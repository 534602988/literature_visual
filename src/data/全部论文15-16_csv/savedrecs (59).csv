There is also growing recognition of the value, with respect to regulatory benefit-risk assessment, of information that could be gathered from patients the direct users of these products. Patients can provide unique insights into practical aspects of living with their disease and its treatments as well as gaps in treatment needs. An enhanced understanding of patients' experiences and perspectives can contribute directly to better-informed decision making about these products by regulators. Health Canada is currently exploring and examining the most effective ways to collect and consider patient input in the evaluation of therapeutic products. As part of this process, Health Canada is assessing the suitability of other existing models through environmental scans, discussions with other health authorities, and pilot projects. Lessons learned from these models can inform best practices and opportunities for patient involvement when designing a model to meet Canada's needs and context. Health Canada launched a Patient Involvement Pilot Project in 2014 to simulate how input from patients, their caregivers, health care professionals, and patient groups could be collected and incorporated in the drug submission review process. This ongoing experience and continuous learning will define better how to incorporate patient input into benefit-risk assessment and regulatory decision making throughout the life cycle of therapeutic products in Canada.","[Klein, Agnes V.; Hardy, Stephanie; Lim, Robyn] Hlth Canada, Hlth Prod & Food Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Cumming Sch Med, OBrien Inst Publ Hlth, Calgary, AB, Canada",Health Canada; University of Calgary,"Marshall, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Cumming Sch Med, Hlth Res Innovat Ctr HRIC 3C56, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",damarsha@ucalgary.ca,"Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008",Canada Research Chair in Health Services and Systems Research,Canada Research Chair in Health Services and Systems Research,No financial support was received for this study.

Objective: Our study aimed to perform a systematic review of health economic evaluation studies from the patient's perspective. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases were searched through May 2014 for cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit studies using the patient's perspective in their analysis. The reporting quality of the studies was evaluated on the basis of Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. Results: We identified 30 health economic evaluations using the patient's perspective, of which 7 were conducted in the United States, 9 in Europe, and 14 in Asian or other countries. Seventeen of 23 health conditions evaluated were chronic in nature. Among 12 studies that justified the use of the patient's perspective, patient's financial burden associated with medical treatment was the most commonly cited rationale. A total of 29, 17, and 15 studies examined direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs, respectively. Seventeen studies also included societal, governmental or payer's, and/or provider's perspective(s) in their analyses. Based on Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, more than 20% of the reporting items in these studies were either partially satisfied or not satisfied. Conclusions: There is a paucity of health economic evaluations conducted from the patient's perspective in the literature. For those studies using the patient's perspective, the true patient costs were not fully explored and study reporting quality was not optimal. With the increasing focus on patient-centered outcomes in health policy research, more frequent use of the patient's perspective in economic studies should be advocated.","[Tai, Bik-Wai Bilvick] Caritas Inst Higher Educ, Sch Hlth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bae, Yuna H.; Le, Quang A.] Western Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice & Adm, 309 E Second St, Pomona, CA 91766 USA",Saint Francis University Hong Kong; Western University of Health Sciences,"Le, QA (通讯作者)，Western Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice & Adm, 309 E Second St, Pomona, CA 91766 USA.",qle@westernu.edu,,"Tai, Bik-Wai Bilvick/0000-0002-4017-334X",,,,,49,36,40,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,903,908,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.010,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712720.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500029,0

Efficiency-enhancing trade can breakdown even when the responder has no private information. Overall, the probability of trade and ex post efficiency are lower in the ESS than in the corresponding perfect Bayesian equilibrium.

This study explores business cycle sensitivity in both public and private parts of the healthcare sector across 32 countries. Responses to the business cycle vary notably, both across spending sources and across countries. Whereas in some countries, consumers and/or governments cut back, in others, private and/or public healthcare buyers tend to spend more. We also assess long-term consequences of business cycle sensitivity and show that public cost cutting during economic downturns deflates the mortality rates, whereas private cut backs increase the long-term growth in total healthcare expenditures. Finally, multiple factors help explain variability in cyclical sensitivity. Private cost cuts during economic downturns are smaller in countries with a predominantly publicly funded healthcare system and more preventive public activities. Public cut backs during contractions are smaller in countries that rely more on tax-based resources rather than social health insurances.

A prior distribution is assumed with a zero mean but an ambiguous covariance matrix. The choice of the prior covariance matrix is facilitated by transformation to standardized variables which makes the prior expected R-2 equal to the sum of the prior variances. Three different ranges of the prior expected R-2 are used to define three different intervals of prior covariance matrices which are used to produce three different sets of s-values.

Methods: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of GC1b versus other chemoimmunotherapy options. The model comprised three mutually exclusive health states: progression-free survival (with/without therapy), progression (refractory/relapsed lines), and death. Each state was assigned a health utility value representing patients' quality of life and a specific cost value. Comparisons between GC1b and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil were performed using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were performed via a network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic literature review. To support the model, a utility elicitation study was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Results: There was good agreement between the model-predicted progression-free and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial. On incorporating data from the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that GC1b was cost-effective with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of 30,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios. Conclusions: GC1b was estimated to increase both quality-adjusted life expectancy and treatment costs compared with several commonly used therapies, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly referenced UK thresholds. This article offers a real example of how to combine direct and indirect evidence in a cost-effectiveness analysis of oncology drugs.","[Becker, Ursula; Moreno, Santiago G.; Ray, Joshua A.] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Ngo, Phuong] Roche Prod Pty Ltd, Dee Why, NSW, Australia; [Samanta, Kunal] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",Roche Holding; University of Glasgow; Roche Holding; Roche Holding; Genentech,"Becker, U (通讯作者)，F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Div Pharmaceut, Global Pricing & Market Access, MORSE Hlth Technol Assessment Grp, Bldg 74,Room 4O-Z03-37, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland.",ursula.becker@roche.com,"Becker, Ulrik/D-2657-2012; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Becker, Ulrik/0000-0002-1678-7771; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Moreno, Santiago G./0000-0002-6341-7546",F.

However, more data on the costs of stroke in patients with AF are needed to assess how this therapy affects societal costs. Objectives: The aim of the study was to estimate the average 3-year societal costs of first-incident ischemic stroke in Danish patients with AF, including costs of health care, social care services, and productivity loss. Methods: The study was designed as an incidence-based cost-of-illness study covering the entire Danish population. All patients with a hospital diagnosis of AF were identified, and propensity score-matched analyses were used to estimate costs attributable to first-incident stroke among patients with AF in the period 2002 to 2012. All data were obtained from nationwide registries. Results: A total of 21,673 patients with AF were identified with a first-incident stroke. The average 3-year costs attributable to stroke were US $30,925 per patient (present value) corresponding to US $19,989 in the incidence year and US $7,683 and US $5,176 1 and 2 years after the stroke, respectively. Health care accounted for 66% of the 3-year costs, with hospitalizations in the incidence year as the main cost driver. After the incidence year, costs of social care services exceeded health care costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost estimates were relatively robust. Conclusions: The societal costs of first-incident stroke in patients with AF are substantial. This new evidence can be valuable as an input for decision making regarding the treatment of AF and prevention of future strokes.","[Jakobsen, Marie; Kolodziejczyk, Christophe; Fredslund, Eskild K.] KORA, Danish Inst Local & Reg Govt Res, Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Poulsen, Peter B.; Dybro, Lars] Pfizer Danmark, Ballerup, Denmark; [Johnsen, Soren P.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Epidemiol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark",Pfizer; Aarhus University,"Jakobsen, M (通讯作者)，KORA, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",maja@koia.dk,,"Fredslund, Eskild Klausen/0000-0003-0340-2489; Jakobsen, Marie/0000-0003-3068-1428; Johnsen, Soren P./0000-0002-2787-0271",Pfizer Denmark Aps; Bristol-Myers Squibb Denmark,Pfizer Denmark Aps; Bristol-Myers Squibb Denmark(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was sponsored by Pfizer Denmark Aps and Bristol-Myers Squibb Denmark.

The GMVAR model belongs to the family of mixture vector autoregressive models and is designed for analyzing time series that exhibit regime-switching behavior. The main difference between the GMVAR model and previous mixture VAR models lies in the definition of the mixing weights that govern the regime probabilities. In the GMVAR model the mixing weights depend on past values of the series in a specific way that has very advantageous properties from both theoretical and practical point of view. A practical advantage is that there is a wide diversity of ways in which a researcher can associate different regimes with specific economically meaningful characteristics of the phenomenon modeled. A theoretical advantage is that stationarity and ergodicity of the underlying stochastic process are straightforward to establish and, contrary to most other nonlinear autoregressive models, explicit expressions of low order stationary marginal distributions are known. These theoretical properties are used to develop an asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation for the GMVAR model whose practical usefulness is illustrated in a bivariate setting by examining the relationship between the EUR-USD exchange rate and a related interest rate data.

The objective of stated-preference studies is to acquire information about trade-off preferences among treatment outcomes, prioritization of clinical decision criteria, likely uptake or adherence to healthcare products and acceptability of healthcare services or policies. A widely accepted approach to eliciting preferences is discrete-choice experiments. Patient, physician, insurant or general-public respondents choose among constructed, experimentally controlled alternatives described by decision-relevant features or attributes. Attributes can represent complete health states, sets of treatment outcomes or characteristics of a healthcare system. The observed pattern of choice reveals how different respondents or groups of respondents implicitly weigh, value and assess different characteristics of treatments, products or services. An important advantage of choice experiments is their foundation in microeconomic utility theory. This conceptual framework provides tests of internal validity, guidance for statistical analysis of latent preference structures, and testable behavioural hypotheses. Choice experiments require expertise in survey-research methods, random-utility theory, experimental design and advanced statistical analysis. This paper should be understood as an introduction to setting up a basic experiment rather than an exhaustive critique of the latest findings and procedures. Where appropriate, we have identified topics of active research where a broad consensus has not yet been established.","[Muehlbacher, Axel] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Johnson, F.

We use a rich administrative dataset that links pharmaceutical consumption and hospital discharge records for the full population aged 58 to 65years in January 2004 covered by the public insurer in a Spanish region, and we follow them until December 2006. We use a difference-in-differences strategy and exploit the eligibility age for Social Security to control for the endogeneity of the retirement decision. Our results show that this uniform exemption increases the consumption of prescription medicines on average by 17.5%, total pharmaceutical expenditure by 25% and the costs borne by the insurer by 60.4%, without evidence of any offset effect in the form of lower short term probability of hospitalization. The impact is concentrated among consumers of medicines for acute and other non-chronic diseases whose previous coinsurance rate was 30% to 40%.

In the latter, 20% of the CGB was withheld each quarter, with the amount returned depending on points deducted for failure to meet performance targets. Outcomes studied included indicators of rational drug prescribing and prescription cost. Impacts were assessed using differences-in-differences, because political interference led to non-random assignment across the two groups. The combination of capitated global budget and pay-for-performance reduced irrational prescribing substantially relative to capitated global budget but only in the county that started above the penalty targets. Endline rates were still appreciable, however, and no effects were found in either county on out-of-pocket spending.

We show that the conventional results in Johansen (1996) for the maximum likelihood estimators and associated likelihood ratio tests derived under homoskedasticity do not in general hold under heteroskedasticity. As a result, standard confidence intervals and hypothesis tests on these coefficients are potentially unreliable. Solutions based on Wald tests (using a sandwich estimator of the variance matrix) and on the use of the wild bootstrap are discussed. These do not require the practitioner to specify a parametric model for volatility. We establish the conditions under which these methods are asymptotically valid. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that significant improvements in finite sample size can be obtained by the bootstrap over the corresponding asymptotic tests in both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic environments. An application to the term structure of interest rates in the US illustrates the difference between standard and bootstrap inferences regarding hypotheses on the co-integrating vectors and adjustment coefficients.

J,"Liao, MH",,,,"Liao, Mouhua",,,A market game with symmetric limit orders,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market game; Limit orders; Nash equilibrium; Walrasian equilibrium,EQUILIBRIA; TRADE; COMPETITION; BERTRAND; PRICES; MONEY; NASH,"We extend the market game with symmetric limit orders studied in Weyers (2003, 2004) to a many good setup. Our limit orders are symmetric in terms of payment and determine a unique consistent price system for every strategy profile. The limit orders studied in the previous literature see Dubey (1982), Simon (1984) and Mertens (2003) share none of these properties. It is shown that three mild market thickness conditions imply that the set of symmetric Nash equilibrium outcomes coincides with the set of price-taking equilibrium outcomes. First, the Dubey and Shubik (1978) refinement is used to eliminate no-trade as an equilibrium. Second, any price-taking equilibrium has trade in each market. Third, there are at least two agents of each type, where a type is determined by preferences and endowments. The last two conditions enable applying the Bertrand argument. This paper thus provides new insights to Bertrand's (1883) classic critique of Cournot and the associated problem of capacity constraints raised by Edgeworth (1897). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have indicated that there may be systematic differences in adolescent and adult values for identical health states. An online survey including a series of best-worst scaling discrete choice experiment questions for health states defined by the CHU9D was administered to two general population samples comprising adults and adolescents, respectively. The results highlight potentially important age-related differences in the values attached to CHU9D dimensions. Adults, in general, placed less weight upon impairments in mental health (worried, sad, annoyed) and more weight upon moderate to severe levels of pain relative to adolescents. The source of values (adults or adolescents) has important implications for economic evaluation and may impact significantly upon healthcare policy.

The model extends a set of nonconvex preferences to its maximal inner convex subset, satisfies stochastic dominance principles, resolves the Allais paradox, predicts CPT fourfold pattern of risk attitudes, and characterizes reference dependent preferences. Unlike extant RDU models that transform probability weighting functions (pwfs), our model transforms ranked choice sets while leaving objective probabilities intact. So pwfs are hidden in our model. CPT's loss aversion index is a special case of the interior solution for the extra parameter for unconstrained utility maximization, and it is driven by tail probabilities in our model. We provide several examples to show how popular formulae for the loss aversion index can be classified into inner and outer measures of loss aversion via an approximate Radon-Nikodym formulation of the model. This resolves sources of disparity in estimating the loss aversion index with experimental data. We show that under extant approaches, the loss aversion index is best estimated by a mixture of inner and outer measures of itself. Furthermore, we identify a CPT paradox: The utility loss aversion index is unmeasurable under CPT nonexpected utility framework for mixed lotteries; but measurable for same under the expected utility paradigm adapted to our model.

Two information criteria that measure the divergence of a diffusion process from the true diffusion are defined. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) converges asymptotically to the limit that minimizes the criteria when sampling interval decreases as sampling span increases. When both drift and diffusion specifications are correct, the criteria become zero and the inverse curvatures of the criteria equal the asymptotic variance of the MLE. For misspecified models, the minimizer of the criteria defines pseudo true parameters. Pseudo-true drift parameters depend on approximate transition densities if used.

Interventions likely affect quality of life (QOL) more broadly than is measurable with commonly used health-related QOL utility scales. In line with the World Health Organization's definition of health, a recent Delphi procedure showed that assessment needs to put more emphasis on mental and social dimensions. Objective: To identify the core dimensions of health-related subjective well-being (HR-SWB) for a new, more comprehensive outcome measure. Methods: We formulated items for each domain of an initial Delphi-based set of 21 domains of HR-SWB. We tested these items in a large sample (N = 1143) and used dimensionality analyses to find a smaller number of latent factors. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a five-factor model, which explained 65% of the total variance. Factors related to physical independence, positive affect, negative affect, autonomy, and personal growth. Correlations between the factors ranged from 0.19 to 0.59. A closer inspection of the factors revealed an overlap between the newly identified core dimensions of HR-SWB and the validation scales, but the dimensions of HR-SWB also seemed to reflect additional aspects. This shows that the dimensions of HR-SWB we identified go beyond the existing health-related QOL instruments. Conclusions: We identified a set of five key dimensions to be included in a new, comprehensive measure of HR-SWB that reliably captures these dimensions and fills in the gaps of the existent measures used in economic evaluations.","[de Vries, Marieke; Plantinga, Arnoud] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Inst Behav Econ Res, Dept Social Psychol, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [de Vries, Marieke] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, iCIS, Data Sci Dept, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Emons, Wilco H.

Outcomes were change in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) score, EQ-5D-based QALYs, cost (price year 2014) to the UK NHS and social services over the 12 months following initial PR, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results At 12 months, incremental cost to the NHS and social services was -204.04 pound (95 % CI -1522 pound to 1114) pound. Incremental CRQ and QALY gains were -0.007 (-0.461 to 0.447) and +0.015 (-0.050 to 0.079), respectively. Based on point estimates, PR maintenance therefore dominates treatment as usual from the perspective of the NHS and social services in terms of cost per QALY gained. Whether it is cost effective in terms of CRQ depends on whether the 204 pound per patient could be reinvested elsewhere to a CRQ gain of greater than 0.007. However, there is much decision uncertainty: 95 % CIs around increments did not exclude zero, and there is a 72.9 % (72.5 %) probability that the ICER is below 20,000 pound (30,000) pound per QALY. Conclusion Future research should explore whether more intensive maintenance regimens offer benefit to patients at reasonable cost.","[Burns, Darren K.; Wilson, Edward C.

Country-level decision makers need to consider whether cost-effectiveness analysis used to inform global guidelines are sufficient for their situation or whether to use models that adjust cost-effectiveness results taking into account setting-specific epidemiological and cost heterogeneity. However, demand and supply constraints will also impact cost-effectiveness by influencing the standard of care and the use and implementation of any new technology. These constraints may also vary substantially by setting. We present two case studies of economic evaluations of the introduction of new diagnostics for malaria and tuberculosis control. These case studies are used to analyse how the scope of economic evaluations of each technology expanded to account for and then address demand and supply constraints over time. We use these case studies to inform a conceptual framework that can be used to explore the characteristics of intervention complexity and the influence of demand and supply constraints. Finally, we describe a number of feasible steps that researchers who wish to apply our framework in cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Vassall, Anna; Mangham-Jefferies, Lindsay; Gomez, Gabriela B.; Pitt, Catherine] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1, England; [Gomez, Gabriela B.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Global Hlth, Meibergdreef 9, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gomez, Gabriela B.] Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Foster, Nicola] Univ Cape Town, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Hlth Econ Unit, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center Amsterdam; University of Cape Town,"Vassall, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Social & Math Epidemiol SAME, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",anna.vassall@lshtm.ac.uk,"Foster, Nicola/AAA-9040-2020; Gomez, Gabriela B/HSB-1504-2023; Pitt, Catherine/K-3001-2012","Foster, Nicola/0000-0003-4630-6243; Gomez, Gabriela B/0000-0002-7409-798X; Pitt, Catherine/0000-0003-4967-8966; Vassall, Anna/0000-0002-2911-1375",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J5000021/1]; AMC ASPASIA - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [015.009.042]; South African Medical Research Council as part of the National Health Scholars Programme - Public Health Enhancement Fund; Economic and Social Research Council [1068145] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); AMC ASPASIA - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); South African Medical Research Council as part of the National Health Scholars Programme - Public Health Enhancement Fund; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The authors thank Yoel Lubell and Lungiswa Nkonki for valuable comments on an early draft of the manuscript.

The first symptoms of esca appeared in 10-12 year-old vines; only in more recent times the disease has appeared invines of 6-8 years. Esca affects more white grape varieties than black varieties. Within each type of grape, it was possible to identify a number of varieties with lower esca incidence than other varieties, which are affected with a very high incidence, in some cases more than 50% of plants eradicated in the oldest vineyards. The genetic component has proved to be crucial for the varietal susceptibility to expression of esca symptoms; this aspect should be taken into account in the prevention and prophylaxis actions aimed to the limitation of the risks associated with vine trunk decay.","[Borgo, Michele] Vivai Cooperat Rauscedo, Via Croce 59, I-30150 Treviso, Italy; [Pegoraro, Gianluca; Sartori, Eugenio] Vivai Cooperat Rauscedo, Via Udine 39, I-33090 Rauscedo, Pordenone, Italy",,"Borgo, M (通讯作者)，Vivai Cooperat Rauscedo, Via Croce 59, I-30150 Treviso, Italy.",,,,,,,,4,12,13,0,3,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1041.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701041,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700041,0

The landscape scenery stimulates the visitor to sense an ancient feeling underlined by producers wisdom with the winemaking art documented for centuries. Genetic and historical-archaeological research confirm it by carving a real substratum of autochthonous varieties in a context, the Enotria, which is now better understood also in the material culture. When talking about Enotria and conventionally we think an indefinite wine land, which later became Italia, it is easy to slip into the rhetoric. The situation has changed. The Enotria, land recognizable to the Greeks through the vineyards planted with the support of poles (oinotra), is becoming a reality perceptible and tangible thanks to a research done not only in the laboratory but also in the historical archives and especially in field. The grapevine germplasm research in Basilicata, financed by Region and local authorities, developed by CREA-UTV and CNR-IBAM, exploring the areas of Val d'Agri, Pollino, Matera, Vulture and High Basento and enhanced by an anthropological study, is bringing to public attention varieties so far only imagined in the abundance of grape names which tradition has bequeathed. About the 154 varieties spread in the Lucan towns surveyed in Statistics of the Naples Kingdom disposed by G. Murat in 1811, about the 63 wine varieties and 29 to dual purpose (wine and table), cataloged in Ampelographic Bulletins of the Ministry of Agriculture of 1881, or about the 30 vines from which it has been produced wines presented at the first wine exhibition of 1887 which was held in Potenza, mostly have unfortunately gone missing along with the memory of those who died or emigrated elsewhere abandoning the vines. In archives, remain some ephemeral relationships of those who, like Frojo and Lacava, were worried about record at least the presence, leaving to posterity further details. From the field, exploring old vines or identifying ancient solitary stocks and making use of the historical memory of winegrowers, authentic custodians of biodiversity and of oral tradition for names and ampelographic characters, we have collected 561 accessions. The DNA study has then unraveled varietal confusion detecting synonymous and homonymies, restoring confidence in the effective recognition of the varieties spread in the region. About the accessions analyzed, 421, corresponding to 68 distinct varieties, are included in the National Register; while 140 (17 of which related to foreign varieties) have vernacular names that, in the failure to meet the registered varieties, represent the precious first signal of great vivacity of these territories, where the evolution in cultivation and selection of best grapes has never stopped, together with a deep understanding of grape physiology. Aglianico bianco, Giosana, Iusana, Santa Sofia, as white grapes, and Aglianico delle fosse, Brindisino, Cassano, Colatamurro, as black grapes, are just some of the new autochthonous varieties we recovered, which - when multiplied and authorized for cultivation - could give more recognizability to the terroir, qualitatively expanding the production base towards typicality and naturalness. The explored territories, entered in a wide geographical and cultural area, are the heart within the Enotria core before, and the historical Lucania then, in the III Domestication Centre (Central and Southern Italy and Sicily), which the vine traversed during the third stage from East (Caucasus) to the West, started from the end of the last Ice Age. The vine and the wine tell the story of a territory, becoming themselves cultural heritage, that is authentic cultural markers.","[Del Lungo, Stefano] CNR IBAM Consiglio Nazl Ric, Ist Beni Archeol & Monumentali, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy; [Caputo, Angelo Raffaele; Gasparro, Marica; Alba, Vittorio; Bergamini, Carlo; Roccotelli, Sabino; Mazzone, Francesco] CREA UTV Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, Unita Ric Uva Tavola & Vitivinicoltura Ambiente M, Via Casamassima 148, I-70010 Turi, BA, Italy; [Pisani, Francesco] Azienda Agr Sperimentale Dimostrat Bosco Galdo, ALSIA Agenzia Lucana Sviluppo & Innovaz Agr Reg B, Via Grumentina 118, I-85050 Villa Dagri, PZ, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per i beni archeologici e monumentali (IBAM-CNR); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Del Lungo, S (通讯作者)，CNR IBAM Consiglio Nazl Ric, Ist Beni Archeol & Monumentali, I-85050 Tito, PZ, Italy.",,"Gasparro, Marica/AAP-9506-2021; Pisani, Francesco/ISR-8949-2023; Del+Lungo, Stefano/AAK-9915-2021; Alba, Vittorio/AAC-5455-2021","Alba, Vittorio/0000-0001-5317-0589",,,,,10,4,4,1,8,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1021.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701021,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700021,0

Untreated congenital syphilis results in neonatal death, stillbirth, preterm birth, or congenital deformities. Many developing countries have recently instituted syphilis prevention programs in antenatal care, but there has not been a systematic study of the effects of such programs. This paper is the first to study antenatal testing laws initiated in the U.S. in 1938-1947 which mandated physicians and other persons permitted by law to attend to a pregnant woman to test her for syphilis. We use the variation in the timing of state antenatal testing laws to estimate the laws' effect on neonatal mortality rates and deaths due to preterm birth. Using 1931-1947 Vital Statistics data, we find that these laws decreased neonatal mortality rates of nonwhites by 3.15 per 1000 live births (a 8.6% reduction) while having no discernible impact on whites. The laws contributed to an 18% narrowing of the white-nonwhite neonatal mortality gap by 1947. Using 1950 U.S. Census data, we find that mandatory antenatal testing led to a 7% increase in the cohort size of nonwhite poor, which is consistent with the neonatal mortality results. We find universal antenatal testing to be very cost-effective, with an estimated $7600 cost (in 2013 dollars) per life-year saved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the 2004, 2006 and 2010-2011 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), our identification strategy exploits variation in European Early Retirement Ages (ERAs) and stepwise increases in ERAs in Austria and Italy between 2004 and 2011 to examine an exogenous shock to retirement behavior. Our results show that retirement induced by discontinuous incentives in early retirement schemes causes a 12-percentage point increase in the probability of being obese among men within a two- to four-year period. We find that the impact of retirement is highly non-linear and mostly affects the right-hand side of the male BMI distribution. Additional results show that this pattern is driven by men retiring from strenuous jobs and by those who were already at risk of obesity. In contrast, no significant results are found among women.

The estimator imbeds tail-trimmed estimating equations allowing for over-identifying conditions, asymptotic normality, efficiency and empirical likelihood based confidence regions for very heavy-tailed random volatility data. We show the implied probabilities from the tail-trimmed Continuously Updated Estimator elevate weight for usable large values, assign large but not maximum weight to extreme observations, and give the lowest weight to non-leverage points. We derive a higher order expansion for GEL with imbedded tail-trimming (GELITT), which reveals higher order bias and efficiency properties, available when the GARCH error has a finite second moment. Higher order asymptotics for GEL without tail-trimming requires the error to have moments of substantially higher order. We use first order asymptotics and higher order bias to justify the choice of the number of trimmed observations in any given sample. We also present robust versions of Generalized Empirical Likelihood Ratio, Wald, and Lagrange Multiplier tests, and an efficient and heavy tail robust moment estimator with an application to expected shortfall estimation. Finally, we present a broad simulation study for GEL and GELITT, and demonstrate profile weighted expected shortfall for the Russian Ruble-US Dollar exchange rate. We show that tail-trimmed CUE-GMM dominates other estimators in terms of bias, mse and approximate normality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that 3-week corticosterone injections caused depression-like behavior in mice, as indicated by the significant decrease in sucrose consumption and increase immobility time in the forced swim test. Red wine phenolic extracts treatment significantly reduced serum corticosterone levels. Moreover, it was found that red wine phenolic extract increased the brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein (BNDF) and Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) phosphorylation and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. However, K252a, an inhibitor of TrkB, completely abolished those antidepressant-like effects. These results suggested that the red wine phenolic extracts produce an antidepressant-like effect in corticosterone-treated mice, at least in part, which is possibly mediated by modulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, BDNF, TrkB and CREB phosphorylation levels in the brain region of mice.","[Jia, Ying] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Funct Food & Wine, Wenhua Rd 103, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Dong, Ziyuan] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Yan, Tingxu; Wu, Bo; Liao, Zhengzheng] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Mat Med, Wenhua Rd 103, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Bi, Kaishun] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Pharm, Engn Lab Natl & Local Union Qual Control Tradit C, Wenhua Rd 103, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Gong, Ping] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Engn, Wenhua Rd 103, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Suna, Baoshan] Inst Natl Invest Agr & Vet, Polo Doi Portos, IP, P-2565191 Dois Portos, Portugal",Shenyang Pharmaceutical University; Seoul National University (SNU); Shenyang Pharmaceutical University; Shenyang Pharmaceutical University; Shenyang Pharmaceutical University,"Suna, B (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Invest Agr & Vet, Polo Doi Portos, IP, P-2565191 Dois Portos, Portugal.",sun.baoshan@iniav.pt,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,5,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,4009.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160704009,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700117,0

In general, wood samples from oak species showed the higher number of phenolic compounds detected, while cherry wood samples showed the lowest levels. In addition, some individual phenolic compounds were detected, specifically in some wood samples, such as robinetin in acacia woods and naringenin in cherry wood. For volatile composition, cherry wood chips samples showed the lowest volatile composition followed by increasing order by acacia, French, Portuguese and American wood chip samples. Oak wood chip samples from American species showed the highest volatile content, as a result of high levels of several specific compounds (furfural, 5-methyfurfural, beta-methyl-gamma-octalactones, guaiacol, vanillin and siringaldehyde).","[Jordao, Antonio M.; Correia, Ana.

Such analysis is typically carried out by causality and/or independence tests which have been well studied when the data is univariate or multivariate. Modern data though is increasingly of a high dimensional or functional nature for which Finite dimensional methods are not suitable. In the present paper we develop methodology to check the assumption that data obtained from two functional time series are independent. Our procedure is based on the norms of empirical cross covariance operators and is asymptotically validated when the underlying populations are assumed to be in a class of weakly dependent random functions which include the functional ARMA, ARCH and GARCH processes.

Previous studies show that Finnish hospitals have significantly higher average productivity than hospitals in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and also a substantial variation within each country. This paper examines whether quality differences can form part of the explanation and attempts to uncover quality-cost trade-offs. Data on costs and discharges in each diagnosis-related group for 160 acute hospitals in 2008-2009 were collected. Patient register-based measures of quality such as readmissions, mortality (in hospital or outside), and patient safety indices were developed and case-mix adjusted. Productivity is estimated using bootstrapped data envelopment analysis. Results indicate that case-mix adjustment is important, and there are significant differences in the case-mix adjusted performance measures as well as in productivity both at the national and hospital levels. For most quality indicators, the performance measures reveal room for improvement. There is a weak but statistical significant trade-off between productivity and inpatient readmissions within 30days but a tendency that hospitals with high 30-day mortality also have higher costs. Hence, no clear cost-quality trade-off pattern was discovered. Patient registers can be used and developed to improve future quality and cost comparisons.

Objectives: Using decision analysis within the context of cervical cancer screening in Norway, we aimed to aid decision makers in identifying a subset of relevant strategies that are simultaneously efficient, feasible, and optimal. Methods: We developed an age stratified probabilistic decision tree model following a cohort of women attending primary screening through one screening round. We enumerated detected precancers (i.e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+)), colposcopies performed, and monetary costs associated with 10 alternative triage algorithms for women with abnormal cytology results. As efficiency metrics, we calculated incremental cost-effectiveness, and harm-benefit, ratios, defined as the additional costs, or the additional number of colposcopies, per additional CIN2+ detected. We estimated capacity requirements and uncertainty surrounding which strategy is optimal according to the decision rule, involving willingness to pay (monetary or resources consumed per added benefit). Results: For ages 25 to 33 years, we eliminated four strategies that did not fall on either efficiency frontier, while one strategy was efficient with respect to both efficiency metrics. Compared with current practice in Norway, two strategies detected more pre-cancers at lower monetary costs, but some required more colposcopies. Similar results were found for women aged 34 to 69 years. Conclusions: Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of cervical cancer screening may necessitate additional resources. Although efficient and feasible, both society and individuals must specify their willingness to accept the additional resources and perceived harms required to increase effectiveness before a strategy can be considered optimal.","[Pedersen, Kine; Burger, Emily Annika; Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo] Univ Oslo, Inst Hlth & Soc, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Sorbye, Sveinung Wergeland] Univ Hosp North Norway, Dept Clin Pathol, Tromso, Norway; [Burger, Emily Annika] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Hlth Deceis Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lonnberg, Stefan] Canc Registry Norway, Norwegian Cervical Canc Screening Program, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University Hospital of North Norway; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

We modify the traditional framework for conducting ENBS and assume that the price of the drug is conditional on the trial outcomes. We use a value-based pricing (VBP) criterion to determine price conditional on trial data using Bayesian updating of cost-effectiveness (CE) model parameters. We assume that there is a threshold price below which the company would not market the new intervention. We present a case study in which a phase III trial sample size and trial duration are varied. For each trial design, we sampled 10000 trial outcomes and estimated VBP using a CE model. The expected commercial net benefit is calculated as the expected profits minus the trial costs. A clinical trial with shorter follow-up, and larger sample size, generated the greatest expected commercial net benefit. Increasing the duration of follow-up had a modest impact on profit forecasts. Expected net benefit of sampling can be adapted to value clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry to optimise the expected commercial net benefit. However, the analyses can be very time consuming for complex CE models. (c) 2014 The Authors.

We discuss the imposition of cross-equation restrictions which are required by economic theory as well as methods for data driven bandwidth selection. A test of correct functional form for the entire system of equations is also constructed. Asymptotic and finite sample results are given. We illustrate our estimator by applying it to a cost system for US commercial banks. Our results show that most of the banks are operating under increasing returns to scale, but that returns to scale decrease with bank size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Rivas, J",,,,"Rivas, Javier",,,Mechanism design and bounded rationality: The case of type misreporting,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPLEMENTATION,"In this paper we study the effects of bounded rationality in mechanism design problems. We model bounded rationality by assuming that in the presence of an incentive compatible mechanism, players behave as if their types were in a delta-neighborhood of their true types. In our results, we explore what are the effects of such bounded rationality in the outcomes of the mechanism design problem. To such end, we characterize the social choice functions that are robust to the 3-perturbations in the sense that the designers' loss is at most of order delta(k) for a certain k. A notable finding is that in quasi-linear utilitarian environments the designer's loss is of order of delta(2). We illustrate the applicability of our results by means of examples.

This theorem is of the fundamental value for theory of information and knowledge and it has numerous applications in economics and social science. Recently a quantum-like version of such theory was presented in Khrennikov and Basieva (2014b), where it was shown that, for agents with quantum information processing (and, in particular, the quantum update of probabilities), in general Aumann's theorem is not valid. In this paper we present conditions on the inter-relations of the information representations of agents, their common prior state, and an event which imply validity of Aumann's theorem. Thus we analyze conditions implying the impossibility to agree on disagree even for quantum-like agents. Here we generalize the original Aumann approach to common knowledge to the quantum case (in Khrennikov and Basieva (2014b) we used the iterative operator approach due to Brandenburger and Dekel and Monderer and Samet). Examples of applicability and non-applicability of the derived sufficient conditions for validity of Aumann's theorem for quantum(-like) agents are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It also examines the extent to which obesity imposes negative externalities, and economic interventions that could potentially internalize such externalities, such as food taxes, subsidies for school-based physical activity programs, and financial rewards for weight loss. It discusses other economic rationales for government intervention with respect to obesity, such as imperfect information, time inconsistent preferences, and irrational behavior. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for the field. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no single dominant economic cause of obesity; a wide variety of factors may contribute a modest amount to the risk. There is consistent evidence regarding the economic consequences of obesity, which are lower wages and higher medical care costs that impose negative externalities through health insurance. Studies of economic approaches to preventing obesity, such as menu labeling, taxes on energy-dense foods, and financial rewards for weight loss find only modest effects on weight and thus a range of policies may be necessary to have a substantial effect on the prevalence of obesity.

We also assessed the expected benefit of further research to reduce uncertainty regarding which treatment is optimal. Methods: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib, afatinib, and cisplatin-pemetrexed. Model transition and adverse-effect probabilities were from two published phase III trials: EURTAC (Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer) and LUX-Lung (Afatinib versus cisplatin-based chemotherapy for EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma) 3. EURTAC survival estimates were corrected for patients entering the trial with more severe disease, compared with LUX-Lung 3. Health utilities and costs were from national estimates or the published literature. Inputs were modeled as distributions for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and expected value of perfect information (EVRI) analysis to estimate the expected benefit of reducing uncertainty regarding the decision of optimal treatment. Results: In the base case, both tyrosine kinase inhibitors were more cost-effective than cisplatin-pemetrexed. Erlotinib had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $61,809/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with afatinib. The acceptability curve showed that erlotinib was the optimal treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY (10-year population EVPI = $85.9 million). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY to $70,000/QALY (EVPI = $211.5 million-$261.8 million), however, there was considerable uncertainty whether erlotinib or afatinib was the optimal treatment Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that erlotinib is the preferred first-line treatment for advanced epithelial growth factor receptor mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Further research comparing erlotinib and afatinib is potentially justified, although accurate data are needed on the required cost and sample size of the trial.","[Ting, Jie; Ho, Tien; Xiang, Pin; Sugay, Amanda; Abdel-Sattar, Maher; Wilson, Leslie] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wilson, Leslie] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Ting, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, 3333 Calif St,Suite 420, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",tingj@pharmacy.ucsf.edu,,,,,,,41,51,56,1,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,774,782,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.04.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409604.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800006,0

Objective To evaluate the in-hospital costs of ECMO technology in both US and non-US settings for all patient types. Data Sources Systematic review of English-language articles, using the Pub Med, Embase, Web of Science and EconLit databases. Searches consisted of the terms 'ECMO' AND 'health expenditures' or 'resource use' or 'costs' or 'cost analysis' or 'cost(-)effectiveness' or 'cost(-) benefit' or 'cost(-)utility' or 'economic(-)evaluation' or 'economic' or `QALY' or 'cost per quality-adjusted life year'. Study Selection Only full scientific research articles were included. The exclusion criteria included papers that focused on pumpless ECMO, simulation training or decision support systems; papers that did not include human subjects or were not written in English; papers that did not mention ECMO, costs, economics or resource utilization; and papers that included only outside-hospital, infrastructure capital or device capital costs. Data Extraction Data extraction was completed by one author, using predefined criteria. Results From the database searches, 1371 results were returned, 226 records underwent a full review and 18 studies were included in the final review. Three papers studied adult populations, two studied adult and paediatric populations, five studied only paediatric populations, one studied a paediatric and neonatal population, and the remaining seven exclusively examined ECMO in neonatal populations. The sample sizes ranged from 8 to 8753 patients. ECMO for respiratory conditions was the most common diagnosis category, followed by congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and then cardiac conditions. Most papers (n = 14) used retrospective cost collection. Only eight papers stated the perspective of the cost analysis. The results show a large variation in the cost of ECMO over multiple cost categories (e.g. range of total in-hospital costs of treatment: USD 42,554-537,554 [in 2013 values]). In the USA, the reported costs of ECMO were highest for CDH repair, followed by cardiac conditions, and lowest for respiratory conditions. The US charges were highest for cardiac conditions. Outside the USA, the ECMO cost was highest for cardiac conditions, followed by respiratory conditions, and lowest for CDH repair. No non-US studies reported charges. Conclusion The current literature shows that a large variation exists in the in-hospital cost estimates for ECMO. Further research is needed to understand how the diagnosis, setting and other factors relate to this variation in the cost of this technology. Reliable costing methodologies and cost information will be critical to inform policymakers and stakeholders wishing to maximize the value of advanced medical technologies such as ECMO.","[Harvey, Michael J.; Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gaies, Michael G.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Div Pediat Cardiol, CS Mott Childrens Hosp, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Prosser, Lisa A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Child Hlth Evaluat & Res Unit, Div Gen Pediat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Harvey, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",harveymj@umich.edu,,,,,,,46,64,68,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

These studies have only assessed a single aspect of productivity loss, such as temporary absenteeism or premature mortality, and have only used the Human Capital Approach (HCA). The Friction Cost Approach (FCA) is increasingly recommended, although has not previously been used to assess lost production from HNC. The aim of this study was to estimate the lost productivity associated with HNC due to different types of absenteeism and premature mortality, using both the HCA and FCA. Methods Survey data on employment status were collected from 251 HNC survivors in Ireland and combined with population-level survival estimates and national wage data. The cost of temporary and permanent time off work, reduced working hours and premature mortality using both the HCA and FCA were calculated. Results Estimated total productivity losses per employed person of working age were EUR253,800 using HCA and EUR6800 using FCA. The main driver of HCA costs was premature mortality (38 % of total) while for FCA it was temporary time off (73 % of total). Conclusions The productivity losses associated with head and neck cancer are substantial, and return to work assistance could form an important part of rehabilitation. Use of both the HCA and FCA approaches allowed different drivers of productivity losses to be identified, due to the different assumptions of the two methods. For future estimates of productivity losses, the use of both approaches may be pragmatic.","[Pearce, Alison M.; Timmons, Aileen; Walsh, Paul M.; Sharp, Linda] Natl Canc Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland; [Hanly, Paul] Natl Coll Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Neill, Ciaran; Thomas, Audrey Alforque] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland; [O'Sullivan, Eleanor] Cork Univ Dent Sch & Hosp, Cork, Ireland; [Gooberman-Hill, Rachael] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Ireland; [Gallagher, Pamela] Dublin City Univ, Dublin, Ireland",National College of Ireland; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University College Cork; Dublin City University,"Pearce, AM (通讯作者)，Natl Canc Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland.",a.pearce@ncri.ie,"Pearce, Alison/AAC-3702-2019","Pearce, Alison/0000-0002-5690-9542; Hanly, Paul/0000-0002-5348-4825; O'Sullivan, Eleanor/0000-0003-4982-9488",,,,,33,30,31,0,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

VibraTip(TM) provides a vibratory stimulus for the purpose of detecting diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, and is intended to replace the current practice of using the 128 Hz tuning fork or 10 g monofilament (comparators). The sponsor (McCallan Medical) provided clinical and economic submissions which were evaluated by an External Assessment Centre (EAC). Of six diagnostic studies identified, the EAC considered that only one was directly relevant to the assessment. This study indicated VibraTip(TM) had a sensitivity of 0.79 (95 % CI 0.69-0.90) and specificity of 0.82 (95 % CI 0.74-0.90) for DPN using a neurothesiometer at 25 V as a reference standard. This was non-inferior to the comparators, but the sample size (n = 141) was too small to draw unequivocal conclusions and it is unclear how generalisable results were to clinical practice. The sponsor presented a de facto cost-minimisation model that in the base case showed minimal cost savings and, in sensitivity analysis which assumed diagnostic superiority of VibraTip(TM), showed large savings. The EAC appraised this model and concluded it was flawed as it was not evidence based and costs were likely to be unrealistic.

Improved biomass cooking stoves are alleged to counteract these adverse effects. This paper evaluates take-up and impacts of low-cost improved stoves through a randomized controlled trial. The randomized stove is primarily designed to curb firewood consumption, but not smoke emissions. Nonetheless, we find considerable effects not only on firewood consumption, but also on smoke exposure and, consequently, smoke-related disease symptoms. The reduced smoke exposure results from behavioural changes in terms of increased outside cooking and a reduction in cooking time. We conclude that in order to assess the effectiveness of a technology-oriented intervention, it is critical to not only account for the incidence of technology adoption - the extensive margin - but also for the way the new technology is used - the intensive margin.

Methods: A decision-analytic model examining the cost-effectiveness of linezolid versus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia was created. Publicly available cost, efficacy, and utility data populated relevant model variables. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis varied parameters in 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, and univariate sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of model uncertainties and the robustness of our conclusions. Results: Results indicated that the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) increased 6% ($22,594 vs. $23,860) by using linezolid versus vancomycin for nosocomial pneumonia. The incremental cost per QALY gained by using linezolid over vancomycin was $6,089, and the incremental cost per life saved was $68,615 with the use of linezolid. Vancomycin dominated linezolid in the subset of patients with documented MRSA. The incremental cost per QALY gained using linezolid if no mortality benefit exists between agents or a 60 day time horizon was analyzed was $19,608,688 and $443,662, respectively. Conclusions: Linezolid may be a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin in the empiric treatment of patients with suspected MRSA nosocomial pneumonia; however, results of our model were highly variable on a number of important variables and assumptions including mortality differences and time frame analyzed.

An In-Depth Comparison of Pazopanib Assessments,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,comparative effectiveness; health technology assessment; pharmaceuticals; reimbursement,HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENTS; REIMBURSEMENT; DECISIONS,"Background: In many European jurisdictions, relative effectiveness assessments (REAs) of pharmaceuticals are performed during the reimbursement decision-making process. international collaboration in the production of these assessments may prevent the duplication of information in various jurisdictions. A first pilot of a joint REA (pazopanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma) was published in 2011. Objective: The objective was to investigate how well the methods used in the joint REA match the methods used in the national/local assessments on the same topic. Methods: National/local assessments from European jurisdictions, available in English language, were identified through a literature search and an e-mail request to health technology assessment organizations. Data were abstracted from joint and national/local assessments using a structured data abstraction form. Results were compared for differences and similarities. Results: In total, five national/local reports were included (Belgium, England/Wales, France, The Netherlands, and Scotland). The general methods (indication, main comparator, main end points, main trial) were similar. The details of the assessment (e.g., exact wording of indication, additional comparators, additional trials included, and method of indirect comparison), however, varied. Despite these differences, the joint REA included nearly all comparators, end points, trials, and methods of analysis that were used in national/local REA reports. Conclusions: This study has shown overlap in the methods national/local REA bodies in Europe have chosen for a pazopanib REA for renal cell carcinoma, except for the use and methods of indirect comparisons. Although some additional comparators and outcomes differed between national/local REAs, they can be captured in a comprehensive joint REA.

It is shown that under suitable sparsity conditions, the residual empirical process based on the ALASSO provides valid inference methodology in very high dimensional regression problems where conventional methods fail. It is also shown that the ALASSO based residual empirical process satisfies a functional oracle property, i.e., in addition to selecting the set of relevant variables with probability tending to one, the ALASSO based residual empirical process converges to the same limiting Gaussian process as the OLS based residual empirical process under the oracle. The functional oracle property is critically exploited to construct asymptotically valid confidence bands for the error distribution function and prediction intervals for unobserved values of the response variable in the high dimensional set up, where traditional non-penalized methods are known to fail. Simulation results are presented illustrating finite sample performance of the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As healthier mothers are more likely to work and health shocks to mothers may impact employment and birth outcomes, I combine two strategies: First, I control extensively for time-varying factors that may correlate with employment and birth outcomes, such as pre-pregnancy family income and maternal occupation, pregnancy-related health shocks, maternal sick listing, and health behaviors (smoking and alcohol consumption). Second, to account for remaining time-invariant heterogeneity between mothers, I compare outcomes of mothers' consecutive children. Mothers who work during the first pregnancy trimester have a lower risk of preterm birth. I find no effect on the probability of having a baby of small size for gestational age. To rule out that health selection of mothers between pregnancies drives the results, I focus on mothers whose change in employment status is likely not to be driven by underlying health (mothers who are students in one of their pregnancies and mothers with closely spaced births). Given generous welfare benefits and strict workplace regulations in Denmark, my findings support a residual explanation, namely, that exclusion from employment may stress mothers in countries with high-female employment rates.

When we apply our methods to the dividend-price ratio, we find that even investors who are quite skeptical about the existence of predictability sharply modify their views in favor of predictability when confronted by the historical time series of returns and predictor variables. Correctly taking into account the stochastic properties of the regressor has a dramatic impact on inference, particularly over the 2000-2005 period.

Researchers must select a target minimal clinically important difference (MOD) in HRQOL for the trial, estimate the effect size of the intervention, and then consider the responsiveness of different HRQOL measures for detecting improvements. Generic preference based HRQOL measures are usually less sensitive to gains in HRQOL than are disease-specific measures, but are nonetheless recommended to quantify an impact on HRQOL that can be translated into quality-adjusted life-years during cost-effectiveness analyses. Mapping disease-specific measures onto generic measures is a proposed method for yielding more efficient sample size requirements while retaining the ability to generate utility weights for cost-effectiveness analyses. Objectives: This study sought to test this mapping strategy to calculate and compare the effect on sample size of three different methods. Methods: Three different methods were used for determining an MCID in HRQOL in patients with incontinence: 1) a global rating of improvement, 2) an incontinence-specific HRQOL instrument, and 3) a generic preference-based HRQOL instrument using mapping coefficients. Results: The sample size required to detect a 20% difference in the MCID for the global rating of improvement was 52 per trial arm, 172 per arm for the incontinence-specific HRQOL outcome, and 500 per arm for the generic preference-based HRQOL outcome. Conclusions: We caution that treatment trials of conditions for which improvements are not easy to measure on generic HRQOL instruments will still require significantly greater sample size even when mapping functions are used to try to gain efficiency.","[Halme, Alex S.] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Fritel, Xavier] Univ Poitiers, Fac Med & Pharm, Poitiers, France; [Benedetti, Andrea] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benedetti, Andrea] McGill Univ, Dept Biostat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benedetti, Andrea] McGill Univ, Dept Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benedetti, Andrea] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benedetti, Andrea] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Resp Epidemiol & Clin Res Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Tannenbaum, Cara] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Tannenbaum, Cara] Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Poitiers; McGill University; McGill University; McGill University; McGill University; McGill University; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Tannenbaum, C (通讯作者)，Montreal Res Ctr, Geriatr Inst, 4545 Queen Mary Rd, Montreal, PQ H3W 1W5, Canada.",cara.tannenbaum@umontreal.ca,"FRITEL, Xavier/K-8566-2012","FRITEL, Xavier/0000-0002-4987-8127; Halme, Alex S./0000-0003-3577-8181",European Research Area on Aging (ERA-AGE2); Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante; Economic and Social Research Council United Kingdom; Institut National de Prevention et d'Education pour la Sante (France),European Research Area on Aging (ERA-AGE2); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)); Economic and Social Research Council United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Institut National de Prevention et d'Education pour la Sante (France),"The European Research Area on Aging (ERA-AGE2) funded this study, in collaboration with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante, the Economic and Social Research Council United Kingdom, and the Institut National de Prevention et d'Education pour la Sante (France).",,33,17,19,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,292,298,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.11.004,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773565.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300020,0

Evidence of the values placed on different types of health gain by the general public is limited. MethodsAcross nine European countries, 17657 people were presented with different hypothetical health scenarios each involving a gain of one quality adjusted life year (QALY) and asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for that gain. The questions included quality of life (QoL) enhancing and life extending health gains, and a scenario where respondents faced imminent, premature death. ResultsThe mean WTP values for a one-QALY gain composed of QoL improvements were modest (PPP$11000). When comparing QALY gains obtained in the near future, the valuation of life extension exceeded the valuation of QoL enhancing gains (mean WTP PPP$19000 for a scenario in which a coma is avoided). The mean WTP values were higher still when respondents faced imminent, premature death (PPP$29000). ConclusionsEvidence from the largest survey on the value of health gains by the general public indicated a higher value for life extending gains compared with QoL enhancing gains. A further modest premium may be indicated for life extension when facing imminent, premature death.

Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of cervical cancer primary screening with a HPV-16/18 genotyping test which simultaneously detects 12 other high-risk HPV types. Methods A Markov cohort model compared four strategies: (1) cytology with reflex HPV testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); (2) co-testing with cytology and HPV testing; (3) HPV with reflex to cytology; and (4) HPV with 16/18 genotyping and reflex cytology (ASC-US threshold). Screening began at age 30 and was performed triennially over 40 years. Screening sensitivity and specificity values for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 were obtained from the Addressing THE Need for Advanced HPV Diagnostics (ATHENA) trial. Outcomes for a 1-year follow-up scenario wherein persistent disease was detected were estimated. Screening and cancer treatment costs were calculated from a US payer's perspective in 2013. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at 3 % annually. Results Applying a US$50,000/QALY threshold, strategy (4) dominated strategies (2) and (3) by reducing costs and cancer incidence and improving QALYs, and was cost effective versus strategy (1). Accounting for persistent >= CIN 3 at 1 year, strategy (4) was cost effective versus all other strategies. Detecting HPV-16/18 resulted in earlier diagnosis of clinically relevant >= CIN 3 at initial screening and efficient use of follow-up resources. Outcomes were most influenced by strategy performance. Conclusions Incorporating HPV-16/18 genotyping is cost effective and may improve detection of CIN, thereby preventing cervical cancer.","[Huh, Warner K.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, 1700 6th Ave South,WIC Room 10250, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Williams, Erin; Bramley, Tommy] Xcenda, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Huang, Joice; Poulios, Nick] Roche Mol Diagnost, Pleasanton, CA USA","University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Roche Holding","Huh, WK (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama Birmingham, 1700 6th Ave South,WIC Room 10250, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.",whuh@uabmc.edu,,,,,,,43,30,32,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

After applying panel data technique Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) we have found that in normal days (days other than financial crisis) non-financial firms in Pakistan do not match their volume of trade credit but try to match trade credit in maturity.

On the basis of previous studies, this paper uses a two-staged econometric method to examine the relationship between the foreign direct investment and firm R&D efficiency by the way of financing constraints. Collecting the data from 2009 similar to 2012 of industrial listed companies in China, we find that foreign direct investment can significantly ease the financing constraints. As a result, the firm R&D scale efficiency is improved significantly. But the firm R&D technology efficiency is decreased at the same time.

Six Ly49 genes constitute a gene family located on the horse chromosome 6, between 38 200 Kbp-38 520 Kbp. Immune-response genes represent a functionally important region of the vertebrate genome subject to selection pressure. NK cells are involved in the antigen recognition process through their highly variable receptors. Our work may contribute to better estimating the genetic diversity of this functionally important region.

Such taxes have been criticised on the basis of their regressivity and potentially adverse impact upon poverty. This paper analyses the effect of such taxes on a range of poverty measures and also examines the effect of a revenue-neutral tax subsidy mixed with a tax on unhealthy food combined with a subsidy on more healthy food. Using Irish expenditure data, the results indicate that taxes on high fat/sugar goods on their own will be regressive but that a tax-subsidy combination can be broadly neutral with respect to poverty.

Here, we demonstrate the potential of a Nicotiana benthamiana TGS 16C reporter line in the signalization of demethylating events caused by the activity of the so-called demethylating agents. These compounds have the ability to block or to interfere with the activity of methyltransferases, enzymes responsible for maintaining methylation marks on the replicating sequences. This N. benthamiana line carries a green fluorescent protein gene (GFP), whose promoter had been methylated and is thus inactive. By treating such plants with compounds with demethylating properties, their demethylating potential can be estimated by the effect on the re-established GFP expression in plant tissues.","[Mynarzova, Zuzana; Baranek, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Hort, Mendeleum Inst Genet, Lednice 69144, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Mynarzova, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Hort, Mendeleum Inst Genet, Valticka 337, Lednice 69144, Czech Republic.",zuzana.mynarzova@mendelu.cz,"Baránek, Miroslav/E-8371-2016","Baránek, Miroslav/0000-0002-1583-3588",,,,,13,1,1,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,428,433,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100080,0

This model not only considers the desirability of response approaching to target, but also evaluates the reliability of responses within specification limits. Finally, we use the hybrid genetic algorithm to optimize the overall desirability function. Two examples are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Cost-effectiveness analysis presented as cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained has been controversial, raising heated support and opposition. Objectives: To assess the impact of economic evaluation in decisions on what to fund in four European countries and discuss the implications of our findings. Methods: We used a protocol to review the key features of the application of economic evaluation in reimbursement decision making in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, reporting country-specific highlights. Results: Although the institutions and processes vary by country, health economic evaluation has had limited impact on restricting access of controversial high-cost drugs. Even in those countries that have gone the furthest, ways have been found to avoid refusing to fund high-cost drugs for particular diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and orphan diseases. Economic evaluation may, however, have helped some countries to negotiate price reductions for some drugs. It has also extended to the discussion of clinical effectiveness to include cost. Conclusions: The differences in approaches but similarities in outcomes suggest that health economic evaluation be viewed largely as rhetoric (in D.N. McCloskey's terms in The Rhetoric of Economics, 1985). This is not to imply that economics had no impact: rather that it usually contributed to the discourse in ways that differed by country. The reasons for this no doubt vary by perspective, from political science to ethics. Economic evaluation may have less to do with rationing or denial of medical treatments than to do with expanding the discourse used to discuss such issues.","[Franken, Margreet] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Franken, Margreet] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Heintz, Emelie] Karolinska Inst, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth, Med Management Ctr, Hlth Outcomes & Econ Evaluat Res Grp, Stockholm, Sweden; [Gerber-Grote, Andreas] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Sch Hlth Profess, Winterthur, Switzerland; [Raftery, James] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Karolinska Institutet; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; University of Southampton,"Franken, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",franken@imta.eur.nl,"Heintz, Emelie/GYD-4031-2022; Franken, Margreet MG/H-3200-2013","Heintz, Emelie/0000-0002-0715-7591; Franken, Margreet/0000-0003-4207-510X",,,,,41,11,11,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,951,956,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.08.001,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987645.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300007,0

It assesses whether the health gains offered by an intervention are large enough relative to any additional costs to warrant adoption. When there are constraints on the health care system's budget or ability to increase expenditures, additional costs imposed by interventions have an opportunity cost in terms of the health foregone because other interventions cannot be provided. Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) are typically used to assess whether an intervention is worthwhile and should reflect health opportunity cost. Nevertheless, CETs used by some decision makers such as the World Health Organization that suggested CETs of 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita do not. Objectives: To estimate CETs based on opportunity cost for a wide range of countries. Methods: We estimated CETs based on recent empirical estimates of opportunity cost (from the English National Health Service), estimates of the relationship between country GDP per capita and the value of a statistical life, and a series of explicit assumptions. Results: CETs for Malawi (the country with the lowest income in the world), Cambodia (with borderline low/low-middle income), El Salvador (with borderline low-middle/upper-middle income), and Kazakhstan (with borderline high-middle/high income) were estimated to be $3 to $116 (1%-51% GDP per capita), $44 to $518 (4%51%), $422 to $1967 (11%-51%), and $4485 to $8018 (32%-59%), respectively. Conclusions: To date, opportunity-cost-based CETs for low-/middle-income countries have not been available. Although uncertainty exists in the underlying assumptions, these estimates can provide a useful input to inform resource allocation decisions and suggest that routinely used CETs have been too high.","[Woods, Beth; Revill, Paul; Sculpher, Mark; Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Woods, B (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",beth.woods@york.ac.uk,,"Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Revill, Paul/0000-0001-8632-0600; Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Department for International Development (UK); Rockefeller Foundation; UK National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0513-10060],Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); Department for International Development (UK); Rockefeller Foundation; UK National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This research report was produced as part of the Lablite project (http://www.lablite.org/) as well as the International Decision Support Initiative (www.idsi.health.org, a global initiative to support decision makers in priority setting for universal health coverage.

J,"Belau, J",,,,"Belau, Julia",,,Outside option values for network games,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POSITION VALUE; ALLOCATION,"Various political, economic and social situations of cooperation and bargaining can be modeled by cooperative games. Cooperation potential and the outcome of cooperation are often influenced by the structure of how agents are related to each other, that is, by a network structure. Extending Myers on (1977)'s model of restricted communication, Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) introduced the setting of network games which is more flexible, for example in the distinction between the outcome of communication paths. The contribution of this paper is the analysis of outside-option-sensitive allocation rules in the network game setting. More precisely, we provide definitions and axiomatizations of outside-option-sensitive extensions of the Myerson value and the Position value for network games, the graph-x-value and the kappa value for network games, respectively. These values have not been analyzed in the network game framework so far and, in contrast to their counterparts by means of restricted communication, we justify the values following the simple aspects used in the original axiomatization of the Shapley value. In addition, we also find such a justification of the Myerson value for network games. In all axiomatizations, we do not require any conditions on the network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In phase III trials, it has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy and safety in comparison with the old standard of care. In addition, it provides the first interferon-free regimen allowing treatment of patients without previous therapeutic options. A current debate regarding pricing and affordability can be attributed to high treatment costs. The objective of this review was to compare health economic evaluations of sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in terms of models, patient populations, interventions and results. Methods A systematic review was conducted using the data sources Medline (1946-09/2015), Embase (1974-09/2015), the Health Technology Assessment Database (September 2015) and the UK National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (September 2015). We included health economic evaluations that measured the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based regimens compared with regimens without sofosbuvir for the treatment of adult patients infected with chronic hepatitis C. The articles were then critically appraised regarding the effectiveness data, cost data and models utilised. Results Fourteen studies were included, which analysed the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir in seven different countries. Differences in study characteristics were found regarding study populations, modelling and willingness-to-pay thresholds. The study results demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of the treatment combination of sofosbuvir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in comparison with the old standard of care. Dual therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin was considered cost effective only in comparison with no therapy. Conclusion Despite high costs, the included studies indicate that sofosbuvir-based regimens are cost effective in most patients. While the results are unequivocal with regard to sofosbuvir-based triple therapy, the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based dual therapy heavily depends on country-specific willingness to pay. Although interferon-containing triple therapy has now been replaced by newly approved direct-acting antivirals in most middle-and high-income countries, the availability of these oral treatment combinations is poor in low-income countries. Therefore, the findings of our review are still of relevance.","[Luhnen, Miriam; Waffenschmidt, Siw; Gerber-Grote, Andreas; Hanke, Gloria] Inst Qual & Efficiency Hlth Care IQWiG, Mediapk 8, D-50670 Cologne, Germany",,"Luhnen, M (通讯作者)，Inst Qual & Efficiency Hlth Care IQWiG, Mediapk 8, D-50670 Cologne, Germany.",miriam.luhnen@iqwig.de,,"Waffenschmidt, Siw/0000-0001-6860-6699",,,,,45,10,12,0,10,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

In a class of games called strongly symmetric tail function games, the following holds: existence of perfect epsilon-equilibrium (Solan and Vielle, 2001) for all epsilon > 0 is equivalent to the existence of Nash equilibrium. In the larger class of strongly symmetric (not necessarily tail function) games, this equivalence no longer holds. The main result is that every strongly symmetric game has a symmetric epsilon proper equilibrium (Myerson, 1978) which is an epsilon-equilibrium (Radner, 1980).This existence result fails to hold in the larger class of weakly symmetric games.

We hypothesize that test features (risk of developing the adverse reaction with and without testing, test cost, and treatment cost) and the choice context (physician recommendation and the most common choice made by peer patients) will influence choices. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was conducted in which 189 patients at high risk for gout were asked to choose between treatment options that varied along key attributes. A latent class logit model was used to analyze the choice data and test the hypotheses. Results: We identified two classes of patients: the risk-averse class and the cost-conscious class. The WTP to reduce the risk of life-threatening ADRs from 1 out of 600 to 1 out of 1 million was SGD1215 in the risk-averse class. In contrast, in the cost-conscious class, the WTP was insensitive to the extent of risk reduction. Overall, the predicted take-up rate for the test is 65% at a price of SGD400. If the test was recommended by a physician or was chosen by most of the patients, the take-up rate for the test would increase by 8.5 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively. Conclusions: There is a potentially large demand for genetic tests that could reduce the risk of life threatening ADRs. Physician recommendations and providing information on the choices of others are powerful influences on demand, even more so than moderate price reductions.","[Dong, Di; Ozdemir, Semra; Bilger, Marcel; Finkelstein, Eric] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Hlth Serv & Syst Res Program, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore; [Dong, Di] Duke Kunshan Univ, Global Hlth Res Ctr, Kunshan, Peoples R China; [Bee, Yong Mong] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Singapore, Singapore; [Toh, Sue-Anne] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, Singapore, Singapore; [Toh, Sue-Anne] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Singapore, Singapore; [Finkelstein, Eric] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA",National University of Singapore; Duke Kunshan University; Singapore General Hospital; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Duke University,"Dong, D (通讯作者)，Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Hlth Serv & Syst Res Program, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore.",dong_di87@u.duke.nus.edu,"Ozdemir, Semra/GXW-0913-2022; dong, Dong/JFJ-3808-2023; dong, dong/JQV-8909-2023","Ozdemir, Semra/0000-0001-7556-1601; Bilger, Marcel/0000-0002-2872-6597; Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686",Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School,Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School,This study was supported by Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School.,,53,22,24,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,767,775,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1837,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712704.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500013,0

We examine consumer learning in influenza vaccine demand within a reduced form instrumental variable framework that exploits differences in risk characteristics of different influenza viruses as a natural experiment to distinguish the effects of learning based on previous influenza vaccination experiences from unobserved heterogeneity. The emergence of a new virus strain (influenza A H1N1/09) during the 2009 Swine flu' pandemic resulted in two different vaccines being recommended for distinct population subgroups with some people, who were not usually targeted by seasonal vaccination programs, being specifically recommended for the new Swine flu vaccine. We use these differences in vaccination targeting to construct instrumental variables for estimating the effect of past influenza vaccination experiences on the demand for pandemic vaccine. We find large causal effects of previous seasonal vaccination on pandemic vaccination. Causal effects of past influenza vaccination experiences on perceived vaccination safety are likely to be an important pathway linking past vaccination experiences with future vaccine uptake. Our results suggest a significant role of learning in vaccination decisions. Current efforts to expand seasonal vaccination may thus have potentially important long-term effects on future influenza vaccination levels and pandemic preparedness.

We show that GPs in all countries respond to information about societal costs, benefits and effectiveness, and that they make tradeoffs between them. The UK GPs have higher willingness to accept costs when they can prescribe medicines that are cheaper or more preferred by the patient, while Norwegian GPs tend to have higher willingness to accept costs for attributes regarding effectiveness or the doctors' experience. In general, there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity also within each country.

It is shown that the presence of strong unobserved common factors can lead to an undetermined GVAR model. To solve this problem, we propose augmenting the GVAR with additional proxy equations for the strong factors and establish conditions under which forecasts from the augmented GVAR model (AugGVAR) uniformly converge in probability (as the panel dimensions N, T-j ->infinity) to the infeasible optimal forecasts obtained from a factor-augmented high-dimensional VAR model. The small sample properties of the proposed solution are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments as well as empirically. In the empirical part, we investigate the value of the information content of Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) for forecasting global (48 countries) output growth, and cothpare forecasts from AugGVAR models with a number of data-rich forecasting methods, including Lasso, Ridge, partial least squares, and factor-based techniques. It is found that (a) regardless of the forecasting methods considered, PMIs are useful for nowcasting, but their value added diminishes quite rapidly with the forecast horizon, and (b) AugGVAR forecasts do as well as other data-rich forecasting techniques for short horizons, and tend to do better for longer forecast horizons.

Utility is a key input of many decision analytic models used for economic evaluations. Objective: To systematically review COPD-related utilities and to compare these with alternative values used in decision models. Methods: The literature review comprised studies that generated utilities for COPD-related stages based on EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire surveys of patients and of decision models of COPD progression that have been used for economic evaluations. The utility values used in modeling studies and those from the meta-analysis of actual patient-level studies were compared and differences quantified. Results: Twenty decision modeling studies that used utility value as an input parameter were found. Within the same span of publication period, 13 studies involving patient-level utility data were identified and included in the meta-analysis. The estimated mean utility values ranged from 0.806 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.747-0.866) for stage I to 0.616 (95% CI 0.556-0.676) for stage IV. The utility scores for comparable stages in modeling studies were different (significant difference 0.045 [95% CI 0.041-0.052] for stage III). Modeling studies consistently used higher utility values than the average reported patient-level data. Conclusions: COPD decision analytic models are based on a limited range of utility values that are systematically different from average values estimated using a meta-analysis. A more systematic approach in the application of utility measures in economic evaluation is required to appropriately reflect current literature.","[Moayeri, Foruhar; Hsueh, Ya-Seng (Arthur); Clarke, Philip; Dunt, David] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Moayeri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Level 4,207 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia.",foruhar.moayrei@gmail.com,"Moayeri, Foruhar/K-1119-2015; Tanne, David/F-2560-2010","Clarke, Philip/0000-0002-7555-5348","University of Melbourne Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences","University of Melbourne Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences(University of Melbourne)","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not for-profit sectors, except PhD scholarship fund from the University of Melbourne Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences.",,64,6,6,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2016,19.0,4.0,,,,,363,373,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.01.012,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DO9GU,27325328.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378094200010,0

This instrument is known as the EQ-5D-5L. To make the EQ-5D-5L suitable for use in economic evaluations, societal values need to be attached to all 3125 health states. Objectives: To derive a Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L. Methods: Health state values were elicited during face-to-face interviews in a general population sample stratified for age, sex, and education, using composite time trade-off (cTTO) and a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Data were modeled using ordinary least squares and tobit regression (for cTTO) and a multinomial conditional logit model (for DCE). Model performance was evaluated on the basis of internal consistency, parsimony, goodness of fit, handling of left-censored values, and theoretical considerations. Results: A representative sample (N = 1003) of the Dutch population participated in the valuation study. Data of 979 and 992 respondents were included in the analysis of the cTTO and the DCE, respectively. The cTTO data were left-censored at -1. The tobit model was considered the preferred model for the tariff on the basis of its handling of the censored nature of the data, which was confirmed through comparison with the DCE data. The predicted values for the EQ-5D-5L ranged from -0.446 to 1. Conclusions: This study established a Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L on the basis of cTTO. The values represent the preferences of the Dutch population. The tariff can be used to estimate the impact of health care interventions on quality of life, for example, in context of economic evaluations.","[Versteegh, Matthijs M.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Karin M.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Evers, Silvia M.

Motivated by Malliavin and Mancino (2002, 2009) we propose a new Fourier domain based estimator of multivariate ex-post volatility, which we call the Fourier Realized Kernel (FRK). An advantage of this approach is that no explicit time alignment is required unlike the time domain based methods widely adopted in the existing literature. We derive the large sample properties and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator under some general conditions that allow for both temporal and cross-sectional correlations in the measurement error process. Our results can be viewed as Frequency domain extension of the asymptotic theories for the multivariate realized kernel estimator of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2011). We show in extensive simulations that our method outperforms the time domain estimators when two assets with different liquidity are traded asynchronously. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As end users, patients are important stakeholders regarding the outcomes of CEAs, yet their knowledge of HE model development and application, or their involvement therein, is absent. This paper considers possible benefits and risks of patient involvement in HE model development and application for modellers and patients. An exploratory review of the literature has been performed on stakeholder-involved modelling in various disciplines. In addition, Dutch patient experts have been interviewed about their experience in, and opinion about, the application of HE models.

We give two definitions that are representative of this kind of attitude and investigate their implications in (an intertemporal version of) three popular models used in decision theory: the Expected Utility, the Choquet Expected Utility and the MaxMin Expected Utility models. The first definition reveals interesting links with the theory studying the impossibility of aggregating infinite streams of income, while keeping both strong monotonicity and equality among all generations. Our second definition turns out to be a behavioural characterization of what Irving Fisher called impatience.

Balanced contributions (Myerson, 1980) and balanced cycle contributions (Kamijo and Kongo, 2010) are two well-known examples of such axioms. We revisit these characterizations by nullifying a player instead of deleting her/him from a game. The nullification (Beal et al., 2014a) of a player is obtained by transforming a game into a new one in which this player is a null player, i.e. the worth of the coalitions containing this player is now identical to that of the same coalition without this player. The degree with which our results are close to the original results in the literature is connected to the fact that the targeted value satisfies the null player out axiom (Derks and Haller, 1999).

Methods: Two hundred and twenty-nine child-parent dyads from public insurance programs were enrolled. PROMIS (R) pediatric short forms (SFs) and the PAQLQ were used to measure health-related quality of life across four time points (T1-T4) over 2 years. The Asthma Control and Communication Instrument was used to measure the change in asthma control, and the Global Rating of Change (GRC) Index for breathing problems and overall health was used to measure the change in health status. Responsiveness was tested by comparing the changes in health-related quality of life with the changes in asthma control and health status over time using t tests, generalized estimating equations, and relative validity approaches. Magnitudes of the responsiveness between the Pediatric PROMIS and PAQLQ were assessed through statistical significance, Cohen's d effect size (ES), and standardized response mean (SRM). Results: The PROMIS asthma impact scale and all PAQLQ scales exhibited significant responsiveness (p's < 0.05) and small to medium ES/SRM when anchored to asthma control, GRC breathing problems, and overall health. Relative validity, especially related to change in asthma control status and GRC breathing problems, was equivalent. PROMIS pain interference, fatigue, and mobility SFs also indicated adequate responsiveness. Conclusions: The PROMIS asthma impact SF indicated similar responsiveness to the PAQLQ scales. Due to its brevity and responsiveness, the PROMIS asthma impact SF is useful for clinical practice or research.","[Howell, Carrie R.; Huang, I-Chan] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dep Epidemiol & Canc Control, MS 735,262 Danny Thomas Pl, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Thompson, Lindsay A.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Gross, Heather E.; Reeve, Bryce B.; DeWalt, Darren A.] Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Reeve, Bryce B.] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Health, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [DeWalt, Darren A.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA",St Jude Children's Research Hospital; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Huang, IC (通讯作者)，St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dep Epidemiol & Canc Control, MS 735,262 Danny Thomas Pl, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",i-chan.huang@stjude.org,"Howell, Carrie/G-8787-2018; Reeve, Bryce/AAE-7657-2019; DeWalt, Darren/HJY-2604-2023","Howell, Carrie/0000-0002-6554-6237;",National Institutes of Health [U01 AR052181]; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities(American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC)),"This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grant no.

J,"Oelbermann, KF",,,,"Oelbermann, Kai-Friederike",,,Alternate Scaling algorithm for biproportional divisor methods,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,APPORTIONMENT; SYSTEMS; VECTOR,"In parliamentary elections biproportional divisor methods translate votes into seats so that for each district fixed seat contingents are met and that every party receives as many seats as the overall vote counts reflect. A set of district-divisors and party-divisors ensures that proportionality is respected both within the districts and within the parties. The divisors can be calculated by means of the Alternate Scaling algorithm (AS-algorithm). It is the discrete variant of the iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPF-procedure). The AS-algorithm iteratively generates scaled vote matrices that after rounding alternately fulfill the district-contingents and the party-seats. Thus it defines two sequences: the AS-scaling sequence and the AS-seat-sequence. The central question in this paper is: under which conditions does the AS-algorithm generate a biproportional apportionment? The conjecture of Balinski and Pukelsheim (2006) is partially proven. We show that if the set of biproportional apportionments does not contain more than three elements then the AS-algorithm is able to determine it. In the rare event that the set of biproportional apportionments cannot be determined by the AS-algorithm, the complementary AS-Tie&Transfer-combination puts things right. Its analysis leads to a constructive proof of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of biproportional apportionments. If these conditions are violated the sequences generated by the AS-algorithms may have more than two accumulation points. On the contrary, the IPF-procedure has at most two accumulation points.

We outline the most apparent dissimilarities and reflect on their underlying reasons. We randomly sampled 50 studies from each of three country income groups from a comprehensive database of 2844 economic evaluations published between January 2012 and May 2014. Data were extracted on ten methodological areas: (i) availability of guidelines; (ii) research questions; (iii) perspective; (iv) cost data collection methods; (v) cost data analysis; (vi) outcome measures; (vii) modelling techniques; (viii) cost-effectiveness thresholds; (ix) uncertainty analysis; and (x) applicability. Comparisons were made across income groups and odds ratios calculated. Contextual heterogeneity rightly drives some of the differences identified. Other differences appear less warranted and may be attributed to variation in government health sector capacity, in health economics research capacity and in expectations of funders, journals and peer reviewers. By highlighting these differences, we seek to start a debate about the underlying reasons why they have occurred and to what extent the differences are conducive for methodological advancements. We suggest a number of specific areas in which researchers working in countries of differing environments could learn from one another. (c) 2016 The Authors.

They use control functions to address the simultaneous determination of inputs and productivity. Both assume that input demand is a monotonic function of productivity holding capital constant and then invert this function to condition on productivity during estimation. If the observed capital variable is measured with error, input demand will not generally be monotonic in the productivity shock holding observed capital constant. We develop consistent estimators of production function parameters in the face of this measurement error. Our identification and estimation results combine the nonlinear measurement error literature with Wooldridge's (2009) joint estimation method to construct a proxy for productivity that addresses simultaneity.

The obtained data of the boron total content in the studied sandy soil showed that in 0-60 cm layer of the soil the boron total content ranges from 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg, in 60-150 cm soil layer - from 0.75 to 0.78 mg/kg. The boron content in the sandy soils of studied area varies within wide limits and characterizes as insufficient. Fertilizing with boron is an effective agricultural technique for up-frost plants and productivity of grapes. This technique allows to increase the sugar content of the berries up to 0.81.4 g/cm(3), while substantially reducing the acidity of the juice. The yield of grape crystal grade in the variant with background + N90 P90 K90 + 2 kg of active boron addition was 76.8 t/ha, which is higher than in the control at 34.2 t/ha. The increasing of sugar berries in this variant was from 0.8 up to 1.4 g/cm(3).

We provide recommendations on handling nonadherence in economic evaluations. Methods: The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database was searched for recently published trials. We extracted information on the methods used to assign shared costs in the presence of nonadherence and methods to account for nonadherence in the economic analysis. Results: Ninety-six eligible trials were identified. For one-off interventions, 86% reported the number of participants initiating treatment. For recurring interventions, 56% and 73%, respectively, reported the number initiating and completing treatment, whereas 66% reported treatment intensity. Most studies (23 of 31 [74%] trials and 42 of 53 [79%] trials of one-off and recurring interventions, respectively) reported strict intention-to-treat or complete case analyses. A minority (3 of 31 [10%] and 7 of 53 [13%], respectively), however, performed a per -protocol analysis. No studies used statistical methods to adjust for nonadherence directly in the economic evaluation. Only 13 studies described patient-level allocation of intervention costs; there was variation in how fixed costs were assigned according to adherence. Conclusions: Most of the trials reported a measure of adherence, but reporting was not comprehensive. A nontrivial proportion of studies report a primary per -protocol analysis that potentially produces biased results. Alongside primary intention-to-treat analysis, statistical methods for obtaining an unbiased estimate of cost-effectiveness in adherers should be considered.

This large spatial coverage suggests a strong flexibility of this wine grape variety to its environment, particularly when it comes to climate. To investigate the plasticity of Chardonnay for producing wine, we have built a geodatabase localizing the production areas (wine region, vineyard or plot, when possible) of 2029 wines awarded with either gold or bronze medals at the international wine competition Chardonnay du Monde, from 2000 to 2015. Wines were produced by 982 different wineries, covering 231) world wine regions within 41 countries. The climate of each production region was depicted with the WorldClim. database. It consists of a set of high spatial resolution gridded (approximately 1 km) monthly rainfall accumulations and air temperature averaged on the 1950-2000 period. This data was updated to the 2000-2015 period by means of the delta method applied to the CRU TS 3.2 climate database at a lower resolution (0.5 degrees). Ten agroclimatic indices were calculated and analyzed. Grape growing climate of Chardonnay wine regions are extremely diverse. Their average growing season temperature (April to October for the northern hemisphere and October to April for the southern hemisphere) ranges from 15.2 to 21.7 degrees C (5% and 95% percentiles) for still Chardonnay wines, whereas it ranges from 14.7 to 20.3 degrees C for sparkling Chardonnay wines. Average growing season rainfall ranges from 106 to 630 nun with an average of 396 mm. This diversity indicates a considerable adaptation of Chardonnay for wine production. This plasticity probably offers an adaptive perspective to climate change, especially for cool climate regions such as Burgundy (the motherland of Chardonnay), where most of still and sparkling wines are produced with this variety.","[Gavrilescu, Catinca; Bois, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRC UMR Biogeosci, CNRS, 6 Bd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bois, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Inst Univ Vigne & Vin, Rue Claude Ladrey, F-21000 Dijon, France",Universite de Bourgogne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bourgogne,"Gavrilescu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRC UMR Biogeosci, CNRS, 6 Bd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.",,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,5,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1013.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701013,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700013,0

Methods: Outcomes included change in minutes of total moderate to vigorous physical activity, leisure-time moderate to vigorous physical activity and walking per week, and weight stability between baseline and maintenance at 48 weeks. Marginal cost-effectiveness ratios (MCERs) were calculated for each outcome, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using a bootstrap method. The analysis was carried out from the societal perspective and calculated in 2013 US dollars. Results: For the 260 participants in the analysis, program costs were $165 $19, and participant costs were $164 $35, for a total cost of $329 $49. The MCER for change in walking was $1.50/min/wk (95% CI 1.28-1.87), for change in moderate to vigorous physical activity was $1.73/min/wk (95% CI 1.41-2.18), and for leisure-time moderate to vigorous physical activity was $1.94/min/wk (95% CI 1.58-2.40). The MCER for steps based on the accelerometer was $0.46 per step (95% CI 0.30-0.85) and weight stability was $412 (95% CI 399-456). Conclusions: The Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity Program is a relatively low-cost strategy for increasing physical activity. The marginal cost of increasing physical activity is lower than for weight stability. The participant costs related to time in the program were nearly half the total costs, suggesting that practitioners and policymakers should consider the participant cost when disseminating a lifestyle physical activity program into practice.

Launched by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the GetReal project aims to improve understanding of how to reconcile evidence to support efficacy and effectiveness and at proposing operational solutions. Objectives: The objectives of the present narrative review were 1) to understand the historical background in which the concept of the EEG has emerged and 2) to describe the conceptualization of EEG. Methods: A focused literature review was conducted across the gray literature and articles published in English reporting insights on the EEG concept. The identification of different paradigms was performed by simple inductive analysis of the documents' content. Results: The literature on the EEG falls into three major paradigms, in which EEG is related to 1) real-life characteristics of the health care system; 2) the method used to measure the drug's effect; and 3) a complex interaction between the drug's biological effect and contextual factors. Conclusions: The third paradigm provides an opportunity to look beyond any dichotomy between standardized versus real-life characteristics of the health care system and study designs. Namely, future research will determine whether the identification of these contextual factors can help to best design randomized controlled trials that provide better estimates of drugs' effectiveness.","[Nordon, Clementine] LASER Res, 10 Pl Catalogne, F-75014 Paris, France; [Karcher, Helene; Abenhaim, Lucien] LASER Analyt, London, England; [Groenwold, Rolf H.

Since 2015, the French wine sector has been working on an original study to identify new research avenues while launching an innovative action plan to combat vineyard decline. First, a statistical analysis enabled to estimate research efforts in the different countries. 70 factors susceptible to contribute to vineyard decline were then identified by analyzing more than 500 publications. These factors are biological, physical or linked to growing practices. While the role of pathogens is fairly well-known, the impact of the land plot or the soil on decline is less understood. Secondly, a prospective methodology was used to better identify viticulture system factors and levers affecting vines. It was thus demonstrated that yield and longevity are strongly linked to agronomy, economic variables and plant matter, plant physiology, disease, etc... These are the key issues and leverage actions to combat more strongly vineyard decline. The matrix analysis was then complemented by interviews and statistical data to imagine leverage actions.

For this purpose, second fermentations were conducted by the traditional method using a base wine elaborated with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Riesling Italic, and fermented with S. cerevisiae vr. bayanus EC1118 strain. Samples were collected from 0 to 360 days, and evaluated with respect to the basic physic-chemical characteristics, yeast population, and the concentration of volatile compounds. The results showed that the second fermentation, other than an increment in the alcohol concentration leads to a small increase in volatile acidity, where total acidity decreased during fermentation, and increase again during aging. Yeast population declined rapidly after fermentation, but autolysis initiated just after 9 month of aging. Based on the concentration of volatile compounds, three profiles could be defined: (1) a fermentation profile defined by higher concentrations of acetates and lower concentrations of ethylates and fatty acids; (2) a post-fermentation profile with intermediary concentrations of acetates, and increased concentrations of fatty acids, and their ethyl esters; and (3) a mature profile with higher concentrations of diethyl succinate, fusel alcohols, volatile fatty acids, and their ethyl esters, and lower concentrations of acetates.","[Verzeletti, Andrelise; Echeverrigaray, Sergio; Vanderlinde, Regina; Longaray Delamare, Ana Paula] Univ Caxias Do Sul, Inst Biotechnol, BR-95070960 Caxias Do Sul, Rio Grande Do S, Brazil; [Cardoso, Alejandro] Vinicola Cia Piagentini, B-95020183 Caxias Do Sul, Rio Grande Do S, Brazil; [Vanderlinde, Regina] Ibravin Laren, BR-95084470 Caxias Do Sul, Rio Grande Do S, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Verzeletti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Caxias Do Sul, Inst Biotechnol, BR-95070960 Caxias Do Sul, Rio Grande Do S, Brazil.",,"Echeverrigaray, Sergio/CAI-2867-2022; Echeverrigaray, Sergio/CAF-7909-2022; Delamare, Ana Paula Longaray/AHE-9445-2022; Longaray Delamare, Ana Paula/AGZ-4312-2022","Delamare, Ana Paula Longaray/0000-0001-9638-5483;",,,,,19,3,3,1,14,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2019.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702019,0.0,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700063,0

The use of selected wine yeasts can be considered one of the most effective and simple tools. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of co-inoculation times of selected non-Saccharomyces/Saccharomyces yeasts on the reduction of ethanol levels in wines. Hanseniaspora uvarum BHu9, Starmerella bacillaris BSb55 and Candida membranaefasciens BCm71 were co-inoculate with Saccharomyces cerevisiae under fermentative conditions. Treatments assayed were: pure fermentations of S. cerevisiae BSc203 and non-Saccharomyces yeasts BHu9, BSb55 and BCm71; -co-fermentations: A-BHu9/BSc203; B-BSb55/BSc203 and C-BCm71/BSc203. These co-inoculations were carried out under mixed (simultaneous inoculation), and sequential conditions (non-Saccharomyces yeasts inoculated at initial time and S. cerevisiae at 48, 96 and 144h). Lower fermentative efficiencies were registered when BHu9 and BSb55 remained pure more time. Conversely, the conversion efficiency was reduced in co-inocula of BCm71/BSc203, when both yeasts interact more time. Metabolites produced during all vinification processes were within acceptable concentration ranges according to the current legislations. Conclusion Time interaction during fermentation processes of non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces yeasts showed influence on ethanol production, and this effect would be dependent on the co-inoculated species.","[Victoria Mestre, Maria; Paola Maturano, Yolanda; Eugenia Toro, Maria; Vazquez, Fabio] IBT FI UNSJ San Martin, RA-1109 San Juan O, Argentina; [Victoria Mestre, Maria; Paola Maturano, Yolanda; Combina, Mariana] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Mercado, Laura; Combina, Mariana] EEA Mendoza INTA, Ctr Estudios Enol, RA-3853 San Martin, Lujan Mendoza, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA),"Mestre, MV (通讯作者)，IBT FI UNSJ San Martin, RA-1109 San Juan O, Argentina.;Mestre, MV (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",victoria_mestref@hotmail.com,,"Mestre Furlani, Maria Victoria/0000-0002-2996-8635",,,,,25,3,3,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2025.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702025,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700069,0

The extreme borrowing constraint used in the classical version of the model, surveyed in Becker (2006), and the limited form of borrowing constraint examined in Borissov and Dubey (2015) are relaxed to allow more liberal borrowing by the households. A perfect foresight equilibrium is shown to exist in this economy. We describe the steady state equilibria for the liberal borrowing regime and show that as the borrowing regime is progressively liberalized, the steady state wealth inequality increases. Unlike the case of a limited borrowing regime, an equilibrium path need not converge in the case of liberal borrowing regime. We show through an example that a two period cyclic equilibrium exists when agents are allowed to borrow against their two period future wage income. This result is similar to the possibility of non-convergent equilibrium capital stock sequences in the model with no borrowing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The additional impact of reference pricing over and above previously implemented generic substitution was also assessed. Methods: An interrupted time series design with a control group and segmented regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the implementation of generic substitution and the reference price system on the daily cost of antipsychotics. The data have 69 monthly values of the average daily cost for each of the studied antipsychotics: 39 months before and 30 months after the introduction of reference pricing. For one of the studied antipsychotic, the time before the introduction of reference pricing could be further divided into time before and after the introduction of generic substitution. Results: According to the model, 2.5 years after the implementation of reference pricing, the daily cost of the studied antipsychotics was 24.6% to 50.6% lower than it would have been if reference pricing had not been implemented. Two and a half years after the implementation of the reference price system, however, the additional impact of reference pricing over and above previously implemented generic substitution was modest, less than 1 percentage point. Conclusions: Although the price competition induced by reference pricing decreased the prices of antipsychotics in Finland in the short-term, the prices had a tendency to stagnate or even to turn in an upward direction in the medium- to long-term. Furthermore, the additional impact of reference pricing over and above previously implemented generic substitution remained quite modest.","[Koskinen, Hanna; Mikkola, Hennamari; Saastamoinen, Leena K.; Ahola, Elina; Martikainen, Jaana E.] Social Insurance Inst, Res Dept, POB 450, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,"Koskinen, H (通讯作者)，Social Insurance Inst, Res Dept, POB 450, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",hanna.koskinen@kela.fi,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,1105,1112,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.08.014,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686797.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500021,0

In addition, we analysed the variance of LoS and associations of selected regional-level factors with LoS and 1-year mortality after cerebral infarction. The data show that LoS distributions are surprisingly different across countries and that there is significant deviation in the risk-adjusted regional-level LoS in all of the countries studied. We used negative binomial regression to model the individual-level LoS, and random intercept models and ordinary least squares regression for the regional-level analysis of risk-adjusted LoS, variance of LoS, 1-year risk-adjusted mortality and crude mortality for a period of 31-365 days. The observed variations between regions and countries in both LoS and mortality were not fully explained by either patient-level or regional-level factors. The results indicate that there may exist potential for efficiency gains in acute hospital care of cerebral infarction and that healthcare managers could learn from best practices.

Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted using data from a 56-week, randomized controlled trial of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patient-reported outcome measures included the RA-WIS, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Global Assessment of Disease Activity and Pain, data for which were collected at baseline and at weeks 12, 16, 24, and 56. Data were analyzed for reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Results: Among 148 patients whose data were analyzed, more than half were women (56.1%) with a mean age of 46.8 years. On average, patients experienced RA symptoms for 8.7 months; the mean 28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) was 5.9, and the mean HAQ-Disability Index was 1.3. The RA-WIS demonstrated excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability (alpha = 0.89 and intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91, respectively). At baseline and week 24, moderate to strong correlations were seen between RA-WIS total scores and the HAQ the Global Assessment of Disease Activity, and the Pain Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire, ranging from 0.47 to 0.81 (all P < 0.0001). Mean RA-WIS total scores and work disability risk levels discriminated between clinical severity scores on the DAS28, the HAQ - Disability Index, and the Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (all P < 0.05). Mean baseline to week 24 RA-WIS total change scores were significantly different among American College of Rheumatology responder groups (P < 0.0001) and between DAS28 remission status groups (P < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence supporting the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the RA-WIS for evaluating work disability in patients with RA in a clinical trial setting.","[Revicki, Dennis; Kimel, Miriam; Safikhani, Shima] Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ganguli, Arijit; Roy, Sanjoy; Chen, Naijun; Cifaldi, Mary] AbbVie Inc, N Chicago, IL USA",Evidera; AbbVie,"Revicki, D (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",dennis.revicki@evidera.com,,"Roy, Dr. Sanjoy/0000-0002-9327-6350",AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"The design, conduct, and financial support for this study were provided by AbbVie.

HH is associated with increased iron absorption leading to parenchymal organ damage and multiple arthropathies. Early diagnosis and treatment prevents complications. Population screening may increase early diagnosis, but no programmes have been introduced internationally: a paucity of health economic data is often cited as a barrier. Objective To conduct a systematic review of all health economic studies in HH. Methods Studies were identified through electronic searching of economic/biomedical databases. Any study on HH with original economic component was included. Study quality was formally assessed. Health economic data were extracted and analysed through narrative synthesis. Results Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of papers reported on costs or cost effectiveness of screening programmes. Whilst most concluded screening was cost effective compared with no screening, methodological flaws limit the quality of these findings. Assumptions regarding clinical penetrance, effectiveness of screening, health-state utility values (HSUVs), exclusion of early symptomatology (such as fatigue, lethargy and multiple arthropathies) and quantification of costs associated with HH were identified as key limitations. Treatment studies concluded therapeutic venepuncture was the most cost-effective intervention. Conclusions There is a paucity of high-quality health economic studies relating to HH. The development of a comprehensive HH cost-effectiveness model utilising HSUVs is required to determine whether screening is worthwhile.","[de Graaff, Barbara; Neil, Amanda; Sanderson, Kristy; Si, Lei; Palmer, Andrew J.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Med Sci Bldg 2,17 Liverpool St Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Yee, Kwang Chien] Univ Tasmania, Sch Med, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Tasmania,"Palmer, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Med Sci Bldg 2,17 Liverpool St Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",Andrew.Palmer@utas.edu.au,"Si, Lei/AAM-3218-2020; Neil, Amanda Louise/K-1212-2019; Sanderson, Kristy/KBD-4634-2024; Palmer, Andrew/J-7289-2014; Sanderson, Kristy/J-2796-2013","Si, Lei/0000-0002-3044-170X; Neil, Amanda Louise/0000-0002-1344-6672; Palmer, Andrew/0000-0002-9703-7891; Sanderson, Kristy/0000-0002-3132-2745; de Graaff, Barbara/0000-0003-0743-9561",PhD Australian Postgraduate Research Award scholarship by Australian Government,PhD Australian Postgraduate Research Award scholarship by Australian Government,Barbara de Graaff was supported by a PhD Australian Postgraduate Research Award scholarship provided by the Australian Government: this body did not have any role in the study.,,100,8,8,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The degree of complementarity is captured by the elasticity of substitution of the CES aggregator function. Drawing from the Central Limit Theorem and the Extreme Value Theory we find, under very general assumptions, that the cross-sectional distributions of technological productivity are well-approximated either by the lognormal, Weibull, or a novel CES/Normal distribution, depending on the underlying elasticity of substitution between technology components. We find the tail of the CES/Normal distribution to be fatter than the Weibull tail but qualitatively thinner than the Pareto (power law) one. We also numerically assess the rate of convergence of the true technological productivity distribution to the theoretical limit with n as fast in the body but slow in the tail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Now consider two groups, one of which has a broader set of values than the other. We develop a mathematical model to investigate how this difference in broadness of values may drive a change on the population level towards positions in line with the more narrow set of values. The model is motivated by the empirical finding that conservative morality rests equally on moral foundations that are individualizing (harm and fairness) and binding (purity, authority, and ingroup), whereas liberal morality relies mainly on the individualizing moral foundations. The model then predicts that, under certain conditions, the whole population will tend to move towards positions on moral issues (e.g., same-sex marriage) that are supported by individualizing moral foundations.

Exploiting linked employer-employee panel data that consist of rich survey-based and administrative information on firms, workers and regions, we apply a flexible propensity score matching approach that controls for selection on observables and time-constant unobserved factors. While the effects of analysing sickness absenteeism appear to be rather limited, our results suggest that health circles/courses increase tenure and job stability across various age groups. A key finding is that health circles/courses strengthen the labour force attachment of elderly employees (51-60), implying potential cost savings for public transfer schemes such as unemployment insurance or early retirement schemes.

This paper examines the short-run changes in health, health care access, and health care utilization after job loss that lead to these long-term effects. Using a sample with more than 10,000 individual job losses and longitudinal data on a wide variety of health-related outcomes, we show that job loss results in worse self-reported health, activity limitations, and worse mental health, but is not associated with statistically significant increases in a variety of specific chronic conditions. Among the full sample of workers, we see reductions in insurance coverage, but little evidence of reductions in health care utilization after job loss. Among the subset of displaced workers with chronic conditions and those for whom the lost job was their primary source of insurance we do see reductions in doctor's visits and prescription drug usage.

By extending the CCC model in several ways, it allows for all the primary stylized facts of financial asset returns, including volatility clustering, non-normality (excess kurtosis and asymmetry), and also dynamics in the dependency between assets over time. A fast EM-algorithm is developed for estimation. Each element of the vector return at time t is endowed with a common univariate shock, interpretable as a common market factor. This leads to the new model being a hybrid of GARCH and stochastic volatility, but without the estimation problems associated with the latter, and being applicable in the multivariate setting for potentially large numbers of assets. A feasible technique which allows for multivariate option pricing is presented, along with an empirical illustration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I impose a threshold crossing model on both the endogenous regressor and the outcome. The bounds proposed by Shaikh and Vytlacil (2011,SV) on the ATE are sharp only under a restrictive condition on the support of the covariates and the instruments, which rules out a wide range of models and many relevant applications. In this setting, I provide a methodology that allows the construction of sharp bounds on the ATE by efficiently using the variation of covariates without imposing support restrictions.

Deliberation among stakeholders could achieve this goal, but rarely involves patients and citizens directly. Objectives: This study aimed at evaluating the acceptability, and the perceived benefits and risks, of public and patient involvement (PPI) in coverage decision making to Belgian stakeholders. Methods: A two-round Delphi survey was conducted among all stakeholder groups. The survey was constructed on the basis of interviews with 10 key stakeholders and a review of the literature on participation models. Consensus was defined as 65% or more of the respondents agreeing with a statement and less than 15% disagreeing. Eighty stakeholders participated in both rounds. They were defined as the Delphi panel. Results: Belgian stakeholders are open toward PPI in coverage decision processes. Benefits are expected to exceed risks. The preferred model for involvement is to consult citizens or patients, within the existing decision-making structures and at specific milestones in the process. Consulting citizens and patients is a higher level of involvement than merely informing them and a lower level than letting them participate actively. Consultation involves asking nonbinding advice on (parts of) the decision problem. According to the Delphi panel, the benefits of PPI could be increasing awareness among members of the general public and patients about the challenges and costs of health care, and enriched decision processes with expertise by experience from patients. Potential risks include subjectivity, insufficient resources to participate and weigh on the process, difficulties in finding effective ways to express a collective opinion, the risk of manipulation, and lobbying or power games of other stakeholders. Conclusions: PPI in coverage decision-making processes is acceptable to Belgian stakeholders, be it in different ways for different types of decisions. Benefits are expected to outweigh risks.","[Cleemput, Irina; Christiaens, Wendy; Kohn, Laurence; Leonard, Christian] Belgian Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Cleemput, Irina] Hasselt Univ, Hasselt, Belgium; [Kohn, Laurence] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Sch Publ Hlth, Brussels, Belgium; [Leonard, Christian] Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Leonard, Christian] Univ Namur, Namur, Belgium; [Leonard, Christian] High Sch Louvain Hainaut, Louvain, Belgium; [Daue, Francois; Denis, Alain] Yellow Window Management Consultants, Antwerp, Belgium",Hasselt University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Namur,"Cleemput, I (通讯作者)，Belgian Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, AC Kruidtuin, Doorbldg 10th Floor,Kruidtuinlaan 55, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Irina.Cleemput@kce.fgov.be,"Kohn, Laurence/AAY-1423-2021","Kohn, Laurence/0000-0003-4835-2024; Christiaens, Wendy/0000-0003-4264-2207; Cleemput, Irina/0000-0003-4479-8950",,,,,43,16,16,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,477,483,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.12.015,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091602.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600015,0

These inequalities are used to establish consistency of the LASSO even when the number of parameters is of a much larger order of magnitude than the sample size. We also state conditions under which no relevant variables are excluded. Next, non-asymptotic probabilities are given for the adaptive LASSO to select the correct sparsity pattern. We then provide conditions under which the adaptive LASSO reveals the correct sparsity pattern asymptotically. We establish that the estimates of the non-zero coefficients are asymptotically equivalent to the oracle assisted least squares estimator. This is used to show that the rate of convergence of the estimates of the non-zero coefficients is identical to the, one of least squares only including the relevant covariates.

Objectives: We aimed to determine an a priori responder definition for a patient reported outcome instrument, the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), using an anchor-based method, to interpret individual treatment benefit in patients with LPR, on the basis of the US food and Drug Administration guidance. Methods: Patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms suggestive of LPR underwent twice-daily 40 mg esomeprazole treatment for 12 weeks. We used a 50% or more reduction in the primary laryngeal symptom at week 12, an empirical criterion, as an anchor to dichotomize the participants into two groups, and to establish a responder definition of the RSI score change. The optimal cutoff point of the RSI score change was determined on the basis of the maximal Youden index of the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: The mean reduction in the RSI score was significantly greater in subjects with a 50%. or more reduction in the primary laryngeal symptom than in those without (-11.0 +/- 7.8 vs. -3.1 +/- 8.3, P < 0.0001). A reduction of six points or more in the RSI score at week 12 was considered to be the responder definition with a sensitivity of 0.79 and a specificity of 0.70. Conclusions: We propose an a priori responder definition derived from an empirical criterion according to the Food and Drug Administration guidance: a reduction of six points or more in the RSI score at week 12. This preliminary estimate provides a clinically meaningful change at an individual level, although additional studies and validations across various languages are required.","[Lien, Han-Chung; Lee, Shou-Wu; Yeh, Hong-Zen; Ko, Chung-Wang] Taichung Vet Gen Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lien, Han-Chung; Yeh, Hong-Zen; Ko, Chung-Wang] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Dept Internal Med, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Lien, Han-Chung] China Med Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wang, Chen-Chi] Taichung Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wang, Chen-Chi] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Sch Med, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Wang, Chen-Chi] Chung Shan Med Univ, Sch Speech Language Pathol & Audiol, Taichung 40201, Taiwan; [Lee, Shou-Wu] Chung Shan Med Univ, Dept Internal Med, Taichung 40201, Taiwan; [Hsu, Jeng-Yuan] Taichung Vet Gen Hosp, Divi Chest Med, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chi-Sen] Taichung Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Taichung, Taiwan; [Liang, Wen-Miin] China Med Univ, Grad Inst Biostat, Taichung 40402, Taiwan",Taichung Veterans General Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; China Medical University Taiwan; Taichung Veterans General Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Chung Shan Medical University; Chung Shan Medical University; Taichung Veterans General Hospital; Taichung Veterans General Hospital; China Medical University Taiwan,"Liang, WM (通讯作者)，China Med Univ, Grad Inst Biostat, 91 Hsueh Shih Rd, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.",wmliang@mail.cmu.edu.tw,"Lee, Shao-Wu/AAT-2594-2021",,,,,,37,14,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,396,403,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.001,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091593.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600006,0

We develop a solution concept that we can situate roughly between Wilson's coarse core and Yannelis's private core. We investigate the interim negotiation of contracts and address the two situations of contract delivery: interim and ex post. Our solution differs from Wilson's concept because the measurability of strategies in our solution is postponed until the consumption date (assumed with respect to the information that will be known by the players at the consumption date). For interim consumption, our concept differs from Yannelis's private core because players can negotiate conditional on proper common knowledge events in our solution, which strengthens the interim aspect of the game, as we will illustrate with examples.

J,"Carlson, K",,,,"Carlson, Kyle",,,Fear itself: The effects of distressing economic news on birth outcomes,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health; Birth weight; Gestational age; Birth outcomes; Stress,SPONTANEOUS PRETERM BIRTH; MATERNAL STRESS; MANDATORY NOTICE; EARNINGS LOSSES; HUMAN-PREGNANCY; JOB INSECURITY; MENTAL-HEALTH; LABOR-MARKET; HARD TIMES; WEIGHT,I use new administrative data on mass layoffs and plant closings to study the effects of distressing economic news. Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy can impair fetal development. I find that announcement of impending job losses leads to a transient decrease in the mean birth weight within the firm's county one to four months before the job losses. A loss of 500 jobs corresponds roughly to a decrease of 15-20 g and 16 percent greater risk of low birth weight. Layoffs announced late in pregnancy are most strongly linked to decreased birth outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We document the extent to which a sample of European students (from Denmark, France, Italy and Sweden) consider that individuals should assume the financial burden of paying the costs of risky behaviour. We test the acceptability of different ways of financing costs because of ill health that is more or less associated with risky behaviour in accordance with a normative framework relating to responsibility-sensitive fairness. We find that the majority of students agree with assuming financial responsibility for risky behaviours and that there should be compensation for unfavourable circumstances. Students agree that two individuals with the same responsibility variables should make an equal financial contribution and that more effort in maintaining health for given circumstances should be rewarded with a lower financial contribution. The specific health context and the type of risky behaviours involved matter in determining perceptions of justice in health financing.

However, genetic tests nowadays in use have very low sensitivity for identifying subjects at risk of VTE. Thrombo inCode (R) is a new genetic tool that has demonstrated very good sensitivity, thanks to very good coverage of the genetic variants that modify the function of the coagulation pathway. Objective To conduct an economic analysis of risk assessment of VTE from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System with Thrombo inCode (R) (a clinical-genetic function for assessing the risk of VTE) versus the conventional/standard method used to date (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A). Methods An economic model was created from the National Health System perspective, using a decision tree in patients aged 45 years with a life expectancy of 81 years. The predictive capacity of VTE, based on identification of thrombophilia using Thrombo inCode (R) and using the standard method, was obtained from two case-control studies conducted in two different populations (S. PAU and MARTHA; 1,451 patients in all). Although this is not always the case, patients who were identified as suffering from thrombophilia were subject to preventive treatment of VTE with warfarin, leading to a reduction in the number of VTE events and an increased risk of severe bleeding. The health state utilities (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and costs (in 2013 EUR values) were obtained from the literature and Spanish sources. Results On the basis of a price of EUR 180 for Thrombo inCode (R), this would be the dominant option (more effective and with lower costs than the standard method) in both populations. The Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses indicate that the dominance would occur in 100 % of the simulations in both populations. The threshold price of Thrombo inCode (R) needed to reach the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) generally accepted in Spain EUR 30,000 per QALY gained) would be between EUR 3,950 (in the MARTHA population) and EUR 11,993 (in the S. PAU population). Conclusion According to the economic model, Thrombo inCode (R) is the dominant option in assessing the risk of VTE, compared with the standard method currently used.","[Rubio-Terres, C.; Rubio-Rodriguez, D.] Hlth Value, C Virgen Aranzazu 21,5 B, Madrid 28034, Spain; [Soria, J.

Those without post-school education qualifications are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of onset and are more likely to be out of work and on income support than those with qualifications up to 4 years after onset, due in part because they have greater difficulty adjusting.

For researchers studying policies which impact the disabled or elderly (e.g., Supplemental Security Income, Disability Insurance, and Early Retirement), this could lead to significant bias in key parameters of interest. Using the American Community Survey, we examine the potential for both inflated and deflated reported disability status and generate a general index of disability, which can be used to reduce the bias of these self-reports in other studies. We find that at least 4.8million individuals have left the labor force because of a work-limiting disability, at least four times greater than the impact implied by our replication of previous models.

For a given risk measurer, the risk parameter is expressed as a function of the volatility coefficients theta(0) and the risk, r (eta(t)), of the innovation process. A two-step method is proposed to successively estimate these quantities. An alternative one-step approach, relying on a reparameterization of the model and the use of a non Gaussian QML, is proposed. Asymptotic results are established for smooth risk measures, as well as for the Value-at-Risk (VaR). Asymptotic comparisons of the two approaches for VaR estimation suggest a superiority of the one-step method when the innovations are heavy-tailed. For standard GARCH models, the comparison only depends on characteristics of the innovations distribution, not on the volatility parameters. Monte-Carlo experiments and an empirical study illustrate the superiority of the one-step approach for financial series. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In some cases, there is no Pareto ranking among the different sunspot equilibria. However, this paper shows that a sunspot equilibrium with lower price-volatility is superior in economic welfare to one with higher price-volatility based on a compensation test of balanced tax-transfer plans. Specifically, I start with a non-singular benchmark equilibrium. For any nearby equilibrium prices with smaller volatility, there exists a small redistribution of first period endowments that achieves an equilibrium with the same price-volatility but is yet Pareto-superior to the benchmark equilibrium. Such a Pareto-improving redistribution does not exist for the nearby equilibrium with higher price-volatility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using 1991-2011 data before and after a 1999 premium subsidy policy change in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), we find that the employer premium contribution scheme has a differential impact on health plan pricing based on two market incentives: 1) consumers are less price sensitive when they only need to pay part of the premium increase, and 2) each health plan has an incentive to increase the employer's premium contribution to that plan. Both incentives are found to contribute to premium growth. Counterfactual simulation shows that average premium would have been 10% less than observed and the federal government would have saved 15% per year on its premium contribution had the subsidy policy change not occurred in the FEHBP. We discuss the potential of similar incentives in other government-subsidized insurance systems such as the Medicare Part D and the Health Insurance Marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that are advanced text analysis techniques integrated with the other attributes and behavior of the fans of corporate to study the relationship on social media. The results showed that customer loyalty was directly impacted by corporate image and behavioral intention. Good corporate image and active behavioral intention will lead to a positive customer loyalty. In summary, in improving corporate image and stimulating behavioral intention would lead to an increase in sales and willingness for purchase. As the result suggest, Shanghai Peace hotel need to more widely publicized their corporate such as celebrity endorsement[1] and make more interactive with his followers through a variety of marketing activities. The core concept regarding customer relationship management (CRM) has been changed from simply concerning what customers need to the way to satisfy consumers. The difference between the traditional media and social media is another marketing problem. Facing such challenges, businesses should reconsider their strategy regarding customer satisfaction. Whether they can stand by every consumer, or make extra efforts to anticipate, appreciate, understand, and satisfy their genuine needs and whether they could build close relationship with them are the three main topics in CRM.

It was measured genes expressions of pro-inflammatory soluble factors (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and MMP12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and TIMP1) for detection of M1 or M2 polarization of MDMF. In the diet with fish oil, it showed a statistically significant increase in gene expression of MMP12 (P<0.01). It was measured genes expressions after stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In case of both diet (fish oil and palm oil) IL-1 gene expression was increased in contrast to HPRT-1 (housekeeping gen). It is obvious that MDMF were directed to M1 polarization in fish oil diet.

This paper discusses the methodology advantages of applying TR1Z in management innovation, put forward the basic idea of the management specialization of TRIZ to management innovation, as well as the basic work of the management specialization of TRIZ.","[Zhang, Ya-qiang; Li, Hong-mei] Xingtai Univ, Dept Business Adm, Xingtai, Hebei, Peoples R China",Xingtai University,"Zhang, YQ (通讯作者)，Xingtai Univ, Dept Business Adm, Xingtai, Hebei, Peoples R China.",tjhbzyq@126.com,"sun, huan/IUN-8843-2023",,,,,,15,3,3,0,20,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,655,658,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_133,0.0,,,4,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700133,0

Inappropriate production lot-size determination can generate substantial scrapped overdue stocks and idle processing, which lead to serious environmental burdens. In this paper, Material flow cost accounting (MFCA), an environmental management accounting method, is adopted to reduce the amount of wastes that result from large overstocks and other wastes caused by current production lot-size determination are traced. For comparison with the conventional cost accounting used in the original simulation model, MFCA can identify negative products cost related to environmental impacts hidden in the production processes. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed procedure of application of simulation with MFCA can also perform a dynamic analysis and a static analysis.","[Zhao, Run] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Econ & Management Sch, Zhen Jiang, Peoples R China; [Takakuwa, S.; Ichimura, H.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Jiangsu University of Science & Technology; Nagoya University,"Zhao, R (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Econ & Management Sch, Zhen Jiang, Peoples R China.",zhaorun1982@hotmail.com; takakuwa@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; ichimura.hikaru@f.nagoya-u.jp,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,223,227,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_47,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700047,0

We propose a model of product differentiation, taking into account the taste and health characteristics of products. We study how two firms react to alternative policies: an MQS policy, linear taxation of the two goods on the market, and taxation of the low-quality good. The MQS and the taxation of the low-quality product are the preferred options by a social planner. If taste is moderately important, the MQS policy is chosen by a populist and a paternalist social planner. If taste is a major component of choice, the populist planner chooses to tax the low quality product whereas the paternalist planner prefers the MQS policy. Finally, for a paternalist social planner, an MQS-based policy always allows for higher levels of welfare than an information policy alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Preoperative and postoperative follow-up often elicit PROMS in the form of generic quality-of-life instruments (e.g., Short Form health survey SF-12 [SF-12]) that can be used in economic evaluation to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). However, the timing of postoperative measurement is still under debate. Objectives: To explore the timing of postoperative PROMS collection and the implications for bias in QALY estimation for economic evaluation. Methods: We compared the accuracy of QALY estimation on the basis of utilities derived from the SF-12 at one of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after total knee arthroplasty, under different methods of interpolation between points. Five years of follow-up data were extracted from the St. Vincent's Melbourne Arthroplasty Outcomes (SMART) registry (n = 484). The SMART registry collects follow-up PROMS annually and obtained more frequent outcomes on subset of patients (n = 133). Results: Postoperative PROM collection at 6 weeks, 6 months, or 12 months biased the estimation of QALY gain from total knee arthroplasty by-41% (95% confidence interval [CI]-59% to-22%), 18% (95% CI 4%-32%), and-8% (95% CI-18% to-2%), respectively. This bias was minimized by collecting PROMS at 3 months postoperatively (6% error; 95% CI-9% to 21%). Conclusions: The timing of PROM collection and the interpolation assumptions between measurements can bias economic evaluation. In the case of total knee arthroplasty, we recommend a postoperative measurement at 3 months with linear interpolation between preoperative and postoperative measures. The design of economic evaluations should consider timing and interpolation issues.","[Schilling, Chris; Clarke, Philip M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Schilling, Chris; Dowsey, Michelle M.; Choong, Peter F.] Univ Melbourne, St Vincents Hosp, Dept Surg, Fitzroy, Vic, Australia; [Dowsey, Michelle M.; Choong, Peter F.] St Vincents Hosp Melbourne, Dept Orthopaed, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; NSW Health; St Vincents Hospital Sydney; University of Melbourne; St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne; St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne,"Schilling, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, 207 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3051, Australia.",chris.schilling@unimelb.edu.au,"Choong, Peter/F-1109-2014; Dowsey, Michelle/J-4162-2012","Choong, Peter/0000-0002-3522-7374; Dowsey, Michelle/0000-0002-9708-5308; Clarke, Philip/0000-0002-7555-5348; Choong, Peter/0000-0001-7333-7665",University of Melbourne; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [APP1093229]; NHMRC [APP1035810],University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne); National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),This work was supported by the University of Melbourne.

First, using a lower pseudocontinuous rationality function, we prove that the model is structurally stable and robust to epsilon-equilibria for almost all parameter values, and the structural stability implies robustness to bounded rationality. Second, by relaxing the assumption of compactness, if the feasible correspondence is compact-valued and continuous, and the rationality function is continuous, we show that the robustness to epsilon-equilibria implies structural stability. Third, using a lower semicontinuous rationality function, we prove that (lambda, epsilon)-stability implies (lambda, epsilon)-robustness.

Healthcare decision makers are thus driven to find better ways to manage budgets and deliver on their mission. Formal processes of priority setting and resource allocation (PSRA) are one means to this end. Objective This paper reports an evaluation of one such approach, Program Budgeting and Marginal Analysis (PBMA), as applied at a children and women's tertiary care facility in Nova Scotia, Canada. A brief evaluation conducted immediately after the conclusion of the PBMA process was supplemented with a larger retrospective evaluation. Methods The retrospective evaluation included 26 face-to-face individual interviews with senior and middle managers who took part in PBMA. Interview transcripts were analyzed against a template consisting of 19 elements of structure, process, attitudes, and outcomes associated with high performance in PSRA. Results Respondents had a good experience with the implementation of PBMA, and considered it an improvement over past practice. Success was attributed to effective leadership, and substantial efforts to engage staff members. Understanding of economic and ethical principles of decision making was reportedly increased. Areas for improvement included ensuring that everyone participated in good faith, better communication of final results, and stronger follow-through to determine if anticipated changes and benefits in fact occurred. Conclusion The evaluation framework employed here proved useful in assessing the quality of this resource allocation exercise. The results are directly useful to local decision makers, and the identified strengths and weaknesses are broadly consistent with those reported in studies of other organizations.","[Smith, Neale; Mitton, Craig] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Evaluat, Vancouver Coastal Hlth Res Inst, 7th Floor,828 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Mitton, Craig] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Hiltz, Mary-Ann; Campbell, Matthew; Gujar, Shashi Ashok] IWK Hlth Ctr, Qual & Syst Performance, Halifax, NS B3K6R8, Canada; [Dowling, Laura] Nova Scotia Hlth Author, Halifax, NS B3H1V7, Canada; [Magee, J.

Previous economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccination in France have not modeled the potential impact of vaccines on disease burden via reduced transmission. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of pentavalent rotavirus vaccination into the French infant vaccination schedule. Methods: We developed an age-structured model of rotavirus transmission calibrated to 6 years of French gastroenteritis incidence and vaccine clinical trial data. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pentavalent rotavirus vaccination considering that 75% of infants would receive the three dose vaccine course. Results: Our model predicts that rotavirus vaccination will decrease rotavirus gastroenteritis incidence and associated clinical outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, delay the seasonal peak of infection, and increase the age of infection. From the societal perspective, our base-case scenario predicts that vaccination coverage would be cost-effective at (sic)115 or (sic)135 per vaccine course at (sic)28,500 and (sic)39,500/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively, and suggests that almost 95% of the financial benefits will be recouped within the first 5 years following vaccination implementation. From the third-party payer perspective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from (sic)12,500 to (sic)20,000/QALY, respectively. Our uncertainty analysis suggests that findings were sensitive to various assumptions including the number of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and the extent of QALY losses per rotavirus episode. Conclusions: Introducing pentavalent rotavirus vaccination into the French infant vaccination schedule would significantly reduce the burden of rotavirus disease in children, and could be cost-effective under plausible conditions.","[Dan Yamin] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Dan Yamin; Atkins, Katherine E.; Galvani, Alison P.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Infect Dis Modeling & Anal, New Haven, CT USA; [Atkins, Katherine E.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London, England; [Remy, Vanessa] Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, France",Tel Aviv University; Yale University; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France,"Dan, YM (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Ind Engn, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",yamind@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,53,6,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,811,819,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.011,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712709.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500018,0

The project was used to develop a framework to help the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industry sponsors understand how patient preferences regarding benefit and risk might be integrated into the review of innovative medical devices. Methods: A public-private partnership of experts from medical device industry, government, academia and non-profits collaborated on development of the MDIC patient centered benefit-risk framework. Results: The MDIC Framework examines what patient preference information is and the potential use and value of patient preference information in the regulatory process and across the product development life cycle. The MDIC Framework also includes a catalog of patient preference assessment methods and an agenda for future research to advance the field. Conclusions: This article discusses key concepts in patient preference assessment of particular importance for regulators and researchers that are addressed in the MDIC Framework for patient centered benefit-risk assessment as well as the unique public-private collaboration that led its development.","[Ho, Martin; Saha, Anindita] US FDA, Ctr Devices & Radiol Hlth, Silver Spring, MD USA; [McCleary, K.

We argue that the effects might differ over the distribution of the health status and use quantile regression methods to provide a more complete picture. To take the potential endogeneity of job loss into account, we estimate quantile treatment effects where we rely on job loss due to plant closures. We find that the effect of job loss indeed varies across the mental and physical health distribution. Job loss due to plant closures affects physical health adversely for individuals in the middle and lower part of the health distribution while those in best physical condition do not seem to be affected.

In this paper, we merge the Original Cohort and the Offspring Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study to study how adult offspring smoking behavior and subjective health assessments vary with elder parent smoking behavior and health outcomes. These data allow us to model the smoking behavior of adult offspring over a 30-year period contemporaneously with parental behaviors and outcomes. We find strong like father, like son' and like mother, like daughter' correlations in smoking behavior. We find that adult offspring significantly curtail their own smoking following an own health shock; however, we find limited evidence that offspring smoking behavior is sensitive to parent health, with the notable exception that women significantly reduce both their smoking participation and intensity following a smoking-related cardiovascular event of a parent. We also model the subjective health assessment of adult offspring as a function of parent health, and we find that women report significantly worse health following the smoking-related death of a parent.

However, in an era of constrained medical resources, the cost-effectiveness of such a program needs to be demonstrated. Objective The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature analyzing the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening using LDCT. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews-Health Technology Assessment, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Due to technological progress in CT, we limited our search to studies published between January 2000 and December 2014. Our search returned 393 unique results. After removing studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria, 13 studies remained. Costs are presented in 2014 US dollars (US$). Results The results from the economic evaluations identified in this review were varied. All identified studies reported outcomes using either additional survival (life-years gained) or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs gained). Results ranged from US$18,452 to US$66,480 per LYG and US$27,756 to US$243,077 per QALY gained for repeated screening. The results of cost-effectiveness analyses were sensitive to several key model parameters, including the prevalence of lung cancer, cost of LDCT for screening, the proportion of lung cancer detected as localized disease, lead time bias, and, if included, the characteristics of a smoking cessation program. Conclusions The cost-effectiveness of a lung cancer screening program using LDCT remains to be conclusively resolved. It is expected that its cost-effectiveness will largely depend on identifying an appropriate group of high-risk subjects.","[Raymakers, Adam J.

To explain why, we build a model in which the outsourcing decision is a trade-off between cost and control. Since nonprofit firms are more restricted in how they consume net revenues, they experience more rapidly diminishing value of a dollar saved, and they are less attracted to a low-cost but low-control outsourcing opportunity than a for-profit firm is. This difference is exaggerated in services where the benefits of controlling the details of production are particularly important but minimized when a fixed-cost shock raises the marginal value of a dollar of cost savings. We test these predictions in a panel of California hospitals, finding evidence for each and that the set of services that private non-profits are particularly interested in controlling (physician-intensive services) is very different from those than public hospitals are particularly interested in (labor-intensive services). These results suggest that a model of public or nonprofit make-or-buy decisions should be more than a simple relabeling of a model derived in the for-profit context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To assess the comprehensive impact of HCV infection, systematic tracking of HRQOL in patients with HCV infection is important. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically validate an HCV-specific HRQOL instrument, the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-Hepatitis C Version (CLDQ-HCV), in patients with chronic HCV infection. Methods: The CLDQ-HCV has 29 items in four domains, each scored on a Likert scale of 1-to 7. We used a large cohort of patients with HCV infection enrolled in clinical trials (N = 4142) to test internal consistency, validity, and responsiveness, and we used another cohort of untreated patients with HCV infection (N = 36) to assess test-retest reliability. Results: The CLDQ-HCV performed well in all the psychometric assessments. In particular, the Cronbach alphas ranged from 0.84 to 0.94 for the four domains. The item-to-own-dimension correlations exceeded 0.6 for 27 of the 29 items. Of the clinical and demographic parameters, the presence of cirrhosis and history of psychiatric conditions were discriminated best by the CLDQ-HCV (all P < 0.0001). The domains' correlations with similar domains of the 36-item short form health survey exceeded 0.8. The responsiveness to significant clinical outcomes such as developing treatment-induced anemia and clearance of HCV infection was notable (up to -0.70 for anemia and up to +0.85 for achieving sustained virologic response; all P < 0.0001). Test-retest reliability showed intraclass correlations of 0.84 to 0.93 between multiple administrations. Conclusions: The CLDQ-HCV is a fully validated, simple-to-administer HCVspecific instrument for patients with HCV infection that could be considered in studies of HCV-infected patients.","[Younossi, Zobair M.] Inova Fairfax Hosp, Ctr Liver Dis, Dept Med, Falls Church, VA USA; [Younossi, Zobair M.; Henry, Linda] Inova Hlth Syst, Betty & Guy Beatty Ctr Integrated Res, Falls Church, VA USA; [Stepanova, Maria; Henry, Linda] Ctr Outcomes Res Liver Dis, Washington, DC USA",Inova Fairfax Hospital; Inova Health System,"Younossi, ZM (通讯作者)，Betty & Guy Beatty Ctr Integrated Res, Claude Moore Hlth Educ & Res Bldg,3300 Gallows Rd, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",zobair.younossi@inova.org,"Younossi, Zobair M./JRY-9916-2023; Stepanova, Maria/V-5513-2019","Stepanova, Maria/0000-0003-0444-8155",,,,,53,32,32,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,544,551,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.005,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565271.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600008,0

First, the present study compares two survey methods of measuring people's preferences for a specific healthcare technology when each choice has the same efficiency. The second objective was to consider how this information regarding preferences could be used in decision making. Methods We conducted single-attribute (budget allocation) and multi-attribute (discrete-choice) experiments to survey public medical care preferences. Approximately 1000 respondents were sampled for each experiment. Six questions were prepared to address the attributes included in the study: (a) age; (b) objective of care; (c) disease severity; (d) prior medical care; (e) cause of disease; and (f) disease frequency. For the discrete-choice experiment (a) age, (b) objective of care, (c) disease severity, and (d) prior medical care were orthogonally combined. All assumed medical care had the same costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per life-year or QALY). We also calculated the preference-adjusted threshold (PAT) to reflect people's preferences in a threshold range. Results The results of both experiments revealed similar preferences: intervention for younger patients was strongly preferred, followed by interventions for treatment and severe disease states being preferred, despite the same cost per life-year or QALY. The single-attribute experiment revealed that many people prefer an option in which resources are equally allocated between two interventions. Marginal PATs were calculated for age, objective of care, disease severity, and prior medical care. Conclusion The single- and multi-attribute experiments revealed similar preferences. PAT can reflect people's preferences within the decision-maker's threshold range in a numerical manner.","[Shiroiwa, Takeru; Fukuda, Takashi] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan; [Saito, Shinya] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Hlth Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Coll Life Sci, Kusatsu, Japan; [Kodama, Satoshi] Kyoto Univ, Dept Eth, Grad Sch Letters, Kyoto, Japan; [Noto, Shinichi] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Dept Hlth Sci, Niigata, Japan",National Institute of Public Health - Japan; Okayama University; Ritsumeikan University; Kyoto University; Niigata University,"Shiroiwa, T (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan.",t.shiroiwa@gmail.com,"Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932; Noto, Shinichi/0000-0002-6952-7770","Health and Labour Science Research Grants, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26463217, 16K08894, 25871156] Funding Source: KAKEN","Health and Labour Science Research Grants, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was funded by Health and Labour Science Research Grants, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.",,33,9,9,0,14,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The models exploit the asymptotic theory for high-frequency realized volatility estimation to improve the accuracy of the forecasts. By allowing the parameters of the models to vary explicitly with the (estimated) degree of measurement error, the models exhibit stronger persistence, and in turn generate more responsive forecasts, when the measurement error is relatively low. Implementing the new class of models for the S&P 500 equity index and the individual constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we document significant improvements in the accuracy of the resulting forecasts compared to the forecasts from some of the most popular existing models that implicitly ignore the temporal variation in the magnitude of the realized volatility measurement errors.

Researchers have speculated that flawed program designs or weak financial incentives may be to blame, but the reason for P4P's limited success may be more fundamental. When P4P rewards multiple services, it creates a special case of the well-known multitasking problem, where incentives to increase some rewarded activities are blunted by countervailing incentives to focus on other rewarded activities: these incentives may cancel each other out with little net effect on quality. This paper analyzes the comparative statics of a P4P model to show that when P4P rewards multiple services in a setting of multitasking and joint production, the change in both rewarded and unrewarded services is generally ambiguous. This result contrasts with the commonly held intuition that P4P should increase rewarded activities.

The patient is the central figure, but their choice of facility is guided by their physician and influenced by hospital characteristics. This study estimated changes in referral patterns for inpatient admissions and outpatient diagnostic imaging associated with changes in ownership of three multispecialty clinic systems headquartered in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN. These clinic systems were acquired by two hospital-owned integrated delivery systems (IDSs) in 2007, increasing the probability that hospital preferences influenced physician guidance on facility choice. We used a longitudinal dataset that allowed us to predict changes in referral patterns, controlling for health plan enrollee, coverage, and clinic system characteristics. The results are an important empirical contribution to the literature examining the impact of hospital ownership on location of service. When this change in ownership forged new relationships, there was a significant reduction in the use of facilities historically selected for inpatient admissions and outpatient imaging and an increase in the use of the acquiring IDS's facilities. These changes were weaker in the IDS acquiring two clinic systems, suggesting that management of multiple acquisitions simultaneously may impact the ability of the IDS to build strong referral relationships.

Effective approaches to increase the implementation of guidance are needed. Since investment in activities that improve implementation competes for funding against other health generating interventions, it should be assessed in term of its costs and benefits. Objective: In 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence released a clinical guideline recommending natriuretic peptide (NP) testing in patients with suspected heart failure. However, its implementation in practice was variable across the National Health Service in England. This study demonstrates the use of multi-period analysis together with diffusion curves to estimate the value of investing in implementation activities to increase uptake of NP testing. Methods: Diffusion curves were estimated based on historic data to produce predictions of future utilization. The value of an implementation activity (given its expected costs and effectiveness) was estimated. Both a static population and a multi-period analysis were undertaken. Results: The value of implementation interventions encouraging the utilization of NP testing is shown to decrease over time as natural diffusion occurs. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the value of the implementation activity depends on its efficacy and on the population size. Conclusions: Value of implementation can help inform policy decisions of how to invest in implementation activities even in situations in which data are sparse. Multi-period analysis is essential to accurately quantify the time profile of the value of implementation given the natural diffusion of the intervention and the incidence of the disease.","[Whyte, Sophie; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Faria, Rita; Walker, Simon; Palmer, Stephen; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Radford, Stefanie] NHS England, London, England",University of Sheffield; University of York - UK,"Whyte, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, SCHARR, Regent Court, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",Sophie.whyte@sheffield.ac.uk,"Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019","Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009; Walker, Simon Mark/0000-0002-5750-3691; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566",UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme,UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme,This research was undertaken by the Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions funded by the UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme.

It considers a nonseparable model for a cost function C = phi(Y, U) where C and Y are the cost and the output, U is uniform in [0, 1] and phi is increasing with respect to U. The cost frontier corresponds to U = 0 and U can be interpreted as a normalized level of inefficiency. The endogeneity issue arises when Y is dependent of U. For identification and estimation, we use a nonparametric instrumental variables estimator of the model for fixed value U = alpha, and obtain an estimate of the alpha-quantile cost frontier phi(Y, alpha). This involves the solution of a non linear integral equation. If the true frontier phi(Y, 0) is wanted, it is then estimated by estimating the bias correction phi(Y, 0) - phi(Y, alpha) under additional regularity conditions. The procedure is illustrated through a simulated sample and with an empirical application to the efficiency of post offices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, early economic evaluations, prior to introduction, often rely on assumed levels of uptake based on expert opinion or uptake of similar interventions. In addition to the likely uncertainty surrounding these uptake assumptions, they also do not allow for uptake to be a function of product, intervention, or user characteristics. This letter proposes using uptake projections from discrete choice experiments (DCE) to better parameterize uptake and substitution in cost-effectiveness models. A simple impact model is developed and illustrated using an example from the HIV prevention field in South Africa. Comparison between the conventional approach and the DCE-based approach shows that, in our example, DCE-based impact predictions varied by up to 50% from conventional estimates and provided far more nuanced projections. In the absence of observed uptake data and to model the effect of variations in intervention characteristics, DCE-based uptake predictions are likely to greatly improve models parameterizing uptake solely based on expert opinion. This is particularly important for global and national level decision making around introducing new and probably more expensive interventions, particularly where resources are most constrained.","[Terris-Prestholt, Fern; Quaife, Matthew; Vickerman, Peter] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Social & Math Epidemiol SaME, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Vickerman, Peter] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Bristol,"Terris-Prestholt, F (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Social & Math Epidemiol SaME, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",Fern.Terris-Prestholt@lshtm.ac.uk,"Quaife, Matthew/O-4754-2015","Quaife, Matthew/0000-0001-9291-1511; Terris-Prestholt, Fern/0000-0003-1693-5196; Vickerman, Peter/0000-0002-8291-5890",Programme for Appropriate Technology for Health (PATH); Economic and Social Research Council 1 + 3 Studentship; Faculty of Public Health and Policy Fellowship; Microbicide Development Programme; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [1359994] Funding Source: researchfish,Programme for Appropriate Technology for Health (PATH); Economic and Social Research Council 1 + 3 Studentship; Faculty of Public Health and Policy Fellowship; Microbicide Development Programme; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Support for this work was provided by: Programme for Appropriate Technology for Health (PATH), Economic and Social Research Council 1 + 3 Studentship, Faculty of Public Health and Policy Fellowship, Microbicide Development Programme, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation project titled ARV-Based Prevention Technologies: Developing the Capacity and Needed Tools to Deliver New Prevention Products (2011-2015).",,28,25,27,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2016,25.0,,,1.0,,,116,123,,10.1002/hec.3297,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DB9TF,26773825.0,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368859100010,0

It allows to measure agricultural production and its spatial distribution, characterize rural structure, facilitate inspection and development of agricultural policies, optimize distribution of agricultural credit, estimate crop yield and generate research data. A key component for a quality registry is accurate measurement of areas and their geographical position, through georeferencing, to allow integration with other spatial information. The Vineyard Registry of Rio Grande do Sul is one of the most complete agricultural registries in Brazil. It has been carried out in all grape producing properties in the state since 1995, and its georeferencing began in 2005, with the objective of accurately map vineyards. Embrapa has developed a methodology to accelerate georeferencing, by simplifying the field mapping process. One of the central points of this methodology was the development of a software called MapaGPS to organize and classify measured points in the field. Recently, this software has been improved, with the incorporation of features, such as transformation between coordinate systems, conversion between files of different formats, and more control over generated charts. The georeferencing experience of the Vineyard Registry of Rio Grande do Sul may be used throughout Brazil and other countries. The software is available under a free license, and there are no restrictions to adopting the methodology. This document aims to disclose details of this methodology and how it may be used to facilitate zoning projects worldwide.","[Fialho, Flavio Bello] Embrapa Uva & Vinho, Rua Livramento 515, Bento Goncalves, RS, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Fialho, FB (通讯作者)，Embrapa Uva & Vinho, Rua Livramento 515, Bento Goncalves, RS, Brazil.",,"Fialho, Flávio Bello/M-1027-2015","Fialho, Flávio Bello/0000-0001-8568-2204",,,,,4,0,0,0,2,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1035.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701035,0.0,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700035,0

The influence of DP size of condensed tannins on astringency perception remains unclear for decades. In the present study, the astringency intensity of purified and identified grape oligomeric tannins (DP ranged from 1 to 5) was firstly explored. A novel non-solid phase strategy was used to rapidly exclude the galloylated PAs from the non-galloylated PAs and fractionate the latter according to their DP size. Then, a series of PAs with individual DP size and galloylation were purified. Furthermore, purified compounds were identified by both normal phase HPLC-FLD and reverse phase UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF. Finally, the contribution of the astringency perception of the individual purified tannins was examined with a salivary protein binding ability test. The results were observed by HPLC-FLD and quantified by changes in PA concentration remaining in the filtrate. In summary, a new approach without a solid stationary phase was developed to isolate PAs according to their DP size. And a positive relationship between the DP of PAs and salivary protein affinity was revealed.","[Ma, Wen; Waffo-Teguo, Pierre; Jourdes, Michael; Teissedre, Pierre-Louis] Univ Bordeaux, ISVV, Unite Rech OENOL, EA 4577, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France; [Ma, Wen; Waffo-Teguo, Pierre; Jourdes, Michael; Teissedre, Pierre-Louis] INRA, ISVV, USC OENOL 1366, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France; [Li, Hua] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Enol, Xianyang 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE; Northwest A&F University - China,"Teissèdre, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, ISVV, Unite Rech OENOL, EA 4577, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France.;Teissèdre, PL (通讯作者)，INRA, ISVV, USC OENOL 1366, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France.",pierre-louis.teissedre@u-bordeaux.fr,"Teissedre, Pierre-Louis/I-6885-2016",,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2002.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702002,0.0,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700046,0

We focus on the least absolute deviation quantile estimator and show that while the underlying process is a sequence of stationary martingale differences, the estimation errors are asymptotically normal with the convergence rate which is slower than root n and determined by the dependence parameter of the volatility sequence. A non-parametric resampling method is employed to estimate the normalizing constants by which the confidence intervals are constructed. To demonstrate the methodology, we conduct a simulation study as well as an empirical analysis of the Value-at-Risk estimate of the S&P 500 daily returns. Both are consistent with the theoretical findings and provide clear evidence that the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals for the quantile estimate are severely biased if the strong dependence of the unobserved volatility sequence is ignored.

We show that the presence of time-persistent individual-specific effects does not lead to changes in the identification conditions of traditional Cowles Commission dynamic simultaneous equations models. However, the limiting properties of the estimators depend on the way the cross-section dimension, N, or the time series dimension, T, goes to infinity. We propose three limited information estimator: panel simple instrumental variables (PR!), panel generalized two stage least squares (PG2SLS), and panel limited information maximum likelihood estimation (PLIML). We show that they are all asymptotically unbiased independent of the way of how N or T tends to infinity, Monte Carlo studies are conducted to compare the performance of the PLIML, PIV, PG2SLS, the Arellano-Bond type generalized method of moments and the Akashi-Kunitomo least variance ratio estimator.

Newer studies, however, include patients with significant comorbidities, unstable psoriasis, or concomitant treatments. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide data on long-term response to etanercept and estimate the cost in daily practice. Methods: This is an observational retrospective study including patients with plaque-type psoriasis receiving etanercept 50 mg/wk for more than 6 months at the Dermatology Department of the University Hospital of La Corutia (Spain). Psoriasis severity was determined using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at baseline and then at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and annually until treatment discontinuation. Results: A total of 102 patients aged 24 to 78 years were included. Response rates of 58.8% and 66.3% for PASI 75 score (reduction of at least 75% in PASI score compared with baseline) were achieved after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Among patients who continued treatment, the PASI 75 score was maintained by 75.3% at 1 year, 82.5% at 2 years, and 88.2% at 3 years. The percentage of patients receiving other systemic treatments was 38.2%. Adverse effects were reported in 13.7%, all of them mild, except one case of urinary sepsis. The average cost per patient was (sic)244.68 +/- (sic)45.27 per week and (sic)34.95 +/- (sic)6.46 per day. Conclusions: We provide data on long-term response to etanercept and its costs in a real-world setting. Response rates were higher than in some clinical trials, with progressive efficacy and not related to body mass index. Etanercept cost was comparable with that estimated in other studies. Combination with a conventional systemic agent can enhance efficacy without additional adverse events.","[Maria Fernandez-Torres, Rosa; Paradela, Sabela; Fonseca, Eduardo] Univ Hosp La Coruna, Dept Dermatol, Xubias Arriba 84, La Coruna 15006, Spain",Complejo Hospitalario Universitario A Coruna,"Fernández-Torres, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp La Coruna, Dept Dermatol, Xubias Arriba 84, La Coruna 15006, Spain.",rosaftorres@gmail.com,"Fonseca, Eduardo/IAS-0526-2023; Fonseca, Eduardo/D-9725-2011","Fonseca, Eduardo/0000-0002-8048-2681; PARADELA, SABELA/0000-0002-6779-6459",Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),This study has been supported in part by a grant from Pfizer for Investigator-Initiated Research.,,19,9,9,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,1158,1161,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.07.010,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686803.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500027,0

It also uses these rates as an instrumental variable to assess the importance of prenatal care on birth weight. The analysis is conducted using a unique dataset of Medicaid reimbursement rates and 2001-2010 Vital Statistics Natality data. Conditional on county fixed effects, the study finds a modest, but statistically significant positive relationship between Medicaid reimbursement rates and the number of prenatal visits obtained by pregnant women. Additionally, higher rates are associated with an increase in the probability of obtaining adequate care, as well as a reduction in the incidence of going without any prenatal care. However, the effect of an additional prenatal visit on birth weight is virtually zero for black disadvantaged mothers, while an additional visit yields a substantial increase in birth weight of over 20 g for white disadvantaged mothers.

The proposed test statistic may be regarded as the Bayesian version of the Lagrange multiplier test. Its asymptotic distribution is obtained based on a set of regular conditions and follows a chi-squared distribution when the null hypothesis is correct. The new statistic has several important advantages that make it appealing in practical applications. First, it is well-defined under improper prior distributions. Second, it avoids Jeffrey-Lindley's paradox. Third, it always takes a non-negative value and is relatively easy to compute, even for models with latent variables. Fourth, its numerical standard error is relatively easy to obtain. Finally, it is asymptotically pivotal and its threshold values can be obtained from the chi-squared distribution. The method is illustrated using some real examples in economics and finance. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We first define the class of subset-additive hedonic games and show that they have the same representation power as the class of hedonic games. We then define a restriction of subset-additive hedonic games that we call subset-neutral hedonic games and generalize a result by Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2002) by showing the existence of a Nash stable partition and an individually stable partition in such games. We also consider neutrally anonymous hedonic games and show that they form a subclass of the subset-additive hedonic games. Finally, we show the existence of a core stable partition that is also individually stable in neutrally anonymous hedonic games by exhibiting an algorithm to compute such a partition.

The Labour Force Survey is used to compare the working hours of doctors with a variety of control groups before and after the implementation of the directive. The controls include those unconstrained by the directive and doctor counterparts working in Europe. We use differences-in-differences and matching methods to estimate the impact of this natural experiment, distinguishing between the anticipation and enactment of the European Working Time Directive.

Where this is not overt a speculum examination is undertaken to confirm diagnosis. The Vision Amniotic Leak Detector (ALD) is a panty liner that can diagnose amniotic fluid as a cause of vaginal wetness. It was evaluated by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as part of the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme. The sponsor (CommonSense Ltd) identified five studies, of which three were deemed within scope by the External Assessment Centre (EAC). Two of these three used an inappropriate comparator. The EAC recalculated the diagnostic accuracy of Vision ALD using speculum examination as the comparator: sensitivity of 97 % (95 % CI 93-99 %), negative predictive value of 96 % (95 % CI 92-98 %). A negative result would therefore allow patients to be discharged with confidence. In the sponsor's cost-consequence model only patients with a positive Vision ALD result would have a speculum examination, producing a cost saving of around 10 pound per patient. The EAC felt that some costs were unjustified and the model did not include infection outcomes or use in a community setting. The EAC revised the sponsor's model and found the results were most sensitive to clinician costs. Vision ALD was associated with savings of around 15- pound 25 pound per patient when administration in lower-cost community healthcare avoided a referral to a higher-cost secondary-care centre. NICE published guidance MTG15 in July 2013 recommending that the case for adopting Vision ALD was supported by the evidence.","[Ray, A. F.; Peirce, S.

We exploit this quasi-experiment to estimate the effect of geographical accessibility on outpatient case numbers using both individual-level and semi-aggregate panel data. We find a 24-27 per cent increase of case numbers as a result of the establishments. Our specialty-by-specialty estimates imply that a 1-min reduction of travel time to the nearest outpatient unit increases case numbers for example by 0.9per cent in internal care and 3.1per cent in rheumatology. The size of the new outpatient capacities has a separate effect, raising the possibility of the presence of supplier-induced demand. By combining a fixed-effects logit and a fixed-effects truncated Poisson estimator, we decompose the effects into increases in the probability of ever visiting a doctor on the one hand and an increase of the frequency of visits on the other hand. We find that new visits were dominant in the vast majority of specialties, whereas both margins were important for example in rheumatology. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the fixed-effects truncated Poisson estimator in modelling count data by examining its robustness by simulations.

We propose an asset pricing model with generalized disappointment aversion preferences and short- and long-run volatility risks that captures several stylized facts associated with the risk-return trade-off at short and long horizons. Writing the model in Bonomo et al. (2011) at the daily frequency, we aim at reproducing the moments of the variance premium and realized volatility, the long-run predictability of cumulative returns by the past cumulative variance, the short-run predictability of returns by the variance premium, as well as the daily autocorrelation patterns at many lags of the VD( and of the variance premium, and the daily cross-correlations of these two measures with leads and lags of daily returns. By keeping the same calibration as in this previous paper, we ensure that the model is capturing the first and second moments of the equity premium and the risk-free rate, and the predictability of returns by the dividend yield. Overall adding generalized disappointment aversion to the Kreps-Porteus specification improves the fit for both the short-run and the long-run risk-return trade-offs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One frequently asked question is how far should I extend the network and which treatments should I include? Objective: To explore the increase in precision from including additional evidence. Methods: We assessed the benefit of extending treatment networks in terms of precision of effect estimates and examined how this depends on network structure and relative strength of additional evidence. We introduced a star-shaped network. Network complexity is increased by adding more evidence connecting treatments under five evidence scenarios. We also examined the impact of heterogeneity and absence of evidence facilitating a first-order indirect comparison. Results: In all scenarios, extending the network increased the precision of the A versus B treatment effect. Under a fixed-effect model, the increase in precision was modest when the existing direct A versus B evidence was already strong and was substantial when the direct evidence was weak. Under a random-effects model, the gain in precision was lower when heterogeneity was high. When evidence is available for all first-order indirect comparisons, including second-order evidence has limited benefit for the precision of the A versus B estimate. This is interpreted as a ceiling effect!' Conclusions: Including additional evidence increases the precision of a focal treatment comparison of interest. Once the comparison of interest is connected to all others via first-order indirect evidence, there is no additional benefit in including higher order comparisons. This conclusion is generalizable to any number of treatment comparisons, which would then all be considered focal. The increase in precision is modest when direct evidence is already strong, or there is a high degree of heterogeneity.

We use administrative mental health care data of the total Dutch population from 2008 to 2010. We find an efficiency effect: on the flat part of the fee schedule providers reduce treatment duration by 2 to 7% compared to a control group. However, we also find unintended effects: providers treat patients longer to reach a next threshold and obtain a higher fee. The data shows gaps and bunches in the distribution function of treatment durations, just before and after a threshold.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of genetic and ECG screening strategies for the early detection of LQTS using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CRD databases between 2000 and 2013. A weighted version of Drummond checklist was instrumental in further assessing the quality of the included studies. Results: We identified four eligible articles. Among them, genetic testing in the early detection of LQTS was cost-effective compared with no testing in symptomatic cases and not cost-effective when compared with watchful waiting in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients with established LQTS although it reached cost-effectiveness in higher risk subgroups, whereas ECG testing in neonates was highly cost-effective when compared with any screening strategy. Conclusions: LQTS profiling and patients' stratification have the potential to improve the disease management. Because of the limited current knowledge in this field, the present review recommends to perform further cost-effectiveness evaluations of the genetic and ECG screening alternatives, especially within European health care systems, which are still not available in the literature on genetic testing.

Few studies have focused on what happens before initiation, the point from prescribing to dispensing of an initial prescription. Objective: Our objective was to provide guidance and encourage high-quality research on the relationship between beneficial outcomes and initial medication adherence (liVIA), the rate initially prescribed medication is dispensed. Methods: Using generic adherence terms, an international research panel identified IMA publications from 1966 to 2014. 'their data sources were classified as to whether the primary source reflected the perspective of a prescriber, patient, or pharmacist or a combined perspective. Terminology and methodological differences were documented among core (essential elements of presented and unpresented prescribing events and claimed and unclaimed dispensing events regardless of setting), supplemental (refined for accuracy), and contextual (setting specific) design parameters. Recommendations were made to encourage and guide future research. Results: The 45 1MA studies identified used multiple terms for 1MA and operationalized measurements differently. Primary data sources reflecting a prescriber's and pharmacist's perspective potentially misclassified core parameters more often with shorter/nonexistent pre- and postperiods (1-14 days) than did a combined perspective. Only a few studies addressed supplemental issues, and minimal contextual information was provided. Conclusions: General recommendations are to use IMA as the standard nomenclature, rigorously identify all data sources, and delineate all design parameters. Specific methodological recommendations include providing convincing evidence that initial prescribing and dispensing events are identified, supplemental parameters incorporating perspective and substitution biases are addressed, and contextual parameters are included.

Methods: Change from baseline scores was calculated, and treatment effects were analyzed using mixed models for repeated measures. Three separate models were then estimated to examine the association between the quality-of-life/utility end points and the clinical and other health outcome end points measured during the trials, including cognition, function, behavior, and dependence. Results: The performance of the two measures differed. Subject-assessed QOL-AD was found to be weakly associated with clinical measures of cognition, and with caregiver reports of function, behavior, and dependence, and showed little movement over time and did not appear to differ by baseline AD severity. Proxy-assessed QOL-AD scores were consistently lower than subject-assessed scores, and the level of decline in QOL-AD was greater using proxy assessed QOL-AD. Proxy assessed HUI-3 scores were more strongly associated with clinical measures of cognition, function, behavior, and dependence than the subject- and proxy-assessed QOL-AD scores. Larger proportionate changes over 78 weeks were observed with HU1-3 scores and greater separation in HU1-3 scores by baseline seventy. Conclusions: Subject-assessed QOL-AD is less likely than proxy assessed QOL-AD to respond to changes in clinical measures used to track progression in clinical trials of subjects with mild to moderate AD. Proxy-assessed HU1-3 assessments were more in line with other outcome assessments and could therefore be better outcome measures to evaluate clinical progression in mild to moderate AD.

This procedure considers approximating a multivariate regression function by an affine combination of one-dimensional marginal regression functions. The weight parameters involved in the approximation are estimated by least squares on the basis of the first-stage nonparametric kernel estimates of the marginal regressions. Under some mild conditions, we have established asymptotic normality for the estimated weights and the regression function in two cases: Case I considers that the number of the covariates is fixed while Case II allows the number of the covariates depending on the sample size and diverging. As the observations are assumed to be stationary and near epoch dependent, the approach developed is applicable to both the estimation and forecasting issues in time series analysis. Furthermore, the method and result are augmented by a simulation study and illustrated by an application in forecasting the high frequency volatility of the FTSE100 index. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This evidence is puzzling because there are no concurrent jumps in macroeconomic fundamentals. I estimate a confidence-risk model where agents use a constant gain specification to learn about the unobserved expected growth from the cross-section of signals. While consumption shocks are Gaussian, investors' uncertainty (confidence measure) is subject to jumps, which endogenously trigger jump risks in equity and option markets. The model provides a good fit to macroeconomic, equity, option, and forecast data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using comparable data from two countries with universal public LTC insurance, the Netherlands and Germany, we examine how institutional differences relate to differences in the choice for informal and formal LTC. Although the overall LTC utilization rate is similar in both countries, use of formal care is more prevalent in the Netherlands and informal care use in Germany. Decomposition of the between-country differences in formal and informal LTC use reveals that these differences are not chiefly the result of differences in population characteristics but mainly derive from differences in the effects of these characteristics that are associated with between-country institutional differences. These findings demonstrate that system features such as eligibility rules and coverage generosity and, indirectly, social preferences can influence the choice between formal and informal care. Less comprehensive coverage also has equity implications: for the poor, access to formal LTC is more difficult in Germany than in the Netherlands.

Our empirical framework is motivated by growing concerns in the literature regarding the reliability of inferences from portfolio-based methods. In our initial tests, we confirm the existence of several CAPM anomalies at the firm level. Prominent multifactor models deliver only a modest improvement, however, as they often resolve only those anomalies which are directly linked to their additional factors. Further results suggest that the economic importance of CAPM anomalies is overstated. We find that anomalies are primarily confined to small stocks, few characteristics are associated with CAPM alphas out of sample, and many firm characteristics do not contain unique information about abnormal returns.

Most prior work has focused on a null of equal accuracy in population basically, whether the additional coefficients of the larger model are zero. Our asymptotic approximation instead treats the coefficients as non-zero but small, such that, in a finite sample, forecasts from the small and large models are expected to be equally accurate. We derive the limiting distributions of tests of equal mean square error, and develop a bootstrap for inference. Simulations show that our procedures have good size and power properties.

By using this observation as its methodological point of departure, it shows that (i) a Bayes-Nash equilibrium (BNE) exists in a finite Bayesian game with private information if and only if a Nash equilibrium exists in the induced large game, and (ii) both Pareto-undominated and socially-maximal BNE exist in finite Bayesian games with private information. In particular, it shows these results to be a direct consequence of results for a version of a large game re-modeled for situations where different players may have different action sets.
