By using data provided by the World Input-Output Database, the water used in production, consumption and trade is quantified for 41 world regions between 1995 and 2008. Results show that global water use grew by 37.3%, with China, India and Brazil contributing most to that increase. China and India, together with the EU-27, were also responsible for the largest water footprint variations. In terms of trade, the EU-27 was the largest water importer and China and India the main water exporters. The results provided in this paper offer an overview of the main countries' responsibility for the use of water resources. They provide a good starting point for international debates and policies on sustainable water use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The success of liberalisation is based on smart regulation, which has been capable of providing solutions to unforeseen events in the process. Our paper seeks to contribute to existing understanding of the unexpected and collateral effects of the liberalisation process in the power system by examining a natural experiment that occurred in Spain in 2009. In that year, the electricity supply by distribution system operators disappeared. This change in retail market competition, as we demonstrate in this paper, has had an unexpected effect in terms of the system's balancing requirements.

While nodal pricing is implemented in Canada and some markets in the United States, European markets are split up into a limited number of price zones with uniform prices, in order to at least partially realize the benefits of regional price differentiation. Zonal boundaries often coincide with national borders, but some countries are also split into multiple zones. In this paper we shed light on possible negative welfare effects of market splitting that arise in a model where investment incentives in new generation capacity are taken into account if zones are misspecified. We show that standard approaches to configure price zones - on the basis of projected nodal price differences or congested transmission capacity - may fail to suggest reasonable zone specifications. Also an adjustment of Available Transfer Capacities (ATCs) between zones or a switch to flow-based market splitting does not ensure positive welfare effects. Our analysis suggests that a careful and detailed evaluation of the system is needed to ensure a reasonable zone configuration.

The Resilient Community and Livelihood Asset Integration Model (ReCLAIM) comprises six steps that focus on community assets and aspirations. The second of these steps is to determine the baseline carbon profiles of communities based on six sources of carbon emissions: materials, construction processes, stationary energy, transport, water systems and waste. The methodology employed an annualised lifecycle analysis of housing materials and construction, and an annual inventory of other emission sources. Profiles were calculated for two remote communities and compared to the Australian average and also average electricity consumption by remote communities in the Northern Territory. The results, expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO(2)-e), showed that average household carbon profiles of the two communities (6.3 and 4.1 tCO(2)-e/capita/yr) were generally lower than the Australian average (7.3 tCO(2)-e/capita/yr). The stationary energy results revealed that infrastructure and building design could raise fuel consumption and costs, and therefore carbon emissions, despite modest lifestyles. The carbon emission categories differed between the two communities highlighting the need for an individualised approach to understanding the drivers of carbon emissions and mitigation responses.

On the basis of the Indonesia Family Life Survey data set, we find that on average urban and rural households have the same willingness to pay for in-house piped water, that is, 34.24 per cent of their monthly house rent. For the 25 per cent urban and rural households with lowest expenditure, this percentage is equivalent to 9.41 per cent and 7.57 per cent of their monthly expenditure, respectively. The findings support a need for further investment in in-house piped water in both areas, particularly for the households with the lowest expenditure levels.","[Suparman, Yusep] Padjadjaran State Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Stat, Bandung, Indonesia; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Dept Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Folmer, Henk] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xianyang, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Oud, Johan H.

Firstly, two statistical properties of country risk ratings, volatility clustering and asymmetrical revision were identified in a theoretical framework based on Cruces (2006). Secondly, considering the oil price volatility, numerical experiments were conducted based on extended models to test and verify specific properties of country risk ratings in selected oil-exporting countries. Empirical results suggest that properties of country risk remain comparatively steady despite oil price volatility. It is also found that the oil price volatility can obviously exaggerate the country risk volatility, as it happened during 2007-2009. Country clustering based on the properties of country risk ratings shows that the selected countries maintain a significant clustering tendency. These features are of great importance for estimating risk exposure of international trade and investments in oil export during extreme situations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The notions of resistance and recoverability are used to examine these reactions. The analysis reveals both continuities and significant changes in the regional impact of recession from one economic cycle to the next. Further, while economic structure is found to have exerted some influence on the resistance and recoverability of certain regions, in general region-specific' or competitiveness' effects appear to have played an equally, if not more, significant role.","[Martin, Ron; Gardiner, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Gardiner, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Econometr, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Southampton; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk; p.j.sunley@soton.ac.uk; bg@camecon.com; pt23@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/1035811/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research for this paper formed part of a larger project on 'How Regions React to Recession: Resilience, Hysteresis and Long Run Impacts', funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [grant number ES/1035811/1], whose support is gratefully acknowledged.",,91,354,418,100,580,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The methodology deals with several important issues prevalent in policy and program evaluation, including application and approval stages, nonrandom treatment assignment, endogeneity, and discrete outcomes. This article presents a computationally efficient estimation algorithm and techniques for model comparison and treatment effects. The framework is applied to evaluate the effectiveness of bank recapitalization programs and their ability to resuscitate the financial system. The analysis of lender of last resort (LOLR) policies is not only complicated due to econometric challenges, but also because regulator data are not easily obtainable. Motivated by these difficulties, this article constructs a novel bank-level dataset and employs the new methodology to jointly model a bank's decision to apply for assistance, the LOLR's decision to approve or decline the assistance, and the bank's performance following the disbursements. The article offers practical estimation tools to unveil new answers to important regulatory and policy questions.","[Vossmeyer, Angela] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Vossmeyer, A (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",angela.vossmeyer@cmc.edu,,,All-UC Group in Economic History,All-UC Group in Economic History,"The author is greatly indebted to Ivan Jeliazkov and Gary Richardson for their invaluable guidance.

Although, Thailand promotes the use of biofuels, it has yet to achieve its policy targets. This paper focuses on the first generation biofuel development in Thailand and examines the perceptions of seven stakeholder groups to guide further policy development. These stakeholders were feedstock producers, biofuel producers, government agencies, car manufacturers, oil companies, non-profit organizations and end users. It combines a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework with an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework and a TOWS Matrix for analysis of stakeholder's perceptions to propose priorities for policy development. Five policies were of high priority for development of biofuel. These are: (1) promoting biofuel production and use in long term through government policies, (2) revising government regulations to allow sale of biofuel products to other domestic industries while keeping retail prices of blended biofuels below those of regular ethanol and biodiesel, (3) improving farm management and promoting contract farming, (4) expanding cultivation area and yield without affecting food production and environmental sustainability, and (5) balancing biofuel feedstock use between the food and energy industries.

In the light of this literature, this paper investigates the relationship between spatial distribution of skills in the year 2001 and district-wise employment growth between the years 2001 and 2011, for India. We argue that educational attainment as a measure of worker skills may not be appropriate for a developing country and take a different approach to measuring skills wherein a worker's skill is inferred from the occupation in which he/she is employed. We use district-wise data on occupational distribution of employment (from Census of India) along with the skill content of occupations (from a US-based dataset called O-NET) to measure regional skills. Using this measure, we model employment and population growth simultaneously and find a positive relationship between cognitive skills and employment growth. The results are robust across all the models that we employ. Our results suggest the presence of externalities associated with skilled people which is instrumental in increasing productivity and employment in skilled regions.","[Balasubramanian, Ishwarya] IGIDR, AK Vaidhya Marg,Goregaon East, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,"Balasubramanian, I (通讯作者)，IGIDR, AK Vaidhya Marg,Goregaon East, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",ishwarya@igidr.ac.in,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

To quantify time-varying environmental attitudes among local residents, we exploit geo-specific Google search-query data derived from Internet-based big data and verify through ordinary least squares regression outcomes regarding environmental behavior. For the purpose of drawing policy implications, we revisit decisions by state governments of the United States to adopt three well-known green electricity policies: renewable energy portfolio, net metering rules, and public benefit funds. As some states have not yet adopted some (or any) of these policies, unlike previous studies, we handle the issue by examining right-censored data and applying a duration-based econometric method called the accelerated failure time model. We found state residents' environmental attitudes to have statistically significant roles, after controlling for other traditional time-varying policy adoption factors. Interestingly, the extent to which anti-environmental attitudes affect a state's policy adoption differs across green energy policies, and knowing this can help a local government formulate better-tailored environmental policy. In particular, researchers can use our method of incorporating citizens' environmental attitudes to discuss relevant issues in the field of energy policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing restricted-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, our empirical results indicate that Blacks have higher PEA-usage rates than Whites, likely caused by their higher unemployment rates. However, Whites in regions with relatively weak professional networks tended to tap into PEAs more than otherwise similar Blacks, reducing the Black-White differential in PEA usage. These findings fit with the conceptual prediction that Whites endure a disproportionate negative impact when tighter labor markets (and thus fewer referrals) exist. They also raise the question about whether current anti-labor-market discrimination policies account for potential job-referral differentials between Black and Whites. To the extent that employers favor employee recommendations from members of a particular racial/ethnic group, then perhaps policy targeting discrimination in the workplace should consider how job openings are initially advertised and subsequently filled.","[Mora, Marie T.; Davila, Alberto; Boudreau, James] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, 1201 West Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Mora, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, 1201 West Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",Marie.Mora@utrgv.edu; Alberto.Davila@utrgv.edu; James.Boudreau@utrgv.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, the public regulatory status of electric power plants is found to have a strong influence on whether FGD investment is made. Compared to deregulated power plants, those that are still under rate-of-return regulations by Public Utility Commissions are more likely to install FGD. Second, a higher rate of inspections of polluting facilities (not just electric utility power plants) in a state in the previous year is associated with a higher probability of power plants adopting FGD this year. In addition, sulfur content of coal and plant size are both positively associated with the likelihood of FGD installation. The service length of boilers is negatively associated with the likelihood.

When different meanings are (un)intentionally juxtaposed in analyses of the agglomeration/network externalities-menagerie, researchers may reach inaccurate conclusions about how they interlock. Both externality types can be analytically combined, but only when one adopts a coherent approach to their conceptualization and operationalization, to which end we provide a combinatorial typology. We illustrate the typology by applying a state-of-the-art bipartite network projection detailing the presence of globalized producer services firms in cities in 2012. This leads to two one-mode graphs that can be validly interpreted as topological renderings of agglomeration and network externalities. Resumen La aglomeracion y las externalidades de red son conceptos difusos. Cuando en los analisis de la variedad de tipos de aglomeracion y externalidades de red se yuxtaponen diferentes significados intencionadamente (o inintencionadamente), los investigadores pueden llegar a conclusiones inexactas acerca de como se entrelazan. Ambos tipos de externalidades se pueden combinar analiticamente, pero solo cuando se adopta un enfoque coherente en su conceptualizacion e implementacion, para lo cual proporcionamos una tipologia combinatoria. La tipologia se ilustra mediante la aplicacion de una proyeccion de red bipartita vanguardista que detalla la presencia de las empresas de servicios de produccion globalizadas en ciudades en 2012.

A Heckman model is employed to correct for the zero observation problems and to estimate consistently the labour mobility with a modified gravity equation. Given the institutional barriers, the fiscal decentralization has two contending effects on labour market integration: local economic development promotes labour mobility, but local public goods crowding restrains the inflow of labour at the destination. The crowding effect is stronger at lower levels of government.","[Chen, Yiu Por (Vincent)] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Chen, YP (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ypchen@cityu.edu.hk,,"CHEN, Yiu Por/0000-0001-5921-1310",,,,,46,2,2,6,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The key value of biodiversity lies in its role in ensuring the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide services to humans and other living organisms that comprise them. For that reason, maintaining a sufficient degree of biodiversity is the key to the continued delivery of essential ecosystem services and the need to ensure the conservation of biological diversity is now widely accepted. In spite of this global sentiment, there is not a national or international convergence towards a framework to report to different stakeholders' groups the performance of organizations like protected areas and national parks, in terms of their biodiversity and the conservation activities they are achieving. After describing the concept of biodiversity, its value and the information needs of the community related to it, the main purpose of the paper is to propose a theoretical and systemic framework for its reporting by public sector organizations established for the protection of the natural capital, by means of some specific indicators deduced mainly by the literature concerning biological sciences.

With reference to the research results, sellers in digital shadow economy include the entities with officially registered activities, who are trying to evade taxation of the revenues earned from the operations in e-space. On the other hand, according to the experts, the amount of the officially accounted revenue earned by these entities may reach up to 300 EUR.

Specific ones are addressed to youth to access programs that are financing start-ups for bachelor degree graduates. There are also disadvantaged groups, as women, Romany, migrating, refugees, persons over 50, unemployed in rural areas, persons with disabilities that are interested in finding a source of income by starting their own business, but they are facing with limited knowledge, less self-confidence, lack of fund and not supportive attitude of the environment.

Knowing the barriers, that are considered by the studied group to be most important issue that are keeping them away, give us the opportunity to act on and to design tools for overcoming. After analyzing the results of a survey on the barriers and need of the targeted groups, it was designed a training program with two components: a training course and a mentoring to be tested on the target groups.

This study investigates the variation in the pre-enrollment load patterns of Korean commercial and industrial electricity customers and their impact on event-day loads during a critical peak pricing experiment in the winter of 2013. Contrary to conventional approaches to profiling electricity loads, this study proposes a new clustering technique based on variability indices that collectively represent the potential demand-response resource that these customers would supply. Our analysis reveals that variability in pre-enrollment load patterns does indeed have great predictive power for estimating their impact on demand-response loads. Customers in relatively low-variability clusters provided limited or no response, whereas customers in relatively high-variability clusters consistently presented large load impacts, accounting for most of the program-level peak reductions.

Then it can be concluded that Chinese sporting goods IPO enterprises are required to take full advantage of trade associations to vigorously conduct market researches, enlarge internal investments, pay ample attentions to avoid superfluous distribution and cutthroat competitions, implement going-out enterprise strategy, accelerate industrial upgrading and industrial transfer, increase investments in research and development, highlight brand marketing and strengthen enterprise competitiveness, providing component departments with sufficient evidence to make macro decisions. In January, 2010, with China-ASEAN Free Trade Area co-established by China and ten countries from ASEAN, all member countries are available to zero-tariff free trade, in other words, all countries within this area have gotten rid of their own threshold and products and capitals from these countries can be imported and exported free of barriers, which vitalizes ASEAN trade. In addition, with 1.7 billion costumers and a total trade volume of 1.23 trillion dollars, this free trade area proves to enjoy the largest population and area all over the world. With constant trade liberalization and broad cooperations in economy and technology, Chinese sporting goods enterprises will surely embrace precious opportunities and severe challenges. On one hand, abundant natural resources and cheap labor resources from ASEAN countries will bring Chinese sporting goods enterprises with considerable convenience and huge business opportunities to implement multinational capital, goods and labor service exchanges within the area. On the other hand, since Chinese sporting goods industry turns out to share more and more similarities with that of ASEAN countries in industrial structure and product mix, narrow complementary business spectrum exists. Besides sporting goods business accounts for a small proportion in the total volume of bilateral trade. Therefore it is imperative for Chinese sporting goods enterprises to figure out how to make the best of their own resources and advantages, reinforce complementariness of product mix and industrial trade with ASEAN and occupy the ASEAN market as soon as possible.","[Jie, Fu] Zhengzhou Finance & Econ Coll Sports Success, Zhengzhou 451200, Peoples R China",,"Jie, F (通讯作者)，Zhengzhou Finance & Econ Coll Sports Success, Zhengzhou 451200, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-288-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,87.0,,,,,,1095,1099,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8WB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392733200226,0

We investigate the role of freshwater inputs on the blue crab fishery in Georgia, USA. Blue crabs are known to respond to salinity changes in the estuaries in which they reside, and declining freshwater flow to the coast over the last 50 years is correlated with increases in average estuarine salinity and falling commercial harvests. A structural, bioeconomic model reveals freshwater inputs have significant effects on fishery outcomes. Simulations of a counterfactual minimum-flow standard for three different rivers, set at 25% of 50-year averages, suggest such a policy would result in measurable benefits for the fishery, improving profits by 35% ($1.7 million) during the period 2002-2012 in the three fishing areas for which data were available.

To evaluate the effects of particular factors and explore the beliefs and expectations that influence food consumption, we applied the qualitative research methods with focus groups aiming to provide an in-depth, complex understanding of how seniors see and interpret their satisfaction. The qualitative analytical approach chosen in our research was thematic content analysis. The purpose of employing focus groups lies in selecting information-rich cases for study in depth. Sampling design therefore was more purposive rather than random. The research questions posed by the research have arisen out of the need to gain insight into aspects of seniors' consumption behaviour. The findings from group interviews were supported by the results from a questionnaire. From a retail management and marketing point of view our findings call for a stronger consideration of seniors' customer segment in food offerings and store layout. Both qualitative and quantitative results revealed that age dimensions influence perceptions and behaviour related to food consumption.","[Lesakova, Dagmar] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Mkt, Dolnozemska Rd 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lesakova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Mkt, Dolnozemska Rd 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",lesakova@euba.sk,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,8,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,783,791,,10.15414/isd2016.s10.03,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500095,0

It will undoubtedly influence the petroleum fiscal policies and practices of petroleum producing countries. The methodology used involved a review of literature to identify factors that enhance the attractiveness of petroleum fiscal regimes; deploying experts to validate the appropriateness of the identified factors; conducting exploratory factor analysis and evaluating the internal consistency reliability of the construct's dimensions; performing confirmatory analysis for convergence and discriminant validity of the dimensions; and computing model fit indices to evaluate the goodness of fit of the four-factor correlated attractiveness petroleum fiscal regime scale. The results obtained suggest that a credible and manageable scale for assessing the attractiveness of petroleum fiscal regimes can be readily constructed.

They also turned from the passive clients into a well-informed in the market offer consumers. The increase of knowledge and consumers awareness is the result of the rapid development of technology, in particular common access to the Internet. Consumers also engage themselves in cooperation with the producers. Active attitude of the consumers to co-creation of the market offer nowadays is defined as the phenomenon of prosumption. Consumers, previously passive recipients of the product manufactured by the company, take over part of the product development process on themselves. On the other hand, producers through communication with consumers, encourage them to introduce their ideas. An important aspect of accompanying these relations is a partnership cooperation.","[Matysik-Pejas, Renata; Szafranska, Monika; Krasnodebski, Andrzej] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Enterprises Management, Al Mickiewicza 21, Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Matysik-Pejas, R (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Enterprises Management, Al Mickiewicza 21, Krakow, Poland.",rrmatysi@cyf-kr.edu.pl; m.szafranska@ur.krakow.pl; rrkrasno@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"shah, hamad/L-1358-2017","Matysik-Pejas, Renata/0000-0003-3485-0970",,,,,21,1,1,1,17,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,812,819,,10.15414/isd2016.s10.06,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500098,0

Especially in time of the current Global Financial Crisis. Poland and other member states from Central and Eastern Europe can learn much from the case of Spain and Portugal because their situation today is comparable to these countries situation 30 years ago. Similarly, Poland and it's neighbours has a huge amount of unsolved problems in primary sector and try to solve them with community structural aid. Large part of lands located in studied area is characterized by a low level of development and dependence of production in the first sector. The rapid pace of growth limits a traditional employment structure in which agriculture plays a very important role. The results of investigation are presenting that last thirty years have brought positive changes manifested in evolution of employment and participation structure in Mediterranean countries. In spite of substantial dynamics of positive changes and the three decades passage during integration of the countries analysed, the situation is still complicated. The low level of economic development, structural problems, dramatic situation of public finances and the labour market, resulting from the global financial crisis, cause that those countries, without the help of EU would face on edge of a precipice.","[Piecuch, Jakub; Niewiadomski, Michal] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Adama Mickiewicza Alley 21, Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Piecuch, J (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Adama Mickiewicza Alley 21, Krakow, Poland.",j.piecuch@ur.krakow.pl; michal@niewiadomski.li,,"Niewiadomski, Michal Radoslaw/0000-0002-3129-3331",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,62,67,,10.15414/isd2016.s1.05,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500006,0

Low patient compliance with prescribed therapeutic plan is very common in both ambulatory practice and clinical trials. Non-adherence of subjects in clinical studies can seriously jeopardize validity of results obtained during randomized clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS: Both systematic literature review and cross-sectional survey were conducted among physicians and patients to determine evaluation of therapy adherence by both groups. RESULTS: According to the analytical reviews in published articles, the most common definition of therapy adherence or compliance is the ability and willingness of patients to abide to a prescribed therapeutic regimen. There is a strong correlation between patient adherence to the therapeutic regimen determined by the study protocol of RCTs, and the validity of efficacy and safety evaluation of the investigated medicinal product. Analysis of the results from the conducted survey lead to the conclusion tha t 35% of physician's state that the results of ongoing therapy are highly dependent on patient compliance. As far as patients are concerned, almost half of the respondents have answered they comply with the prescribed therapy and would evaluate the treatme nt process as successful. Both patients and medical professionals declare their willingness to participate in clinical trials and strictly stick to the requirements of the study protocol. CONCLUSION: These results decisively confirmed that the control of a disease is a bilateral process between the patient and the doctor. Patient satisfaction with their current therapy directly correlates with the results of treatment.

The purpose of this simple web-based application is to assist dairy farms managers to better understand the dynamics of the dairy herd structure and to improve economically sensible decision-making abilities in Slovak conditions. The application firstly helps dairy farmers to calculate the potential production and economic impact of different scenarios at the farm-level, in the terms of alternative what-if analyses comparison. Secondly, it takes into account the farm specific characteristics, unique limitations or weaknesses. The versatility of the core application offers potential use in numerous areas including optimal replacement heifer management or feeding strategies evaluation. When heifers calve at ages greater than optimum, larger inventories of heifers must be maintained in the young female bovine herd. Increasing the age at calving also increases the generation interval, delaying the introduction of genetically superior replacements in the herd. If the annual replacement rate of first lactation cow in the EkonMOD milk tool is set to 35%, and 25 % for remaining stages of lactations in a 300 head herd, a minimum of 170 heifers are needed in the pool, assuming a 4% attrition factor for stillbirths, 100 % dairy cow natality, 5 % mortality of calves. With selection of calves indicator set to 4 %, 50 % ratio of heifers born, heifer selection at 20 %, culled cows that die before disposal set to the value of 20 %, approximately 64 pregnant heifers are needed. For every one month increase in the age at calving over 24 months, the replacement inventory numbers are increasing at a rate of 4.7% in this model. This figure takes into account the inventory of heifers from birth until calving.","[Zahradnik, Miroslav; Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Záhradnik, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",xzahradnikm@is.uniag.sk; jpokrivcak@yahoo.com,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Záhradník, Miroslav/AAD-4451-2019","Záhradník, Miroslav/0000-0002-1377-8415",,,,,19,1,1,2,4,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,1002,1008,,10.15414/isd2016.s12.12,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500118,0

One community was Alice Springs, a town with about 9000 households in the geographic centre of Australia. The programme offered a package of support: free energy audits, discounts for the purchase of renewable energy technology and energy efficiency measures, and ongoing information. Households that adopted solar hot water and photovoltaic systems reduced their electricity usage immediately after adoption by 10% and 34% respectively, and this was maintained in the long term. A small rebound effect of 15% was observed in the photovoltaic adopters. It was observed that, on average, households that adopted only energy efficiency measures did not have a significant reduction in their electricity usage over the long term. However, consistent with expectations, this study did show that there was a significant correlation between the number of energy efficiency measures adopted and the greatest household reduction in electricity usage. These contrary results indicate that there are additional factors involved. The connection between the effective use of measures, coincident behavioural change or increased energy awareness and greater energy reduction is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In Europe, this task is shared between Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) and Transmission System Operators (TSOs). For this purpose, the European electricity sector consists of several markets. Objective of this paper is to investigate distorted incentives that stem from loopholes in the market design which BRPs can use to undermine electricity balancing principles in favour of gaming opportunities between the domestic imbalance energy pricing and international wholesale markets. These incentives are evaluated using historical data from the Swiss power system which features a typical European imbalance pricing mechanism. The results imply that little effort would have been needed to make a good profit at the expense of system security. The major loophole arises from the interdependence between cross-border trading and national imbalance energy pricing. Bearing in mind the European Union's Third Energy Package, the importance of national balancing mechanisms will increase strongly. In this context, national remedies to cope with distorted incentives are outlined and the importance of harmonising balancing markets on an international level is elaborated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical results indicate that carbon multipliers of provinces under these principles are significantly different from one another. The carbon multipliers of provinces with higher ratios of carbon intensive sectors in their outputs are also larger. At the same time, the carbon multipliers of the same sector in the provinces are significantly different from one another. Changing the principle causes significant changes in the responsibility for carbon emissions of some provinces, but only slight changes in the responsibilities of some other provinces. However, the responsibilities of provinces with large economic sizes (output) are always the largest, whereas provinces with the smallest economic sizes are always the smallest regardless of the principles. Further, this study proposes a series of regional policies for carbon mitigation according to provincial carbon multipliers and responsibility allocation features under the different principles.

China has designed several allocation rules within seven pilot regions. What influence those rules may cause is closely related with the enthusiasm of emission trading scheme (ETS) covered enterprises' participation in carbon market, and more importantly, with the mechanism design and sustainable development of carbon market. For this purpose, the multi-stage profit model is developed to analyze the ETS-covered enterprises' product prices and emission reduction behaviors under different allocation rules. The results show that, first, under the rules of grandfathering, self-declaration and auctioning, when deciding the optimal product price and optimal carbon emission reduction, those enterprises may focus on maximizing current stage profit; however, under the rule of benchmarking, those enterprises may care more about the impact of current decisions on the profit in next stage. Second, the optimal product price policy is positively correlated with the price of the same kind products, consumers' low-carbon awareness and government subsidy. Finally, along with the increase of carbon price, consumers' low-carbon awareness and government subsidy and the decrease of carbon emission cap, those enterprises tend to reduce carbon emissions.

Quarterly numbers of overnight stays are disaggregated by trip purpose. Seasonality in vacation tourism to Scotland is shown to be defined by more than a simple rural-urban division. Overseas visiting friends and relatives (VFR) tourism is largely an urban phenomenon and is consequently less seasonal than vacation tourism. Lower seasonal concentration of VFR tourism is not uniform across the regions. Although levels of seasonal intensity of business tourism to the three principal cities of Scotland are approximately the same, there are noticeable variations over time.","[Coshall, John; Charlesworth, Richard] London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, Div Tourism, London N7 8HN, England; [Page, Stephen J.] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Tourism, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",London Metropolitan University; Bournemouth University,"Coshall, J (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, London Metropolitan Business Sch, Div Tourism, Stapleton House,277-281 Holloway Rd, London N7 8HN, England.",coshallj@sky.com; r.charlesworth@londonmet.ac.uk; s.page@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Page, Stephen W./AAX-2920-2021","Page, Stephen W./0000-0001-5312-2149; page, stephen/0000-0002-1756-4561",,,,,61,32,33,2,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Factors affecting regional productivity and innovation in Israel: some empirical evidence, Regional Studies. The role of human capital and physical capital in determining regional productivity and innovation is examined. Two specific mechanisms through which knowledge becomes an inherently regional asset are investigated: the generation of local externalities (a stock mechanism) and human capital accumulation and mobility (a flow mechanism). Empirically, this connection is investigated using recent advances in spatial panel data analysis applied to regions in Israel. Panel co-integration is used to entangle issues of spurious relationships. Results show that human capital stock has large and relatively consistent effects on both regional earnings and regional innovation levels. Human capital mobility is inversely related to innovation. This is interpreted as reflecting the conduit' role of the region in the innovation process. Regional capital-to-labour ratios are also inversely related to innovation, implying that physical capital substitutes rather than complements human capital.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Felsenstein, D (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",msdfels@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Felsenstein, Daniel/JME-1462-2023",,,,,,51,14,14,2,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, not all building uses provide the same opportunities for technology uptake as others. Care homes for older people have characteristics which in technical and economic terms suggest that they might be particularly appropriate for the implementation of more sustainable thermal technologies. They have comparatively high demands for space heating and hot water often sustained on a 24/7 basis. However there are many considerations, both generic and contextual, that will typically play into processes of technology uptake. Through qualitative research in six case study homes, focused on management and staff perspectives and experiences, we explore the degree to which there might be a productive alignment between care home operation and the use of sustainable thermal technologies. Two key themes emerge focused on business considerations and the importance of avoiding risk and damage to reputation; and the ways in which different thermal technologies are relevant to and can potentially impact on care practices. We conclude that despite potential benefits the sector could remain rather resistant to sustainability innovations. We suggest therefore areas in which productive action and further research could be undertaken.

The car industry is already marketing low carbon emitting technologies to adjust to the 95 gCO(2)/km target set for 2020. An alternative policy option is setting energy efficiency standards, measured as energy consumption per kilometre. A policy based on a long-term commitment on continuously decreasing standards and the choice of the focus between CO2 or energy efficiency will strongly influence car technology choice. The aim of this paper is to assess these candidate policies for the EU in terms of effectiveness, costs and emission implications until 2050 on the basis of scenarios quantified using the PRIMES-TREMOVE energy economic transport model. The scenarios assume various configurations of the standards and the assessment draws on comparisons to a Reference scenario which does not strengthen standards after 2025. The analysis shows that restructuring the EU car fleet towards significant reductions of energy consumption and CO2 emissions is affordable provided that preconditions are met regarding technology progress and development of refuelling/recharging infrastructure. CO2 standards allow a diversified use of technologies, while efficiency standards are more risky favouring a single technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They also arise in censored count data, where the highest category might create an additional mode. Modeling bimodal behavior in discrete data is useful for various purposes, from comparing shapes of different samples (or survey questions) to predicting future ratings by new raters. The Poisson distribution is the most common distribution for fitting count data and can be modified to achieve mixtures of truncated Poisson distributions. However, it is suitable only for modeling equidispersed distributions and is limited in its ability to capture bimodality. The Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution is a two-parameter generalization of the Poisson distribution that allows for over- and underdispersion. In this work, we propose a mixture of CMPs for capturing a wide range of truncated discrete data, which can exhibit unimodal and bimodal behavior. We present methods for estimating the parameters of a mixture of two CMP distributions using an EM approach. Our approach introduces a special two-step optimization within the M step to estimate multiple parameters. We examine computational and theoretical issues. The methods are illustrated for modeling ordered rating data as well as truncated count data, using simulated and real examples.","[Sur, Pragya; Bose, Smarajit; Dubey, Paromita] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata 700108, India; [Shmueli, Galit] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Serv Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; National Tsing Hua University,"Sur, P (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata 700108, India.",pragya1386@gmail.com; galit.shmueli@iss.nthu.edu.tw; smarajit@isical.ac.in; paromitadubey@gmail.com,"Shmueli, Galit/F-8847-2013","Shmueli, Galit/0000-0002-0820-0301",,,,,11,19,22,0,10,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The initiative has proved effective in its first phase, which has been developed through the extension of the grid. Yet, there are still important challenges to provide the service to inhabitants of remote areas in the Brazilian Amazon. We identify these challenges within institutional, technology, and funding structures operating within LPT. In line with these challenges, we propose a pathway to facilitate the achievement of universal electricity access in remote areas of the region. The proposed pathway is based on three key leverage points: (i) rules guiding the relationship among new agents and communities; (ii) the implementation of small-scale power generation technologies based on local resources; and (iii) optimized subsidies. It has the potential to allow (i) a better dimensioning of off-grid solutions considering local resources and realities, (ii) the creation of adapted institutions capable of implementing and operating the required systems and, (iii) an effective operation of off-grid solutions.

Two key explanations (place-making and trust-building) for host community responses are identified from the substantial social science literature investigating local community reaction to wind farms. The relationship between these two key factors and policy choices is explored through a comparative case study of five wind farms during a time of major policy change in Ontario, Canada. These five wind projects are all located within a 50 km of each other but are built under different policy regimes, with different ownership arrangements and are of different sizes. They provide a basis to assess the impact of three specific policy elements - approval authority, community benefit arrangements and spatial restrictions of turbine placement - on the place-making and trust-building potential of wind projects in the host communities. We identify a wide range of interactions and conclude that the policy choice to elevate project approval to a central authority has had the most damaging effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the impressive amount of value that is being realized by Big Data technologies in other parts of the marketplace, however, much of the data collected within the oil and gas sector tends to be discarded, ignored, or analyzed in a very cursory way. This viewpoint examines existing data management practices in the upstream oil and gas industry, and compares them to practices and philosophies that have emerged in organizations that are leading the way in Big Data. The comparison shows that, in companies that are widely considered to be leaders in Big Data analytics, data is regarded as a valuable asset-but this is usually not true within the oil and gas industry insofar as data is frequently regarded there as descriptive information about a physical asset rather than something that is valuable in and of itself. The paper then discusses how the industry could potentially extract more value from data, and concludes with a series of policy-related questions to this end. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, identifying and alleviating all barriers that hinder the development of RES is necessary to the successful deployment of these technologies. This paper discusses the main barriers in the diffusion of wind and photovoltaic (PV) solar power in the Greek electricity sector by drawing on the literature of technological innovation systems and system functions. Furthermore, we provide an explanation of the different diffusion rates between the two technologies. Inadequate financial resources, low grid capacity, delays in the issuance of building permits, opposition from local communities to the construction of wind farms and the lack of a stable institutional framework are among the most important barriers that inhibit the diffusion of the wind and PV solar power. The nature of the barriers identified in this study calls for policy intervention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Regression analysis is used to uncover the link between funds and territorial disadvantage for the 1994-2013 period. The analysis reveals that both coordination and compatibility with territorial cohesion have not always improved in response to major policy reforms.

The specialization in knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) across Europe: permanent co-localization to debate, Regional Studies. Knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) have traditionally been said to require the establishment of face-to-face contacts in the transmission of the knowledge-based intermediate inputs they provide, which accordingly influence their localization patterns. However, the search of geographical proximity amongst economics actors implies less and less the need to localize near each other. The study tests this using Eurostat data on regional specialization in KIBS for 230 NUTS-2 regions from eighteen European countries for the period 2000-2007. The findings of the estimated spatial autoregressive (SAR) models suggest how the nodes of transport and communication networks may be relaxing the need of KIBS for permanent co-localization.","[Gallego, Jorge] Univ Alcala, Dept Econ & Business, E-28802 Madrid, Spain; [Maroto, Andres] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Gallego, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Dept Econ & Business, Plaza Victoria,R-0-17, E-28802 Madrid, Spain.",jorge.gallegom@uah.es; andres.maroto@uam.es,"MAROTO SANCHEZ, ANDRES/E-8776-2013; GALLEGO, JORGE/M-1970-2014","MAROTO SANCHEZ, ANDRES/0000-0002-6067-968X; GALLEGO, JORGE/0000-0003-2363-1596",,,,,92,36,38,1,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Building on a new estimation of regional gross domestic product (GDP) from 1860 to 2000, this paper evaluates the long-run evolution of regional income inequality in Spain. It is found that sustained economic growth and the progressive integration of national markets have been accompanied by an inverted 'U'-shaped evolution of regional income inequality. Regional inequality in income per worker rose during the second half of the nineteenth century, peaked in the year 1900 and decreased over the following ninety years. Since 1990, together with the exhaustion of the convergence in regional productive structures, Spain's membership in the European Union generated a new upsurge of differences in labour productivity across the country that could be the basis for a new phase of regional income divergence.","[Martinez-Galarraga, Julio; Tirado, Daniel A.] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Roses, Joan R.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Hist Econ & Inst, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Roses, Joan R.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Figuerola, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",University of Valencia; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Martínez-Galarraga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Edifici Dept Oriental,Av Tarongers S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",julio.martinez-galarraga@uv.es; jroses@clio.uc3m.es; daniel.tirado@uv.es,"Martinez-Galarraga, Julio/AGM-6337-2022; Roses, Joan/K-5475-2013; Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A./Z-5854-2019","Martinez-Galarraga, Julio/0000-0002-3876-3121; Roses, Joan/0000-0003-0661-3134; Tirado-Fabregat, Daniel A./0000-0002-7717-2674",,,,,72,38,41,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Results show that, consistent with the ERM, the region loses entrepreneurs. However, importantly, out-migrants from the South East are more likely to exit subsequently from self-employment relative to other UK internal migrants. Despite its economic functions, the South East is no more likely to attract (would-be) self-employed entrepreneurs than other regions.

Results across several preference scenarios indicate that biopower and geothermal (flash and binary) currently score highest in sustainability for the US. Other renewable energy technologies generally offer substantial sustainability improvements over fossil fuel or nuclear technologies, and nuclear is preferable to fossil fuels in most scenarios. The relatively low ranking of natural gas combined cycle in most preference scenarios should encourage caution in adopting NGCC as a bridge to renewables. Although NGCC ranks high under economic and technical preference scenarios, renewables actually rank higher in both scenarios (hydro - economic; geothermal and biopower - technical).

The equilibrium unemployment rate depends on institutional labour market institutions through mark-up coefficients. Compared with existing studies, the resulting final equation for unemployment has a richer dynamic structure. The empirical investigation is conducted in a panel data framework and uses OECD data up to 2012. We propose to extend the standard estimation method with time dummies to control and capture the effects of common and national shocks by using impulse indicator saturation (WG-IIS), which has not been previously used on panel data. WG-IIS robustifies the estimators of the regression coefficients in the dynamic model, and it affects the estimated equilibrium unemployment rates. We find that wage co-ordination stands out as the most important institutional variable in our data set, but there is also evidence pointing to the tax wedge and the degree of compensation in the unemployment insurance system as drivers of equilibrium unemployment.","[Nymoen, Ragnar] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Sparrman, Victoria] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; Statistics Norway,"Nymoen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",ragnar.nymoen@econ.uio.no; victoria.sparrman@ssb.no,,,,,,,32,10,10,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

This paper summarizes the status of China's fuel quality standards, fuel supply and vehicle emission standards focusing on the major problems of fuel quality management. The mechanism that China uses to establish its fuel quality standards is outlined. The gaming of stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, vehicle and engine manufacturers and the gigantic state-owned oil companies in the development of fuel quality standard formulation and fuel supply is illustrated. Results are presented from testing 59 gasoline samples for sulphur, olefins, aromatics, benzene, and manganese content and from testing 59 diesel samples for sulphur and polyaromatic hydrocarbons collected across the country from 2010 to 2011. This paper also provides key policy suggestions to improve future fuel quality in China. China should improve fuel quality through the application of policy measures such as adjusting the fuel quality standard formulation process, introducing competition and enforcing the transition period for improved fuel introduction, unifying on-road diesel and non-road diesel fuel quality standards, and pay attention to issues like fuel detergent, methanol addition and evaporative emissions.

In recent years, research has increasingly underlined the potential for sustainable innovation of community-led bottom-up actions but has at the same time underestimated their potential impact on the governance of energy systems. Based on a strategic action field framework (SAF), this paper analyses the conflicts over the remunicipalisation of Berlin's electricity grid and investigates the creation and strategic development of two grassroots initiatives as well as their interaction with the local government and the established grid operator. We argue that grassroots initiatives have an important impact on the local energy system, not just through their influence on the implementation of local energy policy but above all by their framing of a specific vision of a local energy transition. The paper discusses the scope and limits of such initiatives in an urban context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to measure distance, institutional, language and technological barrier effects that may hamper collaborative activities between European regions. Particular emphasis is laid on measuring discrepancies between two types of collaborative R&D activities, those generating output in terms of scientific publications and those that do not. The study area is composed of 255 NUTS-2 regions that cover the pre-2007 member states of the European Union (excluding Malta and Cyprus) as well as Norway and Switzerland. We employ a negative binomial spatial interaction model specification to address the research question, along with an eigenvector spatial filtering technique suggested by Fischer and Griffith (2008) to account for the presence of network autocorrelation in the origin-destination cooperation data. The study provides evidence that the role of geographical distance as collaborative deterrent is significantly lower if collaborations generate scientific output. Institutional barriers do not play a significant role for collaborations with scientific output. Language and technological barriers are smaller but the estimates indicate no significant discrepancies between the two types of collaborative R&D activities that are in focus of this study.","[de Clairfontaine, Aurelien Fichet; Fischer, Manfred M.] Vienna Univ Econ andBusiness WU, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Lata, Rafael] Austrian Res Promot Agcy FFG, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Paier, Manfred] AIT, A-1220 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"de Clairfontaine, AF (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ andBusiness WU, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",afichet@wu.ac.at,"Fischer, Manfred/G-5960-2017","Fischer, Manfred/0000-0002-0033-2510; Paier, Manfred/0000-0002-4648-4819",,,,,32,9,10,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In a negative binomial regression analysis, the effects of natural and cultural amenities, the research milieu, human capital, local per capita income, industrial diversity, tolerance, and other factors are tested against the US county-level distribution of independent inventors. Statistically significant estimates are found for natural amenities, human capital, research universities and county population.

Our empirical evidence based on a sample of 24 OECD countries over the period 1984 to 2006 lends a measure of support to this idea.

The main objective of the research was to apply Poisson regression on flood occurrence as the dependent variable. The set of explanatory variables under consideration was tested and subsequently the final model was determined. Poisson regression model, which is a generalized linear model, was chosen as a computing model. Using it guarantees consistent results when working with variables with non-normal data distribution (skewed and discrete). Thus OLS estimator cannot work and is replaced by MLE estimator. Consequently, confidence intervals of estimated parameters and all model results can be received. The research resulted in selecting the Poisson regression model with an estimated and significant parameter. Moreover, sample sets of selected countries were compared and evaluated in terms of overall intensity of flood occurrence. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The importance and role of the competitions considered herein are measured on the basis of sports considerations as well as on their financial indicators, as part of UEFA's budget, the highest forum that governs the entire European football phenomena from an administrative, financial and control perspective. Of course, football is not just a sport anymore. It has held for several years an important place in the current overall mechanisms of socio-economic life. As such, this entire framework dominated by economics is not complete without the current legislative, political, social or cultural conditions (globalization, audiences, sponsors, supporters, social media). Although in some cases it is difficult to make a proper inventory, such elements make up the profile of the true world phenomena. In this context, this paper analyses the implications of the introduction by UEFA of a new licensing and regulation framework Financial Fair Play and the benefits and disadvantages of this program for all parties involved in the football business at European level.

As part of the study Integrated Modelling Assessment (IMS) was developed by establishing functional links between hydrological model Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), agricultural crop simulation model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) and regional climate model Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS). Database pertaining to climatic parameters, hydrological and agro-meteorological inputs to run integrated assessment systems are synthesized to run the model for study area. The model in general aim at major driver of this study is HadRM3 (Hadley Centre third generation regional climate model)-The Hadley Center Regional Climate Models resolution, which is 0.44 degrees x 0.44 degrees (approx. 50 km cell-size) on ground covering an average size of typical Indian districts/sub-basins. For regional levels the results are obtained by aggregating from the sub-basin/district level. The assessment will include the following components: (1) Baseline climatology, (2) Under global warning HadRM3 derived climate change scenarios, (3) Water Resources (Hydrological) analysis including irrigation water, and (4) agro-meteorological analysis including soil-water regime, plant growth and cropping pattern. Overall in Pennar region results revealed that the mean annual flows in the river system would increase by 8 % in A2 and 4 % in B2 whereas, increase in evapotranspiration losses were found to be about 10 % in A2 and 12 % in B2. Impacts on crop yields is the combined effect of increased surface temperatures, decreased rainfall and higher ambient atmospheric CO2. Three rain-fed crops (Groundnut, Sorghum, Sunflower) show decreased yields under A2, whereas B2 seemed to be relatively better than A2. The decrease is significant for groundnut (-38 % for A2 and -20 % for B2), but compared to groundnut impact were less detrimental for other two rain-fed crops (Sorghum and Sunflower). Rice being an irrigated crop in the region showed decrease in yield by -15 and -7 % for A2 and B2 scenarios respectively. Negative simulated crop yields in the region are predominantly due to increased surface temperatures in the future climate change scenarios.","[Gummadi, Sridhar; Rao, K. P.

At this time in Russia favouritism and nepotism were practically not analyzed as an organizational phenomenon. Traditionally they were considered to be sociocultural phenomena and were mainly studied by historians, political analysts, sociologists and psychologists. In this regard a lot of undiscovered issues of the reasons, consequences and ways to counterstand these trends in an organization have been recently brought up. These are those vital problems the given article is devoted to. The social and economic situation in today's Russia predetermines opportunities for favouritism and nepotism's intensive development. The formal institution's acceptable confidence level and the level of interpersonal credibility in Russia are very low what certainly brings to well-being of various unofficial institutions giving rise to favouritism and nepotism and hence, corruption at all levels of governance. The present article illustrates that just nepotism quite often creates opportunities for simulation of superior positions and even the whole departments for close relatives what inevitably brings about organizational effectiveness degrading.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has recently gained popularity as a new approach to integrate business applications in banking sector in order to attain the integration, flexibility and efficiency to succeed in this complex business environment. The aim of this paper is to propose an E-Financial Assistant (EFA) system, an information system that acts as an intermediary between individuals and specialized information systems exposed by banks and financial institutions, which can be easily integrated with other banking systems. The solution helps understand the way the adoption of SOA in E-Banking can create an open and collaborative environment, with low costs and efficient service management.","[Turkes, Mirela] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Raicu, Irina; Rusaneanu, Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Raicu, Irina] Univ Paris 01, CRI, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Turkes, M (通讯作者)，Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",mirela.turkes@ucdc.ro; irina.raicu@ie.ase.ro; rusaneanu_alexandra@yahoo.com,"Mirela Catalina, Turkes/X-5172-2019","Mirela Catalina, Turkes/0000-0002-1556-3258",,,,,3,0,0,0,1,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,250,255,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BD6ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362796900041,0

The findings show that adopting BIM diverts firms away from successful innovation (i.e., in terms of new products/services and new processes in the past three years), and instead is associated with undertaking innovation-related activities while remaining non-innovators. Indeed, reinforcing BIM (through greater depth' of use) may lead to further exclusion from successful innovation.","[Harris, Richard] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [McAdam, Rodney] Univ Ulster, Sch Business, Belfast BT37 0QB, Antrim, North Ireland; [Reid, Renee] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Business, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Durham University; Ulster University; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Harris, R (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",r.i.d.harris@durham.ac.uk,"McAdam, Rodney/Q-5586-2016","Harris, Richard/0000-0001-8066-3629; McAdam, Rodney/0000-0001-5503-3385",,,,,85,3,5,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Therefore, the L2-norm type of regularization is proposed to implement the 2SLS estimation for addressing the weak instrument problem. The L2-norm regularization with a regularized parameter O(n) allows us to obtain the Rothenberg (1984) type of higher-order approximation of the 2SLS estimator in the weak instrument asymptotic framework. The proposed regularized parameter yields the regularized concentration parameter O(n), which is used as a standardized factor in the higher-order approximation. We also show that the proposed L2-norm regularization consequently reduces the finite sample bias. A number of existing estimators that address finite sample bias in the presence of weak instruments, especially Fuller's limited information maximum likelihood estimator, are compared with our proposed estimator in a simple Monte Carlo exercise.","[Kim, Namhyun] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Pohlmeier, Winfried] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Exeter; University of Konstanz,"Kim, N (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter, Devon, England.",n.kim@exeter.ac.uk; winfried.pohlmeier@uni-konstanz.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1882],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through research unit FOR 1882 \ Psychoeconomics' is gratefully acknowledged.

But invisible to the state's view of coal running the nation, are roles played by this commodity in the livelihoods of millions of poor who live on the coal tracts of the country. In this paper, I argue that there are four coal economies with yet another one lurking within or following behind as a shadow in India. Each of these economies has different meanings of coal to those who are involved in the economy, producing the'diverse worlds' of coal. To substantiate my argument, I critically analyse official and field-based primary data within a'diverse economies framework' to present the intricate interlinkages among these worlds. I show that the multiple coal worlds are neither tiered in a hierarchical manner, nor'parallel' in the sense of dualism implied in a simplified formal-informal dichotomy. Rather, these worlds of coal have different actors, and their domains are ruled by different norms and values about the qualities of coal as a material commodity; yet they overlap and intersect with each other through their complex labour regimes.

By estimating a model of urban productivity that incorporates agglomeration of manufacturing, KIBS and non-KIBS using city-level data from China, we find that KIBS agglomeration is an important source of aggregate urban productivity. The importance of KIBS agglomeration in city productivity growth is systematically related to a city's level of economic development.","[Zhang, Cui] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Zhang, C (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zzzhangcui@126.com,,,Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [15JNQM020]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403102]; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation of China [2014A030313371],Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"The author would like to thank the Editor, three anonymous referees, Ning Wang, and Dan S.

This paper aims to explore the scale and timing of historic and future impacts on energy use and emissions of the UK car market. To achieve this aim it applies a bespoke disaggregated model of the transport-energy-environment system to explore the impacts of retrospective and future policy scenarios on the UK car market, trade-offs between greenhouse gas and air quality emissions, and fuel use and associated tax revenues. The results suggest that the impacts on human health of 'real world' excess NOX emissions in the UK are significant. Future 'low diesel' policies can have significant air quality benefits while showing few (if any) carbon disbenefits, suggesting future car pricing incentives may need to be rebalanced taking more account of effects of local air pollution. Car pricing incentives are however unlikely to transform the car market without additional market changes, industry push, infrastructure investment and policy pull aimed at cleaner, lower carbon vehicles.

Increasing residential energy efficiency is a strategic fuel poverty intervention. However, the absence of easily accessible household energy data impedes effective targeting of energy efficiency programs. This paper uses publicly available data, bottom-up modeling and small-area estimation techniques to predict the mean census block group residential heating energy use intensity (EUI), an energy efficiency proxy, in Kansas City, Missouri. Results mapped using geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis, show disparities in the relationship between heating EUI and spatial, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic block group characteristics. Block groups with lower median incomes, a greater percentage of households below poverty, a greater percentage of racial/ethnic minority headed-households, and a larger percentage of adults with less than a high school education were, on average, less energy efficient (higher EUIs). Results also imply that racial segregation, which continues to influence urban housing choices, exposes Black and Hispanic households to increased fuel poverty vulnerability. Lastly, the spatial concentration and demographics of vulnerable block groups suggest proactive, area- and community-based targeting of energy efficiency assistance programs may be more effective than existing self-referral approaches.

Energy ratings, while a solution to the information problem, will only lead to higher efficiency levels if renter's willingness-to pay (WTP) exceeds landlord's investment costs. Using a sample of renters from one university, this paper estimates this WTP using a discrete choice experiment where respondents choose from a hypothetical set of single-bedroom apartments that differ according to a number of attributes including the energy rating. Results show that there is a strong disutility associated with the least efficient properties and that renters will pay significantly more for efficiency improvements at the lower end of the efficiency scale. Importantly, our WTP estimates are calculated in a setting where respondents were informed about the energy rating system prior to choosing and where the rating was shown for every property. Therefore, in order to maximise the impact of energy rating systems, policymakers are encouraged to ensure that both these informational characteristics are in place. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Different levels of understanding of specific energy technologies may produce different risk assessments across technologies within this issue domain. How this differential risk assessment occurs and the role that scientific information may play in it is not yet well known. This project seeks to determine the role that perceived and objective scientific knowledge may play in the public's risk assessments of different energy technologies.

We apply a TIMES based energy system model for Europe. Results for 2030 show that a stricter target of 70 g CO2/km for cars could reduce total transport CO2 emissions by 5% and oil dependence by more than 2% compared to the current legislation. The stricter regulatory CO2 car target is met by a deployment of more efficient internal combustion engine cars and higher shares of EV Total system costs increase by less than 1%. The analysis indicates that EV deployment and the decarbonisation of the power system including higher shares of variable renewables can be synergistic. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the deployment of EV would sharply increase between 2020 and 2030 at learning rates above 12.5%, reaching shares above 30% in 2030.

The base-year model is built through a bottom-up methodology using vehicle registration and technical inspection data. The model forecasts energy consumption up to 2050, taking into account the fleet structure, the car survival profile, trends in activity of the various car categories, and the fuel price and income elasticities that affect car stock and total fleet activity. It provides an initial estimate of private car energy demand in Andorra and charts a baseline scenario that describes a hypothetical future based on historical trends. A local sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the most sensitive input parameters and study the effect of its variability. In addition, the scenario analysis explores the most uncertain future aspects which can cause important variability in the results with respect to the Reference scenario and provides a broad estimate of potential energy savings related to different policy strategies.

We derive rates of convergence for two representative models: an ill-posed model and an approximate factor model. The theory is developed for a large cross-section and a large time-series. As all these methods depend on a tuning parameter to be selected, we also propose data-driven selection methods based on cross-validation and establish their optimality. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to forecasting inflation and output growth in the U.S. show that data-reduction methods outperform conventional methods in several relevant settings, and might effectively guard against instabilities in predictors' forecasting ability.","[Carrasco, Marine] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, CIREQ, CIRANO, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Rossi, Barbara] Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, Barcelona GSE & CREI, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Universite de Montreal; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University,"Carrasco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, CIREQ, CIRANO, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",marine.carrasco@umontreal.ca; barbara.rossi@upf.edu,"Carrasco, Marine/ACU-3814-2022; Rossi, Barbara/D-6756-2013",,SSHRC; ERC [615608]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-33247]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom; European Research Council (ERC) [615608] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ICREA(ICREA); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This article was prepared for the Journal of Business & Economic Statistics invited lecture at the 2016 ASSA-Econometric Society Meetings.

BESSs can also be used to store electricity during low-price hours, when the demand is low, and to meet the demand during peak hours, thus leading to savings for the consumer. This work focuses on the economic viability of BESS from the point of view of the electricity customer. The analysis refers to a lithium-ion (Li-ion), an advanced lead-acid, a zinc-based, a sodium-sulphur (NaS) and a flow battery. The total investment and replacement costs are estimated in order to calculate the cumulated cash flow, the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) of the investment. A parametric analysis is further carried out under two different assumptions: a) varying the difference between high and low electricity prices, b) varying the peak demand charges. The analysis reveals that some electrochemical technologies are more suitable than others for electric bill management applications, and that a profit for the customer can be reached only with a significant difference between high and low electricity prices or when high peak demand charges are applied.

However, such concerns have generally not been translated into tangible policy action. The reasons behind this inaction are not fully understood, and much remains unknown about the status of the rebound effect issue on the policy agenda and policy pathways available. Such knowledge gaps may hamper the development of effective policies to address this issue. In this paper, we examine the extent to and ways in which the rebound effect is considered in policy documents and analyse thirteen specific policy pathways for rebound mitigation. The effectiveness of the pathways is scrutinised and conclusions are offered to mitigate rebound effects. The main policy conclusions of the paper are that an appropriate policy design and policy mix are key to avoiding undesired outcomes, such as the creation of additional rebound effects and environmental trade-offs. From the discussion, economy-wide cap-and-trade systems as well as energy and carbon taxes, when designed appropriately, emerge as the most effective policies in setting a ceiling for emissions and addressing energy use across the economy.

Blending scales of governance: land-use policies and practices in the small state of Luxembourg, Regional Studies. While multilevel governance is helpful in understanding the logics behind integrated sustainable development policies, this paper argues that relational multi-scalar approaches more accurately explain actual land-use transformations in the small state of Luxembourg. These conclusions are based on surveys of planning policies and observations of land-use patterns related to housing and retail. Additionally, over 60 interviews were performed with local actors. The results reveal how actors blend scales of governance to override national directives to exert changes in land use. Blending scales is not always strategic or advantageous, but is an unavoidable process that characterizes interactions in a small state.","[Affolderbach, Julia; Carr, Constance] Univ Luxembourg, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, Route Diekirch, L-7201 Walferdange, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Affolderbach, J; Carr, C (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, Route Diekirch, L-7201 Walferdange, Luxembourg.",julia.affolderbach@uni.lu; constance.carr@uni.lu,,"Affolderbach, Julia/0000-0002-9520-7033; Carr, Constance/0000-0003-1491-536X","National Research Fund Luxembourg [C09/SR/01, PDR-08-032]",National Research Fund Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Research Fund Luxembourg [grant numbers C09/SR/01 and PDR-08-032].,,49,14,14,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Beyond the state: shaping governance and development policy in an Australian region, Regional Studies. The role of the state in regional development is often unclear and contested. In Australia's Gippsland region, in the east of the state of Victoria, state actors shape trajectories of development while limiting local input to consultative forums. However, this account of regional governance obscures the role of marginalized actors. Despite limited opportunities for meaningful involvement, less powerful social groups can be influential by strategically engaging with state structures and local communities. Drawing upon a strategic-relational approach, with specific reference to the regional politics of scale, territory and relationality, this empirical study considers the role of the state and marginalized actors in shaping regional development policy.","[Pape, Madeleine; Fairbrother, Peter] RMIT Univ, Ctr Sustainable Org & Work, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Snell, Darryn] RMIT Univ, Sch Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Pape, M (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Ctr Sustainable Org & Work, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",mpape@wisc.edu; peter.fairbother@rmit.edu.au; darryn.snell@rmit.edu.au,"Fairbrother, Peter/R-7050-2019","Fairbrother, Peter/0000-0002-8169-4811; Snell, Darryn/0000-0002-0888-0992","Commonwealth Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport; Australian Research Council [DP120101773]","Commonwealth Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This work was supported by the Commonwealth Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport and by the Australian Research Council under Grant DP120101773.",,51,20,20,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The analysis is conducted on Denmark after the electricity market liberalization. Probit and tobit techniques are employed to take account of a potential threshold effect. I find that the level and type of the support policy are the dominant drivers of deployment. A feed-in tariff significantly brings more wind power in than a premium policy. The additional capacity installed monthly increases by more than 1 MW for each additional (sic)/MWh of support. This is compared to the effect of the electricity price, investment cost, interest rate and general economic activity. If the policy is a premium, I find that 23(sic)/MWh of support in addition to electricity price is needed to observe the connection of new turbines to the grid with a 0.5 probability. I convert this support level into a carbon price of 27(sic)/ton if wind power competes with coal, and 48(sic)/t if it competes with gas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nations as well as regions differ in their growth rates. Whether these different growth rates lead to a convergence or divergence is a well-studied topic. However, the literature on clusters shows that regional economic growth is often related to the presence of specific industries. Hence, convergence and divergence might also be a phenomenon of specific industries instead of the whole economy. Therefore, the spatial distribution of each industry in Germany is examined in this paper and whether the distribution of employment converges to or diverges based on this spatial distribution is analysed. The industry characteristics that relate to the convergence are also studied.","[Brenner, Thomas] Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Kauermann, Goeran] Univ Munich, Dept Stat, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; University of Munich,"Brenner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",thomas.brenner@staff.uni-marburg.de; goeran.kauermann@lmu.de,,,,,,,61,0,1,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, no analyses have been done to examine theses changes in the non-energy intensive industry in France. We analyzed their importance in French industry with respect to their energy intensity, energy costs, value added, labour and the diffusion of production sites by using data at the 3-digit level with 236 sectors. Using a new decomposition method that gives no residual, this paper attempted to examine, over 10 years from 1996 to 2005, the changes that occurred in an area that has been neglected in energy analysis. We found that structural change had an overwhelming effect on the decline of aggregate energy intensity. Furthermore, we found that the higher the level of sector disaggregation, the more significant the changes that can be attributed to structural change, due to the homogeneity of this industrial group. The results of our study show that it is important to take into account the effects of structural change in bottom-up modelling exercises so as to improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasting for policy makers and scientists.

By defining ER&D as the effort undertaken by a firm to reduce its pollution per unit of output, we find in a duopoly framework that privatization cannot catalyze both public and private firms' ER&D efforts simultaneously; it can increase one but decrease the other firm's investment, or it may even lower both firms' ER&D investments. Moreover, when production causes severe environmental damage, or the imposition of environmental taxes poorly internalize the pollution externality, privatization may result in a poorer environment. For the sake of having a cleaner environment, policy-makers can impose higher environmental taxes on a highly polluting industry when it is being privatized.

Better educated individuals will later become an innovator or creator of new technology. Schools provide the education necessary to understand this new information and technology. Education is a vital factor for the accumulation of intellectual capital to reach economic growth. As a small developing island with its eleven universities, government assigning education is one of the locomotive sectors of the North Cyprus economy.

The important role for rural women represents education, extension service, social and professional alliances. The personal knowledge and capabilities of rural women confirm that they are prepared for managerial positions in the agri - food businesses and for entrepreneurial activities. They have the capabilities to diversify agricultural and rural activities and to create new employment opportunities in countryside.","[Jackova, Silvia; Kadlecikova, Maria; Kosuda, Jozef; Jurickova, Zuzana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Jacková, S (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",silviajackova39@gmail.com; Maria.Kadlecikova@uniag.sk; aione@gts.mail.sk; Zuza.Jurickova@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,5,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,47,53,,10.15414/isd2016.s1.03,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500004,0

This paper investigates patterns of wage inequality in 60 British cities. It has two principal goals: (1) to describe which cities are most unequal; and (2) to assess the important determinants of inequality. The results show a distinct geography of wage inequality: the most unequal cities tend to be affluent and located in parts of the Greater South East of England. A central determinant of these patterns is the geography of highly skilled workers. Because of this, the geography of urban wage inequality reflects the geography of affluence more generally.","[Lee, Neil] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Sissons, Paul] Coventry Univ, Ctr Business Soc, Jaguar Bldg,Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England; [Jones, Katy] Univ Salford, SHUSU, Allerton Bldg, Lancaster M5 4WT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Coventry University; University of Salford,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.d.lee@lse.ac.uk; paul.sissons@coventry.ac.uk; k.e.jones@salford.ac.uk,,"Sissons, Paul/0000-0002-1768-6120; Jones, Katy/0000-0002-8090-4557",Joseph Rowntree Foundation,Joseph Rowntree Foundation,This paper was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.,,60,32,39,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Given that strategic input outsourcing occurs, we show that the cost-efficient integrated firm will locate as far away from its rival as possible, so as to increase its rival's input price when its own cost advantage is small; at the same time, the cost-inefficient downstream firm likes to locate closer to its rival to lower the input price. Hence, there is an interior locational equilibrium, and the principle of maximum differentiation does not hold. When an integrated firm's cost advantage is large, the principle of maximum differentiation is valid. However, when the integrated firm's own cost advantage is even larger, the integrated firm can become a monopolist through strategic input outsourcing. Under this case, the equilibrium location depends on the magnitude of the input homemade ratio when the input homemade ratio is small. Otherwise, the integrated firm would like to locate at the middle of the market.","[Lin, Yen-Ju] Fo Guang Univ, LOHAS, 160 Linwei Rd, Jiaosi 26247, Yilan County, Taiwan; [Lin, Yen-Ju] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Futurel, 160 Linwei Rd, Jiaosi 26247, Yilan County, Taiwan; [Lin, Yan-Shu; Tu, Kuang-I] Natl DongHwa Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Sec 2 Da Hsueh Rd, Shoufeng 97401, Hualien, Taiwan; [Tu, Kuang-I] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Finance, 64 Wunhua Rd, Huwei Township 632, Yunlin County, Taiwan",Fo Guang University; Fo Guang University; National Dong Hwa University; National Formosa University,"Tu, KI (通讯作者)，Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Finance, 64 Wunhua Rd, Huwei Township 632, Yunlin County, Taiwan.",tu700124@nfu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C [NSC 101-2410-H-431-006]","Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C","We are grateful to Professor Fu-Chuan Lai, Wen-Jung Liang, Hong Hwang, two anonymous referees and seminar participants at 3rd International Conference on Regional Science for their valuable comments, leading to substantial improvements of this paper.

The demographic estimates of European Commission show that by 2060 in Latvian population number elderly people aged 65 and over will almost double.

The empirical analyses employed the difference-in-difference propensity score-matching approach, which allows several important sources of bias to be addressed, such as selection bias, simultaneity bias and functional form misspecification, from which many previous studies suffer. Using panel data of 1333 firms from the Schleswig-Holstein region in Germany, it is found that the crowding-out effect of the RDP is close to 100%, implying that firms use public support to substitute for private investments. Furthermore, no evidence was found that, due to the RDP programme support, firms would have brought forward their investments planned originally for a later period, rejecting the inter-temporal substitution of investments.","[Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, D'Artis] European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain",,"Kancs, D (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",jmichalek@gmx.de; pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu; dartis.kancs@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850; Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X",European Commission [EU-022708],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),The authors acknowledge the financial support given by the 6th Framework Programme of the European Commission [contract number EU-022708].,,54,22,22,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The case of schools in Albania, where English is taught as a foreign language, shows that pupils who do well in proficiency tests, do not perform adequately in oral communication for the same grammatical knowledge. This papers aims to introduce a range of available grammar learning strategies for learners of EFL to use in the A2 and B1 levels. The material is accompanied by concrete examples of how grammar learning strategies can be included in lesson plans, based on textbook material. The aim is to render interested readers the awareness of the possible need to increase communicative grammar proficiency in learners of EFL by increasing their awareness of the range of means available to create long-lasting associations between the theory, acquisition, and correct usage of grammar.

Especially the transport sector is seen as one of the key drivers of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper describes the methodology used to combine the application of two models in order to provide a basis for informed policy recommendation for GHG mitigation. The TEMT model provides real world emission factors adapted to local conditions in Gauteng for numerous vehicle technology concepts. Those data feed into the TIMES-GEECO energy system model which identifies future technology use for different alternative scenarios. Finally, the scenario results are illustrated spatially using a GIS programme. The results of the scenario analysis show that under implemented policies GHG emissions in Gauteng are likely to increase substantially. Pollutant emissions are currently high as a result of a comparably old vehicle fleet. The spatial display of these results shows where the traffic network is concentrated and the location of so-called emission hot-spots. Energy efficient policies for the transport sector of Gauteng can achieve a significant reduction of emissions and energy consumption. Alternative powertrains and the use of locally produced biofuels can play a significant role in such policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the literature it is often assumed that the failure pattern follows a specific distribution and the step-down-stress accelerated life testing is operated under approximately the same environment as that of the early operating life of the product. In this paper we require the product life distribution to have some specified properties. The step-down-stress accelerated life testing is operated under severe (stress) conditions involving high temperature, voltage, etc. and the product's residual life depends on the step-down-stress level and the length of step-down-stress accelerated life testing period. Accelerated step-down-stress before shipment will reject poor-quality products and improve product reliability within a warranty period. Accelerated step-down-stress saves time but may cost more.

Evaluation results show that application of heat metering in 2012 requires improvement with the score pegged at 60.7. It is suggested that policy support from national government should be strengthened, the impact of policies released by provincial government be curbed and heat metering pricing be increasingly reasonable.

The study concentrates on the regulation of renewable energy generation with a focus on grid access and connection mechanisms. The high rate of distributed generation penetration is mainly based on the early support that these countries gave to the expansion of renewable energy generation - mainly wind and solar - within their respective national policies. Germany and Denmark are the ones with the most sophisticated support schemes, which have shown a dynamic design over time. In terms of connections, Germany has the most favorable connection regime which provides not only priority connection but also priority grid access for generation units that produce electricity from renewable energy sources. Sweden guarantees equal treatment among different technologies (i.e. a non-discrimination principle). High connection costs have been observed specially in Germany and Denmark. The costs of network upgrades are usually socialised across demand customers. However, integration issues should be taken into consideration in order to avoid expansion of distributed generation in a way which unnecessarily raises total system costs, via high connection costs.

Impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions suggest strong interaction between perceived and expected inflation, with a lesser role for actual inflation. Media effects are generally small, but imply an asymmetric reaction of inflation expectations and perceptions to news on increasing vs. decreasing inflation.

The results suggest that the cost-efficiency in the provision of municipal services increases with (1) the level of pooling or joint provision of services among municipalities; (2) the saliency of local taxes, as compared with regional grants, in its operating budget; (3) the presence of external public comptrollers; and (4) the magnitude of the municipality's accumulated past investment in infrastructures.","[Arcelus, Francisco J.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Business Adm, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Arcelus, Francisco J.; Arocena, Pablo] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, E-31006 Navarra, Spain; [Cabases, Fermin; Pascual, Pedro] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31006 Navarra, Spain",University of New Brunswick; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Arcelus, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Fac Business Adm, POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",arcelus@unb.ca; pablo@unavarra.es; fcabases@unavarra.es; ppascual@unavarra.es,"Arocena, Pablo/K-6375-2017","Arocena, Pablo/0000-0002-4035-4597","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Spain's Ministry of Education [ECO2011-29314-C02-01, ECO2010-21242-C03-03]",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Spain's Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),The authors thankfully acknowledge the financial support for the completion of this research from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; and from Spain's Ministry of Education [project numbers ECO2011-29314-C02-01 and ECO2010-21242-C03-03].,,41,28,28,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this paper, we look at the diffusion of knowledge related to environmental technologies developed within the oil and gas industry. To assess knowledge spillovers from oil and gas inventions as a measure of technology diffusion, we rely on forward patent citations methodology. Results show that there is a strong likelihood that the citing patent will be eventually linked to environmental technologies if the original oil and gas invention has already environmental uses. Moreover, both intra and intersectoral spillovers produce a turnabout effect, meaning that citing patents show the opposite quality level of the cited patent. Our results support the idea that more sector-specific environmental policies, with an emphasis on diffusion, would significantly improve the use of environmental technologies developed within the oil and gas industry.

Participants receive either common or private signals about the point of no return, and experience either high or low reductions in payoffs if insufficient contributions are made. Our data reveal that, as expected, contributions are higher if the cost of not reaching the threshold is high than if it is low. High signal values discourage contributions and endanger the likelihood of success when signals are common, but not when signals are private. In addition, successful coordination of contributions is less frequent in a control treatment featuring a standard provision point mechanism than in the experimental treatment where the payoff reduction factor is high, although the theoretical predictions of the two games are similar.(C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To improve the fitness of the model, we combine the underlying price process with an additive stochastic jump process. We improve the model's performance by introducing a time-varying jump probability that is explained by two variables: the daily relative change in the volume of transactions and the European Commission's announcements regarding the supply of permits. We show that (i) sharp increases in volume have led to increased volatility during the April 2005-December 2007 period but not for the period beginning in January 2008, and (ii) announcements induce jumps in the process that tend to increase volatility across both periods.

Third, an employment-weighted measure of metropolitan technological cohesion is developed. The results confirm that technological relatedness is positively related to metropolitan industry portfolio membership and industry entry and negatively related to industry exit.

The goal is to assess the effectiveness of gasoline taxes and vehicle fuel efficiency standards on fuel consumption. The results reveal substantial interaction between vehicle fuel efficiency and the price elasticity of gasoline demand: the improvement of vehicle fuel efficiency leads to lower price elasticity and weakens consumers' sensitivity to gasoline price changes. The offsetting effect also differs across households due to demographic heterogeneity. These findings imply that when gasoline taxes are in place, tightening efficiency standards will partially offset the strength of taxes on reducing fuel consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the impact of a CO2 price, marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) are a commonly used tool by policy makers, providing a direct graphical link between a CO2 price and the expected abatement. However, such MACCs can suffer from issues related to robustness and granularity. This paper focuses on the relation between a CO2 emission cost and CO2 emission reductions in the power sector. The authors present a new methodology that improves the understanding of the relation between a CO2 cost and CO2 abatement. The methodology is based on the insight that CO2 emissions in the power sector are driven by the composition of the conventional power portfolio, the residual load and the generation costs of the conventional units. The methodology addresses both the robustness issue and the granularity issue related to MACCs. The methodology is based on a bottom-up approach, starting from engineering knowledge of the power sector. It offers policy makers a new tool to assess CO2 abatement options. The methodology is applied to the Central Western European power system and illustrates possible interaction effects between, e.g., fuel switching and renewables deployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Two scenarios for the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) were proposed: the first, in which low investments in E&P and social and environmental barriers undermine the development of oil resources beyond the limits characterized as 2P; the second, more optimistic, in which current exploratory and production areas in Amazonia and low-explored Offshore-Shelf basins are developed, thus, increasing EUR to 3P reserves plus contingent resources. Findings show that oil production in Peru has not followed a Single-Hubbert pattern, except for the area with more drilling activity and the highest accumulated production in the Northwest coast. Actually, institutional and regulation changes and less-attractive periods for operators due to poor results in oil discoveries explain why a multi-Hubbert approach better depicted the oil production in Peru. Peru has the potential to achieve a second peak of 274 kbpd of crude oil, overcoming the peak of 195 kbpd, reached in 1982. However, most of the remaining production would be located in Amazonia, where social and environmental issues pose critical challenges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike the existing studies, this paper focuses on one sector of the economy and utilises a unique monthly dataset Empirical analysis based on Johansen's cointegration approach shows that the three variables are cointegrated - i.e., a stable long-run relationship exists among electricity consumption, output and entrepreneurship in Singapore's manufacturing sector. Empirical analysis based on data from January 1983 to February 2014 reveals that electricity consumption adjusts very slowly to shocks to industrial production and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, entrepreneurship Granger causes electricity consumption, which causes industrial production. As electricity consumption causes industrial output, the growth hypothesis concerning energy consumption and economic growth holds in Singapore's manufacturing sector and policies that restrict electricity production, without electricity imports, are likely to lead to a decline in the manufacturing output.

Using data for 20 industrial countries and a continuous-time Weibull duration model, we find evidence of positive duration dependence suggesting that housing market cycles have become longer over the last decades. Then, we extend the baseline Weibull model and allow for the presence of a change-point in the duration dependence parameter. We show that positive duration dependence is present in booms and busts that last less than 26 quarters, but that does not seem to be the case for longer phases of the housing market cycle. For normal times, no evidence of change-points is found. Finally, the empirical findings uncover positive duration dependence in housing market booms of European and non-European countries and housing busts of European countries. In addition, they reveal that while housing booms have similar length in European and non-European countries, housing busts are typically shorter in European countries.","[Agnello, Luca] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat SEAS, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Castro, Vitor] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor; Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Alumni Assoc, London WC2 2AE, England",University of Palermo; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Agnello, L (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat SEAS, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",luca.agnello01@unipa.it; vcastro@fe.uc.pt; rjsousa@eeg.uminho.pt,"Castro, Vítor/P-4837-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Castro, Vítor/0000-0002-6426-6663; Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753","Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE; National Funds through the FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-037268, PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013]",Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE; National Funds through the FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,"The authors thank the Editor, Professor Rong Chen, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Leasing activity is examined both at microeconomic level, for which it has a direct impact, as well as at macroeconomic level for which it has both direct and indirect influence. While considering the macroeconomic level, where leasing activity stands as one of the factors of economic growth, material production and its supporting infrastructure and services have been covered. The purpose of this study is to identify potential opportunities of using leasing in the wealth creation process and its impact on economic growth, and therefore the use of this activity as a tool to stimulate economic growth. From the majority of indicators that used to characterize production and economic activity of enterprises working in production, agriculture, construction and repair industries, influenced by leasing activity, we chose and analyzed the main and most important ones: capital productivity, materials intensity, energy intensity. During the study a direct correlation between the index of material consumption and economic growth rates has been recognized. Leasing activity, as a process of the constant change of equipment used in the manufacturing process affects the amount of material and energy intensity at all levels of material production. Replaced equipment is generally more economical in terms of material and energy consumption, these ones will therefore be continuously improved, which ultimately has a positive effect on economic growth. Ultimately, leasing activity has a positive effect on the value of macroeconomic indicators, including economic growth. (C) The Authors.

In this context, the data which were collected from 216 employees of hotel establishments by the survey method were analyzed using the structural equation modelling technique. The results of the study indicate that organic organization structure has been found to have no direct effect on job embeddedness and individual adaptive performance. In addition to this, mechanistic organization structure affects job embeddedness positively, while it has no direct effect on individual adaptive performance. However, learning organization affects both job embeddedness and individual adaptive performance positively and learning organization has a fully mediator role in the relationships between organic organization structure and job embeddedness.

There are a number of variations in the application of value added taxes and other consumption taxes, including different interpretation of the same or similar concepts. This article is focused on the analysis of the opinions of different groups of inhabitants on the size of the value added tax, on the size of the real estate tax, on the issue of complicated system with lots of exceptions, and on the issue of frequent changes in taxes. The analyzed issue is a part of a broader context which has been solved within the project of specific research conducted by the team from the Department of Economics, Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, called The Causalities of Tax Incidence and the Modeling of Tax Processes. This project follows another project of specific research called The Causalities of Tax Incidence, while the data from this project have been used for the analysis within this article.

The problem considers credit union (savings cooperative) business that seemed stable after the problematic restructure 10 years ago. But during this January the payment from Deposit Insurance Fund of the Czech Republic had to compensate the consumers of the MSD credit union. This subject provided services with higher interest rates even during the last years of technically zero interest rate of the central bank. A question information asymmetry and the moral hazard arose again. All that is written in famous study for European central bank by Vesala et Gropp supporting the explicit deposit insurance system is correct but the conditions has partially changed. Credit unions try to compete with banks undertaking a higher level of credit risk but still being within Basel II accords. The paper is considering the question of the future development -to try to compete with the conventional banks as FIO credit union successfully did or to return to Austrian model. Next future trend is outlined in sum up of the deposit insurance system characteristics backed by other several studies. Also the problem of information asymmetry overcome is being discussed with the result that mostly used monitoring indicator cannot be applied to credit union market. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Switzerland has already introduced a CO2 tax on gas and heating oil and is considering introducing a CO2 tax on gasoline and diesel as well. The effectiveness of such a tax depends on the level of the short- and long-run price elasticity. Moreover, acceptance of a CO2 tax by a society depends on both the distributional effects of such a tax among households and its spatial effects among regions. In this paper, the regional impact of a hypothetical CO2 tax on gasoline consumption in Switzerland is analysed by estimating a demand function for gasoline using panel data from 547 Swiss municipalities from 2001 to 2008. Gasoline sales were collected from the five largest gasoline companies operating in Switzerland, covering about 60% of overall sales. Swiss municipalities are relatively small units, and car ownership and use in one municipality is thought to influence gasoline sales in the neighbouring ones. Accordingly, the method used in the model also accounts for spatial correlation in the consumption of gasoline. Overall, our spatial econometric analysis shows that the tax burden of a CO2 tax will be higher in rural areas than in urban areas.

Many observers are concerned, however, that the diffusion of systems based on renewable resources may give rise to energy sprawl, i.e. an increasing occupation of available land to build new energy facilities of this kind. These critics foresee a transition from the traditional fossil-fuel systems, towards a renewable resource system likewise based on large power stations and extensive energy grids. A different approach can be taken to reduce the risk of energy sprawl, and this will happen if the focus is as much on renewable sources as on the introduction of distributed renewable energy systems based on micro plants (photovoltaic panels on the roofs of buildings, micro wind turbines, etc.) and on multiple micro-grids. Policy makers could foster local energy enterprises by: introducing new enabling rules; making more room for contractual communities; simplifying the compliance process; proposing monetary incentives and tax cuts. We conclude that the diffusion of innovation in this field will lead not to an energy sprawl but to a new energy system characterized by a multi-layered density: a combination of technology, organization, and physical development.

Policy drivers and objectives that are assumed to affect coexistence, such as the fulfillment of conservation objectives and the prioritization of other competing marine uses, were scored by experts and predictions were crosschecked with state practice. While in most areas MRE-MPA coexistence is not prohibited by law, practice indicates resistance towards it. Furthermore expert judgment demonstrated that a number of additional factors, such as the lack of suitable space for MRE projects and the uncertainty about the extent of damage by MRE,to the MPA, might influence the intentions of the two major parties involved (i.e. the MRE developer and the MPA authority) to pursue or avoid coexistence. Based on these findings, the interactions of these two players are further interpreted, their policy implications are discussed, while the need towards efficient, fair and acceptable MRE-MPA coexistence is highlighted.

This paper develops a multi-sector dynamic computable general equilibrium model with an ETS module to study the appropriate ETS policy design, including a carbon cap, permit allocation and supplementary policies (e.g., penalty policies and subsidy policies). The main results are as follows. (1) To achieve China's Copenhagen pledge, the equilibrium nationwide carbon price is observed to be between 36 and 40 RMB yuan per metric ton. (2) The ETS policy has a cost-effective mitigation effect by improving China's production and energy structures with relatively little economic harm. (3) Various ETS sub-policies should be carefully designed to balance economic growth and carbon mitigation. In particular, the carbon cap should be set according to China's Copenhagen pledge. A relatively large distribution ratio of free permits, the output-based grandfathering rule for free permits, a penalty price (on illegitimate emissions) slightly above the carbon price, and a sufficient subsidy (from ETS revenue) are strongly recommended in the early stages to avoid significant economic loss.

However, the investment enthusiasm on coal power remains unabated and leads to continuous operation efficiency deterioration in recent years. In this paper, we quantify the rational capacity and potential investment of coal power in China during the 13th FYP period (2016-2020). By employing power planning model and fully considering the power sector's contribution in the 15% non-fossil primary energy supply target by 2020, we estimate that the reasonable capacity addition space of coal power ranges between 50 GW and 100 GW, depending on the expected range of demand growth. We find that if all the coal power projects submitted for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approval were put into operation in 2020, capacity excess would reach 200 GW. Such huge overcapacity will bring forth disastrous consequences, including enormous investment waste, poor economic performance of generators and more importantly, delay of low-carbon energy transition.

Despite these benefits, LCHNs provide for just two per cent of heat demand in the UK, when estimates suggest they have the potential to provide for around 43 per cent. These low levels of LCHN provision are in stark contrast to the Nordic nations which exemplify some of the highest quality and most extensive heat networks in the world. It is within this context that the Pioneer Cities project (the project) was launched by the UK government to help local authorities overcome barriers to the deployment of LCHNs. This paper reports the findings of an evaluation of this project, drawing on 86 interviews across five local authorities, analysed using elements of Actor Network Theory (ANT). The evaluation found that the project's success has been limited. Participating local authorities have encountered challenges regarding marketisation, public sector retrenchment and inexperience in mobilising LCHNs. These factors militate against the formation of the robust actor-networks required to deploy LCHNs. Analysis using ANT reveals insights into why LCHNs remain elusive in the UK and suggests that policy makers need to strengthen local authorities' ability to lead and deliver complex infrastructure projects.

A critical assumption in this respect is that public sector saving is not being offset by private sector dis-saving, which is at stake with the hypothesis of Ricardian equivalence. Based on a framework of co-integrating saving rates, this model provides an empirical test of the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis on Norwegian time series data. Although the model rejects the strong-form presence of Ricardian equivalence, results indicate that the Norwegian approach does not fully succeed in separating spending of resource revenues from the accrual of the same revenues.

Several system options could help balance electricity supply and demand given different mixes of intermittent, baseload and load-following generation capacity; of these, electricity storage is especially interesting. If electricity storage could be deployed widely, grids of any size could sustain a wide range of profiles of intermittent and baseload power. Currently, most installed electricity storage worldwide is pumped hydro. Flywheels, compressed air and batteries represent interesting technologies that could provide grid-scale storage, especially if technology costs come down. A significant amount of storage R&D worldwide is appropriately focused on lowering these costs, but more is needed. Ultimately, storage will only achieve high levels of penetration if it can compete for service provision in electricity markets, and policy adjustments are needed in many countries to ensure this is the case.

One way of limiting further infrastructure induced retail price rises is via 'cost-reflective' electricity network pricing that incentivises users to shift their demand to non-peak periods. Empowering consumers with knowledge of their energy usage is critical to maximise the potential benefits of cost-reflective pricing. This research consulted residential electricity consumers in three Australian states on their perceptions and acceptance of two cost-reflective pricing scenarios (Time-of-Use and Peak Capacity pricing) and associated technologies to support such pricing (smart meters, in-home displays and direct load control devices). An energy economist presented information to focus groups on the merits and limitations of each scenario, and participants' views were captured. Almost half of the 53 participants were agreeable to Time-of-Use pricing, but did not have a clear preference for Peak Capacity pricing, where the price was based on the daily maximum demand. Participants recommended further information to both understand and justify the potential benefits, and for technologies to be introduced to enhance the pricing options. The results have implications for utilities and providers who seek to reduce peak demand. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The former dimension refers to the pure (intrinsic) performance of the good, whereas the latter dimension has a positional content: buying green goods satisfies the consumer's desire to be portrayed as a socially worthy citizen. We consider the case in which these quality dimensions are in conflict with each other so that the higher the hedonic quality of a good, the lower the corresponding environmental quality. We characterize the equilibrium configurations and discuss the policy implications deriving from our analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Practitioners use DEA estimators far more frequently than FDH estimators, implicitly assuming that production sets are convex. Moreover, use of the constant returns to scale (CRS) version of the DEA estimator requires an assumption of CRS. Although bootstrap methods have been developed for making inference about the efficiencies of individual units, until now no methods exist for making consistent inference about differences in mean efficiency across groups of producers or for testing hypotheses about model structure such as returns to scale or convexity of the production set. We use central limit theorem results from our previous work to develop additional theoretical results permitting consistent tests of model structure and provide Monte Carlo evidence on the performance of the tests in terms of size and power. In addition, the variable returns to scale version of the DEA estimator is proved to attain the faster convergence rate of the CRS-DEA estimator under CRS. Using a sample of U.S. commercial banks, we test and reject convexity of the production set, calling into question results from numerous banking studies that have imposed convexity assumptions.

Till now, Greek energy policy has been considered insufficient to tackle energy poverty issues, as focusing mainly on short-term rather than permanent solutions. A primary survey has been conducted, recording objective data of energy expenses as well as subjective perceptions about housing conditions. The findings showed that, under the objective expenditure-based method, 58% of Greek households are energy poor. Among households under the poverty threshold, the energy poverty rate exceeds 90%. Existing and new subjective indicators shed light on other aspects of energy poverty, such as the level of thermal comfort at home, damp problems detected, restriction of other essential needs in order to manage energy payments, etc. Some interesting conclusions are also drawn by exploring the relationship between various indicators. It appears that households considered energy poor are not identical when examined by objective and subjective indicators. However, different indicators complement each other by capturing different aspects of the problem and provide a broader overview of the issue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating network analysis with the production function approach to study the spillover effects of transport infrastructure, Regional Studies. The production function approach is used to analyse the role of transport infrastructure on regional gross domestic product (GDP) using new definitions and measures of road network capital stock that represent the real benefit obtained by regions when accessing markets. Improving the existing methodologies, the infrastructure stock is weighted with trade data so as to estimate the direct effects on production of a region's own infrastructure (what is termed here internal stock'), as well as the spillover effects that it receives from using that of neighbouring regions (imported stock). The methodology is illustrated by using Spanish data for the 1980-2007 period and these internal and imported infrastructure stocks are calculated using geographical information system (GIS) network analysis based on generalized transportations costs. With this new data set, successive regressions are performed controlling for endogeneity and the obtained results are compared with those of previous research. The validity of this methodology and the existence of significant and rather large spillover effects that even outweigh the effect of the internally endowed capital stock on aggregate production are confirmed. On average, the relative magnitude of the spillover effects to that of the internal (own) stock effect increases with the level of territorial disaggregation, i.e., it is larger for provincial data than for regional data. Unfortunately, it is also found that spillover effects are asymmetric, exhibiting negative values for poorer regions, as they do not profit from the capital stock existing in their neighbouring areas as do their richer counterparts, thereby casting doubts on the cohesion effects attributed to transport infrastructure investments.","[Alvarez-Ayuso, Inmaculada C.; Zofio, Jose L.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, C Francisco Tomas y Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Condeco-Melhorado, Ana M.; Gutierrez, Javier] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Geog Humana, C Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Alvarez-Ayuso, IC; Zofío, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, C Francisco Tomas y Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.;Condeço-Melhorado, AM; Gutiérrez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Geog Humana, C Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",inmaculada.alvarez@uam.es; amcondeco@gmail.com; javiergutierrez@ghis.ucm.es; jose.zofio@uam.es,"Condeço-Melhorado, Ana/ABG-6531-2020; Gutiérrez, Javier/AGZ-2959-2022; Zofío, José Luis/K-5178-2014; Zofío, José L./HTQ-2877-2023; ALVAREZ AYUSO, INMACULADA/K-5808-2014","Condeço-Melhorado, Ana/0000-0002-7260-3260; Zofío, José Luis/0000-0003-1170-9501; ALVAREZ AYUSO, INMACULADA/0000-0003-0495-623X",Madrid's Directorate-General of Universities and Research [S2007-HUM-0467]; Spanish Ministry of Transportation [P42/08]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-21643],Madrid's Directorate-General of Universities and Research; Spanish Ministry of Transportation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"The authors acknowledge financial support from Madrid's Directorate-General of Universities and Research [grant number S2007-HUM-0467; http://www.uam.es/transportrade), the Spanish Ministry of Transportation [grant number P42/08], and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [grant number ECO2010-21643].",,45,23,24,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The main findings of our study are as follows: (1) Households that purchased energy-efficient air-conditioners saved more electricity than those that did not. (2) Additional-purchase households showed significant energy savings, whereas replacement households did not. The rebound effect may negate the energy-saving effects of a new air conditioner. (3) Altruistic attitude is associated with more active participation in power saving.

In order to ensure the smog governance projects could be promoted smoothly and the public shoulder the environmental responsibilities consciously, it is necessary for the policymakers to take public attitude into consideration, and understand the public willingness to pay (WTP) for smog mitigation. This paper adopts a CV method framework to assess the value of WTP and analyze the determinants. Given the consideration of the possible presence of the selectivity bias caused by protest responses, the bivariate sample selection model is constructed for estimation. Results show that up to 14% of respondents hold the protest responses, and neglecting the selection bias caused by protest responses would lead to downward biased estimates. The mean value of WTP for the smog mitigation is 1590.36 RMB per year, accounting for about 1% of annual income. Moreover, the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude among public is found to be significantly correlated with their WTP, and the other determinants such as household annual income, energy expenditure and economic loss caused by smog could also substantially affect the value of WTP. We further recommend grading governance and policy transparency to address the smog crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we examine the impacts of China's gasoline-pricing reform implemented in January 2009 on the fuel economy of the country's new automotive fleet. In particular, we distinguish the effects of two common elements of China's energy-pricing reform packages: the effects of the energy tax increase (i.e., the gasoline tax increase) and the effects of the energy-pricing mechanism reform (i.e., the adoption of a market oriented pricing scheme for gasoline). By exploiting a rich dataset of monthly new passenger vehicle sales at the vehicle-model level in China between 2008 and 2013; we are able to control for potential correlations between unobserved product and consumer characteristics and products' fuel efficiency. Our empirical results infer that fuel costs have a significant influence on new vehicle sales in China, while the presented policy simulations suggest that the gasoline pricing reform in China has led-to an approximately 6.25 percent increase in new vehicle fuel economy. Moreover, the two major elements of the reform, the gasoline tax increase and. expedited adjustment cycles for gasoline prices, make similar contributions to the increase in the new vehicle fleet's fuel economy, with the former contributing 3.43 percent and the latter, 2.82 percent.

For many years, over 1/3 of domestic electricity, that is about 53-55 TWh, has been generated by lignite-fired power plants. Currently, with 63-66 million tons of extraction, Poland is the fourth lignite producer worldwide and the second in the European Union. There are three possible scenarios for the development of lignite mining in Poland by 2050. Unfortunately, despite the huge lignite resources, amounting to more than 23.5 billion tons, and great potential of the mining industry, the future of Polish lignite mining does not look optimistic from the economic point of view. This is associated with social and environmental problems, including the European Union's climate and energy policy. However, this may change in the event of a global economic crisis and unstable geopolitical conditions. Therefore, a new energy doctrine for Poland at least by 2050 is urgently needed.

The results of the analysis conducted on a sample of 227 European regions show that increasing variety is associated with the reallocation of the workforce across sectors whereas within-sector productivity is associated with high levels of both coherence and cognitive distance of the regional knowledge base.","[Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.;Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Via Real Coll 30, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy.",Francesco.quatraro@unice.fr,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022; Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239",European Commission [266959],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),The funding in 2013 of the European Commission through FP7 research project 'Policy Incentives for the Creation of Knowledge: Methods and Evidence' (PICK-ME) [grant number 266959] is gratefully acknowledged.,,74,10,10,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In Malaysia, the transportation sector accounts for 28% of total CO2 emissions, of which 85% comes from road transport. By 2020, Malaysia is targeting a reduction in CO2 emissions intensity by up to 40% and in this effort the role of road transport is paramount. This paper attempts to investigate effective policy options that can assist Malaysia in reducing the CO2 emissions level. An Optimisation model is developed to estimate the potential CO2 emissions mitigation strategies for road transport by minimising the CO2 emissions under the constraint of fuel cost and demand travel. Several mitigation strategies have been applied to analyse the effect of CO2 emissions reduction potential. The results demonstrate that removal of fuel price subsidies can result in reductions of up to 652 ktonnes of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions can be decreased by 6.55%, which would enable Malaysia to hit its target by 2020. CO2 emissions can be reduced significantly, up to 20%, by employing a combination of mitigation policies in Malaysia. This suggests that appropriate mitigation policies can assist the country in its quest to achieve the CO2 emissions reduction target. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, high-speed rail does not seem to impact on employment.","[Albalate, Daniel; Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, Av Diagonal 690, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Fageda, X (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, Av Diagonal 690, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.",albalate@ub.edu; xfageda@ub.edu,"Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019; Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018","Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589; Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169",Spanish Government [ECO2012-38004]; Regional Government of Catalonia [SGR2014-325],Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Regional Government of Catalonia,This work was supported by the Spanish Government [project number ECO2012-38004] and by the Regional Government of Catalonia [project number SGR2014-325].,,68,28,29,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this study, we examine the effect of long-distance commuting (LDC) on timing of retirement. Previous research indicates negative health effects and substantial disutility of commuting. Potentially, this may affect the labour supply of older workers via early retirement. Longitudinal population register data from Sweden on employed older workers are used for semi-parametric estimation of survival in the labour force. The results for men indicate shorter survival in the labour force/ earlier retirement for LDCs, primarily among men with high education. For women, there is no evidence of LDC being associated with early retirement. For women with high education, there are indications of longer survival in the labour force among the commuters. The seemingly contradictory results for the highly educated may be due to gender differences in commuting distances and socio-economic attributes of commuters.","[Backstrom, Peter] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Backstrom, Peter] Umea Univ, Stockholm Umea Sch Business & Econ 16490, Swedish Def Res Agcy FOI, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Sandow, Erika] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Ctr Demog & Ageing Res, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Westerlund, Olle] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Ctr Demog & Ageing Res, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University; FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency; Umea University; Umea University,"Sandow, E (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Ctr Demog & Ageing Res, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",peterbackstr@gmail.com; erika.sandow@umu.se; olle.westerlund@umu.se,"Sandow, Erika/HPF-1871-2023","Sandow, Erika/0000-0001-9587-9000; Westerlund, Olle/0000-0003-2958-5615","Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus) [2006-21576-36119-66]; Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) [2006-1010]","Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus)(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE)","The authors are grateful for valuable suggestions from two anonymous referees and financial support from the Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus Grant Number 2006-21576-36119-66) and Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE, Grant Number 2006-1010).",,59,7,7,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Many physicians have acquired these administrative responsibilities by chance and may not possess the necessary tools or managerial know-how to administrate their respective establishments. The necessity to refine these leadership roles is evident and can be done so using several methods; with the implementation of a leadership development program or a program that provides a degree which can train physicians during their residency or at different stages of their careers. These programs can be extremely beneficial not only financially, but also from a moral and ethical standpoint, not to mention the general satisfaction of patients due to the improvement of services offered. One such program has already been applied at Duke Medicine, the MLPR (Management and Leadership Pathway for Residents) is an innovative program which is targeted towards residents with a medical degree that are also interested in management training. The MLPR program was developed in 2009 with the intent to cultivate the development of a new breed of physician-leaders, by providing residents with a rotational system supervised by mentors these physicians-in-training will be faced with various demanding tasks in a clinical environment as well as with different prospects in management that are aimed to further develop their leadership and managerial skills in all aspects of modern medicine. By suggesting the idea of introducing such a ground-breaking program into the Romanian health care system at an early stage in any medical career will give rise to more opportunities for aspiring physician-executives to subsequently enhance the overall quality of any health care enterprise.

As an integrated European market for electricity develops, wholesale electricity prices should be converging as a result of market coupling and increased interconnectivity. Electricity mixes are also changing, spurred by a drive to significantly increase the share of renewables. Consequently, the electricity wholesale price dynamics are evolving, and the fuel-electricity price nexus that has been described in the literature is likely to reflect this evolution. This study investigates associations between spot prices from the British, French and Nordpool markets with those in connected electricity markets and fuel input prices, from December 2005 to October 2013. In order to assess the time-varying dynamics of electricity spot price series, localized autocorrelation functions are used. Electricity spot prices in the three markets are found to have stationary and non-stationary periods. When a trend in spot prices is observed, it is likely to reflect the trend in fuel prices. Cointegration analysis is then used to assess co-movement between electricity spot prices and fuel inputs to generation. The results show that British electricity spot prices are associated with fuel prices and not with price developments in connected markets, while the opposite is observed in the French and Nordpool day-ahead markets.

This has resulted in worsening food shortages and therefore resorts to foreign sources to fill the food deficit. Therefore, in this the paper we tried to identify the most important factors affecting the problem of the growing food gap, and the deterioration of self-sufficiency rates of selected food commodities (wheat and flour, maize, rice, red meat, white meat). We chose these goods based on their relative importance. In spite of the importance of productivity, the share of these commodities in the value of food imports exceeds production rates. So, we have set up methodological framework that includes estimating equations of general time trend during the period 2000-2013, expected future quantities of the food gap, and identify the most important factors affecting the amount of the gap and the share of self-sufficiency of goods under study. The main findings reveal that Arab countries are significantly exposed to the FNS risks, mainly driven by the food trade deficit between Arab countries, high unemployment, and high population growth rates. This resulted in the expansion of the size of the food gap between domestic production and national consumption of those goods and declining self-sufficiency rate of those goods. Therefore, they rely on foreign sources to fill the deficit. The Arab food integration is one of the most important reasons for achieving the Arab food security strategy. As this integration will bring significant economic advantages of the Arab world, it might increase the volume of trade exchange between Arab countries, on the one hand, and between the Arab world and foreign markets, on the other.","[Elbogghi, Elham Giuma; Alawad, Abdullah; Qineti, Artan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Elbogghi, EG (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",elhamjum@yahoo.com; abdullah.alawad@outlook.com; artan.qineti@gmail.com,"Qineti, Artan/AAD-8740-2019",,,,,,10,0,0,1,7,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,907,922,,10.15414/isd2016.s12.02,0.0,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500108,0

Effective potentials, taking into account the screening effects at large distances and the quantum-mechanical diffraction effect at small distances, were used to model the interaction between particles. Another effective screening potential was chosen to describe the charge interaction with neutral atoms. This potential takes into account the interaction between free charge and atomic nucleus with centrally symmetric distribution of the electron density. The degree of ionization was calculated through solving the system of Saha equations. Pair correlation functions were studied in the exponential approximation. Thermodynamic properties for hydrogen plasma were calculated using the effective potentials and obtained on their base pair correlation functions. Internal energy and equation of state of partially ionized hydrogen plasma were compared with the results from previous research.

Imperatives and dimensions of this model are the analysis result of data obtained by observation applied to public information and market research. The study was conducted nationwide. This model is the companies' response to market demand. This model proposes a general framework for the creation of successful collaboration between universities and businesses. The industrial partners do not necessarily have all the competencies to perform each operation in-house for the development of competitive products. Therefore, collaboration with universities helps them in researching the problems that cannot be solved individually. In this sense, universities could be considered as partners for industries. The analysis undertaken shows that how the two entities, the university and industry collaborate, very much fits with the framework for collaboration shown. Although the open innovation model does not apply significantly and primarily in these entities, there is a high potential for its implementation and the creation of added value.

Malnutrition, infectious diseases, overcrowding, strict custodial physical infrastructure, and limited access to basic health services, among other factors, contribute to a worsening of the physical and mental health of prisoners OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to ascertain leading health problems, care needs, and the degree of health protection used in the prison population of the Republic of Macedonia. METHODS: The research is a cross-sectional study of the prison population, composed of 550 prisoners, with 100 situated in Bitola's prison, 100 in the prison of Prilep, 50 women imprisoned in the women's section of the correctional institution, Idrizovo, and another 300 prisoners from Idrizovo. RESULTS: The most important reasons for causing illness amount examinees were the conditions in prison (as considered by 73.0% of respondents), drug use (by 50.4% of respondents), stress (by 45.6% of respondents), and improper nutrition (by 43.6% of respondents).

Numerous definitions of e-services generalize their essence, reflect the specific characteristics and certain elements of their production process. They are important for economic theory and practice, but none of them have acquired general acceptance. Supranational institutions, scientists and researchers attempt to seek one definition. A lot of definitions explain e-services only as e-government, e-learning and e-commerce. It is insufficient for further classification. We pay attention to classification of e-services in this chapter. Some of them divided e-services according to the branch, processes etc. Classification as e-co model, e-ladder, E-Diamond model, classification of service and product to the dimensions in a 2 * 2 matrix, and fulfilment-product classification have been introduced. The main goal of our study is to provide an extensive review of e-service definitions and classifications. Based on the findings we propose our own classification of e-services. The result of our work is a new 3D model. The 3D model is constructed according to bases of stages models and Diamond model, but we respect also user's needs and their fulfilment in process. In this empirical analysis of e-service definitions and classifications, we have compared known definitions and classifications and proposed a new model. Most models and schemes only deal with public e-services. We bring a new perspective, the classification is intended for all known e-services. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, the crisis, also referred to as the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 30's in the 20th century, has sparked a wave of questions dealing with the financial analysis and predictions of the future financial situation. At present, various models of discriminant analysis and logistic regression, most of which originated in the 20th century and under the conditions of different economies, are predominantly used for the forecasting the financial situation of companies in the Slovak Republic. The usefulness of these models is now questionable in countries where they primarily originated and therefore all the more in the Slovak Republic.

Citation analysis belongs to the category of bibliometrics, and it is one of the most active research fields in current bibliometrics, scientometrics, webometrics, library and information science. It is increasingly widely used in the evaluation of journal, document, scientific research and talent, information service and knowledge management. The development of citation analysis was initiated by P. LK Gross et al.' s first research in 1927 and developed rapidly with the advent of the Science Citation Index. In 1981, Wang Chongde published the first citation analysis article in the China's Journal of Information Science, which marked the start of the research on the Chinese periodical citation([1]).

This compartmentalization is mirrored in scholarship, where much research has focused on the fragmentation of, respectively, global energy and global climate governance, but only little has been said about how these fields might be integrated. Our analysis of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) changing activities in recent years shows that governance integration - both within global energy governance and between global energy and climate governance - is now happening. The IEA has broadened its portfolio to embrace the full spectrum of energy issues, including renewable energy and climate change; it has built and is expanding key partnerships with both the UN climate convention and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); and it has become an authoritative advocate for the inter-related goals of a low-carbon transition and climate change mitigation. We show that these developments are not the result of a top-down plan, but have rather emerged through the Agency's various efforts to pursue its energy-centric mandate in a fast-changing global policy environment.

This paper examines the impact a system non-synchronous penetration limit has on the dispatch-down of wind and quantifies the significance of interconnector counter-trading to the priority dispatching of wind power. A fully coupled economic dispatch and security constrained unit commitment model of the Single Electricity Market of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangement was used in this study. The key finding was interconnector counter-trading reduces the impact the system non-synchronous penetration limit has on the dispatch-down of wind. The capability to counter-trade on the interconnectors and an increase in system non-synchronous penetration limit from 50% to 55% reduces the dispatch-down of wind by 311 GW h and decreases total electricity payments to the consumer by (sic)1.72/MW h. In terms of the European Union electricity market integration, the results show the importance of developing individual electricity markets that allow system operators to counter-trade on interconnectors to ensure the priority dispatch of the increasing levels of wind generation.

The model primarily focuses on structural linkages among migration, university education, labor productivity, and human capital formation in the short run and long run. Our paper demonstrates that the impact of the human capital investment on GRP growth was higher for the 30s age cohort than for any other age cohort, and this holds for both the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and the rest of Korea (ROK).

Concerning the definition of HME, it can be interpreted from different aspects, but most empirical studies testing HME focus mainly on investigating firm share and exports. This paper empirically investigates the HME in terms of wages in the case of China by using panel data for the period 1980-2012. We find that the wages in coastal regions are higher than those in the interior, due to the size differences between regions. Additionally, regional inequality in wages between the coastal and interior regions evolves in an inverted U-shaped curve during periods of regional integration. The evolution of the space-economy in China during the past three decades supports the inverted U-shaped pattern predicted by the theoretical models of spatial economics.","[Wang, Jian] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Xu, Junqian] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Jiangnan University,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Dept Econ, 20 Chengzhong Rd, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China.",jianwang@shu.edu.cn; jxu2000@jiangnan.edu.cn,,"WANG, JIAN/0000-0001-6128-1254",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503161]; Jiangsu General Project Fund of Philosophy and Social Sciences [2015SJD348],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu General Project Fund of Philosophy and Social Sciences,"We particularly thank editor, two anonymous referees, Dao-Zhi Zeng, Shota Fujishima, Jacques-Francois Thisse, Hajime Takatsuka and Xiwei Zhu for providing exceptionally detailed and helpful comments and suggestions to improve this paper.

We apply the speculative ratio to examine the relation between basis and speculative activity in the oil futures market before and after the financialization of the oil market in 2003. Our finding suggests that the oil futures market is dominated by uninformed speculators in the post-financialization period. Our finding carries several practical policy implications, as follows: (1) both the commodity exchange and the regulator should design regulations and trading policies that improve basis risk; (2) on the commodity exchange side, new policies on margin requirements and position limits for speculators should be implemented; (3) margin requirements should be based on the level of basis risk; (4) regulators should speed up implementation of the position limit rule in the Dodd-Frank Act; and (5) stronger and more meaningful enforcement actions by regulators are required to punish and deter market manipulators.

Depending on their policy design, these preferences can impact the RPS program costs and emissions reduction. This study evaluates the impact of these policies on costs and emissions, coupling an economic dispatch model with optimized renewable site selection. Three policy designs of an increased RPS in Michigan are investigated: (1) 20% Solar Carve-Out, (2) 5% Distributed Generation Solar Carve-Out, and (3) 3 x Solar Multiplier. The 20% Solar Carve-Out scenario was found to increase RPS costs 28%, while the 5% Distributed Generation Solar Carve-Out increased costs by 34%. Both of these solar preferences had minimal impact on total emissions. The 3 x Solar Multiplier decreases total RPS program costs by 39%, but adds less than half of the total renewable generation of the other cases, significantly increasing emissions of CO2, NOR, and SO2 relative to an RPS without the solar credit multiplier. Sensitivity analysis of the installed cost of solar and the natural gas price finds small changes in the results of the Carve-Out cases, with a larger impact on the 3 x Solar Multiplier.

Although now largely discredited, this assumption remains a foundation of laissez-faire policies that anticipate energy transition resulting spontaneous forest recovery with economic development. Our results suggest that such policies can undermine broader policy objectives and actually worsen forest conditions in rural Indonesia. Based on a case study of forest margin communities in eastern Indonesia, we demonstrate that fuel subsidy reform did little to reduce rural household demand for fuelwood, while dramatically increasing fuelwood demand for processing agricultural products. Our results show how household decisions related to fuel sources are affected by non-economic considerations and external factors, such as opportunities to sell fuelwood. We argue that policy interventions that encourage energy transition of households do not necessarily improve forest conditions, as household fuelwood use may be a symptom, rather than a driver of deforestation and forest degradation. Thus policies to improve forest conditions should focus more on addressing the market environment of forest-margin communities, providing energy alternatives to small industries that are often the larger consumers of fuelwood.

An analysis of the barriers to heat pump adoption using agent-based modelling,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewable heat incentive; Feed-in tariff; Agent-based model,,"The UK Government introduced the tariff-based domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in April 2014 to encourage installation of renewable heat technologies as a key component of its carbon reduction policy. Of these, heat pumps are considered to be the most promising for widespread adoption and as such are the subject of this paper. Pilot studies prior to introduction of the policy identified non-financial barriers to uptake, such as the hassle factor involved, and initial figures indeed indicate that uptake is lower than expected. We analyse these non-financial barriers using an agent-based model and conclude that there is a tipping point beyond which adoption is likely to fall very sharply. We suggest that the RHI's complex and stringent compliance requirements for home inspections and heat emitter performance may well have driven adoption past this point and that further intervention may be required if the key aims of the RHI are to be achieved.

The future demand for industrial sites in the Netherlands: is employment a good predictor, Regional Studies. Popular forecasting models for long-term planning of industrial sites assume a strong linear relationship between employment and land use. New Dutch panel data for 1997-2008 were used to test this assumption. In a linear model, employment alone does not suffice to predict land use. Non-linear models show a relationship at municipal and industrial sites level, but not for regions. However, the relationship is strongly biased by unobserved heterogeneity. For planning purposes and prediction, additional explanatory variables are necessary to tackle this problem. The findings do not support the use of simple linear models for the planning of industrial sites.","[Beckers, Pascal] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Schuur, Jan] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Beckers, P (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",p.beckers@fm.ru.nl; jan.schuur@pbl.nl,,,,,,,55,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

One question not addressed by this debate is this: What if the EPA regulations turn out to be inadequate to address future mitigation goals? That is, what will the landscape for future policies look like if these regulations turn out to be just an interim measure? This analysis compares potential short- and long-term consequences of several key regulatory design choices, including mass-based versus rate-based standards, tradable versus non-tradable standards, and differentiated versus single standards. It finds that long-term consequences may be significant in terms of the legacy they leave for future policy revisions: tradable standards lead to lower electricity prices and become weaker over time; differentiated tradable standards lead to relatively greater investment in coal retrofits; non-tradable standards lead to relatively greater retirement of coal capacity.

This paper analyses the potential, barriers and limitations for regional innovation policy to facilitate industrial renewal in old industrial regions. It draws on a case analysis of the policy programme 'Biorefinery of the Future' geared to promote renewal of the forest industry in Northern Sweden. It is shown that infusion of radical emergent technology is necessary for new regional path development, but not sufficient. To avoid a singular focus on technology-push, policy should pay more attention to complementary experimentation processes in relation to demand-side characteristics, firm strategies and business models as well as regulatory aspects. Moreover, coordination between regional innovation policy and adjacent domains and levels of policy-making is needed as some of the most pressing obstacles for renewal are not specific to the region but instead to the industry at large.","[Coenen, Lars; Moodysson, Jerker; Martin, Hanna] Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat & Res Learning Econ CIRCLE, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Coenen, Lars] Nord Inst Studies Innovat NIFU, Res & Educ, NO-0302 Oslo, Norway",Lund University,"Coenen, L (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat & Res Learning Econ CIRCLE, Box 117, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",lars.coenen@circle.lu.se,"Coenen, Lars/GZN-1468-2022; Coenen, Lars/ABE-5947-2020","Coenen, Lars/0000-0002-5671-3988; Martin, Hanna/0000-0002-2427-5098","Nordic Energy Research (TOP-NEST project); Swedish Energy Agency (KIBIOS project); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA","Nordic Energy Research (TOP-NEST project); Swedish Energy Agency (KIBIOS project); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA(Vinnova)","Financial support, for which the authors are grateful, was provided by Nordic Energy Research (TOP-NEST project), the Swedish Energy Agency (KIBIOS project) and the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA.",,81,87,93,7,135,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The recent repeal of an established carbon tax has seen the defunding of significant renewable energy initiatives and a controversial review of the national Renewable Energy Target is threatening key drivers for investment in renewable energy. The current regulatory focus on community 'acceptance' does not facilitate the active community support necessary to challenge this increasingly hostile policy context. This research considers current experiences of community engagement in wind farm governance in one Australian jurisdiction. Through documentary analysis and two qualitative case studies, it examines legal and non-legal requirements for community governance mechanisms and considers how these influence wind farm development in rural areas. Findings include a problematic reliance on procedural compliance in assessing wind farm consultation, domination by vested interests, and reduced expertise in community engagement at the time it is needed most. Recommendations include integration of best practice guidelines in current regulation; harmonisation of policy settings to ensure equity across energy sectors; and an evidence-based commitment to benefit sharing as a strategy for increasing community support of rural wind farm development.

So far, such programmes have yielded mixed success. While partnerships between international, national and local organisations have become the pre-eminent model for RET programmes, we know relatively little about their contribution. This article traces the role of renewable energy partnerships in development cooperation, shifting the analytical emphasis from barriers and drivers to key actors and their relationships. It presents a relational approach for the analysis of development assistance for renewable energy, drawing on theories concerning the role of strong and weak ties in inter-organisational networks. Through an analysis of seven empirical cases from Central America, the article provides insights into how different forms of inter-organisational relationships can facilitate implementation of RET programmes but do not necessarily enhance the capacities of local organisations in a way to support a more sustainable adoption of RETs. On the basis of this analysis, theoretical and policy implications are given concerning the potential of relational approaches for researching technology diffusion processes, and the role of strong and weak ties for the success - or failure - of renewable energy partnerships.

This paper will look into claim problems experienced by Malaysian contractors in construction projects. To achieve this, questionnaires survey were conducted involving the contractors and consultants. The findings indicate that the lack of site staff awareness to proactively detect claims, inaccessibility or unavailability of relevant documents, and conflicts which arises during owner/contractor negotiation are all critical problems associated with the process of claim management.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the SALTMED model performance on simulation of soil moisture, total dry matter and yield of Chenopodium quinoa Willd. var. Titicaca grown in the Mediterranean region of Turkey under different irrigation methods, irrigation strategies and water qualities (fresh, saline and drainage water). For this purpose, field data from two different locations, Tarsus and Adana, were used in SALTMED Model. Different irrigation treatments with drip irrigation system consist of full and deficit irrigation using fresh water, full and deficit irrigation using saline water at ECw 30, 20 and 10 dS m(-1) salinity levels, and partial root drying (PRD) with fresh water along with rainfed (DRY) treatment were considered in Adana study. In Tarsus, line-source sprinkler system was used to create four irrigation levels (full and three deficit irrigation treatments) using drainage canal water. The field experiments results were compared with simulation results on soil moisture, grain and dry matter yield.

It occupies nearly 40% of the total area under Citrus cultivation in India. Citrus industry in India is the third largest fruit industry of the ranking ninth among top orange producing countries contributing 3% of the world's total orange production of the world. Vidarbha region from the Maharashtra state of India is known to the entire world for its awesome quality of Mandarin oranges. This wealth of Central India is now turning to the weakness; entire economy based on orange produce is slowly declining over the past few decades. Owing to the crisis, the suffering farmers are committing suicides. The present investigation is an attempt to find out the root cause of the decline in cultivation and production in terms of quality as well as quantity and as also of devising suitable strategy to increase the yield. For the purpose of the study ten sites have been identified. The most important reasons threatening the orchard production is the irrigation practice that is conventionally adopted by the farmers. The study tries to probe the objectives to determine the soil quality by analysing the water chemistry, the daily water requirement of the soil and planning for the requisite irrigation on the basis of soil condition. An investigation has revealed that, the off beat irrigation leads to the deterioration of the soil quality, as a long term effect. The soil analysis therein showed signs of salt accumulation in the effective root zone and the pH of the soil became basic. Other Physico-chemical parameters analysed were EC, WHC, Infiltration Rate, Soil Texture, Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Organic Matter. Ideally the Citrus crop requires acidic or neutral soil for the optimum performance of the plant. Daily Water Requirement (DWR) depending on the soil features, effective root zone, Readily Available Water (RAW) and rate of evaporation have been determined. The soil with available chemistry, RAW (50-60 mm), DWR (131.32-84.00 lt), the evaporation rate (10-14 mm) was recorded and reported to schedule irrigation.

The study emphasizes the importance of being not only cost effective, but also environmental friendly in choosing the optimum transportation channel. The Ordinary Least Squares method is being applied in order to demonstrate that railway transport is more eco-friendly than other means of transport considering the energy consumption level. The right balance should be achieved between using different transportation modes taking into account the infrastructure needs of each model and also the energy consumption forecast for the goods that need to be delivered. Although even if new infrastructures are bringing advantages and new opportunities from both economic and social point of view, their long term sustainability is an important factor that should be also taken into consideration and especially the effects on the surrounding environment like for example: air pollution, noise, space consumption etc. Efficiency is an important component of sustainability, hence any transportation system should target maximum operational productivity with minimal usage of resources.

All these, however, were not accompanied by an appropriate legislative framework to protect banks in case of economic imbalances. In this context, since the beginning of the economic crisis, a strong concern has been voiced about the reform of the banking sector. New rules were put in place with a view to reduce the risks within the financial system. A major responsibility for the crisis was attributed to the too big to fail banks. Thus, many of the newly adopted regulations targeted this specific segment of the banking sector. Authorities in Europe and the United States have received significant powers including the power to impose banks downsizing if the authorities evaluation shows that the banks in question pose a serious risk for the stability of the system. However, after four years from the adoption of the first reform measures, the banking system remains large relative to the gross domestic product, with banks too big to fail and with no real prospects for change.

J,"Baer, HA",,,,"Baer, Hans A.",,,The nexus of the coal industry and the state in Australia: Historical dimensions and contemporary challenges,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coal industry; State; Australia,,"This article presents a historical account of the close relationship between the coal mining industry and the federal and various state governments, thus over time building a state/coal industry nexus in Australia. It examines (1) an early colonial stage extending from the late 18th century to around the time of Federation in 1902 when the nexus emerged; (2) an intermediate stage from the early 20th century to the late 1970s when the nexus became solidified; and (3) a late stage from the early 1980s to the present day when the corporate sector came to dominate the nexus. Both Coalition and Australian Labor Party governments have consistently supported the exploitation of Australia's coal and natural gas, including recently coal seam gas, and supported the expansion of coal ports. An opposition movement has called for leaving coal and coal seam gas in the ground and shifting Australia's energy production to renewable sources, particularly solar and wind energy. The article highlights how the nexus between coal mining and the state inhibits action on climate change. It argues this can be transcended by energy policy directed at socializing coal mining, wedded to a program of transitioning it to renewable energy production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on data concerning the interactions of universities in the UK with large research and development (R&D)-intensive firms, the paper employs both social network analysis and regression analysis. It is found that the structural position of a university within networks with large R&D-intensive firms is significantly associated with the level of research income gained from industry. Spatial factors, on the other hand, are not found to be clearly associated with performance, suggesting that universities operate on a level playing field across regional environments once other factors are controlled for.","[Huggins, Robert; Prokop, Daniel] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Izushi, Hiro] Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Cardiff University; Aston University,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",HugginsR@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Prokop, Daniel/0000-0002-6394-6149",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-171-25-0023],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The authors are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [grant award reference number RES-171-25-0023] for partly funding the research upon which this article is based.,,61,5,7,0,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

For this reason, the present study simulates and compares an emission permit system (EPS) and an ambient permit system (APS) when fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is generated from industrial and residential sources. Thus, this research contributes to the spatial, economic and environmental assessment of industrial and residential emissions. The options to reduce pollution include replacement of heating devices in residential sources and installing end-of-pipe technologies in industrial sources. The results in terms of total cost and technological chosen options are similar under an APS and EPS for targets lesser to 80%. This is explained because it is more cost-effective to reduce emissions in residential sources than in industrial sources, and additionally, residential pollution has only local impact. However, some industrial sources should install abatement technologies for more demanding targets; in this case as industrial pollution are scattered in different areas, the total cost of an APS are lower than the total cost of an EPS.

The optimal deployment of these high-penetration-enabling solutions imply the existence of a healthy power grid, and therefore imply a central role for utilities and grid operators. This article also proposes that a value-based electricity compensation mechanism (based on e.g., Value of Solar (VOS) and load shaping tariffs), recognizing the multi-facetted, penetration-dependent value and cost of solar energy, and capable of shaping consumption patterns to optimally match resource and demand, could be an effective vehicle to enable high solar penetration and deliver affordable firm power generation.

J,"Thomas, S",,,,"Thomas, Stephen",,,The Hinkley Point decision: An analysis of the policy process,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nuclear power; Policy process; UK; Hinkley Point,,"In 2006, the British government launched a policy to build nuclear power reactors based on a claim that the power produced would be competitive with fossil fuel and would require no public subsidy. A decade later, it is not clear how many, if any, orders will be placed and the claims on costs and subsidies have proved false. Despite this failure to deliver, the policy is still being pursued with undiminished determination. The finance model that is now proposed is seen as a model other European countries can follow so the success or otherwise of the British nuclear programme will have implications outside the UK. This paper contends that the checks and balances that should weed out misguided policies, have failed. It argues that the most serious failure is with the civil service and its inability to provide politicians with high quality advice truth to power. It concludes that the failure is likely to be due to the unwillingness of politicians to listen to opinions that conflict with their beliefs. Other weaknesses include the lack of energy expertise in the media, the unwillingness of the public to engage in the policy process and the impotence of Parliamentary Committees.

It would be only possible to achieve the GHG target for 2030 if the fraction of non-emission energy be more than 70% of the total input primary energy for power generation with the current conversion efficiency (40%). Even the conversion efficiency is changed to 50%, still the carbon dioxide emissions are larger than the targeted carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector. The overshoot ratio would still increase from 5.9 in 2009 to 7.6 in 2035 even with the successful implementation of the 2nd EMP. Thus, additional efforts to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions and the overshoot ratio from the energy sector are required beyond adjusting the supply mix configuration for power generation and the conversion efficiency. Policies and programs encouraging the changes in consumer behavior toward reduction of goods consumption and energy savings are expected to impact on reducing the carbon dioxide emissions and the overshoot ratio.

This study explored the energy-saving potential from improving supply chain efficiencies and reducing excess inventory in China's retail system from a life-cycle perspective. Through embodied energy analysis, we found that energy invested pre-manufacture contributed 80-95% of the total energy embodied in consumer products. Although embodied energy intensities had declined by 60-90% since the mid-1990s, the lessened marginal improvements implied that low hanging fruits have largely been captured, and the search for new opportunities for energy-saving is in demand. Positive correlations between total economic inputs and embodied energy in consumer goods indicated possible synergy effect between cost-reduction and energy-saving in supply system management. And structural path analysis identified sector-specific energy management priorities for each retail-related sector. This study suggested that improving supply chain efficiencies provides a promising supplement to China's current industrial energy-efficient projects which target reducing direct energy use per se as an intra-firm cost saving measure. From the life-cycle perspective, the definition of green sector might have to be reconsidered in China towards a more energy-efficient economy and society. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The control group did not receive any information. In two follow-up surveys, four (N=333) and nine months (N=258) later, participants rated the acceptability of several low carbon policies. A pre-survey assessed the personal ecological norm for saving electricity. Participants with strong personal ecological norms reported generally higher policy acceptability. After environmental framing they also indicated higher acceptability compared to the monetary framing or control group. These results indicate that information campaigns should be designed carefully in order to promote positive spillover effects. Environmental framing of private-sphere behaviour can increase the disposition for further pro-environmental behaviour in the public sphere, e.g. policy acceptability. When appealing to monetary benefits in pro-environmental behaviour, there is a risk of inhibiting positive spillover effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternative policies must be explored to balance construction and operation. Taking the costs and benefits from a typical rural household biogas project, this paper assesses the economic performance at three different subsidy levels, i.e., no subsidy, existing standard and positive externality based standard. Furthermore three subsidy alternatives, one-time, annual and combined option are applied to the externality based standard. The results show that household biogas digesters have unsatisfactory economic performance without any subsidy and even in current subsidy policies. Environmental benefits of the digester were estimated as 2732 Chinese Yuan, significantly larger than existing subsidy standard. To keep continuous work during the 20-year lifespans of digesters, the income disparity of farmers among regions must be considered for policy application. With the increasing of labor costs, the ratio of initial subsidies must be reduced. These results provide policy implications to the future development of biogas projects in terms of both their construction and follow-up management, reuse of the abandoned digesters as well as the exploitation of other emerging renewable energy projects.

Consequently, both energy intensity and fossil fuel intensity are rising for Indian agriculture. But, these are declining for the aggregate Indian economy. Thus, revision of fossil fuel prices acquires greater significance for Indian agriculture than for rest of the economy. There are significant differences across crops. The crop-level analysis is supplemented by an alternative approach that utilizes a three-sector input-output (I-O) model for the Indian economy representing farming, fossil fuels, and rest of economy. Fossil fuels sector is assessed to portray, in general, strong forward linkages. The increase in total cost of farming, for a given change in fossil fuel prices, is estimated as a multiple of increase in direct input cost of fossil fuels in farming. From the three sector aggregated economy this multiple was estimated at 3.99 for 1998-9. But it grew to 6.7 in 2007-8. The findings have stronger ramifications than commonly recognized, for inflation and cost of implementing the policy on food security. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it seeks to determine to what extent a neighborhood's geographic situation impacts its probability of improving or declining and is spatial proximity equally advantageous and detrimental. To answer these spatial dependence questions, we employ and expand upon a spatial Markov model. Aside from the standard weight matrix typically utilized in spatial Markov studies comprised of the mean value of a neighborhood's surrounding area, this paper furthers this conceptualization by exploring alternate specifications including the mode and upper and lower quartiles. Results suggest that spatial dependence plays a strong role in impacting biennial transitions, and when examining the upper and lower quartiles, this dependence is shown to be nonlinear and amplified at the extreme ends of the QoL spectrum. A case study of neighborhoods in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, during the 2000-2010 decade is used to illustrate these concepts to the study of neighborhood dynamics.","[Delmelle, Elizabeth; Thill, Jean-Claude] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Wang, Chunhua] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of International Business & Economics,"Delmelle, E (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",edelmell@uncc.edu; Jean-Claude.Thill@uncc.edu; chunhua.wang@rocketmail.com,,,,,,,33,8,9,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This paper outlines the necessary steps in creating power systems with the flexibility needed to maintain stability and reliability while relying primarily on variable energy resources. These steps are provided in the form of a comprehensive overview of policies, technical changes, and institutional systems, organized in three development phases: an initial phase (penetration up to about 10%) characterized by relatively mild changes to conventional power system operations and structures; a dynamic middle phase (up to about 50% penetration) characterized by phasing out conventional generation and a concerted effort to wring flexibility from existing infrastructure; and the high penetration phase that inevitably addresses how power systems operate over longer periods of weeks or months when variable generation will be in either short supply, or in over-abundance. Although this transition is likely a decades-long and incremental process and depends on the specifics of each system, the needed policies, research, demonstration projects and institutional changes need to start now precisely because of the complexity of the transformation. The list of policy actions presented in this paper can serve as a guideline to policy makers on effectuating the transition and on tracking the preparedness of systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a methodology for estimating the power production potential of agricultural biomass in a country. Further, the methodology has been applied to develop a roadmap for producing reliable power in India. The present study reveals that about 650 Mt/year of agricultural biomass is generated in India, while about one-third of this has been found to be surplus for energy applications. The cereal crops have major contribution (64.60%) in production of surplus biomass followed by sugarcane (24.60%) and cotton (10.68%). The energy potential of these resources is of the order of 3.72 EJ, which represents a significant proportion of the primary energy consumption in the country. These biomass resources can produce electric power of 23-35 GW depending upon the efficiency of thermal conversion. The delivery of biomass to the plants and selection of appropriate technology have been found as the major issues that need to be resolved carefully. In the end, the study summarizes various technological options for biomass collection and utilization that can be used for producing clean and consistent power supply. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, this article develops a new criterion for identifying whether or not a particular time series variable is a common factor in the conventional approximate factor model. Second, by modeling observed factors as a set of potential factors to be identified, this article reveals how to easily pin down the factor without performing a large number of estimations. This allows the researcher to check whether or not each individual in the panel is the underlying common factor and, from there, identify which individuals best represent the factor space by using a new clustering mechanism. Asymptotically, the developed procedure correctly identifies the factor when N and T jointly approach infinity. The procedure is shown to be quite effective in the finite sample by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The procedure is then applied to an empirical example, demonstrating that the newly developed method identifies the unknown common factors accurately.","[Parker, Jason] Michigan State Univ, North Cent Reg Ctr Rural Dev, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sul, Donggyu] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",Michigan State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Parker, J (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, North Cent Reg Ctr Rural Dev, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Sul, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Econ, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",jparker588@gmail.com; d.sul@utdallas.edu,,"Parker, Jason/0000-0001-9227-6976",,,,,27,10,13,0,11,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, the dynamics of the market has not been studied systematically with regard to the new emerging competitors, namely unconventional oil. In this paper, the future trend of conventional and unconventional oil production and capacity expansion rates are analyzed using system dynamics approach. To do so, a supply-side modeling approach is utilized while main effective loops are modeled mathematically as follows: technological learning and progress, long and short-term profitability of oil capacity expansion and, production, and oil proved reserve limitations. The proposed model is used to analyze conventional and unconventional oil production shares, up to 2025, under different oil price scenarios. The results show that conventional oil production rate ranges from 79.995 to 87.044 MB/day, which is 75-80 percent of total oil production rate, while unconventional oil production rate ranges from 19.615 to 28.584 MB/day. Simulation results reveal that unconventional oil can gain a considerable market share in the short run, although conventional oil will remain as the major source for the market in the long run.

Temporary geographical proximity in the form of face-to-face contact is commonly thought to enhance learning. In a sample of individuals (n=294) involved in knowledge transfer in the Olympic Games, temporary geographical proximity emerges as a rather weak predictor of learning, although its explanatory value improves when coupled with organized proximity. This association disappears, however, when controlling for other predictors, suggesting that there is no unique effect of temporary geographical proximity on learning. Part of the effect of temporary geographical proximity is mediated through other variables, urging further research into the paths of mediation.

Among the key parameters identified in territorial knowledge dynamics (TKDs), this paper focuses on the balance and trade-off between proximity and distant relations, especially as far as knowledge relationships are concerned. This entry is investigated through an original process consisting in combining micro-motives for knowledge relationships and structural properties of resulting knowledge networks, always paying attention to the balance between proximity and distance. From the information available in EURODITE case studies and the presentation of the methodology, the micro-foundations of proximity and distance in knowledge relationships are explored according to the knowledge trade-off and the complex knowledge value chain that typify the modern knowledge process. Based on these micro-considerations, a structural analysis of TKDs is inferred that provides significant patterns of their structuring. From these patterns policy implications are extracted which show that collaborative incentives on some particular missing links fit better with effective policies than the common view of connecting people' policies.","[Crespo, Joan] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vicente, Jerome] Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, Sci Po Toulouse, Mfg Tabacs, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Utrecht University; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Crespo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.crespo@uu.nl; vicente@ut-capitole.fr,"Vicente, Jerome/H-5784-2011","Vicente, Jerome/0000-0002-0274-1799; Vicente, Jerome/0000-0003-2556-2061; crespo, joan/0000-0002-3059-5776; Crespo, Joan/0000-0003-4053-8158","EURODITE Project (Regional Trajectories to the Knowledge Economy: A Dynamic Model, Sixth Framework Program) [006187]","EURODITE Project (Regional Trajectories to the Knowledge Economy: A Dynamic Model, Sixth Framework Program)","This research received financial support from the EURODITE Project (Regional Trajectories to the Knowledge Economy: A Dynamic Model, Sixth Framework Program) [contract number 006187].",,61,16,20,4,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

They are considered important, as they provide the inputs for industrial development and increase export earnings, they contribute to food security as well as provide agricultural products for local markets. In the Republic of Armenia there are number of agricultural based projects that were implemented and are being implemented. Usually these projects are financed by international donors and are realised by locally selected institutions. We have adopted principal-agent model in the process of project implementation to show the possible information asymmetries that could be raised between international donors and implementers. The parties involved in the project implementation are the principal (i.e. Project donor), and agent (i.e. Project implementer). When donors are delegating the agents to complete the project there is a risk of information asymmetry. If the implementer behaves opportunistically, it could use it into its utility maximization. The outcome could be the decrease of project contribution allocated for beneficiaries. In this paper, we show the probable risks of parties' relations. We propose too, some risk minimization strategies that we think will alter the information asymmetry. First, prior to project delegation there is strictly recommended to study the implementer experience and the path that he/she has completed. Second, during implementation process increase the monitoring of specific tasks that were proposed by project plan. The following suggestions are made for projects that are existent in Armenia; however, we think that they are applicable in use of other countries examples as well.","[Babayan, Davit; Kadlecikova, Maria] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Babayan, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",davit.babayan@uniag.sk; maria.kadlecikova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,7,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,315,320,,10.15414/isd2016.s5.01,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500037,0

Authors argue that utilitarian perspective which used to be connected with classical concepts of rationality in economics is not the only approach to understand reasoning behind the human behaviour. Moreover, Virtue ethics developed by Aristotle more than 2000 years ago, gives modern perspective to the questions of morale and ethics, connecting individuals to broader communities and explaining their motivation and actions. Similarly, deontological theories that from the first sight might seem as contradicting to rational choice, explain human behaviour when examined at the macro level of analysis. This conceptual analysis concludes that various elements from different theories on ethics are able to provide more profound model of reasons behind human behaviour in comparison to basic assumptions in classical economics.

We undertake this in the context of the British market. We show how, ceteris paribus, the progressive replacement of coal with wind imposes extra costs of reserve and evaluate alternative way to meet this, whether through capacity payments funded by customers, or a reliability requirement on wind generators with capital cost or energy feed-in subsidies. We consider the reality of market concentration and the extent to which pragmatic regulation could allow prices to rise above marginal cost to reduce the extent of direct subsidies and complex market designs. We also evaluate the implied cost of carbon reduction in a progressive replacement of coal with wind, when the security is maintained by extra peaking gas. We find that support through capital allowances rather than the energy market is more efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Kaizen method is not limited to production entities, but it needs to be focused on the company's vision. The method is an appropriate and a well used tool for identifying and analyzing problems related to productivity with management without a system, with low work productivity, with work safety, and others. The Kaizen method is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous incremental improvement of all aspects of one's life. Kaizen is not a widely used method for improving quality in businesses. It can be applied in all branches of production since managers are not the only ones striving to improve production processes, production, and to improve the work place, but mainly employees are. It focuses not only on improving quality, but also on improving everything that can be improved within a company, because even a slight improvement affects the quality of production or services. However, it is not a method, but a process oriented way of thinking, which provides a basis for behaviors in ones daily life.","[Cierna, Helena; Sujova, Erika] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Environm & Mfg Technol, Dept Mfg Technol & Qual Management, 26 Studentska St, Zvolen, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Cierna, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Environm & Mfg Technol, Dept Mfg Technol & Qual Management, 26 Studentska St, Zvolen, Slovakia.",helena.cierna@tuzvo.sk; erika.sujova@tuzvo.sk; tavodova@tuzvo.sk,"Ťavodová, Miroslava/ABE-2003-2021",,,,,,5,1,1,1,22,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,237,245,,10.15414/isd2016.s4.01,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500028,0

The challenge is to identify or create the value flows and act upon these within the specific business organization to have proper value management.

In this paper, we analyze the 1998-2012 oil trade networks using the point-wise mutual information (PMI) method and determine the pairwise trade preferences and dependencies. Using examples of the USA's trade partners, this research demonstrates the usefulness of the PM' method as an additional methodological tool to evaluate the outcomes from countries' decisions to engage in preferred trading partners. A positive PMI value indicates trade preference where trade is larger than would be expected. For example, in 2012 the USA imported 2,548.7 kbpd despite an expected 358.5 kbpd of oil from Canada. Conversely, a negative PMI value indicates trade dis-preference where the amount of trade is smaller than what would be expected. For example, the 15-year average of annual PMI between Saudi Arabia and the U.S.A. is - 0.130 and between Russia and the USA -1.596. We reflect the three primary reasons of discrepancies between actual and neutral model trade can be related to position, price, and politics. The PMI can quantify the political success or failure of trade preferences and can more accurately account temporal variation of interdependencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, European demand for wood pellets has been growing faster and more steadily than supply leading to rising market prices in recent years. This article presents an econometric analysis of demand and supply of wood pellets in the residential heating sector in Austria, one of the most dynamic markets for residential pellets. Annual and monthly time series data between 2000 and 2014 are used in a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression to estimate supply and demand elasticities of wood pellets. In all model specifications, pellets demand is found to be inelastic (from -0.66 to -0.76) and pellets supply unit-elastic (from 1.03 to 1.18). Thus, consumers are highly exposed to price changes resulting from supply shocks. Policies which support investments in pellet boilers will shift the demand of wood pellets and likely leading to higher prices for consumers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This rise affects the blood-vessel wall and causes critical stresses likely to produce fissures in the blood vessels.

The most daring entrepreneurs also considered that international markets could offer similar opportunities, and thus established firms to operate exclusively in foreign countries.

The article describes the principle of these methods, and also the production process of a breast phantom and a tumor phantom. These phantoms can be used for measurements in the microwave frequency range, 8-12 GHz. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was to design a tumor phantom and a breast phantom, and to measure their dielectric properties. These properties must simulate human tissue. METHODS: To measure dielectric properties of human tissue, phantoms were designed using the waveguide Hippel's method and the resonance method with a cavity resonator. RESULTS: The aim of this work was to create the phantoms that would have properties comparable to those of real tissues. Results of measurement are shown as frequency dependence of relative permittivity and conductivity for breast, breast phantom, tumor, and tumor phantom.","[Maniakova, Eva; Faktorova, Dagmar] Univ Zilina, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Measurement & Appl Elect Engn, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Maniakova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Measurement & Appl Elect Engn, Zilina, Slovakia.",eva.maniakova@fel.uniza.sk; dagmar.faktorova@fel.uniza.sk,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,647,651,,10.12955/cbup.v4.826,0.0,,,5,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000096,0

The main findings suggest that the mark-ups for the lending rates that banks charge are generally higher in the South than in the North. Moreover, the empirical results indicate that the pass-through tends to be longer in Southern regions. Furthermore, little support is found for the hypothesis that regional banks react asymmetrically when adjusting their loan rates when these are above or below equilibrium levels, but some evidence supporting an upward rigidity in the regional deposit rates is detected.","[Montagnoli, Alberto] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S10 2GW, S Yorkshire, England; [Napolitano, Oreste] S Vinci Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Siliverstovs, Boriss] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Sheffield; Parthenope University Naples; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Siliverstovs, B (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",a.montagnoli@sheffield.ac.uk; napolitano@uniparthenope.it; siliverstovs@kof.ethz.ch,"Siliverstovs, Boriss/T-2405-2019","Napolitano, Oreste/0000-0001-6758-9823",,,,,53,7,7,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The paper focuses on the case of V4 countries in the period of 1991 - 2012. Throughout the more than 20 years examined, the countries spread out into many different forms of decoupling. The results of analysis suggest that in most observed partial variables occurs the strong decoupling of economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions, what can be considered as positive trend. Though decoupling elasticity convey a positive message, data indicate that, in order to meet its 2050 ambitious objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the V4 countries will need to accelerate their implementation of new policies, while restructuring the ways how they meet their demand for energy, food, transport and housing.

Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in R&D investment The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO2 emissions on account of increased R&D investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

While HVPLs often face public opposition, the energy transition and renewables are generally perceived positively. Drawing on the importance of benefit perception and affective responses for the acceptance of technologies, the present study investigated whether the perception of HVPLs changes when they are seen as a necessary measure for the successful energy transition. The results show that HVPLs are associated with more positive feelings, higher perceived benefit, lower perceived risk, and higher general and local acceptance when they are linked to the energy transition. However, numerous people believed that the energy transition renders further grid expansions unnecessary. This belief proved to be resistant to the provision of contrary information. Furthermore, the results underline the effect of visual impacts on the acceptance of HVPLs. Changes to the electricity grid that are accompanied by less visual impacts (e.g., technological modification) are more accepted than more visually disruptive changes (e.g., new construction). Finally, the findings emphasize the importance of affective response for the acceptance of HVPLs, especially for local acceptance. The results have several important implications for energy policy makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Discoveries are steadily enhancing national reserves and have brought the country into a new role in the global oil industry. This paper aims at investigating the economic gains that could be expected from a Brazilian oil field in the pre-salt region. Analyses were conducted based on the Libra field, the largest oil discovery in Brazil until now, with approximately 10 billion barrels. The results were calculated for different scenarios of oil prices, companies' arrangements and regulatory regimes. The findings suggest that economic gains could be higher for the Brazilian Government if the oil production were conducted under a service contract scheme. However, considering the current production-sharing regime in force for pre-salt areas, economic gains could be higher if a bidding process was conducted, ensuring for the Brazilian Government a higher participation in the oil to be produced. Additionally, the results demonstrate that under the current rules applied for the production-sharing regime, the government quota of oil has decreased over time, putting at risk economic results.

Electricity market prices should reflect these market prices of emission allowances as they are a cost factor for power producers. The pass-through rate is the fraction of the emission allowance price that is passed through to electricity market prices. It is often measured and presented as an average or a fixed estimate over some time period. However, we expect that the pass-through rates should actually vary over time as electricity supply curves reflect the marginal costs of different producers that differ in emission intensity. We apply a Kalman Filter approach to observe pass-through rates in Germany and U.K. and find strong support for time varying instead of fixed pass-through rates. Although policy makers are interested in the impact of a policy on average, our results indicate that one needs to be careful with the time-frame over which pass-through rates are measured for policy evaluation, as an incorrect chosen evaluation period could cause an under- or overestimation of the pass-through rate. In addition, our model helps to provide policy makers with insight in the development of pass-through rates when market circumstances change with respect to power production. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this huge literature, no dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model was available that captures two well-known stylized facts: (1) the stagflationary impact of an oil price shock, together with (2) the influence of the energy efficiency of capital on the depth and length of this impact. We build, estimate and simulate a New-Keynesian model with capital accumulation, which takes the case of an economy where oil is imported from abroad, and where these stylized facts can be accounted for. Moreover, the Bayesian estimation of the model on the US economy (1984-2007) suggests that the output elasticity of oil might have been above 10%, stressing the role of oil use in US growth at this time. Finally, our simulations confirm that an increase in energy efficiency significantly attenuates the effects of an oil shock a possible explanation of why the third oil shock (1999-2008) did not have the same macro-economic impact as the first two ones. These results suggest that oil consumption and energy efficiency have been two major engines for US growth in the last three decades. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We compute the residual demand function for each generator, taking explicitly into account the issue of transmission line congestion. This procedure allows recovering correct zonal Lerner index and the implied measure of the marginal cost function. We find evidence of a stable U-shaped marginal cost function for three main Italian generators, but a flat function for ENEL, the former national monopolist. The policy relevance of our approach lies in the possibility to offer some empirical knowledge of the marginal cost function of each generator to the regulator to design appropriate policy measures geared to the promotion of competitive market conditions. We propose a new market surveillance mechanism, which is based on the principle of sanctioning excessive deviations from the estimated measure of the marginal cost function presented in this work.

Commonly-suffered job burnout is a form of job burnout caused by external factors. It is closely related to task characteristics rather than individual idiosyncrasies. To explore the causes of commonly-suffered job burnout, the special attributes (the integrated output attributes, conditional output attributes, and public goods attributes) of coal mine safety output and the inevitability of the invalidation of the bounded authority in safety supervision were analyzed in this study, which reveals the formation mechanism of commonly-suffered job burnout. Moreover, a confirmatory game model was constructed to analyze how the attributes of the safety output and bounded authority of safety supervision act on the safety output. The theoretical connotation of commonly-suffered job burnout was explained based on the job demands-resources theory. A comparative analysis of commonly-suffered job burnout and the job burnout that occurs in the traditional research object was also undertaken from the viewpoint of the job demands, which are determined by the characteristics of the work task and their corresponding coping resources. Policy suggestions were given based on interventions in commonly-suffered job burnout. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the energy certificate is intended to provide the characteristics of individual buildings, so stimulating the real estate market toward ever better energy performance, data management of the certificates issued over time, using a national or regional energy cadastre, makes available a data base which is useful for energy planning in the building sector. This paper provides the needed results of a benchmarking study on data from the energy cadastre of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. By integrating data from the energy cadastre (175.778 energy certificates) with the statistical data obtained from the national census, indicators were obtained on the energy performance of existing buildings. The energy indicators obtained, characterised by building type and construction period, normalised as a function of Degree-Days, become an effective tool for energy planning at local and regional scales. In the specific case, the energy indicators have been used to estimate the potential for energy retrofit of existing buildings in the Lombardy Region. The same indicators can also be used by municipalities for energy planning at the municipal or district level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The first two margins have been studied extensively, however the third has received scant attention. How significant is this 'intensive margin'? What would be the optimal policies when it is taken into account? The paper develops and analyzes a simple model of the technical and behavioral mechanisms that determine the volume emissions produced by a car. The results show that an optimal fuel tax would provide drivers with appropriate incentives along all three margins and that only public information is needed for a fuel tax to be set optimally. In contrast, an optimal distance tax would require private information. Lastly, relative to the optimal fuel tax, a simple uniform fuel tax is shown to be progressive.

We use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Canadian economy and disaggregate households into deciles by annual income using data from a large household expenditure survey. Using the model, we find that the existing BC carbon tax is highly progressive even prior to consideration of the revenue recycling scheme, such that the negative impact of the carbon tax on households with below-median income is smaller than that on households with above-median income. We show that our finding is a result of welfare effects of a carbon tax being determined primarily by the source of a households' income rather than by the destination of its expenditures. Finally, we show that the existing revenue recycling scheme is also progressive. Overall, the tax appears to be highly progressive. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We do so by testing hypotheses grounded in diffusion and finance theory and the literature on the barriers to energy efficiency. Using two large surveys of UK households, we explore the adoption of nine technologies. Our results indicate 'investment inefficiency' amongst household adopters occurs for two reasons. First, contrary to notions of rational choice, we find a negative relationship between the investment return of technologies and their level of diffusion. Second, we show adopters of these technologies display characteristics broadly consistent with diffusion theory, contradicting the prediction of finance theory that investment return, not individual characteristics, should drive adoption. We also find that policy has played a role in inducing the diffusion of these technologies and that tenure and spill-over effects are important in adoption. Finally, adoption is motivated more by a desire to save money than by environmental concern. We conclude by giving examples of how our research can lead to better policy timing and targeting.

The non-sustainable credit policies practiced by banks before the crisis have largely contributed to this distress. In particular in emerging markets, an easy access to credits has generated, after the financial turbulences, a considerable amount of non-performing loans which have subsequently affected the banks' profitability. In addition, the need for an increased capitalization is also susceptible of negatively influencing the profitability in the short-run. Against this background, we test the influence of financial soundness indicators on the banks' profitability, at the macro-level, in a set of emerging countries. Different from previous studies which assess the impact of the banking sector characteristics and of the macroeconomic context on the profitability, we focus on the internal conditions of banks. Using the IMF monthly data for the period 2005-2013 and a panel data approach, we discover that non-performing loans have a negative impact on banks' profitability under the fixed effect model. While the level of liquidity has a mixed influence, the capitalization and the interest rate margins positively affect the banks' profitability. As expected, the non-interest expenses negatively impact the profitability. The results prove robust either if we use the return on assets or the return on equity indicator to measure the level of profitability. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In fact, qanats may be considered as the first long-distance water transfer system. Qanats are an ancient water transfer system found in arid regions wherein groundwater from mountainous areas, aquifers and sometimes from rivers, was brought to points of re-emergence such as an oasis, through one or more underground tunnels. The tunnels, many of which were kilometers in length, had designed for slopes to provide gravitational flow. The tunnels allowed water to drain out to the surface by gravity to supply water to lower and flatter agricultural land. Qanats are up to 3000 years old artificial sub-horizontal underground water channels, 5 to 80 km long, widespread in Iran, but also common in western China, Arabia and the Mediterranean; they were excavated from the bottom of vertical shafts, starting from their exit and advancing upstream till main, productive wells, constructed at the very beginning of the project were met. In this paper, structure, function and also distribution of qanats in Iran are illustrated using library documents. According to the results, qanat is the most sustainable technology for groundwater management and also complies with social, environmental and economic circumstances of the region.

Target costing as a modern method of calculation uses the principles of value analysis, by using instruments of functional cost analysis and quantitative-function deployment can provide a functional differentiation of the product. This approach has a high importance for quality assurance in pre-production phase and it's increasing. Application of target costing is growing in praxis still. Target costing calculation introduce system approach to quantify costs of product in the phase of constructive and development activities of production. Comparison target costing calculation and traditional calculation show target gap. Target costing calculation is new modern instrument that it facilitates to manage price of product by the customers' requirements. The price is determined by market and customer's needs. In this phase is possible to fix costs of product. In praxis we often meet with situation where the price of product is very high and customer is not ready to pay so much.

The reclaimed Dutch type pilot-polder of Messolonghi was chosen as study area, because of its characteristics. The area is most likely dedicated to agriculture and was reclaimed from the sea during the decade of 1960-1969. In this context, samples were taken from different locations and depths in an experimental field located in the campus of TEI of Western Greece. The results of the soil texture analysis showed that the selected field's soil is clay loamy - loamy. In order to investigate the water retention curves, undisturbed samples were taken at 30 cm and 60 cm from three points of the field and the analysis was performed with pressure plate apparatus from 0.33 to 6 bar. The field saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated by Guelph permeameter at 21 points placed in a regular grid for three different depths, i.e. 15-30-60 cm.

What we propose to do and how? To streamline the national innovation policy and in order to save resources, you must create a national body - the Office of innovative development of Kazakhstan under the President. This institution is designed to not only build innovative priorities of the country, but perform all the functions of innovation management at the macro level: planning, organization, control, motivation, control and coordination. It is this office is authorized to determine the structure of the industry responsible for the results of innovation and strategic program to develop regional innovation cluster. In turn, the regional innovation strategy of clustering involves not only the use of natural and geographical potential of the territory, but also the creation of all the necessary elements of an innovative missing basic infrastructure around the university.

For many decades, numerous approaches have been proposed for the consistent estimation of PET at several time scales of interest. The most recognized is the Penman-Monteith formula, which is yet difficult to apply in data-scarce areas, since it requires simultaneous observations of four meteorological variables (temperature, sunshine duration, humidity, wind velocity). For this reason, parsimonious models with minimum input data requirements are strongly preferred. Typically, these have been developed and tested for specific hydroclimatic conditions, but when they are applied in different regimes they provide much less reliable (and in some cases misleading) estimates. Therefore, it is essential to develop generic methods that remain parsimonious, in terms of input data and parameterization, yet they also allow for some kind of local adjustment of their parameters, through calibration. In this study we present a recent parametric formula, based on a simplified formulation of the original Penman-Monteith expression, which only requires mean daily or monthly temperature data. The method is evaluated using meteorological records from different areas worldwide, at both the daily and monthly time scales. The outcomes of this extended analysis are very encouraging, as indicated by the substantially high validation scores of the proposed approach across all examined data sets. In general, the parametric model outperforms well-established methods of the everyday practice, since it ensures optimal approximation of potential evapotranspiration. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This assessment provides a methodology that establishes a causal relationship between policy implementation and energy conservation effects. To enhance the confidence in the research findings, this assessment applies two distinctive and independent approaches: one top-down and the other bottom-up. This assessment finds that industrial energy efficiency policies collectively achieved energy savings of 322 Mtce (9.4 EJ) against the baseline scenario. This accounted for 59% of the sector's total energy savings from 2006 to 2010. The remaining energy savings were realised through autonomous technology improvement (33%) and sector-level structural shift (8%). Correspondingly, cumulative avoided CO2 emissions realised through energy efficiency policies amounted to 760 million tons. This assessment concludes that industrial energy efficiency policies were effective in realising energy conservation targets, but energy conservation effects were not achieved in a cost-effective way. Command and control measures were dominantly implemented, with economic incentives and informational measures taking a complementary role; while market based instruments did not play an important role. As China is planning on implementing a nationwide emissions trading scheme, special attention needs to be paid to policy interaction and coordination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the removal of such subsidies may release a sizeable portion of a country's national budget for use on more productive targets. One of the most recognized challenges of such reform is selling the new energy prices to citizens, particularly those with a more fragile purchasing power. Several empirical and technical studies have prescribed that the reform might be supported by a direct compensation mechanism in order to ensure feasibility. This is what was done during the recent energy subsidy reform in Iran. However, the compensation mechanism implemented in Iran's reform was successful at the beginning, but did not proceed as expected. This has raised questions about the feasibility and sustainability of the direct compensation mechanism, and even of the reform policy itself. In this paper, we consider a stylized model where direct compensation is the instrument proposed to restore consumers' utility against increased energy prices. We find that, when prices of Other Goods are affected by the announced reform policy, the feasibility of a subsidy reform critically depends on the value of certain parameters: the initial subsidization rate, the share of energy in the consumers' bundle, and the energy portion of price of Other Goods.

We offer two different and complementary perspectives to explore the dynamics of energy technology diffusion and progress. We first develop a Solowtype efficiency-improving model of energy technological progress which is described by improvements in primary energy-augmenting efficiency. We further provide a Romer type variety-expanding model of energy technological progress which is represented by the expansion of differentiated varieties of primary energy technology blueprints. Analysis based on two different models reaches consistent results: there are potential forces in the world economy- working through ITD- that pull individual countries to advance energy technology, ensuring a cross-country convergence in the growth rates of energy technology in the balanced growth path. While ITD plays a role in a cross-country convergence in technological growth rates, cross-country differences in the efficiency of undertaking indigenous research and the capacity of absorbing foreign technology spillovers would lead to a cross-country divergence in the absolute levels of energy technology.

However it remains doubtful whether normative feedback would generate significant energy savings in absence of financial accountability and whether the normative feedback is influenced by the proximity of the comparison groups. Here we test various normative feedback approaches at the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, with an objective of understanding this approach. We show that the normative feedback approach can lead to 3.4% energy savings, even when residents are not billed for their electricity usage. Through an analysis of covariance, this paper evaluates the effects of different proximities of comparison and concludes that a street-level comparison level can generate the highest energy savings of 5.4%. Furthermore, this paper also explores and defines the relationship between electricity savings and physical variables including home size, unit type, neighborhood, and the variation of cooling degree days. The study contributes to the understanding of how to realizing the full potential of normative feedback approach in energy savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Four prototypical development regimes are identified from international practice: (1) the private developer-oriented Metroland model dating back to the suburbanisation of London in the nineteenth century England; (2) the private household-led special district model, which can be observed in many contemporary US suburbs; (3) the public planning-regulated model, as featured in most post-war European welfare state countries, including the present-day UK; (4) the public state-as-developer model, which characterises what has been taking place in China. A repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on the results of a large number of cellular automata simulations suggests no significant difference between models I and II in terms of their welfare outcomes measured by aggregate utility.

In response to this, much scientific work has chiefly focussed on analysing the biofuel domain and on giving policy advice and recommendations. Although innovation has been acknowledged as one of the key factors in sustainable and cost-effective biofuel development, there is an urgent need to investigate technological trajectories in the biofuel sector by starting from consistent data and appropriate methodological tools. To do so, this work proposes a procedure to select patent data unequivocally related to the investigated sector, it uses co-occurrence of technological terms to compute patent similarity and highlights content and interdependencies of biofuels technological trajectories by revealing hidden topics from unstructured patent text fields.

With the growth of the sector, discussions about competing land uses are likely to increase. For a better understanding of the synergies between agricultural land, its role and bioenergy the perception of the different stakeholders will play an important role. The perception of stakeholders related to AD, feedstock and energy crop production was investigated through interviews and a stakeholder workshop. The results indicated that from an AD operator and feedstock producer perspective, on-farm AD is more an additional activity integrated into existing agricultural systems than a renewable energy technology. The risk of a shift in agricultural practices and large areas to grow energy crops for AD is seen as low for the UK. Nonetheless, land use and related challenges need to be considered as the demand for AD feedstocks increases with the fast growth of the sector. Considering the synergies between bioenergy and agriculture as well as the motivations and benefits perceived by stakeholders will play an important role in a successful policy design to provide the required emission reduction in both sectors without subverting sustainability.

We claim that to understand public acceptance, we need to go beyond the current thinking of citizens framed as passive respondents to proposed projects, and instead view infrastructure projects as enacted by citizens in their local settings. We propose a combination of sensemaking theory and actor-network theory that allows insight into how citizens enact entities from experiences and surroundings in order to create meaning and form a reaction to new infrastructure projects. Empirically, we analyze how four citizens make sense of an electricity cable project through a conversation process with a representative from the infrastructure developer. Interestingly, the formal participation process and the materiality of the cable play minor roles in citizens' sensemaking process. We conclude that insight into the way citizens are making sense of energy infrastructure processes can improve and help to overcome shortcomings in the current thinking about public acceptance and public participation.

We present the first U.S. national-level assessment of state RPS program benefits and impacts, focusing on new renewable electricity resources used to meet RPS compliance obligations in 2013. In our central-case scenario, reductions in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from displaced fossil fuel-generated electricity resulted in $2.2 billion of global benefits. Health and environmental benefits from reductions in criteria air pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter 2.5) were even greater, estimated at $5.2 billion in the central case. Further benefits accrued in the form of reductions in water withdrawals and consumption for power generation. Finally, although best considered resource transfers rather than net societal benefits, new renewable electricity generation used for RPS compliance in 2013 also supported nearly 200,000 U.S.-based gross jobs and reduced wholesale electricity prices and natural gas prices, saving consumers a combined $1.3-$4.9 billion. In total, the estimated benefits and impacts well-exceed previous estimates of RPS compliance costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings show that competition policies - particularly reducing the degree of vertical integration and increasing privatization - correlate negatively with emission intensity. However, the environmental effect of reducing market entry barriers is generally insignificant. Integration of competition and stringent environmental policies are required to reduce GHG emissions and improve environmental quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As in former research, we show that workers tend at the same time to agglomerate in order to limit trade costs of manufactured goods and to scatter in order to alleviate the burden of urban costs due to large urban areas. In this paper, special attention is paid to the role of congestion, which acts as a dispersion force and hampers workers from agglomerating in the same urban area. We show that the development of public transport, or the construction of road infrastructure, modifies the spatial organization of the economy and fosters agglomeration, as it reduces congestion.","[Allio, Cedric] CIRED, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech,"Allio, C (通讯作者)，CIRED, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",allio@centre-cired.fr,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The ACI is defined as the energy-related CO2 emissions in electricity production divided by the electricity produced. It is a performance indicator since a decrease in its value is a desirable outcome from the environmental and climate change viewpoints. From 1990 to 2013, the ACI computed at the global level decreased only marginally. However, fairly substantial decreases were observed in many countries. This apparent anomaly arises from a geographical shift in global electricity production with countries having a high ACI increasingly taking up a larger electricity production share. It is found that globally and in most major electricity producing countries, reduction in their ACI was due mainly to improvements in the thermal efficiency of electricity generation rather than to fuel switching. Estimates of the above mentioned effects are made using LMDI decomposition analysis. Our study reveals several challenges in reducing global CO2 emissions from the electricity production sector although technically the reduction potential for the sector is known to be great.

The urban sample is composed of Taiwanese aborigines who migrated to cities from their native locales while the rural sample is composed of aborigines who reside in aboriginal villages. Sample data are collected through questionnaire surveys conducted in 2009 and 2012. Results indicate that rural aborigines have a lower unemployment rate but less stable employment than urban aborigines. Employed rural aborigines receive slightly higher salaries and incur higher commuting cost than employed urban aborigines. However, regardless of where the aborigines live (i.e., urban or rural areas), increased job accessibility is not related to employment and employment stability, but significantly increases aboriginal salary. Moreover, improved job accessibility increases the commuting time of rural aborigines, but its effects on the commuting time of urban aborigines depend on the travel mode. Empirical evidence implies that migrating to cities can be both beneficial and fruitless for aboriginal employment, and that the effects of accessibility on the employment of Taiwanese aborigines in urban and rural areas are both similar to and different from those of non-aborigines documented in previous studies.","[Lin, Jen-Jia; Chen, Chi-Hau; Hsieh, Tsung-Yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lin, JJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",jenjia@ntu.edu.tw; cch_1012@hotmail.com; aryuiman@hotmail.com,,,,,,,52,4,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

As we move into the twenty-first century, however, the object of study is changing dramatically in that the majority US population will soon be minorities; this is already the case in many locales, and other countries are experiencing similar shifts. To recount this dynamic and provide context, the paper begins by considering the US city pre-World War II, ethnic enclaves, and their transition to the present day-giving rise to an immigrant ethos that remains prevalent. Attention then turns to general frameworks related to the immigrant experience, and their future applicability. Considered next is the current state of majoritizing the minority. As one outcome, urban neighborhoods will become demographically diverse and reflect socioeconomic differences rather than racial/ethnic ones; that is, in the jargon of past research, neighborhood composition will be determined by Class more than Culture. This should be largely driven by market forces as mediated by elements such as social networks (formal and informal) and personal preferences. Inertia effects also would operate to slow, but not eliminate, shifts in the urban landscape. Conceptually, these forces are represented by Market-Led Pluralism and Resurgent Ethnicity. Regarding other likely futures, as acculturation occurs a substantial increase in intermarriage is expected, leading to A Blended America. Economic shifts also play into the future as nations of the Global South strengthen, while production in the Global North becomes more automated. Hence, immigration will continue, but from different origins; and the overall level will be lower, leading to A Shrinking Nation.","[Brown, Lawrence A.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Brown, LA (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",brown.8@osu.edu,,,,,,,87,1,2,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Yet local climate policies suffer from a lack of scientific understanding and evaluation methods able to support the definition of efficient mitigation strategies. The purpose of this paper is to build on classical approaches in the energy policy field that exist at the national and international level to propose an urban MACCs methodology able to fulfill this lack and inform local debates. The methodology is an extension of static expert-based MACCs; it combines a land use transport integrated model and an abatement cost methodology that integrates co-benefits, and takes into account the spatial and systemic dimensions of cities. The methodology is implemented for the transportation sector of a mid-sized European city (Grenoble, France). Our results present the cost-effectiveness and political feasibility of several proposed measures. We find that the inclusion of co-benefits can profoundly change the cost-benefit assessment of transport mitigation options. Moreover we underline the key parameters determining the cost-effectiveness ranking of mitigation options. These urban MACCs aim to serve as a bridge between urban planning and mitigation policies and can thus contribute to strengthen and align sustainable and climate change agendas at the local level.

Using microdata from the 2007 to 2009 rounds Of the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey, we estimate a complete system of demand augmented with information on gasoline excise taxes. By relying on a complete system of demand, we are able to estimate elasticities that take behavioral responses into account. Crucially, the model allows gasoline taxes to affect demand in two distinct ways: through relative prices and as long-run policy signals. Different increases in gasoline taxes are considered for simulation. A 13.2 cent/gallon tax increase, corresponding to a $15/tCO(2) carbon tax, is found to cause, in the long run, a reduction-in gasoline demand that is about seven times as big as that induced by an equal market-induced price increase. The same measure of differential demand response is derived for tax increases different in size as well as by income quintile and by region. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of corrective taxation in the private transport sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This test is a multivariate extension of the kernel-based Granger causality test in tail event. The main advantage of this test is its ability to examine a large number of lags, with higher-order lags discounted. In addition, our test is highly flexible because it can be used to identify Granger causality in specific regions on the distribution supports, such as the center or tails. We prove that the test converges asymptotically to a standard Gaussian distribution under the null hypothesis and thus is free of parameter estimation uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the excellent small sample size and power properties of the test. This new test is applied to a set of European stock markets to analyze spillovers during the recent European crisis and to distinguish contagion from interdependence effects.","[Candelon, Bertrand] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Chaire Financial Stabil & System Risks Insti, Paris, France; [Tokpavi, Sessi] Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, Nanterre, France",IPAG Business School; Universite Paris Saclay,"Candelon, B (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Chaire Financial Stabil & System Risks Insti, Paris, France.;Tokpavi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, Nanterre, France.",candelonb@gmail.com; sessi.tokpavi@u-paris10.fr,"Tokpavi, Sessi/E-6504-2019","candelon, bertrand/0000-0002-0134-6498; Tokpavi, Sessi/0000-0002-9187-8083",,,,,33,45,47,2,32,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Implementation of RPS favorably affects renewable energy supply and rural development while reducing the land available for meeting demand for food and feed resulting from global population growth. Even in the vast Great Plains of the United States, land requirements are primary considerations between increasing renewable energy capacity and food and feed production. This study applied life cycle assessment (LCA) and project economics to estimate and compare the land intensity and profitability of anaerobic digestion and wind energy projects in the Great Plains. The results show that significantly more energy and revenue can be generated per hectare of land using wind versus anaerobic digestion. Economically, the benefit-to-cost ratios of wind farms were almost twice as favorable as anaerobic digester facilities. Wind farms have consistent benefit-to-cost ratios of 2.15 while the anaerobic digester facilities benefit to cost ratios range from 1.2 to 1.25. Legislature changes to RPS could incentivize increasing the number of anaerobic digesters while also assisting in reversing the current trend of diminishing dairy farms while reducing climate change risks and creating new economic opportunities for renewable energy.

An optimization model of personal carbon trading is proposed, and then, an equilibrium carbon price is derived according to the market clearing condition. Based on the derived equilibrium carbon price, this paper proposes a calculation method of tiered gasoline pricing. Then, sensitivity analyses and consumers' surplus analyses are conducted. It can be shown that a rise in gasoline price or a more generous allowance allocation would incur a decrease in the equilibrium carbon price, making the first tiered price higher, but the second tiered price lower. It is further verified that the proposed tiered pricing method is progressive because it would relieve the pressure of the low-income groups who consume less gasoline while imposing a greater burden on the high-income groups who consume more gasoline.

The empirical analysis based on non-spatial and spatial simultaneous equations models reveals that an increase in the informal employment growth in industry is positively associated with an increase in the formal employment at the same delegation, and vice versa. For the construction activities, the results show that the formal and informal sectors are opposite. With respect to agglomeration externalities, we find positive effects of local competition on employment growth for both formal and informal sectors. Furthermore, we find that formal employment is higher in delegations with higher average monthly wage and high levels of net migration.","[Amara, Mohamed] High Inst Management Sousse, 763 St Abdelaziz El Behi, Sousse 4000, Tunisia",,"Amara, M (通讯作者)，High Inst Management Sousse, 763 St Abdelaziz El Behi, Sousse 4000, Tunisia.",mohamed.amara.isg@gmail.com,"Mohamed, Amara/KBQ-2581-2024",/0000-0002-8213-6635,,,,,64,2,2,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Research suggests that IHDs can support energy consumption reduction, but also that engagement with IHDs can be limited to men and is often short-term. In this paper, we draw on research carried out in Smart Communities, a two-year project in which electricity and gas consumption feedback played a key role. This study was distinctive because it was accompanied by a weekly email communications programme and was provided within the context of community action. Project findings suggest that, although by no means panaceas, approaches such as these can support long-term engagement with energy consumption feedback, including by women, and can support behaviour change.

This study investigates the factors that influence renewable energy technology acceptance in Peninsular Malaysia and attempts to show the impact of cost and knowledge on the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of renewable energy technology. The results show that cost of renewable energy has an indirect effect on attitudes towards using renewable energy through the associated impact on the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The results also indicate that public knowledge in Peninsular Malaysia does not affect perceived ease of use, although the positive impact of knowledge on perceived usefulness is supported. Furthermore, our results show that the current business environment in Peninsular Malaysia does not support the adoption of renewable energy technology, and thus, renewable energy technology is not commercially viable in Peninsular Malaysia. Additionally, the population of Peninsular Malaysia associates the use of renewable energy with a high level of effort and therefore has a negative attitude towards the use of renewable energy technology. There is, therefore, a definite need to pay more attention to the role of public perception and awareness in the successes and failures of renewable energy policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation technology was used for elective practical sessions in a pathophysiology course, with both measurable outcomes and students' feedback evaluated. This study was conducted in Slovakia with volunteers (n = 22), who were 3rd-year students of General Medicine (simulation group), paired with classmates in traditional seminars (control group; n = 22) with the same achievement grades. The control group had completed traditional seminars, whereas the simulation group had completed simulation-based seminars in cardiovascular pathophysiology. A standardized student feedback survey, visual analogue scale, and credit tests for regular pathophysiology were used to perform the analysis. Subjective feedback suggested positive outcomes in approximately 80% of students.

Addressing the endogeneity of migration and human capital, a dynamic panel data model within the framework of beta-convergence is applied, accounting for spatial effects. The regressions indicate that out-migration has a negative but modest effect on regional growth; the expected effect of skill selection is only partly confirmed. In the East German subsample, in-migration increases growth independently of its human capital effect; in West Germany, in-migration lowers growth per se, but this negative impact is offset by the growth-stimulating forces of migrants' skills.","[Kubis, Alexander] Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Schneider, Lutz] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Coburg, Friedrich Streib Str 2, D-96406 Coburg, Germany; [Schneider, Lutz] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Kleine Maerkerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Kubis, A (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Alexander.Kubis@iab.de; Lutz.Schneider@hs-coburg.de,"Schneider, Lutz/ADQ-1801-2022","Schneider, Lutz/0000-0002-3686-0753",EU Commission under Framework Programme 7 [290657],EU Commission under Framework Programme 7,"This research was partially financed by the EU Commission under Framework Programme 7, Theme 8 Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (grant agreement number 290657 [Growth-Innovation-Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe].

One response to these challenges is to diversify into activities that maintain a link with fishing but which are not subject to restrictions on fishing effort and output. This paper explores diversification among inshore fishermen in the English Channel and proposes a conceptual framework to understand this strategy. The findings indicate that fishermen will typically seek to adapt their fishing behaviour before considering diversification, and some will resist diversification altogether due to economic and sociocultural constraints.","[Morgan, Richard] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Morgan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",richard.morgan@myport.ac.uk,,,European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"Research for this paper was conducted as part of the project CHARM 3 (Channel Integrated Approach to Marine Resource Management), selected within the scope of the INTERREG IV A France (Channel)-England Cross-Border European Cooperation Programme, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).",,42,10,12,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper aims to reflect own contributions to the development of management theory and management practice in Romania. First of all, the proposed scientific approach is a positivist approach, because it envisages the interposition of own reflections, an observation of what is happening in the market, an authentic presentation as it is. The main objective of this scientific research is to highlight the importance of social media as a mean of business development by creating new opportunities through promotion and a better brand visibility in the market. In the literature we have outlined a number of methods to assess the way in which companies approach the CRM: call method, the interview, the questionnaire, etc. Quantitative investigation of this paper was conducted based on assessment questionnaire, addressed to the employees of some Romanian companies. The qualitative investigation was conducted at the end of the research, based on analysis and structuring the information obtained. In this paper there were analyzed three elements: management position with the implementation of a CRM system; CRM to SCRM transition and the use of the new SM technologies in the implementation of a CRM system; applying of a SCRM system using social media platforms. As a result of the conducted study it was found that the media is one of the main trainers of public opinion, if not the main, controlling the public sphere. It conveys information, but also it controls and steers the public opinion. Thus, SM can form quickly enough media crisis to lower the public favorability for certain companies or politicians. In this way, by resorting to specific Social Media tools, the companies can obtain crucial information for evaluating the consumer satisfaction, information that would be more difficult to obtain traditionally.

This offers market participants a possibility to reduce their expected imbalances and to offer own unused flexibility. Because this form of distributed balancing before the period of delivery can be profitable for market participants as well as beneficial for system operations, intraday trading is expected to gain more importance in future, especially with increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources in the generation mix. So far, intraday markets are still a research field with many open questions. This paper contributes by a first analysis of intraday trades on ELBAS, one of the European intraday markets. The analysis gives a detailed picture on trading activity and price development and is intended to improve understanding of continuous intraday trading. Findings include that trading activity differs significantly between price zones, that most trades occur in the last hours before gate closure and that market participants have to handle substantial price variations during the trading period. The paper also investigates the imbalance settlement rules in the Nordic countries and studies which effects one- and two-price imbalance settlement systems have on the market participants' profitability of intraday trading.

In 2014, the National Accounting Council of Albania (NACA) performed a major revision of this existing framework of NAS. The focus of this paper is to analyze the current status, as well as the development of accounting and financial reporting in Albania for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). An international standard of financial reporting for SMEs was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but was not fully endorsed by the European Community, nor by the NACA, who instead chose to revise their current NAS. In this study, we provide a general overview of the accounting regime and platforms currently applied in Albania, by focusing on the changes over the recent years. We also depict the main differences between the IFRS for SMEs and the NAS in Albania in treatment of several elements of the financial statements.","[Shkurti, Rezarta; Duraj, Brunilda] Univ Tirana, Fac Econ, Tirana, Albania",University of Tirana (UT),"Shkurti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tirana, Fac Econ, Tirana, Albania.",rezartaperri@feut.edu.al; durajbruna@gmail.com,"Shkurti, Rezarta/GRX-2144-2022","Shkurti, Rezarta/0000-0002-2126-2339",,,,,9,1,1,0,1,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,92,97,,10.12955/cbup.v4.748,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000015,0

The hypotheses are then proposed and tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling technique (SME). The analysis reveals that service quality and customer satisfaction are important antecedents of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction mediates the effects of service quality on customer loyalty.

It discusses the peculiarities of organizing an information-psychological warfare during military conflicts. The goal of our research is to explore how social groups might perceive peculiarities in the information-psychological warfare. The research involves methods of survey, content analysis, and free associations. The effectiveness of psychological warfare significantly depends on how people perceive information. Consequently, in the contemporary world, it is necessary to not only protect or fight on the battlefield, but also to use information weapons. This imposes requirements on psychological scientists to explore peculiarities around the perception of information to help find mechanisms that safeguard people's lives by way of contributing to the formation of necessary attitudes and stereotypes.","[Zeynalyan, Nane] Publ Adm Acad Republ Armenia, Yerevan, Armenia",,"Zeynalyan, N (通讯作者)，Publ Adm Acad Republ Armenia, Yerevan, Armenia.",nanezeynalyan@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,8,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,499,504,,10.12955/cbup.v4.803,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000072,0

Against this background, we investigate the future potential of decentralized Power-to-Heat (P2H) as an additional demand-side flexibility option for the German electricity system. Precisely, we analyze the case of hybrid systems, where conventional gas and oil condensing boiler systems are equipped-with an electric heating rod. In contrast to previous approaches, we set our focus on the economic incentives at household level: only if the switch to a P2H-hybrid system can reduce individual heating expenses significantly, a considerable number of these systems will be installed. For this purpose, we implemented an integrated approach combining three distinct simulation modules. First, a stochastic simulation of the electricity spot market prices in 2020 was conducted. Second, average heat load profiles were generated based on a standard bottom-up analysis. Both results were then fed into an optimization model calculating the cost-minimizing paths of heat generation at household level during the year 2020. The simulated annual savings prove modest as long as household electricity prices are not heavily reduced through political influence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While natural gas will reduce local air pollutants, such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter, the implications for greenhouse gases depend on how the natural gas is extracted, processed, distributed, and used. Applying a technology warming potential (TWP) approach, natural gas as a marine fuel achieves climate parity within 30 years for diesel ignited engines, though could take up to 190 years to reach climate parity with conventional fuels in a spark ignited engine. Movement towards natural gas as a marine fuel continues to progress, and conditions exist in some regions to make a near-term transition to natural gas feasible. Liquefied natural gas in marine transportation is likely to be incentivized where economics favoring natural gas is coupled with air emissions public policy targets. To ensure that climate neutral conversion is achieved with the least delay, TWP results highlight the important role of energy policy for infrastructure development of upstream pathways and onboard ship systems technology innovation.

Although this question has been hotly debated among researchers for decades, the answers yielded so far are ambiguous and inconclusive. The paper proposes an innovative approach that takes not only interregional differences in unemployment rates, but also in unemployment duration and the human capital of the unemployed, that is, in the structure of regional unemployment into account. Both, the skill structure of the unemployed and the share of long-term unemployment are found to have an important impact on regional start-up activity. Moreover, the impact of unemployment structure on new firm formation is found to vary with the knowledge-intensity of the start-ups.","[Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Studies, 1315 East 10th St,SPEA Room 201, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Dohse, Dirk] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Niebuhr, Annekatrin] Inst Employment Res IAB Nord, D-24106 Kiel, Germany; [Niebuhr, Annekatrin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Audretsch, DB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Studies, 1315 East 10th St,SPEA Room 201, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",daudrets@indiana.edu; dirk.dohse@ifw-kiel.de; Annekatrin.Niebuhr@iab.de,,"Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Niebuhr, Annekatrin/0000-0001-8218-0954",,,,,69,19,23,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

When public utilities are under political control, price setting may be affected by political incentives. Besides theories like the political budget cycle, more current research stresses the role of spatial interactions between jurisdictions (yardstick competition). The paper tests for both local political determinants and yardstick competition using a spatial lag model. The results suggest that water prices are lower when political competition is strong and before elections. At the same time the magnitude of the political budget cycle appears to depend upon neighbouring jurisdictions, thus confirming yardstick competition as an indirect determinant of water prices.","[Klien, Michael] Sorbonne Business Sch, Chaire EPPP, F-75240 Paris 05, France",,"Klien, M (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Business Sch, Chaire EPPP, 21 Rue Broca, F-75240 Paris 05, France.",mcl.klien@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,6,7,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Here, we discuss long-term energy-system developments in Africa using results of a recent model inter-comparison study on global climate policy. We focus on Africa's role in the wider global energy system and in global climate mitigation. The results show a considerable spread in model outcomes, emphasizing the large uncertainty regarding Africa's energy future. Without climate policy, Africa's share in global energy-related CO2 emissions is projected to increase to 3-23% by 2100. Emissions become significant on a global scale only after 2050. In none of the model projections the international ambition to provide universal modern energy access by 2030 is achieved. Furthermore, although the continent is currently a large net exporter of oil and natural gas, towards 2050 the model projections emphasize that Africa needs most of its resources for its rapidly growing domestic demand. However, the projected rapid expansion of their energy system also implies that Africa gains importance in global mitigation action. An important challenge is to align the increasing investments in the energy system with climate policy and potential revenues from international carbon trading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Do differences in the exposure to Chinese imports lead to differences in local labour market outcomes? An analysis for Spanish provinces, Regional Studies. In the period 1999-2007 Spanish imports from China multiplied six times, making that Asian country the fourth largest supplier to the Spanish economy. This paper analyses whether this massive increase in imports impacted on the labour markets of Spanish provinces to differing degrees, due to differences in their initial productive specialization. The results show that Spanish provinces with a higher exposure to Chinese imports experienced larger drops in manufacturing employment as a share of the working-age population. However, this reduction was compensated for by increases in non-manufacturing employment.","[Donoso, Vicente; Minondo, Asier] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, E-28223 Pozuelo De Alarcon, Spain; [Martin, Victor] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, E-28032 Vicalvaro, Spain; [Minondo, Asier] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, E-20012 San Sebastian, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Deusto,"Donoso, V (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Campus Somosaguas, E-28223 Pozuelo De Alarcon, Spain.",vdonoso@ccee.ucm.es; victor.martin@urjc.es; aminondo@deusto.es,"Minondo, Asier/G-1769-2015; Martin, Victor/ABG-3718-2020","Minondo, Asier/0000-0001-8566-1278; Martin, Victor/0000-0003-2001-7283","Complutense Institute for International Studies (ICEI), Complutense University, Madrid; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MINECO ECO2010-21643, ECO2011-27619]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER); Basque Government Department of Education, Language Policy and Culture; [HAR2010-18544]","Complutense Institute for International Studies (ICEI), Complutense University, Madrid; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Basque Government Department of Education, Language Policy and Culture;","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Complutense Institute for International Studies (ICEI), Complutense University, Madrid; the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [grant numbers MINECO ECO2010-21643 and ECO2011-27619], co-financed with the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER), and HAR2010-18544; and from the Basque Government Department of Education, Language Policy and Culture.",,29,46,48,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This builds on the idea that 'middle' agents in networks can be an important lever for socio-technical change. The study demonstrates the considerable impact the FM can have on workplace energy consumption, whilst identifying a number of factors that constrain their agency and capacity to act. These include demands to meet workforce expectations of comfort; a lack of support from senior management; and a shortage of resources. Underlying these challenges, the study identifies three different energy rationales - that is to say conceptual frameworks - which are deployed by different groups of organisational actors. The challenges of reconciling these at-times-contradictory rationales results in a picture of energy management which to the outsider can appear highly irrational. The paper concludes with a consideration of how policy makers can apply these insights to support energy reduction in workplaces. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The literature has still widely neglected the role of peripheral network positions for innovation processes. In addition to this, little is known about the determinants affecting a peripheral actors' ability to reach the core. To shed some light on these issues, we have employed a unique longitudinal dataset encompassing the entire population of German laser source manufacturers (LSMs) and laser-related public research organizations (PROs) over a period of more than two decades. The aim of our paper is threefold. First, we analyze the emergence of core-periphery (CP) patterns in the German laser industry. Then, we explore the paths on which LSMs and PROs move from isolated positions toward the core. Finally, we employ non-parametric event history techniques to analyze the extent to which organizational and geographical determinates affect the propensity and timing of network core entries. Our results indicate the emergence and solidification of CP patterns at the overall network level. We also found that the paths on which organizations traverse through the network are characterized by high levels of heterogeneity and volatility. The transition from peripheral to core positions is impacted by organizational characteristics, while an organization's geographical location does not play a significant role.","[Kudic, Muhamed] Wissensch Stat GmbH, Stifterverband, Essen, Germany; [Ehrenfeld, Wilfried] Halle Inst Econ Res, IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Pusch, Toralf] Inst Econ & Social Res, WSI, Dusseldorf, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Kudic, M (通讯作者)，Wissensch Stat GmbH, Stifterverband, Essen, Germany.",muhamed.kudic@stifterverband.de; wilfried.ehrenfeld@iwh-halle.de; toralf-pusch@boeckler.de,,"Kudic, Muhamed/0000-0003-3677-8300",,,,,54,8,8,3,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Multiple facets of industrial structure at the regional scale, including competitive structure, are considered together by exploiting confidential microdata to construct and evaluate detailed metrics across broad geographic and industrial ranges.

Meantime, China is a large transitional economy with significant regional gaps. Against such backgrounds, the calculated results of energy and carbon performance indicators may be biased, without considering heterogeneity across regions. To this end, after incorporating region-heterogeneity, this paper provides detailed information, regarding energy efficiency, carbon emission performance and the potential of carbon emission reductions from regional perspectives, which may be important and useful for policy makers. Our main findings are as follows. Firstly, there is significant group-heterogeneity across regions in China, in terms of energy efficiency and carbon emission performance. Secondly, there are no considerable differences between total-factor and single-factor performance indices, since there is limited substitutability between energy inputs and other production inputs. Finally, significant carbon emission reductions can be made by catching up for regions with low energy efficiency and carbon emission performance. Looking ahead, the Chinese government should adopt measures to promote improvements in terms of energy efficiency and carbon emission performance in the short term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a panel of forty-two Belgian districts since the 1970s and accounting for other key determinants of employment, this paper confirms the Oswald hypothesis. A 1 percentage point rise in the rate of ownership in a district implies a statistically significant fall in the employment rate by about 0.35 percentage points. This negative effect declines in the fraction of the high-skilled in a district. The results underscore the importance of controlling for unobserved district-specific fixed effects and common time effects, and of appropriately dealing with endogeneity.","[Isebaert, Daan; Heylen, Freddy] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Smolders, Carine] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Isebaert, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Sint Pieterspl 6, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",daan.isebaert@ugent.be; freddy.heylen@ugent.be; carine.smolders@ugent.be,,"Smolders, carine/0000-0002-6658-4913","Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen); Belgian Program on Interuniversity Poles of Attraction; Belgian State, Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs [P 6/07]","Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen); Belgian Program on Interuniversity Poles of Attraction(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Belgian State, Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs","The authors acknowledge support from the Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen) and the Belgian Program on Interuniversity Poles of Attraction, initiated by the Belgian State, Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs [contract number UAP No. P 6/07].",,50,11,11,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

When spatial equilibrium fails: is place-based policy second best, Regional Studies. Place-based or geographically targeted policy often is promoted to help poor regions. Based on the spatial equilibrium model, economists routinely argue that place-based policies are distortionary and only slow the needed economic adjustments. This paper reviews the empirical evidence about whether the spatial equilibrium model holds in reality and finds that, even in the United States where labour mobility is thought to be much higher than in Europe, at best weak support for the spatial equilibrium hypothesis is found. Although this suggests potential efficacy of place-based policy, the informational and political economy conditions required for place-based policy to be effective are described.","[Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rickman, Dan S.; Tan, Ying] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Olfert, M.

The analysis is based on a deal-level database of businesses seeking financing, combined with indicators of renewable policies and government R&D expenditures. The econometric analysis relates the number of deals and their volumes in a country to deployment and supply policies using count data and limited dependent variable (Tobit) models. The results suggest that both supply side policies and environmental deployment policies, designed with a long-term perspective of creating a market for environmental technologies, are associated with higher levels of venture capital relative to more short-term fiscal policies. When focusing on policies related to renewable energy generation, the results confirm the positive association of generous feed-in tariffs (FITs) with venture capital investment. However, in the solar sector excessively generous FITs tend to discourage investment, perhaps reflecting a lack of credibility over the longer term. Thus, both sets of results point to long-term policy stability, sustainability and credibility as important policy features to ensure Venture capital backing of innovative and risky ventures in a country's green sector.

Explicit attention is paid to the difference between commodity flows and trade flows that arises from the presence of transhipment points. Observed commodity flows in the transportation survey data are converted to production-consumption trade flows that are consistent with the multi-regional input-output framework. Regional trade flow estimates are then reconciled with regional production and consumption estimates using a mathematical program that aims to make minimal adjustments while imposing known multi-regional input-output accounting identities. It is shown that commodities originating or terminating at a transhipment point should be reassigned to their probable production origins or consumption destinations as long as an unbiased sample of previous observations is available. As the number of observations increases, the prediction error of the production origin or consumption destination decreases exponentially. A real-world case study in the Province of Ontario in Canada demonstrates the feasibility of estimating interregional trade flows from commercial vehicle survey data and shows that the estimated pattern of trade flows is maintained after adjustments are made to satisfy accounting constraints. Therefore, it is possible to create a balanced multi-regional input-output model based on a commercial vehicle survey and the limited supplementary data available at the regional level.","[Bachmann, Chris; Kennedy, Chris; Roorda, Matthew J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto,"Bachmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",chris.bachmann@alumni.utoronto.ca; christopher.kennedy@utoronto.ca; roordam@ecf.utoronto.ca,,"Roorda, Matthew/0000-0001-6724-0154; Kennedy, Christopher/0000-0001-8812-4451",,,,,23,2,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In unconstrained emission scenarios, within the range of future technology performances considered in the present analysis, the cost of nuclear energy is shown to dominate all others in affecting future emissions. Climate-constrained scenarios, stress the relevance, in addition to that of nuclear energy, of biofuels, as they represent the main source of decarbonization of the transportation sector and bioenergy, since the latter can be coupled with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to produce negative emissions.

The improvement of energy efficiency is essential for energy consumption and sustainable development. This study analyzes the negative factors in the pulp and paper sector by calculating energy efficiency from the lengthways time and investigating the gap between China and foreign countries through a horizontal comparison. Accordingly, energy efficiency has increased in the Chinese pulp and paper industry with years of efforts, but its transformation remains unclear. Furthermore, the energy-saving potential, energy cost saving, and carbon dioxide emission reduction in the pulp and paper industry are evaluated according to the Twelfth Five-year Plan (2011-2015). The results show that the pulp and paper industry has further capabilities for energy-saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction by improving energy efficiency in China, resulting in great economic benefit.

The paper has a particular focus on Chinese immigrants and explores the effects of the so-called guanxi, a specific form of social capital for Chinese communities. The empirical research is based on a survey conducted in 2012 among Chinese immigrants in Andalusia (Spain) in which both business owners and paid employees were interviewed. A logistic regression specification was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that the Chinese immigrants with greater structural and relational social capital and better 'guanxi' are more likely to become business owners. On the contrary, cognitive social capital seems to favor the option for paid employment versus the option for self-employment among Chinese immigrants. However, in the specific case of the Chinese immigrants who have a business owner in their family, the cognitive social capital also has positive effects on self-employment.","[Romero, Isidoro; Yu, Zhikun] Univ Seville, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Av Ramon & Cajal, Seville 41018, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Romero, I (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Av Ramon & Cajal, Seville 41018, Spain.",isidoro@us.es,"Romero, Isidoro/E-8160-2010","Romero, Isidoro/0000-0001-8764-2599",,,,,67,5,6,3,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We take an approach that covers many ideas about the costs arising from U.S. reliance on imported oil, and we identify which of those ideas have broad support in the economics literature and which ideas have only limited support. We also quantify the costs of U.S. reliance on imported oil using two approaches. One is fairly narrow, conforms to the economics view of externalities, and yields small cost estimates. The other is relatively expansive, is favored by some policy analysts, and yields much larger cost estimates. We estimate these costs as expected U.S. economic losses over a time horizon from 2010 through 2035, while taking into account world oil market conditions, market power, probable oil supply disruptions, and the oil-market response to those supply disruptions.

As a result, governments have recognised the need to introduce mandatory schemes through legislation, e.g. from 2016 all new build homes in the UK will be required to achieve zero carbon in regulated energy consumption. However, as 2016 approaches, very few zero carbon homes are being delivered. This paper explores the drivers and barriers for zero carbon homebuilding. The perceptions of the wider construction industry were gathered through a series of semi-structured interviews with professionals involved in commissioning, designing, constructing and regulating housing. The results show that, whilst drivers for zero carbon homebuilding exist, the barriers are currently perceived to be greater than the drivers. The barriers are categorised into five groups: economic, skills and knowledge, industry, legislative and cultural. Mechanisms for policy and industry support for the delivery of zero carbon homes are identified to address these barriers. The research findings highlight the need for a clear and robust policy framework for the forthcoming standard. The Government and industry must prioritise raising public awareness of the need for and benefits of zero carbon homes to help develop market demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We first develop a theoretical model in the economic geography field to integrate heterogeneous workers, housing, local entrepreneurs and skill upgrading by unskilled workers. We then analyse how the domestic integration of each state in the USA, approximated by truck registrations, influenced the location choice of skilled and unskilled workers in 1940-1960. By using inter- and intrastate trade flow from the US Commodity Flow Survey, we also analyse the impact of regional trade costs for the contemporary period (1997, 2002, 2007). The theoretical model shows that the bell-shaped curve of spatial development displays a sorting of individuals and firms. Only high-skilled workers increasingly choose the core region during the process of regional integration, while intermediate-skilled workers move to the periphery due to the increase in the price of housing. By impacting differently on the opportunity cost to invest in skill acquisition in the core and the periphery, this sorting influences the regional creation of human capital. First a regional divergence in education investment occurs and then a convergence, but only for high-level regional integration. The empirical analysis confirms that regional trade integration has been a determinant of the spatial distribution of skills in the USA.","[Candau, Fabien] Univ Pau, UFR Droit & Econ, Pau, France; [Dienesch, Elisa] CHERPA Sci Po Aix, F-13625 Aix En Provence 1, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Candau, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pau, UFR Droit & Econ, Ave Doyen Poplawski,BP1633-64016, Pau, France.",fabien.candau@univ-pau.fr; elisa.dienesch@sciencespo-aix.fr,,"Dienesch, Elisa/0009-0003-0963-2784; Candau, Fabien/0000-0003-3989-1157",,,,,74,5,5,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Accuracy of one- to six-quarter-ahead personal income forecasts is compared for a model based on the Minnesota prior used in macroeconomic forecasting and a spatial prior proposed by Krivelyova and LeSage (J Reg Sci 39(2):297-317, 1999). While the Minnesota prior emphasizes time dependence taking the form of a random walk, the spatial prior relies on past values of neighboring state income growth rates while ignoring own-state past income growth. Our findings indicate that forecast accuracy for longer future time horizons is improved by the spatial prior, while that for shorter horizons is better for the non-spatial prior. This motivated a hybrid approach that combines both spatial and time dependence in the prior restrictions placed on the model parameters.","[LeSage, James P.; Cashell, Bryce A.] SW Texas State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"LeSage, JP (通讯作者)，SW Texas State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",james.lesage@txstate.edu,,,,,,,16,9,11,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Moreover, we analyze the impact of China's market-oriented reform on China's regional energy and carbon efficiency. The main findings are as follows. First, most of China's regions did not perform efficiently in energy use and CO2 emissions. Provinces in the east area generally performed better than those in the central and west areas. By contrast, provinces in the west area generally evidenced the lowest efficiency. Second, Market-oriented reforms, especially the promotion of factor market, were found to have positive effect on the efficiency of energy use and CO2 emissions. Third, the share of coal in the total energy consumption and the expansion of the industrial sector were found to be negatively correlated with China's regional energy and CO2 emissions performance. Based on the empirical findings, we provide policy suggestions for enhancing energy and carbon efficiency in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, crop response to water loss, atmospheric temperature and air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum were examined to detect crop water stress. The effects of three irrigation programs (when depleted 30, 50 and 70% of the available water holding capacity within 0.90 m soil profile depth) on two grape cultivar (semillon and razaki) yields, and resulting CWSI were investigated. The non-irrigation treatment (NI) was also used for determination of fully stressed baseline. The lower (non-stressed) and upper (stressed) baselines were determined from measurements of canopy temperatures, ambient air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values and the CWSI was calculated with three irrigation levels using the empirical approach. The CWSI value was useful for evaluating crop water stress in grapevine and should be useful for timing irrigation and predicting yield. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A two-year field experiment was conducted in order to determine the water status of cotton crop (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under full and deficit irrigation conditions. The experiment was set up as a split plot design with four replicates, two main plots (irrigation treatments) and two sub plots (cotton cultivars). The lower (non-stressed) and upper (fully stressed) base lines for the determination of Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) of cotton crop were estimated. Plant water status, expressed in terms of the water potential index (WPI) and CWSI, was measured throughout the growing seasons. The adopted irrigation schemes produced a clear differentiation among cultivars concerning their plant water status. Water shortage resulted in more negative leaf water potential and WPI and greater CWSI values. Leaf water potential, WPI and CWSI values, variation throughout both growing seasons, indicated greater adaptability for Julia in water stress conditions, while Zoi showed a significant water stress behavior during the phases of yield formation and ripening, even for the full irrigated treatment. In general, use of limited drip irrigation regime with 50% of water requirement had significant benefits in terms of saved irrigation water.

The core idea of EROI is to measure the relation of energy diverted from society to make energy available to society. CED, on the other hand, includes forms of energy that are not appropriated by society, such as fugitive methane emissions from oil wells as well as losses of heating value of coal during transport and storage. Such energy forms should be excluded from EROI; failure to do so leads to results that are inconsistent with the intention of EROI and potentially misleading. We demonstrate how this problem is at least partially rectifiable by adopting consistent energy accounting, but also note that among the energy flows not appropriated by society occurring in CED, not all flows can easily be removed. Further, we point to inconsistencies in heating value assumptions in a widely used database that have misled analysts. Finally, we argue that the differential weighting of primary energy forms in published CED-based EROI work is unsubstantiated and should be reconsidered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Only Fuerzas Electricas del Noroeste (Fenosa) had had its origin in a small and local company, the Sociedad General Gallega de Electricidad. This firm achieved significant growth by means of mergers and acquisitions in the 1920s and had managed in the 1940s, through the creation of a new company called Fenosa, to avoid the ban on generating capacity increases established by the electrical agreements signed in the 1930s. Under this new name, but with the same managers, technicians and majority shareholders, the company was granted the concessions to exploit a major part of a new hydraulic basin, that of the Mino river. By building up new hydroelectric facilities there, Fenosa was able to join the Spanish electricity oligopoly.

Previous studies indicate that positive and negative perfectionism lead some desirable and undesirable consequences on employees' work and social life. Accordingly, the study consists of some positive and negative results of the perfectionism. In this context, the data were collected by using a survey method from 146 employees who work as supervisors and managers of hotels. The obtained data were analysed with structural equation modelling technique. The result of the study shows that positive perfectionism affects work engagement and psychological well-being positively, whereas it has no direct effect on emotional exhaustion. In addition to this, negative perfectionism affects psychological well-being negatively but it has no direct effect on work engagement and emotional exhaustion. Therefore, it can be seen that psychological well-being has a fully mediator role in the relationships between negative perfectionism and emotional exhaustion. Moreover, psychological wellbeing has a fully mediator role in the relationships between positive perfectionism and emotional exhaustion. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The technologies reviewed are fanya juu terraces, contour bunds, negarims, trapezoidal bunds, on-farm micro-catchments, Zai pits, tumbukiza, tied ridges, deep tillage and sub-soiling and ripping. These technologies hold rainwater on the soil surface thereby allowing it more infiltration time leading to enhanced soil moisture status, which would not be attained in the absence of these interventions. Zai pits, tumbukiza and deep tillage when used together with soil fertility improvement can increase crop yields by 4-10 times when compared to other similar fields cultivated conventionally. When tied-ridging tillage is used together with fertilizer, manure or their combination it can increase crop yields by 100-300 %. Sub-soiling and ripping increases crop yields by 50-100 % when used together with soil fertility improvement. Micro-catchment technology at 1: 1 and 2: 1 catchment to cultivated land ratio can increase crop yields, but is not practised due to land limitation. Use of fertilizers and or manures with in situ soil moisture conservation leads to improved water use efficiency by crops planted in the semi-arid eastern Kenya. It is, therefore, proposed that in situ rainwater conservation technologies should be an integral part of the farming systems for increased soil moisture conservation, crop production and food security in the semi-arid Eastern Kenya.","[Kathuli, P.; Itabari, J.

There are concerns that convergence in the EU is mostly economic, which may lead to increased inequality and social disparities. Also, research shows that mild divergence can be observed at regional level, which questions the effectiveness of the EU cohesion policy. Purpose of Study. This paper explores whether socio-economic convergence occurs at both national and regional level, and whether the EU cohesion policy is effective. Methods. Using Eurostat data since 2000, we use coefficients of variation to analyze convergence for disposable income, unemployment rates, proportion of people living in households with low work intensity, and migration. Findings and Results. Convergence and divergence are faster at country level, and trends at national level are mostly different than those at regional level in terms of direction and magnitude. For unemployment rates and work intensity, regional data shows more volatility, indicating higher within-country volatility, while between-country volatility is higher for incomes and net migration. Except for unemployment, the Great Recession has not induced an erosion on the convergence observed in the pre-crisis period; in particular, low work intensity holds steady. Greater volatility in internal migration is unexpected given the convergence in income and unemployment rate. Conclusions and Recommendations. Most findings point out that the EU cohesion policy is effective in reducing socio-economic disparities before 2008, and containing them doing the Great Depression. However, this is mostly due to increased between-country convergence. Divergence in internal migration is unexpected and requires further research. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Furthermore, the pattern of capital flows within the single market leaves a significant part of the flows unexplained by fundamentals.","[Katsimi, Margarita] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patis Ave, Athens 10434, Greece; [Katsimi, Margarita; Zoega, Gylfi] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Zoega, Gylfi] Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, 2 Saemundargata, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Zoega, Gylfi] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; Ifo Institut; University of Iceland; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Katsimi, M (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patis Ave, Athens 10434, Greece.;Katsimi, M (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",mkatsimi@aueb.gr; gz@hi.is,"zoega, gylfi/M-3622-2015",,Icelandic Research Fund (IRF) [130551-052]; University of Iceland Research Fund,Icelandic Research Fund (IRF); University of Iceland Research Fund,We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their comments on an earlier draft.

In Nagaland the state government imposed the ban in an attempt to capture control of coal extraction and trade, while in Meghalaya India's National Green Commission imposed the ban over concern for the environment and labour conditions. In both cases local communities have opposed the bans, and in some areas resumed mining under the authority of tribal councils and powerful civil society actors. In this paper we explore the politics of coal extraction that resulted in these bans and the response of communities and authorities. In doing so we made three main arguments that contribute to understanding of coal and communities in frontier regions where state control is partial and the legacy of armed conflict is powerful. First, in both locations the majority of the coal mining activity has been initiated and managed by members of tribal communities rather than profit-driven outsiders. Second, in contrast to other contexts in India (notably Orissa and Jharkhand) where large state or private enterprises seek to modify the law to enable coal extraction, in Nagaland and Meghalaya it has been communities that resent and challenge state and national laws being applied to their lands. Third, the right to extract coal is connected to the right of tribal communities to determine what happens on their lands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

With volatile fossil fuel costs which are most likely to increase in the long-run and competitive renewable energy technologies the introduction of such sustainable power generation system seems a viable and environmental friendly option. Nevertheless the implementation of renewable energies on small islands is quite low based on high transaction costs and missing knowledge according to the market potential. Our work provides a global overview on the small island landscape showing the respective population, economic activity, energy demand, and fuel costs for almost 1800 islands with approximately 20 million inhabitants currently supplied by 15 GW of diesel plants. Based on these parameters a detailed techno-economic assessment of the potential integration of solar PV, wind power, and battery storage into the power supply system was performed for each island. The focus on solar and wind was set due to the lack of data on hydro and geothermal potential for a global island study. It revealed that almost 7.5 GW of photovoltaic and 14 GW of wind power could be economically installed and operated on these islands reducing the GHG-emissions and fuel consumption by approximately 50%. In total numbers more than 20 million tons of GHG emissions can be reduced by avoiding the burning of 7.8 billion liters of diesel per year. Cost savings of around 9 USDct/kWh occur on average by implementing these capacities combined with 5.8 GWh of battery storage. This detailed techno-economic evaluation of renewable energies enables policy makers and investors to facilitate the implementation of clean energy supply systems on small islands. To accelerate the implementation of this enormous potential we give specific policy recommendations such as the introduction of proper regulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we assess the SIDS' pattern towards energy sustainability. Second, we try to understand the macro factors that drive policy-makers in setting the optimal framework for investments in renewable energy sources. The empirical analysis is performed on a large dataset of 136 countries and 41 variables observed in the time span 2000-2011. Countries analyzed include a sample of 12 SIDS (Bahrain, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Fiji Islands, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago) distributed worldwide. Due to the large number of variables collected and their high degree of collinearity, the first step of the analysis concerns the implementation of a Principal Component Analysis in order to extract factors explaining the majority of variation of the original variables. In the second step, three different scenarios of modeling are designed to examine the key factors promoting RES investments. In a first scenario, we employ a pooled regression model, in the second a Fixed Effect model and, in the third, a Random Effect model is estimated. The main results of empirical analysis could be unexpected at first sight. They show, in fact, that SIDS are not on a energy sustainability path. As in the case of other developing countries, policy-makers prefer to use resources to improve economic aspects of development leaving behind issues related to the environmental protection, the use of RES and sustainability. In order to improve economic and environmental resilience of SIDS a synergy between local governments and international organizations to promote the investments in RES is needed. Moreover, an energy plan that clearly supports the generation of energy from RES is recommended. Finally policy-makers should strength their commitment in raising population's awareness toward a green energy generation. Such synergic interventions will allow SIDS to achieve a more sustainable development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, increasing supply tends to lower energy prices, which encourages additional fuel consumption. This fuel market rebound effect can undermine climate change mitigation strategies, even to the point where efforts to reduce GHG emissions by increasing the supply of low-carbon fuels may actually result in increased GHG emissions. Here, we explore how policies that encourage the production of low-carbon fuels may result in increased GHG emissions because the resulting increase in energy use overwhelms the benefits of reduced carbon intensity. We describe how climate change mitigation strategies should follow a simple rule: a low-carbon fuel with a carbon intensity of X% that of a fossil fuel must displace at least X% of that fossil fuel to reduce overall GHG emissions. We apply this rule to the United States Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2). We show that absent consideration of the fuel market rebound effect, RFS2 appears to reduce GHG emissions, but once the fuel market rebound effect is factored in, RFS2 actually increases GHG emissions when all fuel GHG intensity targets are met.

Citizens jointly investing in and operating renewable energy installations have played an essential role in countries such as Germany or Denmark. Building on and extending previous studies, we collect survey data on investment motives for a stratified random sample of German community energy companies. Structural variables are selected using a socio-ecological-technical systems framework. This study aims to identify differences within the community energy sector to better understand investment behaviour and the effects of policy changes. Despite the small sample coverage at the individual member level, the preliminary results of this study suggest that, first, community energy forms a specific type of social investment and that, second, there are significant differences between community energy companies, especially regarding the assessment of the return motive. This motive plays a more prominent role in limited partnerships than in cooperatives and for community wind than for companies focusing on solar or biomass. While these and other factors are highly interrelated, our data indicate that the social setting and geographical and climatic conditions are the critical ones here. These findings may guide further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, modeling and forecasting multi-dimensional conditional heteroscedasticity are technically challenging. As the volatilities of many financial assets are often driven by a few common and latent factors, we propose in this article a dimension-reduction method to model a multivariate volatility process and to estimate a lower-dimensional space, to be called the volatility space, within which the dynamics of the multivariate volatility process is confined. The new method is simple to use, as technically it boils down to an eigenanalysis for a nonnegative definite matrix. Hence, it is applicable to the cases when the number of assets concerned is in the order of thousands (using an ordinary PC/laptop). On the other hand, the model has the capability to cater for complex conditional heteroscedasticity behavior for multi-dimensional processes. Some asymptotic properties for the new method are established. We further illustrate the new method using both simulated and real data examples.","[Li, Weiming; Gao, Jing; Li, Kunpeng] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Yao, Qiwei] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London WC2A 2AE, England",Capital University of Economics & Business; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Li, WM (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",liweiming291@163.com; jinggao96@163.com; likp.07@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; q.yao@lse.ac.uk,"Li, Kunpeng/AAH-1164-2019; 李, 委明/JOZ-1697-2023; 黎, 伟/GXM-4040-2022; li, wj/HGD-7322-2022; liu, 轩/ISR-9283-2023","Li, Kunpeng/0000-0001-5805-793X; Yao, Qiwei/0000-0003-2065-8486","NSFC [71201031, 71571122, 71601131]; EPSRC; EPSRC [EP/L01226X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L01226X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors thank the associate editor and the two referees for their critical and constructive comments that have greatly improved this article.

A conceptual analysis and case study of contentious energy problems,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy analysis; Resolution of energy problems; Energy efficiency; Cost benefit analysis,,"Energy policy and research span multiple objectives, disciplines, methodologies, and data sets. This breadth of research results in conflicting analyses and proposals, which enable various parties to leverage these conflicts to further their vested interests. This paper explores these issues caused by differing research methodologies. It examines a recent proposal to search for common ground regarding contentious energy problems that emphasizes the use of different analytical frames as major sources of disagreement, and a case study regarding a dispute on how to conduct cost-benefit analyses of energy efficiency programs. Resolving differences among the research community and energy analysts requires a collaborative effort of painstaking research and debate. This paper articulates four policy implications. First, energy analysts should not be inexorably bound to their analytical frames. Second, analysts should not encroach on the role of policymakers by being asked to resolve questions that involve tradeoffs among fundamental values. Third, analysts have an important role helping to inform policymakers of the implications and limitations of various types of analyses of energy and environmental issues. Fourth, analysts need to develop a research program that is able to answer particular questions from multiple research frames in order to assess the robustness of their findings.

This paper develops an agent-based model that simulates the introduction of four policy scenarios aimed at promoting electric vehicle adoption in an urban community and compares them against a baseline. These scenarios include reducing vehicle purchase price via subsidies, expanding the local public charging network, increasing the number and visibility of fully battery electric vehicles (BEVs) on the roadway through government fleet purchases, and a hybrid mix of these three approaches. The results point to the effectiveness of policy options that increased awareness of BEV technology. Specifically, the hybrid policy alternative was the most successful in encouraging BEV adoption.

The role of DGSTs in the future energy systems planning of a rural agglomeration in Switzerland is examined using a cost optimization modeling approach. Heat and electricity demand for major sectors are considered. Scenarios introduce DGSTs in a stepwise manner to measure incremental impacts on future capacity planning compared to a baseline scenario. Sub-scenarios also examine the impacts of carbon mitigation policies, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out for key energy carriers and conversion technologies. DGSTs enable a significant reduction in electricity grid usage for the community considered. Small hydro with a storage reservoir and photovoltaics enable the community to become largely self-sufficient with over 80% reductions in grid imports by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. Storage enables maximum usage of the available hydro potential which also leads to network upgrade deferrals and a significant increase in photovoltaic installations. Investment decisions in small hydro are robust against cost variations, while heating technology investment decisions are sensitive to oil and grid electricity prices. Carbon pricing policies are found to be effective in mitigating local fossil fuel emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis takes into account that capacity investment must be chosen under uncertainty about demand conditions and capacity availability, and that capacity as well as electricity generation may be sources of externalities. The main result is that generation subsidies should correspond to externalities of electricity generation (e.g., greenhouse gas reductions), and investment subsidies should correspond to externalities of capacity (e.g., learning spillovers). If only capacity externalities exist, then electricity generation should not be subsidized at all. Our results suggest that some of the most popular promotion instruments cause welfare losses.

The objective is to study how the outcomes of previous exploration decisions, under both private-information and public-information assumptions, as well as timing, influence firms' exploration rates across Alberta. The results show that firms' exploration rates were influenced by both its own drilling history as well as by the outcomes of other firms. The drilling histories of other firms had important effects on a firm's decision to explore a region if the firm had yet to start exploring that region. However, once a firm had started to explore a region, the outcomes of rivals were less important than the firm's own outcomes. Additional results provide an interesting characterization of the different factors that affect firms' exploration decisions. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

One of the major approaches to coordinate economic growth and environmental protection is to substitute coal-fired power with renewable energy. Since 2003, in order to promote wind power development, China has put in place many support policies which fall into either price policy category or non-price policy category. By using a variable intercept and mixed regression model with provincial panel data during 2001-2013, we analyzed the impacts of both categories on the increase of installed capacity in areas with different wind resources. We found that price policy and two non-price policies had positive impacts on the increase of wind power installation, price policy played a greater role than non-price policy did in promoting wind power development, and price policy was more effective in areas with poor wind resources, whilst non-price policy was more effective in areas with rich wind resources.

The main data are obtained from the OECD fiscal decentralization database that distinguishes tax income according to the degree of sub-national control over own resources. The empirical results point to a positive impact of autonomous tax income on sub-national fiscal balances in contrast to tax sharing agreements. However, the positive budgetary influence of tax autonomy only prevails from a minimum share of autonomous taxes in sub-national own revenue.","[Van Rompuy, Paul] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Van Rompuy, P (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",paul.vanrompuy@econ.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,24,10,10,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This multi-year field study sought to fill part of this gap by exploring human adaptation to plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) performance and vehicle charging in smart-grid environments. Homes were equipped with smart meters in a smart-grid experiment conducted by the local utility. Study households were organized by either standard or time-of-use electricity pricing, and randomly assigned to managed or unmanaged charging scenarios. Using a mixed-methods approach, study data were collected through vehicle data loggers, smart-plugs interviews, and questionnaires. The paper describes vehicle operations and performance; the ways in which households managed PHEV charging; and the manner in which they responded to smart-grid, smart-plug, and dashboard feedback. Findings indicate that households actively managed PHEV charging; however, they preferred flexible charging scenarios. Charging-management decisions were influenced by electricity-pricing. Online feedback on household- and vehicle-electricity consumption was generally ignored, but drivers responded to dashboard feedback as they drove. These results provide empirical bases for government and corporate policymakers to improve policy decisions relative to PHEV impacts on electricity loads, design of smart-grid feedback, and design of charging infrastructures.

Here we quantify the changes in the global energy mix necessary to address population and climate change under two energy-use scenarios, finding that renewable energy production (9% in 2014) must comprise 87-94% of global energy consumption by 2100.

Pilot demonstration projects have shown the feasibility and flexibility of this new approach in realizing sustainable development in rural China. Effective utilization of DBF in rural China will lead to gains for global, regional, and local energy savings, environmental protection, sustainable development, and related social benefits.

Three factors are key: local returns to scale in innovation, the housing supply elasticity and the importance of local amenities. Even with global increasing returns, local returns to scale in innovation may be decreasing, making networks more appealing. Inelastic housing supply makes density costlier and may explain why networks are more popular in Europe than the US. Megacities can prevail thanks to amenities if the benefits of scale overwhelm the costs of density. The skilled are more likely to prefer megacities than the unskilled. Megacities may have short-run costs yet improve upon networks in the long run. Resumen Se ha estudiado el compromiso entre las megaciudades y las redes de ciudades mas pequenas en un modelo de crecimiento recombinante y servicios endogenos. Los factores clave son tres: los rendimientos locales a escala en la innovacion, la elasticidad de la oferta de la vivienda y la importancia de los servicios locales. Incluso con rendimientos crecientes a nivel mundial, los rendimientos locales a escala en la innovacion podrian estar disminuyendo, lo que hace que las redes sean mas atractivas. La oferta inelastica de la vivienda hace que la densidad sea mas costosa y hace posible explicar por que las redes son mas populares en Europa que en los Estados Unidos. Las megaciudades pueden prevalecer gracias a los servicios si los beneficios de escala superan los costos de densidad. Las personas con cualificaciones son mas propensas a preferir las megaciudades que las no cualificadas. Las megaciudades pueden tener costos a corto plazo y aun asi mejorar respecto a las redes a largo plazo.","[Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 315A, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ponzetto, Giacomo A.

This study explores current and potential energy behavioural adaptations in Portugal during the smart grid transition process. A web-based survey was made to a representative sample of a specific segment of Portuguese residential end-users. The survey evaluated current energy behaviours and hypothetical future behaviours in a dynamic pricing scenario. Results show this population segment has a positive predisposition towards smart technologies and demand shifting, but it is less likely to accept load control and switch to the liberalised energy market. Factors influencing the behavioural potential are mostly related with market regulation, households' practices and usage behaviours, interference with the private domain, information and technical aspects, and social values. To facilitate behavioural adaptations several strategies are recommended, such as improving the energy market regulation, assessing households' behaviours, prioritising actions already embedded in households daily routines, not interfering with their activities and ensure an override option, and improving energy services, trust and information provided to end-users. The conclusions of the present study are of utmost importance for the design of more effective demand response programmes and energy policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Many traditional solutions, however, work in contradiction to one another. This work investigates effects on estimated emissions and costs of mitigation strategies using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interaction Synergies (GAINS) model to identify policies that satisfy multiple goals. Eight scenarios that describe air pollution control options and mixes of energy production technologies are implemented in GAINS, which quantifies country-wide air pollution and greenhouse emissions and costs of controls. Emissions and costs trajectories are compared to the business as usual case, which projects CO2 emissions to increase by 60% by 2050 compared to 2015. Results show that replacing all coal generation with renewables reduces CO2 emissions in 2050 by 8% compared to 2015, and that aggressive policy targeting the whole energy sector reduces CO2 emissions in 2050 by 40%. GAINS is used to show co-benefits and tradeoffs of each scenario, such as reductions in emissions control costs that accompany a switch to renewables. The approach provides supporting evidence for policies that exploit co-benefits and avoid contradictions by assessing multiple aspects of the energy sector within the integrated framework provided by the GAINS modeling platform.

Financial network models, which take into account the complex interrelationships between countries, seem to be an appropriate tool in this context. To improve the statistical performance of financial network models, we propose to generate them by means of multivariate graphical models. We then introduce Bayesian graphical models, which can take model uncertainty into account, and dynamic Bayesian graphical models, which provide a convenient framework to model temporal cross-border data, decomposing the model into autoregressive and contemporaneous networks. The article shows how the application of the proposed models to the Bank of International Settlements locational banking statistics allows the identification of four distinct groups of countries, that can be considered central in systemic risk contagion.","[Giudici, P.; Spelta, A.] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via Palestro 3, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Giudici, P; Spelta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via Palestro 3, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",paolo.giudici@unipv.it; alessandro.spelta01@universitadipavia.it,"Giudici, Paolo/AAA-7773-2021; Giudici, Paolo/AAA-5126-2021","Giudici, Paolo/0000-0002-4198-0127;",Italian Ministry of Research grant PRIN MISURA: multivariate models for risk assessment,Italian Ministry of Research grant PRIN MISURA: multivariate models for risk assessment,The authors acknowledge financial support from the Italian Ministry of Research grant PRIN MISURA: multivariate models for risk assessment.

CQIV allows estimates to vary across the conditional expenditure distribution, relaxes traditional censored model assumptions, and addresses endogeneity with an instrumental variable. My instrumental variable strategy uses a family member's injury to induce variation in an individual's own price. Across the conditional deciles of the expenditure distribution, I find elasticities that vary from -0.76 to -1.49, which are an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates.

It is an asymptotically distribution-free test and is easy to implement in practice. The article further studies the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of a threshold double autoregressive model. It is shown that the estimated threshold is n-consistent and converges weakly to a functional of a two-sided compound Poisson process and the remaining parameters are asymptotically normal. Our results include the asymptotic theory of the estimator for threshold AR models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) errors and threshold ARCH models as special cases, each of which is also new in literature. Two portmanteau-type statistics are also derived for checking the adequacy of fitted model when either the error is nonnormal or the threshold is unknown. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the score-based test and the estimator in finite samples. The results are illustrated with an application to the weekly closing prices of Hang Seng Index.

Variegated capitalism, Chinese style: regional models, multi-scalar constructions, Regional Studies. The paper explores tensions between the varieties of capitalism framework and the heterogeneous particularities of the Chinese case. Rather than forcing the Chinese model into analytical boxes derived, primarily, from analyses of European and North American capitalism, this complex formation more appropriately can be understood to exist in a 'triangular' relationship with the two conventional poles of varieties scholarship, the US-style 'liberal market' economy and the German-style ` coordinated market' economy. Furthermore, the substantial degree of internal (regional) heterogeneity evident in the Chinese case calls into question those models of capitalism that focus narrowly on institutional coherence at the national scale. Illustrating this point, a range of ` sub-models' of Chinese capitalism is examined: regional styles of capitalist development that remain distinct from one another, and deeply networked into a range of global production networks, and ` offshore' economies, just as they remain, to some degree, distinctively Chinese.","[Zhang, Jun] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Program Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Peck, Jamie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of Toronto; University of British Columbia,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Program Planning, Sidney Smith Hall,5025B,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",zhang@geog.utoronto.ca; jamie.peck@ubc.ca,"Peck, Jamie/A-9072-2009",,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Peck gratefully acknowledges the research grant programme of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,111,137,142,7,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Superimposed on European and global reformation, these changes have requested inclusion of Romanian policies into economic and social paradigms, which has caused major changes in all public administration systems. The HR segment, sensitive to the challenges of the external environment, perceived as a source of opportunity, but equally as a source of threat - by continuously changing laws, economic conditions, demographic policies, social and technological changes, etc. - strongly feels such changes. Thus, the major role of HR departments is a sound and efficient management of their resources, by adopting flexible adaptation strategies, based on accessing opportunities and avoiding threats. However, HR structures must consider staff response to consequences caused by these changes, in addition to external positive or negative impact. A major goal of sustainable development was the implementation of policies intended to optimize administrative capacity and professionalization of public services, as a measure of effective governance and good public policies. In achieving this, human resource occupies an important place, and the major challenge was to harmonize this segment, with influence in any governmental institution, with the effervescent environment to which it belongs.

It uses the anthropometric and occupational data included in the records of the general conscription carried out during the Napoleonic invasion. The findings are interpreted in light of the recent contributions regarding the evolution of the economy and industrial output of central Spain during the second half of the eighteenth century. Significant differences can be observed between different professions and economic sectors, largely explained by income levels, the possible selection for some occupations in accordance with physical characteristics, and access to animal proteins. Furthermore, the data also reveals an overall decrease in height and an increase in inequality between professions during the period.","[Garcia Montero, Hector] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Montero, HG (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",,"Garcia-Montero, Hector/ABA-6076-2020",,"Universidad Complutense de Madrid (pre-doctoral fellowship FPI/ECON); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [HAR2013-47182-C2-2-P, HAR2012-33810]; European Research Council (project EINITE, ERC Starting Grant) [283802]; European Research Council (ERC) [283802] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Universidad Complutense de Madrid (pre-doctoral fellowship FPI/ECON); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); European Research Council (project EINITE, ERC Starting Grant); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","I thank Enrique Llopis Agelan, Jose Miguel Martinez Carrion, Vicente Perez Moreda, Jose Antonio Sebastian Amarilla and the two anonymous referees, for their many helpful comments in different versions of this work.

In the dairy industry and related industries employs more than 21 thousand organizations and more than 1.2 million people, milk and dairy products to 15% of the turnover of retail trade networks. In the 90 years the production of milk and dairy products is characterized by significant decrease of production and by 1999, the decrease amounted to 45,16%. The result of research of market of milk and dairy products: production declined faster than consumption of milk and dairy products. In 1990, per capita consumption of milk and dairy products was 370 kg per year, in 2014 this figure was only equal to 243 kg. The decrease in consumption of milk and dairy products is a result of lower real incomes. Constant excess consumption of milk and dairy products on total volume of production over a long period of time led to the growth of imports. The volume of imports in the period between 1990 and 2014 has increased by 11.84%, while in 2014 the volume of imports decreased by 3% compared to 2013. The sanctions imposed in August 2014, could not ensure rapid growth of production volumes of milk and dairy products in the country. The main reasons for low production of milk and dairy products in Russia, according to experts are: shortage of raw materials, long investment cycles in dairy cattle, the increase of production costs of milk and dairy products, low level of profitability of the dairy industry; low purchasing power of the population, reducing the number of existing enterprises of the dairy industry.","[Guziy, Snezhanna] Russian Timiryazev State Agr Univ, Fed State Budgetary Educ Inst Higher Educ, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Timiryazevskaya 49, Moscow, Russia",Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy,"Guziy, S (通讯作者)，Russian Timiryazev State Agr Univ, Fed State Budgetary Educ Inst Higher Educ, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Timiryazevskaya 49, Moscow, Russia.",guziy@rgau-msha.ru,"Brusenko, Snezhanna Vladimirovna/GYA-1722-2022","Brusenko, Snezhanna Vladimirovna/0000-0002-3714-8194",,,,,0,3,3,2,6,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,770,776,,10.15414/isd2016.s10.01,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500093,0

This paper argues that explicit attention to 'learning to unlearn' unstated theoretical assumptions and normativities can aid in provincialization, and demonstrate ways in which theorizing entails a socio-spatial situation. The authors' efforts to grapple with operationalizing learning to unlearn in three different urban cases are described, followed by an articulation of strategies for theorizing which more explicitly acknowledge theory-building's situatedness as well as points of reflection for developing postcolonial urban theory. It is argued that this usefully shifts the focus of unlearning from 'who' is theorizing 'where' towards theory's unstated norms and assumptions.","[Lawhon, Mary; Pierce, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Silver, Jonathan] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England; [Ernstson, Henrik] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ernstson, Henrik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Div Hist Sci Technol & Environm, KTH Environm Humanities Lab, Stockholm, Sweden",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Durham University; University of Cape Town; Royal Institute of Technology,"Lawhon, M (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",marylawhon@gmail.com; j.d.silver@durham.ac.uk; henrik.ernstson@uct.ac.za; jpierce3@fsu.edu,"Silver, Jon/GON-8117-2022","Silver, Jonathan/0000-0002-4870-2226",Swedish Research Council Formas [211-2011-1519]; ESRC-DFID [RES-167-25-0473]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H045155/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/H045155/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); ESRC-DFID(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Henrik Ernstson acknowledges the support from The Swedish Research Council Formas [grant number 211-2011-1519, Socioecological Movements, MOVE].

Social support networks are a significant factor in effective assistance to families. This research uses an integrated strategy and factor analysis to identify stakeholders of social support services and the extent in which these services are considered important by families in terms of solving their problems. Our findings show that assistance to families is expected in three levels. The first involves direct interpersonal relationships ( between family members and friends) and when this level fails, the network of professionals and experts is the next provider. An effective network of support services to families stands and falls with active family relationships. Where family relationships are absent or dysfunctional, they are compensated by second and third levels of this support. In a developed network of support services, social workers should have tools available to support all three levels. In view of these findings, a trend emphasizing approaches in favor of families solving their own problems rather than professional dominance of such is worth investigating.","[Louckova, Ivana; Gojova, Alice] Univ Ostrava, Fac Social Studies, Ostrava, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,"Loucková, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Fac Social Studies, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ivana.louckova@osu.cz; alice.gojova@osu.cz,"Gojova, Alice/H-2480-2019","Gojova, Alice/0000-0003-0656-6278",,,,,14,0,0,0,6,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,304,310,,10.12955/cbup.v4.772,0.0,,,7,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000043,0

Thus, reporting to our public administrative system, the process of innovation is not normally associated with thinking and acting within the public sector. This is a real challenge, and if this challenge is overcome, innovation has the proper internal channels to take effect. Innovation is a dynamic process that changes the overall architecture of government, identify issues, challenges, develop new processes, creative, and selection and implementation of new solutions. Thus, in general the features of innovation coincides largely with the reform process. Important factor on promoting innovation is promoting a creative mindset. The innovation process is essential to increase public sector efficiency and for delivering quality and competitive public services. The purpose of this paper is to present and analyze innovation as a social phenomenon and how it is tangential to the public administration reform and identify the defining characteristics that classify the reform process as one innovative.

These products are different from the traditional food products and the risks associated with them may also differ from the traditional food risks. On one hand, the typical food risks still apply; on the other hand dietary supplements can have significant nutritional risks since they contain special ingredients which may be dangerous if they are not consumed properly. Meanwhile, on the market customers are given significant amounts of information about food supplements, but this information sometimes can be misleading and may influence consumer habits. The aim of our research therefore is to examine the consumption patterns of adult dietary supplements users, highlighting some of the determinants of food safety as well, such as quality, availability of information and risks. Within the framework of primary research, focus group interviews were conducted and a survey was also used. Based on both the focus group and the survey results, it can be seen that uses of food supplements are judged differently by the respondents. In data processing, factor- and cluster analysis were used to segment consumers based upon how they consider the use of food supplements. Four homogenous groups were identified among the respondents on the market of food-supplements and the research examined which consumer characteristics were applicable to each group.","[Nemeth, Nikolett] Szent Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Business Adm, 1 Pater Karoly Utca, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Németh, N (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Business Adm, 1 Pater Karoly Utca, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",nikolett_nemeth@hotmail.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,792,803,,10.15414/isd2016.s10.04,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500096,0

Whereas Czech hospitals use about 50% of all expenditure on healthcare, it is necessary to focus on their thriftiness and efficiency. Hospitals must work with limited economic resources and it is essential to know how to use these resources efficiently. In the last two decades we can see strong trends of hospitals integration. We now have five holdings and the last one was founded in January 2015. Annual reports were used for analysis from each hospital from 2004 to 2013, and also information from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic. Parts of the annual reports include economic and also non-economic results. This data was statistically analyzed and examined according to whether there was a significant improvement in values after integration. For example, a linear trend was used for evaluation by using a coefficient correlation and a t-test was used for statistical significance. One of the limitations of the research was that the research was based on only two specific samples existing in the Czech Republic. Other holdings have either a very short or a very long period of being integrated and therefore it is very difficult to find specific comparable information. Other limitations of this research were the choice of appropriate financial and also non-financial indicators. Results from analysis were compared with results of other published studies in other countries.

After joining the EU the dairy sector in Latvia has changed, small dairy farms could not complete the new technological requirements of milk production and it was the time when in the country the amount of dairy cows was reduced by 9.3% during the two years from 2003 to 2004. During the last ten years farms involved in commercial milk production often had substantial modernization, the farmers are motivated to improve cows keeping and feeding. The smaller number of dairy cows is partly offset by the regular growth of their milk yield. Thereby average milk yield per cow during the ten years has increased by 42% and has reached 6993 kg in 2014. Milk price is depending on the economic and political situation in the world, it is also influenced by the geographic location, seasonality, and raw materials (feed, electricity, fuel) prices.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 48 patients, who were referred for endarterectomy. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, while depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire(PHQ-9) scale. An assessment of cognitive and depressive symptoms was performed 1-3 days before surgery, and then six months after. RESULTS: A paired sample t-test found that the difference in the mean MoCA score between the before ((X) over bar = 23.37; SD +/- 3.27) and the after ((X) over bar = 24.69; SD +/- 3.68) surgery results was 1.32 (95% CI = 0.48 -2.16; p=0.003; Cohen's d value = 0.95). A paired sample t-test showed that a decrease in mean PHQ-9 score of > 10 for patients six months after CEA (7.5 +/- 4.6) was statistically significant (p=0.019; Cohen's d value =1.32) compared with the PHQ-9 scores at baseline (12.6 +/- 2.8). CONCLUSION: Carotid artery endarterectomy seems to have beneficial effects on the course of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis. Demographic, clinical characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities, previous stroke) did not have impact on course of cognitive and depressive symptoms. A limitation in our study was that the number of patients was relatively small, therefore we intend to perform further study with larger case volume to estimate the impact of carotid artery endarterectomy on cognitive functions and depressive symptoms.","[Pucite, Elina; Miglane, Evija; Jurjans, Kristaps; Krievina, Ildze] Pauls Stradins Clin Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Riga, Latvia; [Pucite, Elina; Miglane, Evija] Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Riga, Latvia; [Slisers, Marius] Univ Latvia, Fac Med, Riga, Latvia; [Krievins, Dainis] Pauls Stradins Clin Univ Hosp, Vasc Surg Ctr, Riga, Latvia; [Krievins, Dainis] Univ Latvia, Dept Surg, Fac Med, Riga, Latvia; [Erts, Renars] Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Phys, Riga, Latvia",Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital; Riga Stradins University; University of Latvia; Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital; University of Latvia; Riga Stradins University,"Pucite, E (通讯作者)，Pauls Stradins Clin Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Riga, Latvia.;Pucite, E (通讯作者)，Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Riga, Latvia.",elina.pucite@rsu.lv,"Miglane, Evija/ABC-9630-2021; Erts, Renars/GQI-3368-2022; Miglane, Evija/AAZ-9103-2020; Jurjans, Kristaps/C-4890-2016","Erts, Renars/0000-0003-3674-8822; Miglane, Evija/0000-0003-4862-6726; Jurjans, Kristaps/0000-0003-1730-8354",,,,,26,0,0,0,4,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,608,614,,10.12955/cbup.v4.820,0.0,,,7,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000090,0

Method: This paper adopts multi-stage stratified sampling to pick out rural residents from six cities in Shandong province to make a research. Descriptive analysis has been applied to analyze the preferences with providers and their reasons of rural residents. Then multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) has been used to analyze different characteristics of medical institutions for rural residents. Results: The first choice of rural residents is rural clinic, which accounts for 57.2%. The advantages of private clinics (440 points), rural clinics (1893 points) and township hospitals or community health service (CHS) institutions (444 points) are close distance and convenience, while the advantage of county hospitals (128 points) or other medical institutions (57 points) is high-level medical skills. It has a statistical meaning and choice differences based on different age, education background, income and employment status (P< 0.00). The characteristics of rural residents to choose different types of medical institutions are also different. Conclusion: It is necessary to increase invest in PHC institutions especially the construction of rural clinics. The service ability of PHC institutions should be improved. And to improve harmonious development, the construction of medical institutions both in county and township needs to be reasonably planned. Publication and guidance of reasonable medical concept to college students should also be intensified.

Economic impacts were larger for extraction from gas wells than oil wells, while the drilling phase generated comparable impacts.

Infrastructure stock is valued in real terms from 1991 to 2009. A spatial panel approach with fixed effects is adopted to test the hypothesis of spillovers by allowing for spatial dependence. The result shows that public surface transportation infrastructure in general does have a significant impact on regional output, most of which is from spillover effect; highways have an overwhelming influence through both local effects and spillover effects. The impacts from public railway and public transit are not significant, but transit does show a positive though small spillover effect.","[Chen, Zhenhua; Haynes, Kingsley E.] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Chen, ZH (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",zchen7@gmu.edu; khaynes@gmu.edu,"Chen, Zhenhua/B-9693-2017",,US Department of Transportation Center of Excellence in Transportation and Regional Development at George Mason University; RITA/UTC II [201080],US Department of Transportation Center of Excellence in Transportation and Regional Development at George Mason University; RITA/UTC II,"This study could be completed without the data support from Matthew Dickens from American Public Transportation Association, Smith Manning, Jim Buechler, Beverly J.

To this end, a new U.S. consumer survey probes core attitudes about the reliability, affordability and environmental impact of energy. Appended quarterly to the long-running monthly survey of 500 households that produces the Index of Consumer Sentiment, this instrument inherits the sample design and statistical rigor of that household economic survey. First-year results yield several notable findings. Home energy bills are viewed as unaffordable if they were to double for consumers in the lower income tercile but only if they were to triple for consumers in the upper income tercile. Regarding the cost increases deemed unaffordable, consumers report much greater sensitivity to higher gasoline prices than to higher home energy bills. Moreover, consumers express at least as much concern about the environmental impact of energy as they do about its affordability, a result that shows some regional variation but which holds across income brackets. Several other findings are of likely interest to energy researchers and policymakers, and the unique data series generated by this survey will enable deeper analyses of attitudinally related energy topics as time goes on.

In this paper we study the Chilean industrial sector, which is the largest consumer of energy within the country. Energy demand and CO2 emissions in Chile have grown rapidly in recent years while energy supply is mostly imported and subject to disruption. Therefore, it is important to understand energy consumption in this sector and determine which sub-sectors have the greatest potential to reduce energy consumption. We used the Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA), applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method I (LMDI-I), to quantify the impact of diverse driving factors on energy consumption. Furthermore, a panel data analysis was used to determine whether there are differences in energy intensity across firms with different characteristics. Our results show that energy intensity has risen over time although energy consumption remains stable. This fact supports the idea that energy efficiency policies could play an important role for the industrial sector. Additionally, energy consumption and energy intensity follow different patterns in each sub-sector; therefore we conclude that the application of differentiated sectoral policies is preferable over a single global policy.

But stochastic choice set formation models in the random utility framework are rarely applied in this literature, although previous research has shown that ignoring choice set formation (when it exists) leads to biased parameter estimates and welfare measures. This paper conducts Monte Carlo (MC) experiments to investigate the directionality and magnitude of welfare measure bias arising from ignoring or misspecifying choice set formation. We find that when attribute cutoff-based choice set formation exists in the data generation process, typical RUM models ignoring or misspecifying choice set formation underestimate welfare measures by 30-50%. Models that approximate choice set formation may produce unbiased welfare measures, but constitute a promising area for future research. This paper illustrates the importance of applying choice set formation in environmental valuation and provides practical guidance about the usage of stochastic choice set formation models.

This paper examines bycatch in a multi-sector fishery in which the gear of one sector is imperfectly selective while in the other it is perfectly selective. In the model, the two stocks are biologically independent so the fisheries are only linked through the nonselective harvest externality. An important difference between this paper and prior work is that the bycatch problem and its solution are examined in a dynamic context. In an application to a commercial-recreational fishery, the two-sector harvest policy that maximizes social welfare is found to be cyclical rather than steady-state. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, this study introduces a low-cost approach to CSP in Brazil by describing and simulating the operation of hybrid CSP plants that use sustainably managed biomass in Brazil's semiarid northeast. Biomass hybridisation of a CSP plant with a solar multiple (SM) of 1.2 and a biomass fill fraction (BFF) of 30% can generate electricity at 110 USD/MWh. The high direct normal irradiation (DNI) and the availability of local low-cost biomass in Brazil's semiarid northeast suggest the possibility of developing a CSP industry capable of supplying low-cost components under a national program framework, with the co-benefits of local job and income generation. For example, the deployment of 10 CSP plants of 30 MWe each would generate 760 direct and indirect jobs during the 24 months of plant construction and approximately 2100 annual jobs associated with the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the generating units. These 10 new units would generate additional local income on the order of USD 57 million. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the South Korean government's ongoing efforts since 2002 to promote the deployment of renewable energy, the established deployment target has not been met and the share of renewable energy supply in total primary energy supply is poor compared to peer countries with a similar level of economic development. Therefore, we attempt to find the causes of this policy failure using qualitative evaluation methods. Through the analyses, conducted using focused interviews and secondary data, we found that the domination of the fossil fuel and nuclear power industry's interests, inconsistent policy shifts, policy design that lacks sufficient support schemes, poorly coordinated government activities, and unsystemic and untimely monitoring and feedback have led to the failure of renewable energy deployment policies in South Korea. To overcome these problems, we suggest that the South Korean government should set more ambitious policy goals, establish a new independent organization that focuses on energy policy issues, use a varied policy mix, and secure political support from diverse policy actors.

To foster shale gas development, many policy incentives have been introduced in China. However, the current incentives have not been sufficiently aggressive, and the shale gas industry has been slow to develop. Existing policies thus need to be further improved. To provide effective support for decision makers in China, a technical and economic evaluation is performed in this study to explore the profitability of shale gas production in pilot zones. The results show that shale gas production is subeconomic under the current technical and economic conditions. Based on this evaluation, a policy analysis is conducted to investigate the profitability improvement offered by the major policies available in China to elucidate a path toward improving incentive policies. The results indicate that policy instruments related to gas prices, financial subsidies, corporate income taxes or combinations thereof could be used as priority options to improve policy incentives. Based on these results, recommendations are presented to improve the current incentive polices aimed at accelerating shale gas development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This possibility has created an intense debate given the ethical, moral and scientific questions it raises. This paper examines the economic issues introduced when geoengineering becomes available in a standard model where strategic interaction leads to suboptimal mitigation. Geoengineering introduces the possibility of technical substitution away from mitigation, but it also affects the strategic interaction across countries: mitigation decisions directly affect geoengineering decisions. With similar countries, I find these strategic effects create greater incentives for free-riding on mitigation, but with asymmetric countries, the prospect of geoengineering can induce inefficiently high levels of mitigation.

Information in higher order cumulants allows identification of the parameters without imposing invertibility. By allowing for an unbounded parameter space, the generalized method of moments estimator of the MA(1) model is classical root-T consistent and asymptotically normal when the MA root is inside, outside, and on the unit circle. For more general models where the dependence of the cumulants on the model parameters is analytically intractable, we consider simulation-based estimators with two features. First, in addition to an autoregressive model, new auxiliary regressions that exploit information from the second and higher order moments of the data are considered. Second, the errors used to simulate the model are drawn from a flexible functional form to accommodate a large class of distributions with non-Gaussian features. The proposed simulation estimators are also asymptotically normally distributed without imposing the assumption of invertibility. In the application considered, there is overwhelming evidence of noninvertibility in the Fama-French portfolio returns.","[Gospodinov, Nikolay] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA; [Ng, Serena] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta; Columbia University,"Gospodinov, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",nikolay.gospodinov@atl.frb.org; sn2294@columbia.edu,"Ng, Serena/AAA-1003-2020","Ng, Serena/0000-0003-2684-364X",National Science Foundation [SES-0962431],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors thank the Editor, an Associate Editor, two anonymous referees, Prosper Dovonon, Anders Bredahl Kock, Ivana Komunjer, and the participants at the CESG meeting at Queen's University for useful comments and suggestions.

Based on the environmentally extended input-output model, this study adopts a two-step approach: (1) to estimate the embodied emissions and their intensities for 393 sectors induced by final demand; and (2) to calculate the driving factors of emission growth between 2003 and 2011 and then evaluate the result by using Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA). The findings of this study demonstrate that the impact of composition change in export with less embodied emission intensities tends to offset the increase in CO2 emission by the export scale growth. The relatively low residential electricity price has resulted in the rapid growth of household electricity consumption and significantly contributed to emissions growth. The result of SDA indicates that Korea's final demand behavior yielded high carbonization over the same period. The findings suggest that Korean government should promote exports in industries with less embedded CO2 in order to protect environments. In addition, emission information of each product and service should be provided for consumers to change their purchase patterns towards contributing to low carbon emissions as active players.

Despite their short and medium-term success, these policies could create a long-term lock-in if they are formulated in a way that leads to a stagnation of systems innovation. The research finds that while the share of wind energy has increased rapidly over time, the feed-in-tariff and other low carbon policies and incentives have not been sufficient to achieve a socio-technical regime transition in Germany yet. We suggest that the German feed-in-tariff has incorporated wind energy (a niche-innovation) and wind energy actors (pathway newcomers) into a slightly modified socio-technical regime that is rather similar to the earlier 'fossil fuel dominant' socio-technical regime.

Specifically, we conduct a quasi-experimental analysis by exploiting the spatial and temporal variation in tuition fee regimes as a result of a Federal Constitutional Court decision. Our empirical results show that the introduction of tuition fees had a particular impact on student migration. We observe three effects: first, male students show a stronger migration response compared to female students. Second, changes in migration behaviour are sensitive to geographical distance. Finally, comparing different types of higher education institutions, we find that the migration effect is larger for universities compared to technical colleges and colleges of arts or music.","[Mitze, Timo] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Mitze, Timo; Burgard, Claudia] RWI, Essen, Germany; [Mitze, Timo] RCEA, Milan, Italy; [Alecke, Bjoern] Gesell Finanz & Reg Anal GEFRA, Munster, Germany",University of Southern Denmark,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tmitze@sam.sdu.dk; burgard@rwi-essen.de; alecke@gefra-muenster.de,,"Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,40,7,7,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Thailand's land transport sector is modelled using the AIM/Enduse, which is a recursive dynamic optimization model, based on bottom-up modelling principle. The travel demand is divided into two major categories which are passenger travel and freight travel. The objective of this paper is to analyse the mitigation possible through low carbon society (LCS) measures and emission tax (ET). Two scenario clusters are devised along with the BAU case. The LCS scenario cluster has three designed scenarios which are LCS-L, LCS-M and LCS-H. The emission tax (ET) cluster has four scenarios, where the taxes of 50, 100, 200 and 500 USD/t-CO2 are implemented. Along with this the marginal abatement costs (MAC) of the countermeasures (CMs) and the co-benefits in terms of energy security, productivity and air pollutant mitigation are also assessed. Results show that LCS scenarios are possible of mitigating up to 1230 Mt-CO2 cumulatively, from 2010 to 2050. In terms of MACs, new vehicles play a pivotal role, along with hybrid vehicles. The Average Abatement Cost (AAC) assessment shows that the AAC of LCS-H scenario is in the order of 100 USD/t-CO2. All the LCS and ET scenarios show an enhancement in energy security and also a threefold increase in productivity. There is distinct mitigation in terms of air pollutants from the transport sector as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our approach introduces geological constraints into a Hotelling type extraction-exploration model. We show that such constraints, in combination with initially small reserves and strictly convex exploration costs, can coherently explain bell-shaped peaks in natural resource extraction and hence U-shapes in prices. As production increases, marginal profits (marginal revenues less marginal extraction cost) are observed to decline, while as production decreases, marginal profits rise at a positive rate that is not necessarily the rate of discount. A numerical calibration to the global oil market predicts substantially higher future oil prices and considerably lower global oil production with the more realistic geological constraints set-up than with the Hotelling simulation. While mainly (small) non-OPEC producers increase production in response to higher oil prices induced by the geological constraints, most (large) producers' production declines, leading to a lower peak level for global oil production. High future oil prices therefore, do not necessarily translate to increased oil supplies on global markets. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies calculated the total cost of ownership (TCO) to evaluate the complete cost for the consumer, focusing on individual vehicle classes, powertrain technologies, or use cases. To provide a comprehensive overview, we built a probabilistic simulation model broad enough to capture most of a national market. Our findings indicate that the comparative cost efficiency of EV increases with the consumer's driving distance and is higher for small than for large vehicles. However, our sensitivity analysis shows that the exact TCO is subject to the development of vehicle and operating costs and thus uncertain. Although the TCO of electric vehicles may become close to or even lower than that of conventional vehicles by 2025, our findings add evidence to past studies showing that the TCO does not reflect how consumers make their purchase decision today. Based on these findings, we discuss policy measures that educate consumers about the TCO of different vehicle types based on their individual preferences. In addition, measures improving the charging infrastructure and further decreasing battery cost are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite predictions that economic integration leads to increasing specialization, the opposite development has been observed at the regional level. Based on nearly three decades of West German data, this paper addresses the diversification of regional economic activity and emphasizes the role of industry dynamics, specifically newly entering business cohorts. Although a strong sectoral specialization evolves in the entry cohorts within and between regions over time, entries substantially increase the overall diversity of regions. Market selection favoured less similar entries in comparison with the initial industry structure and, thus, allowed regional diversity to increase. Overall, the regional specialization processes within each entry cohort did not become less important; however, the fields of regional specialization changed continuously over time, resulting in more diversity.","Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Noseleit, F (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",f.noseleit@rug.nl,"Noseleit, Florian/AAX-7933-2020","Noseleit, Florian/0000-0002-9881-9334",,,,,53,14,15,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The first one implies compliance with the intertemporal budget constraint, government's ability to pay the debt without renegotiation or default and that the tax burden indicators are designed either to stabilize or reduce both under a baseline scenario or alternative scenarios. The second one considers that there is sufficient funding and liquid assets to meet obligations when due, that the level and trajectory of tax burden indicators continuously facilitate market access, the debt roll over risk is low and the debt profile is balanced in terms of maturity, currency composition and investment base. The last one is based on realistic assumptions and projections in terms of macroeconomic adjustment in the primary balance, meaning that the adjustment is economically and politically feasible.

The methodology used corresponds to panel data econometrics. The analysis results confirm a differential impact of unemployment on generations. Youth employment application is better reflected in bid to employers. Young generations cover offers from areas where physical work is reduced or jobs that require higher education. Older people find their place increasingly difficult on labor market, they even accepting low paid jobs or not qualified ones. In terms of regional distribution, we can identify clear patterns, Bucharestzone being an exception; otherwise, it appears to be atypical in the other analyzes too.

This study constitutes part of a holistic OMWW management approach aiming at the production of high added value products from OMWW with zero discharge. OMWW constitutes an organic material that could be recycled back to the soil after its treatment with microfiltration, and used as liquid fertilizer for plant production, thus leading to an environmentally friendly cultivation method with minor carbon footprint, since wastewater would (partially or fully) substitute mineral fertilizers, fresh water savings, and also economic benefits to the farmer. Microfiltered OMWW (MF-OMWW) was applied to maize cultivation in a clay loam soil using two rates of 25 and 50 Mg ha(-1), with the addition of mineral fertilization of 200 kg N ha(-1). Furthermore, a treatment of only MF-OMWW applied at the rates of 50 Mg ha(-1) and an only mineral fertilization treatment were used. The four treatments were replicated four times. The results of the 1st year experiment showed that the different amounts of MF-OMWW used had no significant effect on soil properties. Maize yield, kernel moisture and fat content were not significantly influenced by the different treatments, whereas kernel protein, starch, fiber and ash content were significantly affected. Considering all quality and quantity parameters studied, the treatment with only mineral fertilizer N application gave similar results with the only MF-OMWW treatment, indicating the potential of mineral fertilizer full substitution by MF-OMWW, under the conditions of our study.

The names of English novels usually have a richer culture, it embodies the character traits and characters in the novel, such as the outcome of their fate.

The background of this study is based also on the previous empirical researches of the authors, where they found statistically significant tendency of a middle strong negative correlation (r=-0.615, p=0.000) between the achieved competitiveness level of a country and its growth capacity - so-called developed countries have lower growth capacity. This tendency made the authors think of the HD trends. What if countries with higher indicators of HD also have lower growth capacity in the development of their people? And how are GC and HD trends interconnected? So, the purpose of this study is to take a fresh look at HD in global comparative researches, taking into consideration the abovementioned previous findings in global competitiveness trends. Correlation analysis of HDI 2006 and average annual change of HDI 2006-2012 showed that similarly with GCI growth trends countries with higher HD level also have lower growth capacity in this indicator (r=-0.573, p=0.000). The authors also found out that global growth trends of GCI and HDI are interconnected with statistically significant positive correlation (r=+0.364, p=0.000). The authors conclude that globally more developed countries are currently losing not only their GC, but also HD capacity, and both these trends are statistically significant. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The economic science offers an abstract understanding of the process, seen as the ultimate internationalization of commerce, capital, finances and labor. The anti-globalist side perceives globalization as the engine of a new imperialism, which replaces the old military expansionism with economic instruments. The conspiratorial vision further sustains that globalization is a subversive process, directed for hundreds of years in order to serve the interest of the global elites. This article aims to explain the conspiratorial perception of globalization considering the exogenous and endogenous factors that maintain the predilection for conspiratorial deductions. By analyzing the literature and the virtual conspiracy rhetoric, we found five conditions that allow the perpetuation of conspiracy theories: (1) the historical precedents (2) the discontinuities of modernity (3) the opposing doctrines and the related social categorizing; (4) the lack of certainty and transparency; (5) the persistence of the myth. We consider that globalization was conducted through many forms of imperialism, revealing the human need for power and domination. Even if there is no clear evidence of a major plot to globalize the economy, we can still show that globalization is a process conducted by intention and individual/group interest - in different time periods, sequentially and systematically - and not by the random choices of unorganized individuals seeking the extension of their profits. This is where the conspiratorial reasoning intervenes (Cui bono?), bringing several arguments that support the conspiratorial hypothesis: the intentionality in the economic processes, the need for a causal reasoning and the prevailing private interest in the masse-elites relationship.

But both the awakening of the people and an increase in relations with prosperous neighbours allowed Spain to momentarily join the group of industrialised countries. Notwithstanding his recommendations, Say pointed to the fragility of this privileged situation in the face of political change.

We find an extraordinary increase in trend matching efficiency after the reforms, which testifies to a permanent improvement. Matching efficiency accounts for about half of the BC inward shift. As tightness also increased, a persistent upward movement masked the inward shift.","[Klinger, Sabine; Weber, Enzo] Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Klinger, Sabine; Weber, Enzo] Univ Regensburg, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Weber, Enzo] IOS, Landshuter Str, Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung,"Klinger, S (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.;Klinger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",sabine.klinger@iab.de; enzo.weber@iab.de,,,,,,,46,17,19,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

J,"Marshall, JP",,,,"Marshall, Jonathan Paul",,,Disordering fantasies of coal and technology: Carbon capture and storage in Australia,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon capture and storage; Social defence mechanisms; Climate politics,IMAGINARIES,"One of the main ways that continued use of coal is justified, and compensated for, is through fantasies of technology. This paper explores the politics of 'Carbon Capture and Storage' (CCS) technologies in Australia. These technologies involve capturing CO2 emissions, usually to store them 'safely' underground in a process called 'geo-sequestration'. In Australia the idea of 'clean coal' has been heavily promoted, and is a major part of CO2 emissions reduction plans, despite the technological difficulties, the lack of large scale working prototypes, the lack of coal company investment in such research, and the current difficulties in detecting leaks. This paper investigates the ways that the politics of 'clean coal' have functioned as psycho-social defence mechanisms, to prolong coal usage, assuage political discomfort and anxiety, and increase the systemic disturbance produced by coal power.

In this paper, we consider the impact of this trade barrier, using a sample of 454 stock-listed PV producing firms. We find that the trade barrier erased US$ 8,19 million off the value of the average European PV manufacturers and US$ 247.03 million off the value of the average Chinese PV manufacturers. We also find that while the trade barrier reduced the willingness of the industry to reorganise, it stimulates Chinese manufacturers to reorganise both their domestic and their international operations. The latter, we warn, is likely an attempt by Chinese manufacturers to 'tariff jump'. We conclude, therefore, that the trade barrier was both inefficient, in that it both hurt the companies it aimed to protect, and ineffective, as those it sought to punish may have circumvented it.","[McCarthy, Killian J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"McCarthy, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",,,"McCarthy, Killian/0000-0002-3999-9881",,,,,14,17,18,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2016,99.0,,,,,,154,157,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.055,0.0,,,4,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EC3VS,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388055800015,0

Coal fired power and removal of obstacles to private corporations investing in generating capacity are core elements in this program. With difficulties in boosting national coal production, the state-owned Coal India Limited and energy corporations have spearheaded a range of global coal sourcing endeavours, including investing in offshore deposits. Energy security has become reflected in engineering global supply chains, securing control of coal, with two of the largest projects involving Adani and GVK proposing to develop mines in the Galilee Basin in Queensland, Australia. These investments become the institutional and organisational architecture that locks in demand, a global demand which helps to explain successive Australian governments support for and approval of the projects. Notwithstanding considerable environmental opposition, and questions about the economic merits and commercial viability of the projects, Australian governments are wedded to the conviction that expanded development of the economy is tied to extracting and exporting fossil fuels, to consolidating Australia as an 'energy superpower'.

This examination is carried out by means of a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we conduct an endogenous grouping, regression based convergence test. Unlike previous studies, this methodology endogenously identifies groups of states with emissions that are converging to a similar steady state growth path over time. In the second stage, we evaluate the conditional rate of convergence for the whole sample and for each club using panel data, fixed effects models that control for unobserved, time-invariant heterogeneous effects. More specifically, we examine the rates of convergence conditional on certain structural and non-structural characteristics of the state economy. Results from stage one and stage two suggest that one group of twenty-six states is converging to a unique steady-state equilibrium, and otherwise, the remaining states are diverging. Finally, we discuss different policy approaches to mitigating carbon dioxide emissions based on the club convergence hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Burnett, J.

The public implementation of energy efficiency consultants (EECs) as change agents aims at the diffusion of innovation in residential building efficiency and overcoming information asymmetries in the construction sector. However, the success of these measures has been described as low. We conducted a case study involving 17 in-depth expert interviews to examine the causes of this failure in the case of Germany. In Germany, EECs are organized in a certification scheme which is prerequisite to participate in the publicly funded subsidy system. This analysis has important implications for EECs in general and hence other European countries pursuing such policies. We show that information asymmetries (ex-ante/ex-post) in the ECC market lead to a low willingness to pay. Certification of EECs does not suffice to overcome information asymmetries. We also identify a mismatch between EECs and customer incentives. As top-down policies have failed to facilitate a viable EEC market, we recommend a greater role for private and private-public networks, the cutting of EEC subsidies and a closer alignment between climate policy goals and home owners' economic efficiency considerations.

It is even more important in the vast Brazilian pre-salt domains, where the technological requirements are high and sophisticated. The Brazilian National Oil Company, Petrobras, is facing severe financial limitations to undertake these disbursements. Other oil companies will therefore have to be significantly engaged in the endeavour, which reinforces further the importance of attracting investments in Brazil. Yet this article shows that the governance architecture established in the 2010 Brazilian oil framework will deter investments in several ways, giving rise to agency problems among entities and moral hazard situations because of contractual legal liabilities. There are some credible indications that the government of President Lula overestimated the attractiveness of the Brazilian pre-salt oil discoveries and their capacity to draw investments when proposing the 2010 changes. Little attention was given to the careful examination of how the framework would affect investors, under the assumption that the favourable geological conditions would be sufficiently attractive in themselves. Even though the 2010 reforms have brought some minor advancements and there have been some signs that the government has been recently attempting to mitigate some of the problems examined in this article, that is not enough.

The long-term benefits of such policies in the context of international climate change mitigation depend on their effects on near-term emissions abatement and resultant long-term technological change that will reduce abatement costs of achieving global mitigation goals. There is also an argument that these policies might foster early-mover advantages in international low-carbon technology markets. We first review the factors that could influence such benefits and use a global integrated assessment model to present an illustrative example to understand the potential magnitude of these benefits. We find that reductions in long-term abatement costs might not provide sufficient incentives to justify policies to promote the deployment of low-carbon technologies, in particular, the emerging, higher-risk, and currently expensive alternatives. We also find that early mover advantages can potentially provide substantial benefits, but only if these advantages are both strong and persistent. Our results suggest a role for international cooperation in low-carbon technology deployment to address the existence of free-riding opportunities in the context of global climate change mitigation.

It allows us to identify current policy dilemmas, bottlenecks and discrepancies and to disentangle some of them while offering up a way forward with others. We do not so much offer distinct recommendations but focus more on delineating how to clear the pathway for sound policy intervention and outcomes.

This paper adopts provincial panel data from 1990 to 2014 and employs quantile regression model to investigate the influencing factors of China's CO2 emissions. The results show that economic growth plays a dominant role in the growth of CO2 emissions due to massive fixed-asset investment and export trade. The influences of energy intensity on the lower 10th and upper 90th quantile provinces are stronger than those in the 25th-50th quantile provinces because of big differences in R&D expenditure and human resources distribution. The impact of urbanization increases continuously from the lower lath quantile provinces to the 10th-25th, 25th-50th, 50th-75th, 75th-90th and upper 90th quantile provinces, owing to the differences in R&D personnel, real estate development and motor-vehicle ownership. The effect of industrialization on the upper 90th quantile provinces is greater than those on other quantile provinces on account of the differences in the industrial scale and the development of the building industry. Thus, the heterogeneity effects of influencing factors on different quantile provinces should be taken into consideration when discussing the mitigation of CO2 emissions in China.

This study assessed availability and economics of co-firing beetle kill biomass with coal in power plants in the western U.S. Since biomass may be considered carbon neutral under careful management, co-combustion of biomass with coal provides power plants a way to meet emission reduction requirements, such as those in the EPA Clean Power Plan (CPP). Cost has been a barrier to co-firing, but the economics are altered by emission reduction requirements, such as CPP guidelines. The present study assessed beetle kill biomass availability in national forests in Wyoming and Colorado through Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of U.S. Forest Service (USFS) data. Power plants near beetle kill mortality were identified as candidates for co-firing. An economic assessment of costs to implement co-firing was conducted. Co-firing reduces the need for the USFS to manage beetle kill trees when they are harvested for energy use, and these mitigated treatment costs were considered as an effective subsidy of co-firing. The results of this analysis include beetle kill availability, costs, and annual CO2 emissions reductions that can be met by co-firing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

India's rapid economic growth has enabled the growing middle class to buy household appliances in increasing numbers. The consequent rise in energy consumption and GHG emissions can be significantly reduced if consumers are motivated by awareness and options in the market to buy energy efficient appliances. India has introduced a star rating scheme for appliances, and even without incentives consumers purchase star-rated appliances. The stock of household appliances is projected using the data of a national sample survey of household consumption, observed sale of star-rated appliances and projected consumption distribution. Estimated savings in households' electricity consumption from just four appliances, ACs, refrigerators, TVs, and ceiling fans, for which data were available, range from 52 bKwh to 145 bkwh in 2030, reductions of 10-27%. The corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions will be between 42 Mt and 116 Mt in 2030. With policies of finance and bulk procurement to reduce costs, emissions reduction can be 128 Mt in 2030, a reduction of 30%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It also creates though the necessity to distill via statistical technology the informative elements of this prodigious and indeed colossal data source. Using mixed text sources from professional platforms, blog fora, and stock message boards, we distill via different lexica sentiment variables. These are employed for an analysis of stock reactions: volatility, volume, and returns. An increased sentiment, especially for those with negative prospection, will influence volatility as well as volume. This influence is contingent on the lexical projection and different across Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors. Based on review articles on 100 S&P 500 constituents for the period of October 20, 2009, to October 13, 2014, we project into BL, MPQA, LM lexica and use the distilled sentiment variables to forecast individual stock indicators in a panel context. Exploiting different lexical projections to test different stock reaction indicators we aim at answering the following research questions: 1. Are the lexica consistent in their analytic ability? 2. To which degree is there an asymmetric response given the sentiment scales (positive v.s. negative)? 3. Are the news of high attention firms diffusing faster and result in more timely and efficient stock reaction? 4. Is there a sector specific reaction from the distilled sentiment measures? We find that there is significant incremental information in the distilled news flow and the sentiment effect is characterized as an asymmetric, attention-specific, and sector-specific response of stock reactions.","[Zhang, Junni L.] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junni L.] Peking Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Hardle, Wolfgang K.; Chen, Cathy Y.; Bommes, Elisabeth] Humboldt Univ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Hardle, Wolfgang K.] Singapore Management Univ, Sim Kee Boon Inst Financial Econ, Adm Bldg,81 Victoria St, Singapore 188065, Singapore; [Chen, Cathy Y.] Chung Hua Univ, 707,Sec 2,WuFu Rd, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan",Peking University; Peking University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Singapore Management University; Chung Hua University,"Zhang, JNL (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JNL (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",zjn@gsm.pku.edu.cn; haerdle@hu-berlin.de; cathy1107@gmail.com; Elisabeth.Bommes@hu-berlin.de,"Härdle, Wolfgang K/C-5963-2013","Hardle, Wolfgang Karl/0000-0001-5600-3014",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through Humbold-Universitat zu Berlin [SFB 649],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through Humbold-Universitat zu Berlin,"This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the SFB 649 Economic Risk, Humbold-Universitat zu Berlin.

Though most of the hard work lies ahead, it marks an important first step for the collective global community to address climate change. Fossil fuels continue to remain one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and for many developing countries high levels fossil fuels continues to enable an overconsumption of fossil fuels. Given the sensitivity of governments to subsidy reforms, this study examines the household welfare implications of the removal of fossil fuel subsidies. It finds that while welfare implications are unambiguously positive for government the results are mixed for private households, although in an overwhelming majority of cases, the results are positive. However, even in the cases where the welfare implications are negative for private households we find that it is possible for governments to carry out the reforms in such a way as to be welfare improving to households incomes by compensating them with some of the fiscal savings gained from the subsidy reform.

We present results from an analysis of aggregated account-level utility billing data for energy consumption across the over two million properties in Los Angeles County. Results show that consumption in L.A. County varies widely with geography, income, building characteristics, and climate. Several higher-income areas have greater total energy use per building even in cooler climates, while many lower-income regions rank higher for energy use per square-foot. Energy consumption also correlates with building age, which varies widely throughout the region. Our results demonstrate the many complex and interrelated factors that influence urban energy use. While billing data is critical for devising energy efficiency programs that actually realize estimated savings and promote more sustainable cities, opening access to such data presents significant challenges for protecting personal privacy. The presented approach is adaptable and scalable to cities seeking to develop data-driven policies to reduce building energy use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, it has been shown that the awareness of role model entrepreneurs in the cluster enhances the entrepreneurial intentions of the employees. Secondly, the embeddedness in personal relations with suppliers and customers has proven to exert significant impact in the locational preferences toward the cluster of origin. Overall, the findings of the paper have shed light on how cluster environment poses its impact on nascent entrepreneurs through different mechanisms in the different decision-making processes.

On the supply side, there is interest in integrating renewable energy sources (solar, wind), which are known to vary daily and hourly. On the demand side, the concept of demand response is driving a need to better understand the impact of peak versus off-peak loading, with the objective of maximizing efficiency. In this study, we examine the case of electric power generation in Singapore, and aim to assess the half-hourly variation in associated average carbon dioxide emissions. Given the country's serious push for clean energy solutions and a possibility of adopting carbon trading in the future, we feel the need to address the currently existing gap in research on daily CO2 emissions patterns. By associating representative electricity generation data with the characterized fleet of power plants, half-hourly emissions are found to range between 415 and 455 kg CO2 per MW h. Marginal emission factors show a fluctuating daily pattern between 390 and 800 kg CO2/MW h. Policy makers able to work with real generation data can use this approach to understand the carbon footprint of short-term supply and demand interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When other indirect measures are taken to impact emissions in a specific sector under the cap (such as a push for renewables in the electric power sector), this has implications on the overall allowance price, and on CO2 emissions both from this specific sector and the other sectors under the cap. The central contribution of this paper is the derivation of impact curves, which describe these interactions, i.e., the impact on allowance price and the shift of emissions across sectors. From a set of detailed simulations of the electric power system operation, a so-called emission plane is obtained, from which impact curves can be derived. Focus is on interactions between CO2 abatement through fuel switching and measures affecting the residual electricity demand (such as deployment of renewables) in the electric power sector, as well as on interactions with other sectors, both in a short-term framework.

Although, Latin America is not a high-energy consumer, its share in global consumption is expected to grow, especially in the transportation sector. This make essential for developing countries the adoption of better policies to identify the vehicle groups with largest fuel demands. The present study describes the VKT technique to disaggregate road transport energy consumption by vehicle type, applied to the road transportation system of Ecuador. It also describes the procedures performed to estimate the variables required to run the model, and some of the practical applications that be used to create public policies. Results show as the biggest fuel consumers the heavy-duty freight cargo, followed by light duty vehicles. The estimation of greenhouse gas emissions evidence that road transport released 14.3 million tons of CO2 in 2012. When fuel consumption is compared by it costs, it can be confirmed that Ecuadorean Government covered, through subsidies, for 68% of the annual fuel costs of national road transport, demonstrating the importance of restructuring these expenditures in order to achieve an efficient road transport system.

The increasing frequency of recessionary shocks and the difference in regional growth trajectories in periods of both recession and recovery have resulted in an increased interest in the notion of resilience in the recent literature. This paper, through a discussion of the impacts of recession on Turkish regions, presents an empirical exploration of the concept of regional resilience, categorizing the responses of different regions during economic cycles. A discriminant function analysis is used to explore and explain the differences between resilience categories based on the attributes of the 26 NUTS-II regions, indicating which attributes contribute most to group separation.","[Eraydin, Ayda] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Eraydin, A (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",ayda@metu.edu.tr,"ERAYDIN, Ayda/B-1344-2018",,Turkish Scientific Council [108K613],Turkish Scientific Council(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),The author thanks the Turkish Scientific Council for providing support for the research project on regional resilience (grant number 108K613).,,56,63,77,17,98,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A thermal refurbishment process, in particular, involves numerous decisions and choices; the decision-makers being ultimately confronted with two major questions: which criterion should be adopted in the choice of the refurbishment construction solutions and which refurbishment construction solutions should be chosen? In this paper, a criterion based on technical and economic points of view is proposed, aiming to identify the cost-optimal package of energy efficient solutions from among a set of possible refurbishment measures, within the life cycle of buildings. Sensitivity analyses are also performed so that the results may help the decision-maker choose the appropriate refurbishment solutions to be adopted when different discount rates and building orientations are taken into consideration. A total of seven scenarios, for a macroeconomic perspective, and nine, for a financial perspective, are performed. The costoptimal methodology adopted, following the Directive 2010/31/EU (2010) recommendations, is applied to a Portuguese reference building. The analysis carried out allows obtaining low global life cycle costs solutions and points towards nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) concept. The results are important for drawing national political instruments on buildings energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We use principal component analysis (PCA) to build an index of social networks and explore its impact on the probability of getting a job and on wage levels using the Households Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) longitudinal survey data (2002-2010). We find a positive effect of social capital on migrants' employment outcomes and wages, especially for women. Distinguishing employment into blue and white-collar jobs, we find that social capital only affects the probability of getting a white-collar job. These results suggest that promoting opportunities to create social capital has a beneficial effect on migrants' integration in the host country.

Se encontro un efecto positivo del capital social en los resultados y los salarios del empleo de migrantes, especialmente para las mujeres.

The sector will require thermal power plants for the decades to come, but their business cases are (negatively) affected by this transformation. This study presents a novel tool to quantify the effect of policy, price and project-related uncertainties on power plant business cases. This tool can support policymakers in stimulating necessary investments in new thermal generation capacity. We find that these investments are currently unsound (power plants recoup on average -12% to 59% of their initial investment). Future climate policy, i.e. the CO2 price, has a very strong impact on business cases (affects the profitability by 5-40%-points). The impact of the deployment of wind power is average (2-8%-point difference between 10% and 21% wind penetration). Variations in annual wind power production barely affect the profitability (variation of +/- 1%-point). To stimulate new investments, policy makers should first decrease the uncertainty in business cases caused by policy. Durable climate policy is especially important. Also, policies to increase the profits of thermal power plants should be carefully considered and implemented. This combined approach will reduce the revenue gap that needs to be bridged by supportive policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Tacit' knowledge is a fuzzy concept - a kind of never opened black box - that has not allowed understanding about how knowledge gives birth to monetary income, or to regional development. This paper proposes a distinction between substantial and significant knowledge. While the former refers to knowledge being sold and bought like a good or embodied in goods on the basis of ownership, the latter claims that knowledge workers, firms or communities are remunerated following the institution of authorship, i.e. their capacity to create meaning. This would be a central institution in an increasingly culture-based economy. A typology of regional knowledge-anchoring milieus is then built on this distinction.

Applying the contingent valuation, this study investigates the Korean public's preferences for governmental support for overseas oil and gas E&P projects. The result shows that the governmental support for overseas E&P projects rather decreases public utility. The primary reason behind this utility decrease is that some respondents protested to bid because of their resistance toward tax increase without guaranteeing the efficient government support. This result implies that simple tax increases for expansion of the governmental support may bring about public's strong opposition.

The additive noise model allows for -mixing dependent exogenous noise, random sampling, and an endogenous noise component that encompasses synchronization errors, lead-lag relations, and diurnal heteroscedasticity. The various components may exhibit polynomially decaying autocovariances. In this setting, the class of estimators considered is consistent, asymptotically unbiased, and mixed Gaussian at the optimal rate of convergence, n(1/4). A simple finite sample correction based on projections of symmetric matrices ensures positive definiteness without altering the asymptotic properties of the estimators. It, thereby, guarantees the existence of nonlinear transformations of the estimated covariance matrix such as correlations and realized betas, which inherit the asymptotic properties from the flat-top realized kernel estimators. An empirically motivated simulation study assesses the choice of sampling scheme and projection rule, and it shows that flat-top realized kernels have a desirable combination of robustness and efficiency relative to competing estimators. Last, an empirical analysis of signal detection and out-of-sample predictions for a portfolio of six stocks of varying size and liquidity illustrates the use and properties of the new estimators.","[Varneskov, Rasmus Tangsgaard] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Varneskov, Rasmus Tangsgaard] CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Varneskov, RT (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.;Varneskov, RT (通讯作者)，CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",rvarneskov@creates.au.dk,,"Varneskov, Rasmus/0000-0002-6533-5608","Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University, CREATES; Kobmand Ferdinand Sallings Mindefond; Danish National Research Foundation","Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University, CREATES; Kobmand Ferdinand Sallings Mindefond; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","Some of this article was written while I was visiting the Oxford-Man Institute, University of Oxford, whose hospitality I am grateful for.

In Italy, the hourly equilibrium price for all buyers is computed as a uniform average of supply zonal prices, resulting from market splitting due to line congestion. We model ex-ante individual bids expressed by heterogeneous consumers, which are distinguished by geographical zones. Using empirical estimations, we compute demand elasticity values and new zonal prices, according to a Ramsey optimal scheme. This is a new approach in the wholesale electricity market literature, as previous studies have discussed the relative merit of zonal prices, considering only the issue of line congestion. Our results show that the optimal pricing scheme can improve welfare in the day-ahead Italian electricity market, with respect to both the existing uniform price scheme and the proposal to charge the existing supply zonal prices to the demand side.

In this paper we compare estimates of the hedge ratio from a classical approach of a linear quantile regression, based on selected quantiles as medians, with that of a non-linear quantile regression. To estimate the hedge ratios, we have used a calibrated Student t distribution for the marginal densities and a Student t copula of the portfolio returns using a maximum likelihood estimation. We created two portfolios of the assets, one for equal weight and another for optimal weight in respect of minimal risk. Our findings show that an assumption of Student t marginal leads to a better estimation of the hedge ratio.","[Bohdalova, Maria; Gregus, Michal] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava 81806, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Bohdalová, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava 81806, Slovakia.",Maria.Bohdalova@fm.uniba.sk; Michal.gregus@fm.uniba.sk,"GREGUŠ, Michal/JXW-8133-2024","GREGUŠ, Michal/0000-0002-8156-8962",,,,,8,0,0,1,4,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,229,234,,10.12955/cbup.v4.874,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000033,0

Accounting for endogeneity between output volatility and fiscal developments by using system-generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation techniques, the results indicate that discretionary fiscal policy contributes to output volatility and induces macroeconomic instability at the regional level in Russia. This corroborates previous studies using cross-country data.

It is always regarded as a whole system to unite culture and governance to distribute cultural resources and power make public cultural policy and deal with public cultural affairs. Nowadays, due to industrialization and urbanization, the social flow for urban and rural areas has been enhanced. People in different regions have different life styles and customs, which formed a challenge in fairness of public cultural service. Yunnan province is a kingdom famous for its various ethnic groups and cultural diversity in China, which lies to the border next to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. For this reason, the cultural phenomena there are so various and complicated, and also it has its traits in cultural development which are different from the ones in other areas.

Drivers of university-industry links: the case of knowledge-intensive business service firms in rural locations, Regional Studies. Establishing collaborative links with universities is a difficult task with an uncertain outcome and influenced by many factors including location, geographic distance, compatibility of interests, shared understanding and prior experience of collaboration. Drawing on an analysis of knowledge-intensive business service firms (KIBS) located in predominantly rural districts of the UK, this paper examines the influences on partner selection when developing formal university linkage through knowledge transfer partnerships. The findings indicate that both geographic and organizational proximity are significantly associated with partner choice, indicating that the formation of university-industry links is the result not only of spatial factors but also of prior experience of collaboration.","[Johnston, Andrew] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield Business Sch, Int Business & Econ Res Grp, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England; [Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",Sheffield Hallam University; Cardiff University,"Johnston, A (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield Business Sch, Int Business & Econ Res Grp, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",a.johnston@shu.ac.uk; hugginsr@cardiff.ac.uk,"Johnston, Andrew/AFM-9399-2022","Johnston, Andrew/0000-0001-5352-9563",,,,,117,45,50,3,113,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The CSV concept considers business and society as closely related to each other and lies on business strategies that enhance the competitiveness of companies, while at the same time advancing the economic and social conditions of the society they operate in. The current theoretical and practical discourse of tourism in the Czech Republic is still focused on the area of economic benefits and positives that tourism generates, but there is missing wide discussion about the threats and negative consequences, externalities of tourism. Some Czech authors of destination management theory resign from natural control/regulation function of management that could cause unsustainability of development of tourism in the Czech Republic. The setting of destination management activities in a destination may resign on sustainable principles within designed destination strategy, so the tourism company with implemented CSV concept could prevent this risk of environmental or social harms. The CSV concept could be the opportunity to reduce or eliminate threats and externalities caused by tourism activities. Therefore, the development of tourism could be much more sustainable.","[Konarik, Marek] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Konarík, M (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",marek@konarik.info,,,Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU [IGA/FaME/2015/026],Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU,The author is thankful to the Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU No. IGA/FaME/2015/026 Navrh modelu vzniku klastrove organizace v oblasti zemedelstvi a cestovniho ruchu v podminkach Ceske republiky a v oblasti designu na Slovensku for financial support to carry out this research.,,24,0,0,1,10,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-592-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,221,228,,10.7441/dokbat.2016.22,0.0,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6IP,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000466741400022,0

Such schemes were established as one of the substitute options of food distribution in the space of traditional forms of food distribution and consumption. With view to the actual dramatic development of alternative food networks in the Czech Republic, it is not surprising that in a recent period, a number of studies shift attention to this issue. Most studies are focused on the development of short (food) supply chains, particularly farmers' markets and direct sales. Because SFSCs/AFNs are a relatively current topic and an unexplored concept in many characteristics, the authors of the presented paper use the example of the box scheme (the so-called farm boxes) to describe selected aspects of its development in the Czech Republic while applying geographic, agroeconomic and marketing approaches. The analysis is based on data of specialized web databases which actors of the box scheme use to offer their product via on-line channels. First results reveal a regional differentiation of farm boxes in the Czech republic, relationships between customers, headquarters and supply points and differences in the nature of the product (for example the range of offered commodities...) and its management.","[Konecny, Ondrej; Hajna, Katerina; Zdrahal, Ivo] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Tr Gen Piky 9, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Konecny, O (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Tr Gen Piky 9, Brno, Czech Republic.",ondrej.konecny@mendelu.cz; xhajna1@node.mendelu.cz; ivo.zdrahal@mendelu.cz,"Zdrahal, Ivo/E-4335-2018; Konečný, Ondřej/F-6082-2010","Zdrahal, Ivo/0000-0002-6631-8228; Konečný, Ondřej/0000-0003-3098-7726",,,,,11,1,1,0,10,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,493,501,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500058,0

Taking their role into consideration, we will be able to understand factors that influence the positive or negative attitude towards the inclusion of children with disabilities in general classrooms. 146 teachers participated in this study. The instrument used (created by Jeffrey Bailey) for data collection consisted on a self-reporting questionnaire divided into two sections. In the first section, demographic information from teachers is required. In the second section, teachers' attitude towards the inclusion of children with disabilities in general schools is measured. According to the results: Teacher's gender [t (144) = 0,503, P = 0,616] did not affect their attitudes towards the inclusion of children with disabilities in regular schools. Training on inclusive education [r = 0.75, n = 146 and p = 0.001] positively affected the attitudes of the teachers. It was concluded that development of trainings for teachers should be focused on because it creates professionals with knowledge of specific techniques.","[Lika, Rovena] European Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania",European University of Tirana,"Lika, R (通讯作者)，European Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania.",rovena.lika@uet.edu.al,,,,,,,8,0,2,0,9,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,578,582,,10.12955/cbup.v4.817,0.0,,,5,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000085,0

Some unforeseen or unwanted results may influence the use of space and spatial structures, for example. Car-sharing is an invention that competes with car ownership and which can drastically rise the efficiency of car use and reduce the number of vehicles per users. Diffusion of car-sharing will accelerate in the near future. The spatial consequences of a car-ownership-oriented-century are already known. However, the complications of all travelers using shared automobiles is yet to be understood. It is therefore appropriate to anticipate and prepare for potential side effects of this innovation's diffusion and thus avoid possible negative consequences. This reasoning has led to our research into the relationship between modern mobility innovations and metropolitan spatial structures. The earliest implementations of new transport technologies appeared in metropolises, which also have the highest level of general mobility. This article presents the assumptions and principles from scenario-based research. The example shows how diffusion of this innovation determine possible scenarios relating to future impacts of car-sharing on spatial structures.","[Smolnicki, Piotr Marek; Soltys, Jacek] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Design & Reg Planning, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Smolnicki, PM (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Design & Reg Planning, Gdansk, Poland.",piotr.smolnicki@pg.gda.pl; jsoltys@pg.gda.pl,"Smolnicki, Piotr/F-5014-2015; Smolnicki, Piotr Marek/O-6467-2019","Smolnicki, Piotr/0000-0002-1843-4670; Smolnicki, Piotr Marek/0000-0002-1843-4670",,,,,31,0,0,0,5,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,814,819,,10.12955/cbup.v4.858,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000125,0

The agricultural subsidies are an essential aspect of agriculture and play an important role in international trade. A policy to support farming incomes in the European Union is called the Common Agricultural Policy. It is the complicated policy that includes many tools. An impact of policy of EU agricultural support on the economic performance of agricultural enterprises is therefore an interesting question, especially for policy makers. The agriculture in Slovakia has undergone significant changes, not only in terms of its position in the national economy, but also in terms of its importance at the regional level. There are still persistent differences between better and worse natural conditions as well as economic and social differences with a possible impact on the level of gross agricultural production in different regions of Slovakia. The aim of this paper is to quantify the dependence of agricultural production from the subsidies granted in the context of regions under the NUTS III classification. For the calculation, we used Pearson correlation coefficient that determines the direction and rate of statistical dependence force of two numeric variables. The analysis confirmed our assumption, the result of which is that between amount of gross agricultural production and the volume of subsidies granted is a strong correlation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The challenge is difficult because of an inefficient building stock and high penetration of natural gas. We present new quantified scenarios for residential energy use in the UK to 2050. With minimal policy intervention the UK will remain locked into a gas based heating system, which would conflict with the policy goal of decarbonisation. However, there is a range of scenarios in which this is avoided. A system heavily reliant on heat pumps powered by low carbon electricity is UK policy makers' currently preferred alternative. We conclude that some shift in this direction is likely to be required, but complete reliance on this solution raises a number of problems. Greater use of energy efficiency and biomass can also play a significant role. These options have different risks, but a more diversified strategy would be more prudent. We conclude that the future of UK residential space heating is very uncertain, but meeting low carbon heating goals is better conceptualised as reducing reliance on gas rather than necessarily mass electrification. Our analysis has implications for any country with high use of fossil fuels in space heating and ambitious decarbonisation goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As the current market design, with a single bidding area, ignores the physical constraints of the transmission grid, there is an ongoing discussion about introducing price zones. Against this background, we develop a three-stage approach to model redispatch and market splitting for Germany while considering interactions with interconnected countries. We identify an increasing spatial imbalance between generation and load and delays in grid extension as being the main drivers for the increase of modeled redispatch volumes from 2012 to 2020. We show that market splitting reduces imminent congestion although results are sensitive to the zonal delimitation and corresponding net transfer capacities. The overall welfare effect is negligible, but price differences between the bidding areas investigated, i.e. one Northern and Southern price zone, result in considerable distributional effects. While consumers in Northern Germany would benefit - producer rents and in particular the value of wind energy would decrease - the opposite is true for Southern Germany. We conclude that market splitting constitutes a solution to reduce redispatch measures as long as transmission grid expansion is further delayed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Interrelating dynamic proximities by bridging, reducing and producing distances, Regional Studies. The proximity concept explains the spatiality of relations and innovations with various dimensions of proximity. The paper adapts this framework to the processes of change. It integrates the interrelations between different dynamics into the nomenclature of proximity and distance. Three dynamics are proposed that both interfere with and enable interaction: learning, connecting and moving. These dynamics cause changes in cognitive, network and spatial proximity. Using these dynamics, two arguments are introduced as the basis for a concept of dynamic proximity: (1) proximity in one dimension enables interaction despite distance in other dimensions; and (2) reducing distance at the dyadic level produces distance as externality.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Menzel, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",menzel@geowiss.uni-hamburg.de,"Menzel, Max-Peter/JDW-8861-2023","Menzel, Max-Peter/0000-0003-0298-1159",,,,,119,29,31,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In order to protect domestic consumers from this volatility, historically the government of India tried to control the domestic price of petroleum products by cross subsidization and giving subsidies. In this paper, we analyze the impact of crude oil price on domestic oil prices by applying nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM) approaches for the period of April, 2005-July, 2014. The GHSOM has been explored through pattern analysis on the asymmetric behavior using similarity measures. From the study it can be interpreted that the prices of products left to be determined by the market exhibit a strong asymmetry. However, pricing of the products that are monitored and controlled by the government do not exhibit any such asymmetry. Hence, the question still remains - should the government intervene in pricing petroleum products when monopolistic attitudes of large oil companies are detrimental to the interest of retail consumers?

For example, as part of an on-going annual Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) implementation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requests stakeholder feedback/analysis of programmatic effects, including impacts on gasoline/diesel prices and compliance costs. Motivated by the need for regulatory-specific feedback, a novel regional market model is developed that quantifies price impacts across different regional markets for a number of market variables, including several types of compliance certificates known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). An analysis of the most recent EPA proposal suggests that the D4 (bio-diesel) RIN price could rise to >$1.00/RIN. Sensitivity results show that the D4 RIN price is highly sensitive to soybean oil prices, while D5/D6 RIN prices are most sensitive to the volume of E85 consumed. It was found that the projected costs associated with the RFS in 2017 could be reduced by approximately 50% if an additional 600 million gallons of E85 were consumed. The analysis also suggests that the RFS does not dramatically affect the retail price of either gasoline and diesel fuels paid by consumers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the opportunities to make such investments are often constrained, particularly in contexts of austerity. We consider the potential of revolving funds as an innovative financing mechanism that could reduce investment requirements and enhance investment impacts by recovering and reinvesting some of the savings generated by early investments. Such funds have been created in various contexts, but there has never been a formal academic evaluation of their potential to contribute to low carbon transitions. To address this, we propose a generic revolving fund model and apply it using data on the costs and benefits of domestic sector retrofit in the UK. We find that a revolving fund could reduce the costs of domestic sector retrofit in the UK by 26%, or 9 pound billion, whilst also making such a scheme cost-neutral, albeit with significant up-front investments that would only pay for themselves over an extended period of time. We conclude that revolving funds could enable countries with limited resources to invest more heavily and more effectively in low carbon development, even in contexts of austerity.

One option frequently mooted at the national level is to promote, via policy, the deployment of low-carbon technologies. Promoting the deployment of low-carbon technologies can involve a near-term cost, if such technologies are more expensive overall, or require more upfront capital, than emitting alternatives. However, it lowers future costs of emissions abatement by reducing emissions in the near-term and potentially accelerating rates of improvement in targeted low-carbon technologies. We derive a globally cost-effective, near-term international technology investment strategy to achieve a long-term climate goal and show that it employs a diversified international technology investment portfolio across countries. We also explore the degree to which independent national technology deployment policies align with collaboratively determined regimes. We show that conditions exist under which there are substantial gains to international cooperation in the deployment of diverse low-carbon technologies and also circumstances in which domestic outcomes align with the global outcome.

We find that the fringe supply coming from both intermittent wind generation and combined heat and power (CHP) plants operated by horticultural farmers increases competition, which leads to lower prices in the electricity market.

However, neglect of dam-affected people's needs, can make them vulnerable to the multifaceted impacts of such projects. Using the case of Cambodia's first large dam, the Kamchay dam, this paper reveals social priorities of affected communities and institutional actors linked to environmental and social implications of large hydropower projects using a preference ranking method. Qualitative research revealed concerns among dam-affected communities which included energy access, livelihood changes, environmental impacts, access to natural resources and compensation. Results also reveal divergence between national and local priorities, which in turn brings about an unequal distribution of costs and benefits of the Kamchay Dam between urban and rural areas.

In contrast to quantile regressions, the subpopulations of interest are defined in terms of the possible values of a set of continuous covariates rather than the quantiles of the potential outcome distributions. We show that the CATE parameter is nonparametrically identified under unconfoundedness and propose inverse probability weighted estimators for it. Under regularity conditions, some of which are standard and some are new in the literature, we show (pointwise) consistency and asymptotic normality of a fully nonparametric and a semiparametric estimator. We apply our methods to estimate the average effect of a first-time mother's smoking during pregnancy on the baby's birth weight as a function of the mother's age.

This study evaluates the environmental and economic implications of one such intervention, a hypothetical region-wide renewable portfolio standard (RPS) with biomass carve-outs. It utilizes the Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOMGHG) to assess the multi-sector and interregional allocation of forest harvest activity, and then uses the Sub-Regional Timber Supply (SRTS) model to assess intraregional variation in forest composition and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential. The analysis finds that existing resource conditions influence the regional distribution of land use and harvest changes, resulting in a spatially and temporally diverse forest carbon response. Net forest carbon in the Southeast is greater in the RPS Scenario than in the No RPS Scenario in all but the final years of the model run. Accounting for displaced fossil emissions yields net GHG reductions in all time periods.

Since 2005, increased domestic production and decreased oil use have cut U.S. import dependence in half. The direct costs of oil dependence to the U.S. economy are estimated under four U.S. Energy Information Administration Scenarios to 2040. The key premises of the analysis are that the primary oil market failure is the use of market power by OPEC and that U.S. economic vulnerability is a result of the quantity of oil consumed, the lack of readily available, economical substitutes and the quantity of oil imported. Monte Carlo simulations of future oil market conditions indicate that the costs of U.S. oil dependence are likely to increase in constant dollars but decrease relative to U.S. gross domestic product unless oil resources are larger than estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Reducing oil dependence therefore remains a valuable goal for U.S. energy policy and an important co-benefit of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Customer-sited PV, especially under a net-metering arrangement, may result in revenue erosion and lost earnings opportunities for utility shareholders as well as increases in average retail rates for utility ratepayers. Regulators are considering alternative regulatory and rate-making approaches to mitigate these financial impacts. We performed a scoping analysis using a financial model to quantify the efficacy of mitigation approaches in reducing financial impacts of customer-sited PV on utility shareholders and ratepayers. We find that impacts can be mitigated through various incremental changes to utility regulatory and business models, though the efficacy varies considerably depending on design and particular utility circumstances. Based on this analysis, we discuss tradeoffs policymakers should consider, which ultimately might need to be resolved within broader policy contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Conditionalities and the performance of European Structural Funds: a principal-agent analysis of control mechanisms in European Union cohesion policy, Regional Studies. In the context of debates on the performance of European Union cohesion policy, this paper considers how the European Union has used control mechanisms to influence the use of Structural Funds by member states. Using the principal-agent model, this paper examines empirically three case studies of conditionalities applied to the absorption of funding (decommitment rule), outcomes of interventions (performance reserve) and targeting of expenditure (earmarking) in European Union programmes over the 2000-2013 period. The findings reveal different levels of effectiveness of the three conditionalities, attributable to the differential scope for trade-offs during the regulatory negotiations, external pressure and principal self-interest. The paper discusses an effectiveness threshold for introducing controls, the tensions between multiple conditionalities and the limitations of top-down control mechanisms in influencing agent behaviour.","[Bachtler, John; Ferry, Martin] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, European Policies Res Ctr, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Bachtler, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, European Policies Res Ctr, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland.",john.bachtler@strath.ac.uk; martin.ferry@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,28,30,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper updates our previous studies of this subject and discusses the recent developments in the innovative activities in the UK electricity sector. We find that, in recent years, the initial absence of support policies and the subsequent decline in innovation efforts in the aftermath of the reform has resulted in efforts towards forming an energy technology and innovation policy.

We build a simultaneous system of equations for overnight costs and construction time (lead-time) to control for endogeneity, using change in expected electricity demand as instrument We argue that the construction of nuclear reactors can benefit from standardization gains through two channels. First, short term coordination benefits can arise when the diversity of nuclear reactors' designs under construction is low. Second, long term benefits can occur due to learning spillovers from past constructions of similar reactors. We find that construction costs benefit directly from learning spillovers but that these spillovers are only significant for nuclear models built by the same Architect-Engineer. In addition, we show that the standardization of nuclear reactors under construction has an indirect and positive effect on construction costs through a reduction in lead-time, the latter being one of the main drivers of construction costs. Conversely, we also explore the possibility of learning by searching and find that, contrary to other energy technologies, innovation leads to construction costs increases. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards an evolutionary perspective on regional resilience, Regional Studies. This paper proposes an evolutionary perspective on regional resilience. It conceptualizes resilience not just as the ability of a region to accommodate shocks, but extends it to the long-term ability of regions to develop new growth paths. A comprehensive view on regional resilience is proposed in which history is key to understand how regions develop new growth paths, and in which industrial, network and institutional dimensions of resilience come together. Resilient regions are capable of overcoming a trade-off between adaptation and adaptability, as embodied in related and unrelated variety, loosely coupled networks and loosely coherent institutional structures.","[Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Lund University; Utrecht University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",ron.boschma@circle.lu.se,,,Open Research Area in Europe for the Social Sciences (ORA): 'Territories and Technologies in an Unstable Knowledge Economy: An Evolutionary Framework of Regional Resilience'; NWO (Netherlands); ANR (France); ESRC (UK); DFG (Germany),Open Research Area in Europe for the Social Sciences (ORA): 'Territories and Technologies in an Unstable Knowledge Economy: An Evolutionary Framework of Regional Resilience'; NWO (Netherlands)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Government); ANR (France)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ESRC (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DFG (Germany)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was conducted as part of a project granted under the Open Research Area in Europe for the Social Sciences (ORA): 'Territories and Technologies in an Unstable Knowledge Economy: An Evolutionary Framework of Regional Resilience'.

The dynamic states are approximately marginalized out using a particle filter, and the parameters are sampled via a sequential Monte Carlo sampler over a density-tempered bridge between the prior and the posterior. Our approach delivers exact draws from the joint posterior of the parameters and the latent states for any given number of state particles and is thus easily parallelizable in implementation. We also build into the proposed method a device that can automatically select a suitable number of state particles. Since the method incorporates sample information in a smooth fashion, it delivers good performance in the presence of outliers. We check the performance of the density-tempered SMC algorithm using simulated data based on a linear Gaussian state-space model with and without misspecification.

The aim of this work is to provide an example of the application of a methodology to evaluate the energy needs of the building stock of a city and to determine the possible strategies for energy planning. This paper aims to obtain an estimate, on an urban scale, of the energy needs and CO2 emissions of the public residential buildings of Bari. This estimate is achieved by evaluating the critical issues of the built heritage, the most common architectural typologies and the heating systems in the territory of the city of Bad in southern Italy, as well as the possible strategies for upgrading energy efficiency, through the combined use of energy software and geo-referenced systems. Furthermore, several possible interventions are assumed to improve the energy performance of buildings in not only environmental terms but also economic terms through the instrument of cost-benefit analysis. The ultimate goal is to compare the different intervention strategies to determine which demonstrate greater cost effectiveness and feasibility for future energy planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This subsequently introduces a further uncertainty for a ratepayer considering a net-metered PV investment. To thoroughly comprehend this uncertainty, the paper employs a top-down approach - in vertically integrated environments - to model the volatility of partially hedged electricity charges and its subsequent impact on the value of bill savings from net-metered PV systems. Besides the utility's pricing strategy and rate structures, particular emphasis is given in modeling the fossil fuel mix component that introduces a significant source of uncertainty on electricity charges and thus on the value of bill savings of net-metered, customer-sited, PV applications.

This has resulted in new financial regulation, covering both the financial sector and non-financial sectors. The actual extent to which non-financial companies trading on OTC markets contribute to systemic risk has hardly been the subject of research. This paper investigates the need for financial regulation in the energy sector, which shows a high use of OTC derivatives, by modeling systemic risk measured by the expected fraction of additional failing firms (EAF). Contagion risk within the energy sector and from the energy sector towards the banking sector is compared with that in other non-financial sectors. This paper adds to existing systemic risk literature by specifically looking at financial interdependence between a non-financial sector showing a high usage of OTC commodity derivatives and the banking sector, while contributing to the discussion on energy sector regulation with technical systemic risk analysis. Results indicate that contagion risk from the energy towards the banking sector is not relatively high compared to other non-financial sectors. Our results provide a first indication to question the need for generalized regulation of OTC derivative transactions, as recently introduced by the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).

Due to this, the essential growth in the number of ISO 50001 certified enterprises can be observed in different countries, except Russia. From 2011 to 2013 enterprises located in different countries got 4048 certificates. Russian enterprises got only 18 certificates. The reasons of low interest of Russian enterprises in applying the energy management system are analyzed in this article. Among them we should single out the following two reasons. The first one is the absence of the single domestic information resource, which contains complete data concerning the enterprises that apply this system and the positive results of its application. The second reason is the short-sighted policy of the domestic top management, aimed at getting paper certificate instead of efficient system application and functioning. These two reasons determine the appearance of the third one. It is connected with the unwillingness to cooperate with organizations providing energy management system implementation services and bear definite financial expenses. Thereupon, the article examines a variation of the in-house energy management system implementation and proposes an algorithm concerning the method preparation necessary for energy management system formation.

A comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and geographic information system was adopted to study the effect on soil erosion of different land-uses of the Alqueva reservoir region. Analysing the soil erosion of each land-use it was obtained the following land use erosion vulnerability: Olive orchard>Vineyard>Montado>Alfalfa. The strong erosion variances that were observed in the study area show the importance of locating the 'hot spots' of soil erosion.

Based on multiple regression analysis for U.S. metros, our research generates four key findings. First, airports are more likely to be located in larger metros with higher shares of cultural workers and warmer winters. Second, airports add significantly to regional development measured as economic output per capita. Third, the effect of airports on regional development occurs through two channels-their capacity to move both people and cargo, with the former being somewhat more important.

The theoretical concept of slow tourism summarizes the original idea of wellbeing, developed in 1959 by the american doctor Halbert Dunn affirms Chon, (2012). His idea of welfare on High Level is based on four concepts: a healthy diet; motion; relaxation; cultural and spiritual renewal. Tourists could discover Slow Travel through simple pleasures such as: the flowers scent, flavors, simple peace and the beautiful landscapes. This new vision of tourism includes not only accommodation (which should be simple) and diet (healthy), leisure (peaceful), culture (local culture), services (provided in a simple atmosphere) and respect for the natural environment. Starting from these theoretical considerations I made research among Romanian tourists through which I tried to identify how they perceive the concept of Slow Travel.

As an example the enterprises of the Tatarstan Republic chemicals sector were held up. The given enterprises implement integration within the framework of upstream integration but in two aspects: natural (process plant integration) and within the context of transaction expenses saving. In contexts of international economics globalization new financing sources in financial and operating activities of enterprises become increasingly important under restrictions of production factors scarcity. As far as we know, labor theory of value emphasizes three factors of production: land, labour, capital. Against the background of institutional economics transformation of the first factor and detachment into the additional category such factor as human capital assets is taking place. Initially it was mentioned in Adam Smith's book The Wealth of Nations where human capital asset is thought of as the generalized characteristic for quality and quantity of the human's labour ability being key revenue source and labor productivity growth promoting factor. Nowadays the notion of human capital asset is understood as the body of knowledge, skills, abilities (including creativity and mental ability), human incentives for productive labour acquired due to education, training or based on practical experience and being of great economic value promoting growth in prosperity of certain economic entity and national wealth as well.

Despite the increasing demand for water and its scarcity in some regions in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, water use efficiency or Water Productivity, is claimed to be unsatisfactory. In many Southern European regions up to 85% of the water is consumed by agriculture. The expected climate change will worsen the situation as it will lead to hotter summers. In this paper an initial study to benchmark agricultural irrigation practices-here, protected cultivation - with the objective of evaluating and comparing the systems through performanceindicators that can be obtained from data routinely available at the field and farm level were presented and discussed. Benchmarking, a systematic process for detecting inefficiencies based on comparisons between similar systems, is a potential tool for identifying andtargeting problem areas. The benchmarking tool was based on the results of an FP7 EU-SIRRIMED. In the present study we use this tool in order to assess the performance of two contrasted production strategies (i) hi-tech horticultural production, exemplified by soil-less greenhouse-grown tomato crops with closed, semi closed and open irrigation techniques and (ii) low-tech screenhouse production, exemplified by soil grown sweet pepper under screenhouses having different shading factors. We found that a large margin of progress in water and fertilisers use efficiency is at hand of farmers, provided they can integrate to their farming practices innovative technologies (i.e closed hydroponic systems) or structures that are well adapted to the local climatic and biotic conditions (e.g. screenhouses).

It has achieved a rapid development during the past six decades and contributes to over 11% of the world's electricity supply. On the other side, nuclear accidents have triggered substantial debates with a growing public concern on nuclear facilities. Followed by the Fukushima nuclear accident, some developed countries decided to shut down the existing nuclear power plants or to abandon plans to build new ones. Given this background, accelerating the development of nuclear power on the basis of safety in China will make it a bellwether for other countries. China assigns the top priority to the nuclear safety in nuclear energy development and has maintained a good record in this field. The policy and institutional system provide the necessary guarantee for the nuclear energy development and safety management. Furthermore, China's approach to nuclear safety provides a benchmark for the safe development and utilization of nuclear power.

From then onwards, however, the demand for it following Asturian emigration abroad, being as it was a symbol of cultural identity, and the need to transport it without damage bring about as a result the adoption of the champagne method in Asturias. Between 1900 and 1930, twenty Asturian enterprises will be dedicated to its production after the consolidation of American markets, which demand 90% of the total production. The year 1930, given the degree of economic nationalism and the substitution of imports, brought about, however, the return to a national market in which the competition with wine and cava would be fierce.

In this context, our paper focuses on the role of the minimum wage on the labour market and its direct effects upon employment in Romania. We also identify several particularities at gender level by elaborating an analysis of the minimum wage effects upon male and female employment in Romania. For that we used quarterly data for the period 2000 Q1 - 2014 Q3 and built two employment equations differentiated by gender. Our results are consistent with the international literature and suggest the presence of some gender differences in the way the minimum wage effects are perceived by the employed population.","[Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina; Cristescu, Amalia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina; Stanila, Larisa; Cristescu, Amalia] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, ME (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",madalina.andreica@gmail.com; larisa.stanila@incsmps.ro; cristescuamalia@gmail.com,"Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/F-8696-2011; Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/AAK-8233-2020","Popescu, Madalina Ecaterina/0000-0002-0589-4010",,,,,10,0,0,0,9,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,449,454,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BD6ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362796900073,0

Based on the rate of return regulation in the U.S., the current scheme of control agreement (SCA) regulating the two local integrated investor-owned utilities (IOUs) will expire in 2018 (or in 2023 after an optional 5-year extension), thus offering an opportune time to consider proposals with long lead time to modify or replace the SCA. The proposals made to date range from modifications of the SCA to electricity market restructure. These proposals, however, overlook two important aspects of regulatory governance: transparency and public involvement. This paper estimates consumer support for the proposal to establish a Hong Kong public utilities commission (HKPUC) to improve the current regulatory process. Based on the responses collected in mid-2014 via a face-to-face survey of 1100 Hong Kong residents, we find that at the 1.5% bill surcharge, about 70% the respondents are estimated to support an HKPUC. Thus, there is sufficient consumer support for a financially viable HKPUC, implying that Hong Kong should consider the possibility of establishing an HKPUC, notwithstanding the substantial challenges to be overcome prior to its implementation.

In this study we divided these policies into seven categories: macroscopic, demonstration, subsidization, preferential tax, technical support, industry management, and infrastructure. Since consumers' opinions affect the policy choices of government, based on questionnaire data we use a four paradigm model to analyze the consumers' evaluation of each policy in terms of perceptions of importance and satisfaction. The results show that macroscopic policies are perceived to be of high importance and satisfaction, whereas for industry management policies they are perceived to be of low importance and satisfaction. The importance perceptions of preferential tax and demonstration policies are low, whereas perceptions of their satisfaction are high. Perceptions of the importance of subsidization, technical support, and infrastructure policies are high, whereas perceptions of their satisfaction are low.

Pressured by heightened competition, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are discovering pockets of resources in non-traditional locations. This study proposes a dynamic model explaining the role of MNE subsidiary entry timing, entry mode and mandate in the process of transforming a peripheral area of an advanced market economy into an emerging cluster', a location where internal (local) resources and external (international) connectivity have been established, but are not yet mature. Illustrative cases relating to a period of almost five decades from a peripheral European Union area support the conclusion that MNEs' strategies are critical in transforming shallow resource pools into emerging clusters.","[Mudambi, Ram] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Strateg Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Santangelo, Grazia D.] Univ Catania, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Via Vittorio Emanuele 2, I-95131 Catania, Italy",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Catania,"Mudambi, R (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Strateg Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",ram.mudambi@temple.edu; grsanta@unict.it,"Mudambi, Ram/A-8580-2008; Santangelo, Grazia D./O-7930-2019; Mudambi, Ram/N-1145-2019","Santangelo, Grazia D./0000-0002-1053-4212; Mudambi, Ram/0000-0002-5396-5602",Italian Ministry of University and Research [2003130451],"Italian Ministry of University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The data collection for this study was supported by the 2003 PRIN project 'Foreign Direct Investment and Local Knowledge Spillovers: The High-Tech Cluster in Catania', funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research [prot. 2003130451].",,84,49,54,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Improving energy efficiency through technological advancement is a primary measure to achieve these targets. However, the existence of energy rebound effects may completely or partially offset energy savings associated with technological advancement. This paper adopted a modified input-output model to estimate the economy-wide energy rebound effects across China's economic sectors with the consideration of energy subsidies. The empirical results show that the aggregate rebound effect of China is about 1.9% in 2007-2010, thus technological advancement significantly restrains energy consumption increasing. Removing energy subsidies will cause the aggregate rebound effect declines to 1.53%. Specifically, removing subsidies for coal and nature gas can reduce the rebound effects signifcantly, while removing the subsidies for oil products has a small impact on rebound effect. The existence of rebound effects implies that technological advancement should be cooperated with energy price reform so as to achieve the energy saving target. In addition, the government should consider the diversity of economic sectors and energy types when design the reform schedule. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We present standardized methods that combine freshwater abstraction and estuary functionality to estimate recreational values of freshwater inflow to households located in proximity to the seven selected South African estuaries while testing for the convergent validity of the contingent valuation method (CVM), zonal travel cost method (ZTCM) and the individual travel cost method (ITCM). Given that the dependent variable is the log transform, our dependent variable is not censored, so we use an OLS model for the regression, and model separately our zero values using a spike model. When running our regressions, we pool all observations from the seven estuaries and use dummy fixed effects for each estuary, and use interactions to model different effects of the covariates in each estuary. For travel costs analyses, we estimate truncated count data models of recreational demand taking into account the fact that the number of visitation trips taken is a non-negative integer. The CVM generated values per m(3) of freshwater inflow into the estuary ranges from R0.0022 to R0.0546 whereas the ZTCM values ranges from R0.0035 to R0.0499, while the ITCM generated value per m(3) of freshwater inflow is R0.003.

However, in coal-dominated Polish power system this need is even more crucial than anywhere, since technical lifetime of the most domestic power plants is ending. In this paper, the impact of the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) for CO2 combined with sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission trading mechanism on power technology choice was studied using Market Allocation (MARKAL) model of Polish power system. Poland can contribute to achieving ambitious EU CO2 emission reduction goals to 2050 by switching to diversified electricity mix of low-carbon coal technologies with CCS, and carbon free options e.g. nuclear, biomass IGCC, wind onshore and offshore. This 'low-carbon' mix can be achieved only at high emission allowance prices, stimulated by the introduction of Market Stability Reserve to EU ETS and successive decrease in EU CO2 emission cap. At high emission allowance prices, Poland's CO2 emissions from ETS-participating electricity generating plants are expected to decrease in 2010-2050 period by 96-99%, depending on the projected electricity consumption. Model results prove that SO2/NOx, emission trading scheme, envisaged in Poland, is not effective, in view. of Industrial Emission Directive implementation, and should be reconsidered.

In comparison, few dwellings are built and managed by the public sector. The social housing stock has been built mainly during some post-second world war decades; instead, since the early nineties, it underwent a privatization process. Such a model is inefficient and iniquitous in the long run. Therefore, after being disregarded for several years, social housing has gone back to be among the main agenda items. Nonetheless, due to the lack of public grants, new funding sources are required. The government now fosters an increasing, involvement of private finance through Public-Private Partnership schemes. A first outcome can be found in some pioneering experiences. Their comparative analysis allows bringing out worthwhile findings, which are useful to steer housing policies. Moderate to low yields entail the need to involve new kinds of private entities, particularly those adopting a venture philanthropy approach. Meanwhile, building energy performance measures are a crucial driver of feasibility. They allow the tenants to be willing to pay agreed rents somehow higher than both social rents of protected tenancies and fair rents of regulated tenancies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to 2010, participation in the rating scheme was voluntary. This study first develops a theoretical model of mandatory disclosure policy effectiveness. Then, with a dataset of all ratings since inception of the voluntary regime in 1999, it tests the expectation that initial voluntary adopters have a greater tendency towards environmental stewardship and are more likely to manage and invest in environmental performance improvements, potentially dampening the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure policy. However, multiple statistical models of certification are unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in energy efficiency outcomes between the mandatory and voluntary adopters at equivalent stages. For urban policymakers, the extrapolation of voluntary adopter performance appears to be a good - perhaps even conservative - estimation of mandatory energy performance disclosure outcomes.

The assessment reflects the need to incorporate new renewables into power grids and issues faced in dispatching power and their effect on traditional electricity technologies as well as the need for transmission extension and/or grid reinforcement. Wider introduction of smart grids and the likely demise of nuclear in some OECD countries are bound to enhance the future prospects for new renewables. However, their immediate future expansion will depend on continued subsidies, which are becoming difficult to sustain in present economic circumstances. Development of large energy storage facilities and carbon pricing could significantly enhance future renewable energy prospects. Correspondingly, expanding renewable energy, in spite of their popularity with some governments and sections of the public, is likely to face challenges which will slow their present rapid progress. Nuclear is now shied away from in many industrialized countries and having mixed prospects in developing economies. In many instances, it suffers from high initial costs, long lead times and often excessive construction delays. Nuclear power also faces challenging risks investment as well as regulatory. In contrast to renewables, its share of global energy consumption is declining. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a four-metric framework to identify priority regions to deploy and dispatch these technologies to displace marginal grid air emissions with high environmental and health impacts. To the standard metrics of total mass and rate of air pollutant emissions we add location and time, to prioritize emission displacement near densely populated areas with poor air quality, especially at times when air pollutant concentrations exceed regulatory standards. We illustrate our framework with a case study using storage, demand response, and other technologies to displace peaker power plants, the highest-rate marginal emitters on the California grid. We combine spatial-temporal data on plant electricity generation, air quality standard exceedance days, and population characteristics available from environmental justice screening tool CalEnviroScreen 2.0 to determine where emissions reductions may have the greatest marginal benefit. This screening approach can inform grid siting decisions, such as storage in lieu of peaker plants in high impact regions, or dispatch protocol, such as triggering demand response instead of pealcer plants on poor air quality days.

In particular, we examine the possibility of mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without stressing standards of living. Here, we set up a cross-country CO2 market constrained by a quota, where CO2 is optimally re-allocated based on relative shadow prices of the pollutant. The objective is to stabilize global emissions without hindering global incomes and in the process achieve a single CO2 price. We introduce a re-allocation model that takes into account each country's underlying polluting technology. The model solutions are then used to investigate whether a single, global price for CO2 is attainable. Our results suggest that global CO2 emissions could stabilize without stressing global incomes, with a global CO2 market achieving equilibrium. With a CO2 market, countries would then have the incentive to consider adopting, improving, or investing in additional abatement technologies to move beyond current capabilities, while continuing to increase standards of living.

Considering that individual climate change efforts are unlikely to affect global mitigation paths, the study investigates the possibility that sectoral approaches can help in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, using Thailand as a case study. It conducted online questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews to acquire primary data from companies and key informants from the government, NGOs, NPOs and academics. The results suggested that, among three possible groups of factors that could affect company decisions on whether to promote sectoral approaches, domestic politics (particularly the Thai government) is the most important, though other factors also play important and interrelated roles. The most welcomed type of scheme that could be envisaged would appear to be a sectoral agreement between government and industry. Finally, the authors provide two main policy recommendations, namely the establishment of an industrial association of O&G companies and for it to target how to start looking at measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions amongst large companies in the sector.

Further gains are possible by eliminating unscheduled flows and avoiding the curtailment of renewables with better market design. In the short run the gains could be as high as (sic)3.9 billion/yr, more than 100% of the current gains from trade. About one-quarter of this total comes from day-ahead coupling and another third from shared balancing.

Building on this, we suggest a corresponding definition of energy poverty, as understood in the capabilities space. We argue that such an understanding provides a theoretically coherent means of comprehending the relationship between energy and wellbeing, and thus conceptualising energy deprivation, that makes sense across settings including both the global North and South: a coherence which has previously been lacking. At the same time, it has the flexibility to be deployed in a way that is sensitive to local contexts. Understanding energy use in the capabilities space also provides a means for identifying multiple sites of intervention, including some areas that are currently largely overlooked. We argue that this is advantageous for attempts to address energy poverty in the context of climate change and imperatives for the containment of aggregate energy consumption. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A key feature of this proposal was a judicious set of mixed strategies to recycle all carbon-tax revenues back into the economy. In this note, we show how the carbon tax that the Portuguese Parliament eventually approved deviated from such guidelines, and ultimately failed to achieve the triple dividend. We argue that authorities need to quickly amend the existing legislation to avoid this misguided attempt turning into a missed opportunity to improve environmental, macroeconomic, and fiscal outcomes.

This paper explores the extent to which the labour markets for men and women are becoming integrated as a single entity. It does so in the specific context of the English and Welsh coalfields, where major job losses in the coal industry fell almost exclusively on men. Using data from 1981 to 2008, the paper presents 'labour market accounts' for the coalfields that reveal changing female labour force participation and employment, and it compares these trends with those among men in the same places. Evidence emerges of two relatively independent labour markets - male and female - operating in the 1980s in the same geographic space. However, over time a degree of integration appears to have occurred. As a result, women increasingly have to compete with men for the same jobs and a greater proportion of new job opportunities in the former coalfields are now going to men.","[Beatty, Christina] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Ctr Reg Econ & Social Res, City Campus,Howard St, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Sheffield Hallam University,"Beatty, C (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Ctr Reg Econ & Social Res, City Campus,Howard St, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",c.beatty@shu.ac.uk,"Beatty, Christina/AAE-1438-2022","Beatty, Christina/0000-0003-0943-9979",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [R00221198],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This paper is the result of independent academic research.

F. L. Rural-urban differences in bonding and bridging social capital, Regional Studies. It is a common sentiment that rural areas are richer in social capital than urban areas. This hypothesis is tested here by drawing on data from a Danish survey (2011/2012) and by using the distinction between bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital was found to be significantly higher in rural areas, whereas bridging social capital was found to be marginally higher in urban areas. The evidence thus partly refutes the hypothesis of higher social capital in rural areas. Among other results, the evidence suggests a degree of trade-off between the two forms of social capital.","[Sorensen, Jens F.

Applying a quantitative content analysis approach, all Danish LG action plans within the climate and energy field has been collected and coded, giving insight into the extent of LG CAPs. We assess the extent, targets and scope of LG CAPs and find that Danish LGs are highly involved in mitigation activities with a widespread CAP adoption and an overall high degree of sectoral coverage on base year accounts and action plans, albeit with some significant shortcomings. If current LG CAPs were to form the basis of a decentralised climate governance system, some improvements in target level and sectoral coverage should be implemented. The utilization of regional supporting structures facilitating a gradual improvement seems especially promising. In addition the research points to the significant mitigation potential of considering the full spectrum of local government actors, not simply the pioneers and how local CAPs outside urban pioneers require additional local policy framing to succeed. Focusing on the mutual benefits for national and local actors of an integrated planning system, and the multiple benefits locally, will be key in motivating further action. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Innovative firms often engage in knowledge interactions across regional boundaries, which is difficult to account for by territorial innovation models. The territorial knowledge dynamics perspective directs attention to the ways in which firms and other actors combine regional and extra-regional relations. It deals with the spatial aspects of innovation, emphasizing constantly evolving knowledge networks that are not confined to regional boundaries, which implies a new view on regional knowledge anchoring. The paper presents a case of innovation in the automotive sector in the Vastra Gotaland region of Sweden to show how a spatial pattern of knowledge interactions develops over time.","[James, Laura] Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Vissers, Geert] InnoTep, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Vissers, Geert] InnoTep, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Vissers, Geert] InnoTep, Enschede, Netherlands; [Larsson, Anders] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Human Geog Unit, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Dahlstrom, Margareta] Karlstad Univ, Dept Human Geog, Karlstad, Sweden",Stockholm University; University of Gothenburg; Karlstad University,"Vissers, G (通讯作者)，InnoTep, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",laura.james@humangeo.su.se; ganvissers@gmail.com; anders.larsson@geography.gu.se; margareta.dahlstrom@kau.se,"Larsson, Anders/P-7275-2015; Dahlstrom, Margareta/E-9256-2016","James, Laura/0000-0001-8226-7945; Dahlstrom, Margareta/0000-0001-8788-0044",European Commission [006187]; Browaldh Stipendium; KILN network - Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019488/1],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Browaldh Stipendium; KILN network - Economic and Social Research Council,"This research was undertaken as part of the EURODITE project, funded by the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme [grant number 006187].

However, the within-country dimension matters for both the implementation and the policy formation of climate policies. As a preliminary step towards a better understanding of within-country inequalities, this paper measures their extent for the two major greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, over the 1970-2008 period. Using Theil-index decompositions, we show that within-country inequalities account for the bulk of global inequality, and tend to increase over the sample period, in contrast with diminishing between-country inequalities. Including differences across sectors reveals that between-sector inequalities matter more than between-country inequalities, and between-sector inequalities become the dominant source of global inequality at the end of the sample period in the CO2 case. Finally, estimated social tensions arising from the disconnection between emissions and future damages turn out to be increasing as soon as within-country disparities are taken into account. These orders of magnitude should be kept in mind while discussing the efficiency and fairness of alternative paths in combating global warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though recurrent crises and their respective peaks were a characteristic of this economy, the turning point reached in 1919-1922 had unprecedented consequences due to the definitive loss of the German market and the consolidation of synthetic nitrate. For the first time, this crisis made Chileans aware of the structural problems in its economy and the need to change the saltpetre policy established in the previous century. This paper challenges the traditional Chilean national historiography, which hadn't considered this event as the end of the saltpetre industry, protracting its demise until the Great Depression of 1929.","[Gonzalez Miranda, Sergio] Univ Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile; [Calderon Gajardo, Renato; Artaza Barrios, Pablo] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Arturo Prat; Universidad de Chile,"Miranda, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Arturo Prat, Iquique, Chile.",,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

In 2011 and 2012, the Chinese Government selected four cities- Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Chongqing- to implement pilot commercial building energy efficiency retrofit program. Based on site surveys and expert interviews in these pilot cities, this research conducted a comparative analysis on incentive policies of local city level. The analysis results show that policy designs of existing commercial buildings should be further improved. The aspects that influence the implementation effect in the future, such as subsidy level, installments, and business model promotion, should be specified in the policy clauses. Referring to the technical solution and cost-benefit in Chongqing, we found that lighting system is the most common retrofit objects while envelope system is the least common one. And the subsidy incentive is greatest for educational buildings, followed by office buildings. In the end, we further discussed the problems and obstacles in commercial building retrofit market, and provided a series of recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A typology of Chinese urban regions is identified based on individual regions' functionally and morphologically polycentricity. Three major sets of processes underlying the typology are discerned: the (mis)match between (governmentally) designated and economically integrated urban regions; unequal interregional economic development; and the impact of city-regional plans and policies. Urban regions along the east coast reach high levels of morphological and functional polycentricity. Many planned urban regions are morphologically polycentric, lacking functional integration. Most urban regions in western China lack any form of polycentricity.","[Liu, Xingjian] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Wu, Kang] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Urban Econ & Publ Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Ghent University; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Liu, XJ (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xliu6@hku.hk,"Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020; Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008","Liu, Xingjian/0000-0003-4158-3655; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544; Wu, Kang/0000-0003-3251-6231",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401178]; MoE Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJC790132]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9154024],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MoE Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),The third author is thankful for financial support given by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41401178]; for an MoE Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences [grant number 14YJC790132]; and from the Beijing Natural Science Foundation [grant number 9154024].

Methods include a long-term research (3-years) involving focus groups, interviews, questionnaires, and observations that coincided with a theoretical analysis of conventional methods applicable to business education. Results show that arts based initiatives (ABIs) foster integrated development of skills that generate a strong holistic effect of multi- and inter-disciplinary. These are combined with powerful personal development, as ascertained in 360-degree reviews. It is concluded that an individual's transformation, achieved through ABIs, can impact on team dynamics as well as the organizational strategy and performance, and generates a 'spill-over effect' between individual, team, organization, and community, thus ascertaining the value of holistic approach in business education.","[Malesko, Jelena; Tjurdju, Olga] RISEBA, 3 Meza Str, Riga, Latvia",RISEBA University of Applied Sciences,"Malesko, J (通讯作者)，RISEBA, 3 Meza Str, Riga, Latvia.",lenam54@inbox.lv,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,5,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,346,359,,10.12955/cbup.v4.779,0.0,,,14,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000050,0

We believe that in many cases tourism can be an appropriate tool to revitalize rural areas, to keep and create rural jobs and to maintain services, but without an overall and long-term concept it is not possible to achieve sustainable development in the sector.","[Nagy, Henrietta; Nagy, Adrienn; Kaposzta, Jozsef] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, 1 Pater K Str, Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Nagy, H (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, 1 Pater K Str, Godollo, Hungary.",nagy.henrietta@gtk.szie.hu; nagy.adrienn@gtk.szie.hu; kaposztaj.ozsef@gtk.szie.hu,"Henrietta, Nagy/AAD-8531-2021","Henrietta, Nagy/0000-0001-9732-9926",,,,,19,0,0,0,7,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,516,527,,10.15414/isd2016.s7.11,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500061,0

Based on this theory market risk can be assessed. The paper uses the alternative Markowitz portfolio theory approach, by replacing the stock return with return on equity (ROE), to estimate the risk and profitability of unquoted agricultural farms. The development of risk and return of Slovak farms is estimated in the period of years 2000 - 2013, using the 5-years moving average. The portfolios are created for two types of production: crop farms and animal farms. The results show that from the point of production orientation, the crop farms record higher return and also higher risk in comparison to the animal farms. The development of risk and return reflects the structural changes in Slovak agriculture, which has been continually changing in the way of increasing the share of crop oriented farms.","[Toth, Marian; Holubek, Ivan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia; [Serences, Roman] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ Policy, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",marian.toth@uniag.sk; ivan.holubek@uniag.sk; roman.serences@uniag.sk,"Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019",,,,,,22,3,3,3,15,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,985,993,,10.15414/isd2016.s12.10,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500116,0

However, the specificity of forensic medicine requires objective methods. Thus, there is a necessity for objective methods of diagnosis for acute coronary insufficiency (ACI). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to establish the diagnostic possibilities of the laser method, Mueller matrix polarimetry, on wavelength 450 nm of autofluorescence, with the method of statistical analysis of native heart slices to provide an after-death diagnosis of acute coronary insufficiency. METHODS: In our primary investigation we explored 69 human hearts with ACI, 69 with chronic ischemic heart disease, and 20 from corpses after violent deaths with short agonal period. The samples were studied with a Stokes polarimeter, which was modified to study laser induced autofluorescence. For comparison, histopathological studies were conducted by staining with hematoxylin, basic fuchsine, and picric acid. Data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Coordinate and probabilistic distributions of Mueller matrix invariant r14 and r41 laser polarization autofluorescence samples of myocardium were established. A visual determination of ACI, using coordinate distributions or probabilistic distributions, is difficult and hence, we conducted a statistical analysis between pixels of the image. For optically active fluorophores of the myocardium we found a growth (1.5 times) kurtosis of r41 value. Distribution of r41 decreased 1.6 times in the case of ACI. After definition of balanced accuracy, we noted definition of asymmetry and kurtosis of invariant r41 with 89 % and 95% accuracy allowed a diagnosis of ACI. CONCLUSION: Using the spectrally selective laser method, Mueller-matrix polarimetry, on wavelength 450 nm of autofluorescence with method of statistical analysis of native heart slices allows for diagnosis of ACI with high accuracy.","[Vanchuliak, Oleh; Bachinskiy, Victor] Bucovinian State Med Univ, Dept Forens Med & Med Law, Ukrainian State Higher Educ Inst, Chernovtsy, Ukraine; [Ushenko, Alexander] Yurii Fedkovych Chernivtsi Natl Univ, Dept Correlat Opt & Spect, Ukrainian State Higher Educ Inst, Chernovtsy, Ukraine",Bukovinian State Medical University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Yuri Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University,"Vanchuliak, O (通讯作者)，Bucovinian State Med Univ, Dept Forens Med & Med Law, Ukrainian State Higher Educ Inst, Chernovtsy, Ukraine.",wanchulyak@gmail.com; vbachinskiy@mail.ua; o.ushenko@chnu.edu.ua,"Ushenko, Alexander/AAA-7750-2019; Vanchuliak, Oleh/C-8101-2017; Dubolazov, Alexander/ADO-7941-2022",,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,706,710,,10.12955/cbup.v4.836,0.0,,,5,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000106,0

Moreover, an undershot water wheel system is designed to gain the least dissipationless conversion of kinetic energy. The design of the hydrokinetic energy generation system is developed considering the environmental and maintenance factors, maximum efficiency and buoyancy. Calculation for the velocity of the turbine is made by using Betz's law, usually used for wind energy conversion systems.

The firm selects the energy source, which minimizes its energy or production costs at a given time horizon. Assuming the energy strategy to be established over a fixed time window, the energy choice decision will be made at a given future date T. In this light, the firm's energy cost can be considered as a long position in a risk-free bond by an amount of the terminal oil price, and a short position in a European put option to switch from oil to gas by an amount of the terminal oil price too. As a result, the option to switch from crude oil to natural gas allows for establishing a hedging strategy with respect to energy costs. Modeling stochastically the underlying asset of the European put, we propose a valuation formula of the option to switch and calibrate the pricing formula to empirical data on a daily basis. Hence, our innovative framework handles widely the hedge against the price increase of any given energy source versus the price of another competing energy source (i.e. minimizing energy costs). Moreover, we provide a price for the cost-reducing effect of the capability to switch from one energy source to another one (i.e. hedging energy price risk). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most support schemes for renewable power do not take into account that emissions depend on the location of renewable and conventional power plants within an electricity grid. I simulate optimal power flow in a test grid when 4 renewable power plants connect to the grid across 24 potential sites, amounting to over 10,000 configurations. Each configuration is associated with different levels of emissions and renewable power output. I find that emission reductions vary by a factor of 7 and that curtailment due to transmission congestion is more likely when renewable power plants are concentrated in an area of the grid with low demand. Large cost savings could be obtained by allowing subsidies for renewable power to vary across locations according to abatement potential or by replacing subsidies with a price on emissions.

Our maxim of symmetry asks readers to keep their analysis of energy technologies centered always on both technology and society. Our maxim of reflexivity asks readers to be self-aware of one's assumptions. Our maxim of prudence asks readers to make energy decisions that are ethical or at least informed. Our maxim of agnosticism asks readers to look beyond a given energy technology to the services it provides and recognize that many systems can provide a desired service.

Based on our CSC, we propose new average estimators of ATE and ATT, which include the selected estimators based on a single set of covariates as a special case. We derive the asymptotic distributions of our new estimators and propose how to construct valid confidence intervals. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that in finite samples, our new average estimators achieve substantial efficiency gains over the estimators based on a single set of covariates.

Yet the nature of this transition (i.e. what, when, how and where) and its socioeconomic outcomes at different scales are not well understood. The interdependence of the energy sector and economic growth has been mostly studied at the national level (via some general equilibrium or econometric models) whilst sub-national studies at community or urban levels mostly focus on the governance of transitions. Hence, we suggest that a regional perspective to energy policy and research promises to integrate these two approaches by providing a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the implications of low carbon transitions, as well as contributing to the development of more effective policies. By building on recent ideas on geographical aspects of energy transitions, this article offers insights on the changing relationship between the spatial organisation of economic activities and energy systems, and identifies tools and methods from urban and regional planning to help with the delivery of efficient and equitable policy outcomes.

Furthermore, we constructed a variety of policy scenarios based on management experience in Beijing. The analysis showed that priority to the development of public transport (PDPT) could significantly increase the proportion of public transport locally and would be helpful in pursuing energy savings and emission reductions as well. Travel demand management (TDM) had a distinctive effect on energy savings and emission reductions in the short term, while technical progress (TP) was more conducive to realizing emission reduction targets. Administrative rules and regulations management (ARM) had the best overall effect of the individual policies on both energy savings and emission reductions. However, the effect of comprehensive policy (CP) was better than any of the individual policies pursued separately. Furthermore, the optimal implementation sequence of each individual policy in CP was TP -> PDPT -> TDM -> ARM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

R. From sub-regional networks to sub-regional localism: experiences of collaboration in England's historical Black Country, Regional Studies. Uneven development within the English spatial economy has resulted in a succession of national policy prescriptions, the latest phase being sub-regional local enterprise partnerships (LEPs). This paper identifies associated policy instabilities and questions both the strength of pre-existing sub-regional networks and whether such structures are advantageous for coterminous LEPs. A case study of the de-industrializing Black Country highlights strengthening collaboration across four local authorities during the 2000s, in addition to support for a Black Country LEP. Closer analysis reveals limits to network collaboration and the existence of various legacies which pose threats to sub-regional localism. Even in sub-regions with seemingly strong historical identities, prevailing local authority priorities can limit innovative responses to urban regeneration requirements.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3041, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Henderson, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, McCoy Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3041, Australia.",steven.henderson@unimelb.edu.au,"Henderson, Steven/Q-3404-2019","Henderson, Steven/0000-0002-6734-1796",,,,,52,3,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Maintaining comfortable indoor conditions while reducing energy consumption involves careful design, construction, and management of the built environment and its inhabitants. In this paper, we present findings from the study of a new low energy building for older people in Grenoble, France where conflicts emerged over the simultaneous pursuit of energy efficiency and comfort. The findings contribute to the contemporary literature on the sociotechnical study of buildings and energy use by focusing on intermediation, those activities that associate a technology to end users. Intermediation activities take many forms, and in some cases, can result in the harmonisation or alignment of energy efficiency goals and comfort goals. In other cases, intermediation is unsuccessful, leading to the conventional dichotomy between optimising technical performance and meeting occupant preferences. By highlighting the multiple ways that comfort and energy efficiency is negotiated, we conclude that buildings are provisional achievements that are constantly being intermediated. This suggests that building energy efficiency policies and programmes need to provide opportunities for intermediaries to negotiate the desires and preferences of the multiple stakeholders that are implicated in low energy buildings.

Learning in 'organized anarchies': the nature of technological search processes at trade fairs, Regional Studies. Trade fairs have become an important temporary organizational form for the establishment of inter-firm linkages and networks. Despite recent insights into the nature of knowledge flows, the causal mechanisms linking trade fairs to processes of technological searches and choices remain underspecified. Taking this as a starting point, this paper provides a conceptual and empirical account of the technological search and related learning processes between geographically distant firms at trade fairs. Building on the concept of 'organized anarchies' and the 'garbage-can model' of organizational choice, it reconceptualizes the nature of search processes and applies this conceptualization to an explorative study of four business-to-business fairs in North America. This provides a dynamic explanation of how inter-firm interaction and observation support technological search processes, which may lead to distinct wider patterns of technological specialization and/or diffusion.","[Bathelt, Harald; Gibson, Rachael] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Bathelt, Harald] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Bathelt, Harald] Program Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Bathelt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",harald.bathelt@utoronto.ca; rachael.gibson@utoronto.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [410-2007-2167],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Different aspects discussed in this paper, to which both authors contributed equally, were presented in 2009 at the annual meeting of the Association of American Geographers in Las Vegas, Nevada; at the annual meeting of the Canadian Political Science Association in Ottawa, Ontario; and at the conference on 'Proximity Economics' in Poitiers, France.

Defense Science Board data were used to estimate the current FY2013 total fuel delivered-at-sea price being paid by the USN per gallon between $6 and $7. Using published capital cost data and a range of nuclear electrical energy scenarios, costs ranging between $1.48 to $8.67 per gallon are estimated for producing 82,000 gal per day of fuel in littoral land-based locations. This provides policy analysts with a reasonable economic rationale and justification for planning and designing a new littoral land-based energy conversion process to provide low carbon jet and diesel fuel for operations at sea. This process is considered low carbon emissions because it uses environmentally available carbon and hydrogen and dedicated nuclear electrical energy as its only inputs. Generic naval missions and fuel usage data provide the constraints needed for establishing full scale process size, number of locations, power requirements, and cost using current light water nuclear reactor technology.

This has led to a richer palette of concepts, mechanisms and models of evolution and change, such as plasticity, robustness, evolvability, emergence, niche construction and self-organization, This opens up a different framework for understanding evolution.

The vulnerability of each economy to natural disasters was estimated using a panel linear model, while resilience was estimated by employing a negative binomial panel regression and a difference-in-difference model. Natural disaster damage, related to physical damage and human loss, was shown to have a negative effect on regional economies. Regions with stronger economies prior to natural disasters have lower disaster losses than regions with weaker economic characteristics. More effort to improve regional economic conditions before natural disasters is necessary to minimize disaster loss. Lessons learned from the economic impacts of past natural disasters, in particular in tourism-based regions, can help regional planners and policy makers predict problems related to disasters and more effectively prepare for future events.","[Kim, Hyun; Marcouiller, David W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 925 Bascom Mall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",hkim525@wisc.edu; dwmarcou@wisc.edu,,"Kim, Hyun/0000-0003-0681-5828; Marcouiller, David/0000-0002-8785-6121",,,,,82,56,71,4,76,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The key idea of this approach is to rewrite the characterization of a regression quantile in terms of a copula and marginal distributions. After the copula and the marginal distributions are estimated, the new estimator is obtained as the weighted quantile of the response variable in the model. The proposed conditional estimator has three main advantages: it applies to both iid and time series data, it is automatically monotonic across quantiles, and, unlike other copula-based methods, it can be directly applied to the multiple covariates case without introducing any extra complications. We show the asymptotic properties of our estimator when the copula is estimated by maximizing the pseudo-log-likelihood and the margins are estimated nonparametrically including the case where the copula family is misspecified. We also present the finite sample performance of the estimator and illustrate the usefulness of our proposal by an application to the historical volatilities of Google and Yahoo.","[Noh, Hohsuk; El Ghouch, Anouar; Van Keilegom, Ingrid] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Noh, H (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",word5810@gmail.com; anouar.elghouch@uclouvain.be; ingrid.vankeilegom@uclouvain.be,,"Van Keilegom, Ingrid/0000-0001-8827-7642",IAP research network of the Belgian Government (Belgian Science Policy) [P7/06]; European Research Council under European Community / ERC [203650]; 'Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees' (ARC) of the Communaute francaise de Belgique - Academie universitaire Louvain [11/16-039]; European Research Council (ERC) [203650] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),IAP research network of the Belgian Government (Belgian Science Policy)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); European Research Council under European Community / ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); 'Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees' (ARC) of the Communaute francaise de Belgique - Academie universitaire Louvain; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"All the authors acknowledge financial support from IAP research network P7/06 of the Belgian Government (Belgian Science Policy).

We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, finding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005-2013 an increase of 1 GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 23(sic)/MWh and 4.2(sic)/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009-2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufficient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind.

It is found that regional knowledge in the related field of laser source production and the presence of laser-relevant universities and public research organizations were conducive to the first emergence of laser systems producers. Upstream laser source producers influenced entry into the downstream laser systems industry primarily through their own diversification moves. Public research was less important in the submarket of materials processing laser systems, which is less directly science based than other parts of the laser systems industry.","[Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Fritsch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",buenstorf@uni-kassel.de; m.fritsch@uni-jena.de; luisfermedrano@gmail.com,"Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011; Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182; Buenstorf, Guido/0000-0002-2957-5532",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),"This paper is based on the project 'Emergence and Evolution of a Spatial-Sectoral Systems of Innovation: Laser Technology in Germany, 1960 to Present' jointly conducted by the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, the University of Kassel, and the Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg.

It contains most of the country's irrigation and has been at the center of the national debate about water management reform for more than three decades. One of the most controversial issues has been the introduction of a catchment-wide water market. Critics argue that markets are strengthening pressures for short-term economic development and making it increasingly difficult to achieve more sustainable river management and adjust to climate change. But during the recent very severe millennium drought the water market allowed water to be moved fairly easily from low value agricultural uses to high value uses resulting in almost no overall economic loss. Water reform in the MDB has long been subject to intense conflict between the national government and the four state governments in the catchment (and between the state governments against each other). The Australian national government is attempting to reshape the water governance framework through the introduction of a comprehensive Basin Plan backed by a large funding package that includes the equivalent of approximately $ 3 billion US to purchase water entitlements to achieve environmental improvements. The Basin Plan is designed to reverse over a century of development-induced decline and protect the MDB from the predicted impacts of climate change. While the Basin Plan falls short of its objectives in a number of significant ways it is still a serious effort to implement sustainable river management at a catchment wide scale. As such it provides a case study of international significance for the long running debate about how irrigation can be made sustainable and compatible with the increasing pressure to improve riverine environments.

Being dominated by agro-pastoralists, it was obvious that cassava and other crops that take more than four months before being harvested do not fit well into the system and this is an area that has to be addressed to pre-empt potential conflicts.","[Githunguri, Cyrus M.] KARI Katumani Res Ctr, POB 340-90100, Machakos, Kenya; [Lung'ahi, Esther G.; Kabugu, Joan] ALIN, Nairobi 1009800100, Kenya; [Musili, Rhoda] Mutomo Maarifa Ctr, ALIN, Mutomo, Kitui, Kenya",,"Githunguri, CM (通讯作者)，KARI Katumani Res Ctr, POB 340-90100, Machakos, Kenya.",cyrusgithunguri@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-2010,,978-3-319-13000-2; 978-3-319-12999-0,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2015,,,,,,,225,233,,10.1007/978-3-319-13000-2_20,0.0,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BF2JL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380473000020,0

The research methodology involves the following steps: 1) Establish the main objectives of the research, namely: a) analyze the relationship between integrated marketing communication and consumer behaviour; b) determining those factors that may influence buying behaviour of consumers through the integrated marketing communication. 2) Identify tools used for the collection, processing and analysis of the findings obtained from research, as follows: a) were selected and analyzed a number of scientific articles published in the most known international databases; b) were consulted titles of books published in the domain of research theme; c) were identified items of interest that contributed to achieving the research objectives above-mentioned. 3) Interpretation of obtained theoretical results that contribute to the fulfilment of the main research objectives. Today, consumers use many sources of information, and the value of the integrated marketing communication has grown considerably. Highly targeted, the integrated marketing communication campaigns are based on the strengths of existing communication tools, for to a favourably influence the behaviour of the target audience. Improving the demarches of communicational nature can be achieved by changing the mode of thinking the organizations involving increasingly more the final consumer in the communicational process. Integrated marketing communication is a circular process (not one linear) that starts with the potential consumer and returns to identify the most effective ways by which should be developed the communications programs. The principle after which operates this process is based on the fact that any communication approach must start from the consumer. The method of informational management used for the implementation of this principle is outside-in, which means that the communication process starts from outside the company to the inside of her, with order to determine the tools that best serve to the communication needs of the consumers potential and actual. Through the information obtained from the outside seeks to determine those weaknesses that need to be redressed, and the best ways to formulate the messages so that their impact to be maxim. The specialists in the integrated marketing communication must consider when designing a communicational message a number of factors that play an important role in consumers' decision of choosing a product, because in this way can be influenced in a favourable sense the attitude towards product, leading to the determination of an effective buying behaviour.

According to directive 2000/60/EC, action is needed to protect water in qualitative and quantitative terms. Among the several actions that are expected to contribute to the protection of water is the optimization of irrigation management. In this framework irrigation professionals are challenged to achieve maximum irrigation efficiency at scheme as well as at end-user (farm or landscape setup) level. Irrigation efficiency is a complex concept at upper levels as the losses of someone could be the gains for someone else. At end-user level, irrigation audits which register and analyze information regarding water and soil characteristics, the design, installation and maintenance of the system, the available flow, the operating pressure, the application uniformity and the irrigation schedule provide a useful tool for system evaluation and maintenance, upgrade decisions. In the framework of the present work, selected case studies, part of an irrigation auditing initiative, which is in progress and will include 100 audits at the Regions of Epirus and Western Greece, are presented. Extended literature review was made in order to design the auditing procedures. Special fact sheets have been prepared and pilot audits were used in order to evaluate them and make final adjustments. The audits have been applied on a variety of agricultural irrigation systems (big guns, sprinklers bubblers, drip lines, emitters etc) as well as on sprinkler irrigation systems for landscaping setups (parks and athletic facilities). After each audit, a report is handed to farmers and irrigation managers. The report contains information regarding the findings and proposals for improvements. The majority of the systems that were audited up to now presented serious problems regarding design, construction, maintenance and management. The feedback was positive and most of them agreed to keep records regarding water savings data. It has to be noted that no relevant national legislation or official standard exist in Greece. In this framework, an objective of the initiative is to develop a practical auditing guide and make it available to relevant stakeholders and policy makers.

Curriculum modification was not limited to instructional modification or content modification but included a continuum of a wide range of modified educational components in business. On the bases of findings and conclusions derived from the study, and in consideration of the limitations of the study, the following were recommended: curriculum development/modification in business courses offerings, training of personnel, training of faculty needed to have a compulsory component in teaching and assessing learners with learning challenges. Similar in-service training was also needed for the already practicing faculty. Further, there was a clear manifestation of lack of resources in learning institutions where special students were found, modified curriculum and differentiated instruction materials for students' with multiple intelligences must be introduced.

Given efficient households that minimize the cost of operating automobiles, recent vehicle technology that improves blended fuel substitution, and typical market conditions of the last five years, blended fuels with 20% ethanol concentration could occupy a volume of 82.2 billion gallons in a 138.3 billion gallon gasoline market.

The ethanol demand associated with a voluntary blended fuel market is 16.4 BGY, slightly more than the conventional component of the Renewable Fuels Standard.

In Melanesia, access to modern energy services represents a major unfinished agenda. To that end, Pacific Energy Ministers have endorsed the Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific (FAESP) in April 2011. The associated implementation plan (IPESP) was developed, however never formally endorsed. PICs have instead taken a pathway towards national energy transition roadmaps. This paper describes the current status of the energy sector in PICs, the main challenges and the barriers to the deployment of renewable energy and the role of international cooperation in accelerating deployment. In the context of this analysis, technology cooperation is treated as the sum of cooperation on orgware, software and hardware. These three dimensions are explored in the context of the Pacific energy sector, looking at how development finance (DF) is currently distributed among them. Looking at the key barriers identified and the areas where DF has been focused to date, this paper proposes a framework for removal of barriers to the deployment of renewable energy in the Pacific through more focused use of DF and technical cooperation. The framework identifies key goals, actors, activities, resources necessary and indicators to monitor progress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the institutional capacity of councils in Sydney and how this impacts on decisions to invest in alternative energy projects. We find greenhouse gas emission targets of councils are strongly aligned to national targets but do not reflect the local council's institutional capacity, political leadership or strategic priorities. Energy reduction projects are often identified and undertaken by environmental staff without support from financial staff or financial-evaluation tools. An absence of national guidelines to provide consistency in tracking and reporting limits cross-sector benchmarking. Street lighting contributes to a significant proportion of council's total electricity expenditure and GHG emission profile. Being highly regulated, existing contracts and the current practice of street lighting services limits the councils' ability to reduce emissions. Based on our analysis we recommend a number of measures to overcome these constraints including the use of financial evaluation tools for small-scale renewable energy projects, a standardised national tracking and reporting platform to facilitate progress-reporting and meaningful comparative analysis between councils and policy reform to the regulation of street lighting.

The purposes of this paper are two-fold. The first is to obtain the demand function for DHS-based RH in Korea and investigate the price and income elasticities of the demand employing the quarterly data covering the period 1988-2013. The short-run price and income elasticities are estimated as 0.700 and 0.918, respectively. Moreover, the long-run elasticities are -1.253 and 1.642, respectively. The second purpose is to measure the consumption benefits of DHS-based-RH employing the economic theory that they are the sum of the actual payment and consumer surplus for the consumption. Considering that the average price and estimated consumer surplus of the DHS-based RH use in 2013 are computed to be KRW 87,870 (USD 84.1) and KRW 62,764 (USD 60.1) per Gcal, the consumption benefits of the DHS-based RH are calculated to be KRW 150,634 (USD 144.2) per Gcal. This information can be beneficially utilized to conduct an economic feasibility study for a new DHS project related to RH supply. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This innovation involves enhancing the synergy between buildings and mobility by associating positive energy houses with electric vehicles. The vehicle battery, charged primarily using PV electricity, could also provide a way of storing intermittent solar-generated electricity for later use. The aim of this article is to implement a decision-making model for public administration which can select the best innovation policies based on a number of criteria reflecting their major goals in terms of policies relating to energy, economics, social cohesion and factor 4 (to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050 compared with 1990 levels). The methodology developed herein has been applied to a concrete case, with some resulting recommendations which may be of use for the public authorities: simultaneously combine research in favour of solar mobility technologies and apply a relatively high carbon tax.

It is therefore crucial to understand how viable solutions may find political support on these terms. As one such case, this paper examines Norway's explicit foreign policy to promote Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a mitigation measure. I suggest that a Foreign Policy Analysis framework with a norm-centered constructivist focus allows for new in-sights into how climate policies function as balancing strategies between external normative pressures and important domestic concerns. It reveals how Norway's CCS policy represents an extraordinary effort to bridge seemingly contradictory agendas. The Norwegian CCS case highlights how a state may engage in innovative foreign political engineering to promote solutions to its international climate commitments on terms that fit national energy needs. It shows that climate political success may depend on successfully linking the international and domestic levels by simultaneously appealing to established norms within each system.

Convincing people to drive more fuel-efficiently (eco-driving) is often an integral part of these approaches, especially in the transport sector. But there is a lack of studies on the long-term persistence and potential interaction of the effects of incentives and training on energy conservation behavior in general and eco-driving behavior in particular. We address this gap with a twelve months long natural field experiment in a logistics company to analyze the time-dependent and potentially interacting effects of rewards and theoretical training for eco-driving on fuel consumption in a real-world setting. We find an immediate reduction of fuel consumption following the introduction of a non-monetary reward and an attenuation of this effect over time. Theoretical eco-driving training shows no effect, neither short-term nor long-term, highlighting the often neglected necessity to include practical training elements. Contrary to common assumptions, the interaction of incentives and theoretical training does not show an additional reduction effect. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of changing engrained behavior and habits, and underline the need for a careful selection and combination of interventions.

The subnational impacts will vary because the level of dependence on coal for electricity generation varies substantially across states. Indiana represents a state where the CPP impacts may be relatively large due to heavy dependence on coal for electricity generation. Therefore, this paper presents analysis of the efficacy and cost of alternative approaches to carbon mitigation policy, taking Indiana as an example. A state-level energy system model, IN-MARKAL, was developed based on the MARKAL framework to explore alternative policy scenarios. Results show that a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is relatively cost effective in achieving carbon emissions reduction for Indiana from the perspective of the power system alone, but that the RPS may also lead to a generation mix dominated by coal and wind. Carbon cap and carbon tax outperform the RPS when considering the entire energy system modeled in IN-MARKAL, which also lead to a more diverse generation portfolio for the state.

The French current electricity mix is characterised by a high share of nuclear power which equalled 76% of the total electric production in 2015. With the increase in intermittent renewable sources, nuclear flexibility is examined as part of the solution to balance electricity supply and demand. Our proposed methodology involves designing scenarios with nuclear and intermittent renewable penetration levels, and developing residual load duration curves in each case. The load modulation impact on the nuclear production cost is estimated. This article shows to which extent the nuclear annual energy production will decrease with high shares of intermittent renewables (down to load factors of 40% for proactive assumptions). However, the production cost increase could be compensated by progressively replacing the plants: Moreover, incentives are necessary if nuclear is to compete with combined-cycle gas turbines as its alternative backup option. In order to reconcile the social planner with plant operator goals, the solution could be to find new outlets rather than reducing nuclear load factors. Nuclear flexibility could then be considered in terms of using its power to produce heat or hydrogen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to examine determinants of household heating system choices and to use this information for policy planning purposes. This paper investigates residential homeowner attitudes regarding innovative hybrid home heating systems (HHHS) with choice experiment. Heating system scenarios are designed to represent the most relevant primary and supplementary heating alternatives currently available in Finland. The choice sets include six main heating alternatives (district heat, solid wood, wood pellet, electric storage heating, ground heat pump and exhaust air heat pump) that are described by five attributes (supplementary heating systems, investment costs, operating costs, comfort of use and environmental friendliness). The results imply that HHHSs generally appear to be accepted among households; however, several factors affect perceptions of these technologies. The results reveal differing household attitudes toward the main heating alternatives and show that such views are affected by socio-demographic characteristics (age, living environment, education, etc.). The results suggest that households view supplementary heating systems (especially solar-based) favorably. The other attributes studied also play a significant role in decision making.

China has been especially remarkable, surpassing both the US and the EU in 2013. Some recent facts, however, have raised the question of whether exuberant investment in China's renewable energy sector is rational. This paper aims to contribute to the literature and to the debate in two ways. First, it tests the over investment hypothesis based on the main stream finance methodology; second, it analyzes the role of capital structure in the performance of China's renewable energy firms. Empirical results show that overinvestment in the renewable energy sector exists. The problem is more significant in the biomass and wind sector. Capital structure is found to be more important to downstream firms, indicating that policy makers may provide support that enables these firms to finance their investments through corporate bonds, commercial credit, or long-terms debts.

This study aims to identify the level of renewable energy acceptance in Korea by estimating Korean consumers' additional willingness to pay (WTP) using the contingent valuation (CV) method, which is the most widely used to analyze consumer preferences. The estimation results indicate that Korean consumers are willing to pay an additional USD 3.21 per month for electricity generated with renewable energy. However, WTP in Korea is low relative to other advanced nations, indicating that these values could be influenced through policies aimed at improving knowledge and acceptance of renewable energy sources among Korean consumers.

Twenty life cycle sustainability indicators (11 environmental, three economic and six social) are used to evaluate the current electricity options. Geothermal power is the best option for six environmental impacts but it has the highest capital costs. Small reservoir and run-of-river power has the lowest global warming potential while large reservoir is best for the depletion of elements and fossil resources, and acidification. It also has the lowest levelised costs, worker injuries and fatalities but provides the lowest life cycle employment opportunities. Gas power has the lowest capital costs but it provides the lowest direct employment and has the highest levelised costs and ozone layer depletion. Given these trade-offs, a multi-criteria decision analysis has been carried out to identify the most sustainable options assuming different stakeholder preferences. For all the preferences considered, hydropower is the most sustainable option for Turkey, followed by geothermal and wind electricity. This work demonstrates the importance for energy policy of an integrated life cycle sustainability assessment and how tensions between different aspects can be reconciled to identify win-win solutions.

Reform of the Barnett Formula with needs assessment: can the challenges be overcome?, Regional Studies. Block grants to the UK's devolved administrations are allocated using the Barnett Formula. There have been calls to replace this formula with one based on spending needs assessment, but two obstacles to doing so have been raised. First, that the devolved administrations would be unable to agree on how needs should be assessed; and second, it is unclear how needs assessment might work for devolved governments that can pursue different spending policies. This paper investigates the first issue by analysing whether the Scottish and English formulae for allocating health and education funding within each country are statistically similar; and the second issue through a hypothetical policy simulation analysis.","[King, David; Eiser, David] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"King, D; Eiser, D (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",d.n.king@stir.ac.uk; david.eiser@stir.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), 'Development of Needs-Based Funding Models for the Devolved Territories in the UK' [RES-062-23-2814]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L003325/1, ES/K007173/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K007173/1, ES/L003325/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), 'Development of Needs-Based Funding Models for the Devolved Territories in the UK'; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This research was funded through an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Research Grant [grant number RES-062-23-2814], 'Development of Needs-Based Funding Models for the Devolved Territories in the UK'.",,41,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The most common distinction in the literature divides behaviours as follows: (1) low-impact, low-cost, repetitive behaviours that result in a loss of comfort or curtailment behaviours and (2) high-impact, high-cost, infrequent behaviours that result in no loss of amenities or efficiency behaviours. However, such categorizations have often been ad hoc and two-dimensional (e.g., low-impact vs. high-impact, low-cost vs. high-cost). In contrast, we systematically assess a large range of household energy-saving behaviours (N=261) across nine attributes - energy savings, cost, frequency of performance, required skill level, observability, locus of decision, household function, home topography, and appliance topography. By clustering behaviours according to these attributes, we discern four clusters of energy-saving behaviours: family style, call an expert, household management and weekend project. We discuss the implications of these clusters for intervention design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies are discussed. The non-cooperative strategy is a dynamic game in which each country makes its own environmental decision following the open-loop Nash equilibrium. The cooperative social planner problem assumes an international environmental agreement in force. The non-cooperative and cooperative solutions are compared in the symmetric case of two countries and extended to several identical countries.

This paper contributes to the debate by analyzing the relationship between energy efficiency and economic performance at the micro- (total factor productivity) and macro-level (countries' economic growth). It uses data on a large sample of manufacturing firms across 29 developing countries to find that lower levels of energy intensity are associated with higher total factor productivity for the majority of these countries.

Adaptability and vulnerability in socio-ecological Transformations-the case of Austria,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Resilience; Energy; Peak oil; Vulnerability; Innovation; Social capital,,"Resilience has become a prominent concept to understand system vulnerabilities and flexible ways of adapting to crises. Recently, it gained importance in discussions about the possible peak in oil production (peak oil) and its consequences, which might affect economic performance, social well-being and political stability, and thus also the energy transition to a low-carbon economy. The paper presents a new way of measuring resilience as absolute resilience related to a best practice-model of a resilient society. The resilience model is grounded in explicit theoretical assumptions. All indicators are justified by theoretical and empirical arguments. We present a case study of Austrian municipalities and broader scale spatial types, which were defined according to their degree of urbanization. The mean resilience of Austrian municipalities is moderate, the difference between resilience values of municipalities is small. Significant differences between spatial types exist. Higher resilience is displayed by less urbanized types due to a higher share of agricultural activities and a more favorable level of GDP per capita. Austria has considerable latitude to improve resilience. Corresponding policies should target resilience components with the lowest values first. A sole focus on regionalization is not recommended.

By estimating a dynamic panel model with the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with alternative panel estimators, respectively, we find that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is well supported for all three major pollutant emissions in China across different models and estimation methods. Our study also confirms positive effects of energy consumption on various pollutant emissions. In addition, we find some evidence that trade and urbanization may deteriorate environmental quality in the long run, albeit not in the short run. From policy perspective, our estimation results bode well for Chinese government's goal of capping greenhouse emissions by 2030 as outlined in the recent China-US climate accord, while containing energy consumption and harm effects from expanding trade and urbanization remains some environmental challenges that China faces.

The analyses are conducted by employing a continuous dynamic distribution approach and panel data of 286 cities at the prefecture and above-prefecture level. The results show that per capita CO2 emissions tend to converge during the sample period of 2002-2011. However, multimodality is found in the ergodic distribution of the full sample. It is also found that there is more persistence in cities with low per capita CO2 emissions, and more mobility in cities with high per capita CO2 emissions. The analyses also show that the dynamics of per capita CO2 emissions are significantly different among various geographical, income and environmental policy groups. The conditional distribution analyses indicate that multi modality cannot be explained independently by any one of the two factors, namely geographical location or income level. The findings in this study may have important policy implications for CO2 abatement in China. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among these, the unemployment percentage and the average winter temperature were found to be insignificant to determine the demand for the years between 1975 and 2013. Next, the future values of the statistically significant variables were predicted by time series ANN models, and these were simulated in a multilayer perceptron ANN model to forecast the future annual electricity demand. The results were validated with a very high accuracy for the years that the electricity demand was known (20072013), and they were also superior to the official predictions (done by Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Turkey). The model was then used to forecast the annual gross electricity demand for the future years, and it was found that, the demand will be doubled reaching about 460 TW h in the year 2028. Finally, it was concluded that the approach applied in this work can easily be implemented for other countries to make accurate predictions for the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, knowledge about IBT design is still limited, particularly how to determine the electricity volume for the first block of an IBT scheme. Assuming the first block should be set based on some measure of electricity poverty; we attempt to model household electricity demand such that the range of basic needs can be established. We show that in Chinese households there exists a threshold for electricity consumption with respect to income, which could be considered a measure of electricity poverty, and the threshold differs between rural and urban areas. For rural (urban) families, electricity consumption at the level of 7th (5th) income decile households can be considered the threshold for basic needs or a measure of electricity poverty since household electricity demand in rural (urban) areas does not respond to income changes until after 7th (5th) income decile. Accordingly, the first IBT block for some provinces (e.g., Beijing) appears to have been set at a level that is too high. Over time however, given continued rapid growth, the IBT will begin to better reflect actual basic needs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Key metrics include the documentation of CO2 emissions, energy access measures, and energy supply reserves from 2005-2010. We identify relevant energy indicators using high quality historical data from the IEA and World Bank. We find that ASEAN made little progress toward establishing energy security in the previous five-year planning period (2005-2010) as it regressed in most categories except applicability.

At the start of 2014, the country was already suffering from the weak economic growth, partly due to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The recent plunge in global oil prices put even further strain on the Russian economy. This paper analyzes the dynamic relationship between oil price shocks, economic sanctions, and leading macroeconomic indicators in Russia. We apply a vector autoregression (VAR) to quantify the effects of oil price shocks as well as western economic sanctions on real GDP, real effective exchange rate, inflation, real fiscal expenditures, real consumption expenditures, and external trade using quarterly data from 1999:1 until 2015:1. Our results show a significant impact of oil prices on the Russian economy. We predict that Russia's economic outlook is not very optimistic. If sanctions remain until the end of 2017, the quarter-to-quarter real GDP will contract on average by 19 percent over the next two years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the ambitious plans for enhancements of energy infrastructures in this region, the issue of social acceptance of energy infrastructure is crucial. To foster an understanding of the challenges inherent in this issue we present an analysis concentrating on the social acceptance of energy infrastructure projects in Upper Austria. This paper addresses the issues with realizing energy infrastructure projects and analyzes the problems and benefits based on an empirical-qualitative study comprising expert interviews, discussions with stakeholders, and a round table workshop integrating the disparate viewpoints. The aim of the process was to integrate different attitudes, perspectives and positions of relevant stakeholders, members of citizens' initiatives, environmental organizations and of the national government and local authorities. The results presented are based on both the analysis of the empirical-qualitative data and the existing studies and literature on social acceptance.

We then present a real business cycle model with a financial sector to investigate how the dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates and balance sheet variables of the US banks are influenced by empirically disciplined shocks to bank networth. Both calibrated and estimated versions of the model show that these financial shocks are important not only for explaining the dynamics of financial flows but also for the dynamics of macroeconomic variables.

Unlike the literature on political effects on real economy that suggests that partisan effects accrue through aggregate demand, it is hypothesized that such effects could also accrue through aggregate supply. Using panel data for the Spanish regions over the 1986-2010 period, the main results are: (1) partisan alignment effects only arise when central government enjoys a majority; (2) there exist a positive contemporaneous effect and negative lagged effects; and (3) in absolute value, such effects vanish over time. Results are robust to different specifications and measures of total factor productivity (TFP) and methods of estimation.","[Aray, Henry] Univ Granada, Dept Econ, E-18011 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Aray, H (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Econ, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18011 Granada, Spain.",haray@ugr.es,"Aray, Henry/L-7127-2014","Aray, Henry/0000-0001-6081-0441",Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Science [MICINN-ECO2011-25737]; Centro de Estudios Andaluces [PRY112/08],Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Science(Spanish Government); Centro de Estudios Andaluces,This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Science [grant number MICINN-ECO2011-25737] and by Centro de Estudios Andaluces [grant number PRY112/08].,,42,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A comprehensive analysis of expenditure decentralization and of the composition of local public spending, Regional Studies. Many industrialized countries have recently implemented fiscal decentralization reforms assigning more spending responsibility to sub-national governments. This paper investigates the causes of the decentralization of different categories of public expenditure in 19 developed countries over the period 1980-2006. Different models for each of the spending functions under analysis are estimated adopting a general-to-specific empirical approach. Results confirm existing findings on the negative link between regional income disparities and expenditure decentralization. A similarly negative relationship is found for a set of demographic variables, leading to the conclusion that macroeconomic and, more importantly, political factors are responsible for the recent increase in decentralization. Finally, the analysis is completed by a study of the factors driving sub-national expenditure composition, with political and demographic changes emerging as the most important determinants.","[Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Mercatorum, Fac Econ, I-00178 Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Governance & Econ Res Network Spain, Orense, Spain; [Salotti, Simone] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford OX33 1HX, England",Universita Telematica Mercatorum; Oxford Brookes University,"Sacchi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mercatorum, Fac Econ, Via Appia Pignatelli 62, I-00178 Rome, Italy.",a.sacchi@unimercatorum.it; ssalotti@brookes.ac.uk,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683",,,,,49,36,38,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

These spurious factors can induce an overfitting problem in factor-augmented forecasting models. To address this concern, we propose a method to estimate nonspurious factors by identifying the set of response variables that have no structural changes in their factor loadings. Our theoretical results show that the obtained set may include a fraction of unstable response variables. However, the fraction is so small that the original factors are able to be identified and estimated consistently. Moreover, using this approach, we find that a significant portion of 132U.S. macroeconomic time series have structural changes in their factor loadings. Although traditional principal components provide eight or more factors, there are significantly fewer nonspurious factors. The forecasts using the nonspurious factors can significantly improve out-of-sample performance.","[Yamamoto, Yohei] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Yamamoto, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",yohei.yamamoto@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"MEXT [25870235, 25285067]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245042, 25285067, 25870235] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by the MEXT Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Nos. 25870235 and 25285067.,,30,4,4,0,6,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Currently, crude oil market situation is unstable due to significant decrease in crude oil prices. Thus, volatile prices of crude oil put pressure on agriculture and food industry and low prices of crude oil may cause food prices to decrease. Additionally, lower oil prices have an impact on vegetable oils used in biodiesel production. Consequently, the diminishing trend in crude oil prices might seem to be beneficial for biodiesel producers due to the fact that rapeseed oil, soybean oil, palm oil belong to dominating feedstocks for biodiesel production. However, diesel prices would decline with lower crude oil prices, meaning that low diesel prices push down biodiesel prices. Therefore, this paper focuses on long-run relationship between biodiesel prices and prices of vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. The aim of the paper is to investigate price development and price linkages between biodiesel prices and selected prices of vegetable oils based on linear modelling technique called ordinary least-squares regression.","[Kapusta, Jaroslav; Lajdova, Zuzana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kapusta, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",kapustaspu@gmail.com; zuzana.lajdova@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,4,7,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,113,122,,10.15414/isd2016.s2.02,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500012,0

For such efforts to be worthy, a high rate of adoption of e-government is needed. Technology adoption is one of the most mature areas in information technology (IT) research and many adoption models have been developed for this purpose. Most studies in this field have been focused on voluntary use of systems and mainly from a business context, with minor emphasize on an e-government. A major distinction between technologies of e-government and other online technologies, is that the use of certain e-government technologies is mandatory, rather than voluntary. This paper provides a short introduction of e-government, followed by a review of the most well-known information technology (IT) adoption models at the individual level. Using previous research results, the study will identify the determinant constructs and their relationship for adoption of the digital notarial system of Albania.

This method not only allows the aggregation of multiple indicators and the estimation of well-being shifts over time, but also shows the sources of variation in local economic wellbeing. The results seem to suggest that whilst economic well-being has improved in the great majority of provinces, this advancement stems largely from a more favourable environment than from the specific capacity of each province to reduce its relative distance from key benchmarks.","[Murias, Pilar] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Appl Econ, Rua Burgo Nac S-N, E-15782 Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain; [Novello, Simone; Martinez-Roget, Fidel] CESUGA Univ Coll Dublin, Rua Obradoiro 47, E-15190 La Coruna, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Martínez-Roget, F (通讯作者)，CESUGA Univ Coll Dublin, Rua Obradoiro 47, E-15190 La Coruna, Spain.",mdelpilar.murias@usc.es; fidel.martinez@usc.es,"Murias, Pilar/B-6770-2013; MARTÍNEZ-ROGET, FIDEL/I-4762-2015; MURIAS, PILAR/ABF-1233-2021","MURIAS, PILAR/0000-0002-9057-5670; Martinez Roget, Fidel/0000-0001-5020-8692",,,,,89,4,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The proposed model of relations between determinants was tested by applying the method of structural equation modelling using the data collected from 419 respondents in the Czech Republic. According to the results, the perceived size of website influences the trust in website and it influences the perceived quality of website. The satisfaction with website is influenced the most with the perceived quality of website. The results show that satisfaction with website has strong impact on the customer overall satisfaction, whilst the satisfaction with sellers is not statistically significant.

Hence, the analysis of the relationship between electricity production and growth becomes an interesting field of research, highlighted in the historiography but with contradictory empirical results. In this paper, using a cointegration model for short time series, we examine the causal relationship between electricity and the Spanish GDP during the period 1945-2011 and we conclude that electricity production boosted GDP growth and not the other way round. Disaggregating by sources of generation, it is concluded that both the electricity obtained from renewable sources and nuclear power led to economic growth; this economic growth, however, led to the production of electricity in conventional power plants. Consequently, policies that promote renewable or nuclear power can raise Spanish economic growth.","[Sanz Villarroya, Isabel; Sanau, Jaime] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Villarroya, IS (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,1,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Decomposition of TFP growth into technical change and technical efficiency change reveals that the negative growth is only due to technological regress.

Oil is typically considered to be the most critical fuel as an input for the petro-chemical and transportation sector and due to limited and less spread reserves. In this study external oil supply risks are assessed for the period up to 2035 for the European Union, United States, China, Japan and India (being the five largest importers of oil in the world), based on their current supplier portfolio. Scenarios are constructed for several climate policy and oil-supply projections. It is found that risks increase strongly, when stringent climate policies are prevented from being implemented, especially when a peak in oil supply is taken into account, resulting in major oil supply-disruptions. China faces the lowest oil supply risks in most scenarios but the trends of India, China and US converge over time due to increasing import dependency of China and India. Japan faces high risks since the country has the highest oil import dependency combined with a low oil import diversification. For the EU, all figures are strongly influenced by Russia, accounting for 32% of total imports, and to a lesser extent Norway (11%), with high overall risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result of the growing demand, senior tourists are foreseen to become a powerful consumer group in the near future.

A standard assumption made in the literature is that the reduced form unconditional error covariance matrix varies while the structural parameters remain constant. Under this hypothesis, it is possible to identify the SVAR without needing to resort to additional restrictions. With macroeconomic data, the assumption that the transmission mechanism of the shocks does not vary across volatility regimes is debatable. We derive novel necessary and sufficient rank conditions for local identification of SVARs, where both the error covariance matrix and the structural parameters are allowed to change across volatility regimes. Our approach generalizes the existing literature on identification through changes in volatility' to a broader framework and opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners. An empirical illustration focuses on a small monetary policy SVAR of the US economy and suggests that monetary policy has become more effective at stabilizing the economy since the 1980s.","[Bacchiocchi, Emanuele] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy; [Fanelli, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Fanelli, Luca] Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, Bologna, Italy",University of Milan; University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Bacchiocchi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy.",emanuele.bacchiocchi@unimi.it; luca.fanelli@unibo.it,"Bacchiocchi, Emanuele/K-8423-2017","Bacchiocchi, Emanuele/0000-0002-7365-3630; Fanelli, Luca/0000-0001-5351-2876",Italian MIUR Grant PRIN [prot. 2010RHAHPL 003]; University of Bologna,"Italian MIUR Grant PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); University of Bologna","The authors wish to thank two anonymous referees, Anindya Banerjee, and the following people for useful comments on previous versions of this article: Efrem Castelnuovo, Marcu Lanne, Riccardo 'Jack Lucchetti, Helmut Lutkepohl, Alessandro Missale, Aleksei Netsunajev, Paolo Paruolo and Tao Zha.

This strategy, however, will not be helpful in the short-run. The only way, the power crisis can be controlled or mitigated in the short-run, is to efficiently utilize the available resources. Government lacks such a strategy at this point. The paper provides such a strategy by setting up a power sector model with multiple modules of generation, transmission and distribution. The model provides an efficient way of utilizing the available resources and can be used to perform simulations at different stages of the supply-chain. The results of model show that, if the given resources are utilized efficiently, the power generation increases by 3222 GWh or 5 percent of the current output and the revenue increases by $945 million or 12 percent. The extra generated power decrease the cost of power production by 0.52 cent/KWh cents and reduces the power load-shedding for 2-3 h. These outcomes can significantly relieve the sector and the people of Pakistan. The results of the model have important policy implications on working of the sector and circular debt reduction.

To account for spatial autocorrelation across regions, we formulate a hierarchical spatial model and use a Bayesian instrumental-variable approach. We find that agglomeration of the same industry (i.e., localization) has a productivity-boosting effect, but agglomeration of urban population (i.e., urbanization) has no such effect. In addition, the localization effect increases with the educational levels of employees and the share of intermediate inputs in gross output. These results may suggest that agglomeration externalities occur through knowledge spillovers and input sharing among firms producing similar manufactures.","[Hashiguchi, Yoshihiro; Tanaka, Kiyoyasu] Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan",,"Hashiguchi, Y (通讯作者)，Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",Yoshihiro_Hashiguchi@ide.go.jp; Kiyoyasu_Tanaka@ide.go.jp,,,[25350319]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23530319] Funding Source: KAKEN,"; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Toshiyuki Matsuura, for his data assistance, and participants at the Third Asian Seminar in Regional Science 2013 and the Institute of Developing Economies Workshop 2013 for their constructive comments.

Based on a multi-regional input-output model, this paper estimates consumption-based emissions of service sectors of 41 countries and regions, and discusses the emission abatement policy of service sectors. The results indicate that consumption-based emissions of the service sector in most countries and regions are much greater than direct emissions generated by the service sector. Further decomposition by production sources demonstrates that final demand for services in certain countries causes substantial emissions in the other countries. In most countries, major parts of consumption-based emissions of the service sector come from upstream emissions in non-service sectors due to the intermediate consumption of non-service inputs in the service sector. For the US and China, the consumption-based emissions of their service sectors are traced back to different service consumption bundles and production sectors, which enable us to identify service categories and production sectors that play key roles in the impact of service sectors on CO2 emissions.

Productivity spillovers from foreign multinational enterprises to domestic manufacturing firms: to what extent does spatial proximity matter?, Regional Studies. This paper analyses the role of spatial proximity in productivity spillovers from foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs). Using a database of foreign affiliates located in Italy from 1999 to 2005, it is shown that local firms benefit from the presence of MNEs through both backward and forward linkages. It is found that: (1) spillover effects are more strongly associated with MNEs in knowledge-intensive business services and utilities; and (2) co-location positively affects productivity spillovers, and the effect is stronger for foreign affiliates that are distantly located. This is especially true in the service sector due to the role of temporary spatial proximity and other dimensions of proximity.","[Mariotti, Sergio; Piscitello, Lucia] Politecn Milan, DIG, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Mutinelli, Marco] Univ Brescia, Dipartimento Ingn Meccan & Ind, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; [Nicolini, Marcella] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Nicolini, Marcella] FEEM, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Brescia; University of Pavia; Fondazione Mattei,"Mariotti, S (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, DIG, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",sergio.mariotti@polimi.it; marco.mutinelli@unibs.it; marcella.nicolini@unipv.it; lucia.piscitello@polimi.it,"Nicolini, Marcella/ABE-2618-2020; Nicolini, Marcella/ABA-7959-2020","Nicolini, Marcella/0000-0001-9034-2562; Nicolini, Marcella/0000-0001-9034-2562; piscitello, lucia/0000-0002-4817-315X",,,,,78,19,20,1,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The results demonstrate that using economic tools and assumptions typically applied for building energy regulatory policy changes, net societal economic benefits significantly outweigh costs. The clear economic outcomes, combined with expected health and productivity benefits from improved levels of thermal comfort, should provide security to policy makers to progress home energy standards towards net zero energy performance.

Nevertheless, the increasing difficulty in accessing the capital market and the rising cost of funding sources, both noticeable over the past few years, led to a slowdown of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiatives. Meanwhile, the community is expressing new needs to be satisfied, such as the conversion of brownfields, the recovery of housing stock dating back to former times, as well as the refurbishment of public offices or schools. Emerging priorities include the supply of affordable dwellings for low to medium income households. This essay aims to examine a case study in which PPP and buildings energy efficiency have been successfully combined, in order to jointly contribute to the achievement of a social housing settlement. Thanks to energy efficiency measures concerning building envelope insulation, heating system and other installations the agreed rent results far higher than social rent of protected tenancies, and furthermore above the range of fair rents characterising other regulated tenancies, but mildly lower than market rents. All this allows to achieve an equity yield rate satisfying from the perspective of a venture philanthropy investment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This discounts the influence of varying thermal conditions on how people use buildings and the impact this may have on energy consumption. This paper explores the intersection between older people's thermal experience, spatial and temporal variations in thermal conditions in a dwelling and the influence this has on occupants' use of space. The paper reports on qualitative studies in homes with both conventional and newly installed low carbon heating systems. The results suggest that older people are sensitive to and adept at exploiting variations in the dynamic 'landscape' of warmth to achieve desired thermal preferences and that they modify their dwellings to improve the quality of the thermal environment. There is also some evidence of a 'spatial rebound' effect after energy upgrades, when occupants inhabit rooms they previously could not afford to heat. The nature of qualitative research precludes robust recommendations for policy. However, one important avenue to explore further appears to be that householders may be more strongly motivated by interventions offering improvements across a range of aspects rather than on energy savings alone.

Different quantification methods have estimated the associated historical savings of fuel and CO2 emissions. Primary energy equivalent and econometric methods do not readily quantify factors like operational changes to fossil fuel generation arising from the integration renewable energy. Dispatch models can overcome these limitations, but are generally applied to future scenarios. A dispatch model is applied to ex-post data for the 2012 All Island system in Ireland. Renewable electricity accounted for 20.4% of total generation, 15.8% from wind. The results show renewable generation averted a 26% increase in fossil fuels (valued at (sic)297 million) and avoided an 18% increase in CO2 emissions (2.85 MtCO(2)), as compared to the simulated 2012 system without renewable generation. Wind averted 20% increase in fossil fuel generation and a 14% increase in CO2 emissions (2.33 MtCO(2)). Each MWh of renewable electricity avoided on average 0.43 tCO(2) with wind avoiding 0.46 tCO(2)/MWh. Additional renewable related balancing requirements had minor impacts on fossil fuel generation efficiency; CO2 production rates increased by < 2%. Policy measures to alleviate network congestion, increase system flexibility and increase financial penalties on emissions can increase savings from renewable generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the literature does not establish a significant impact of socially responsible investing on stock market returns. We develop a coherent economic framework of responsible investing to address this paradox. The framework offers theoretical underpinnings for all research on responsible investment as it provides the theoretical underpinnings for the actual behavior of market participants. We associate corporate social performance with key financial accounting ratios like the market-to-book ratio (market value of the firm in relation to accounting value), return on assets, and stock market return. We conclude that there is a strong theoretical foundation for a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, though the relation is conditional on which financial performance measure is considered. We illustrate that the empirical literature about responsible investing is well in line with our model's propositions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the average electricity price rises when construction costs of PV capacity decline due, for example, to technology improvements, bestowing market power and excessive profits on producers employing fossil-using technologies.

Using data on inventors' addresses for the set of 1200 MNCs firms patenting in green technologies over the 2004-2009 period, we find that about 17% of green patents result from MNCs R&D investments conducted outside their home countries. MNCs tend to locate their foreign green R&D activities in other OECD markets and in China, in particular in lightings and solar technologies. The empirical analysis reveals that the probability of conducting green R&D abroad increases with the host country's stringency of environmental regulation, market size and (green) R&D intensity. Also, relatively lower wages for scientists and engineers, and stronger protection for intellectual property rights in the host country increase the likelihood for MNCs to offshore green R&D. The paper concludes by discussing the policy implications of this changing global innovation landscape. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that 75.12% of total CO2 emissions flow mainly into several sectors, such as ferrous sectors, and the chemical industry in the terminal sub-sectors. Although China's thermoelectric efficiency increased dramatically during past four years, emissions from the heat and power production sector are still increasing due to China's large demand for heat and power. In the ferrous metal and chemical industry sectors, CO2 emissions are mainly energy-related, while in the non-metallic mineral sector, CO2 emissions are mainly from process CO2 emissions. In different terminal sub-sectors, the main carriers of CO2 flow are different, thus, related CO2 reduction policies should also be targeted. In addition, some valuable suggestions are given in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper provides one of the first empirical examinations of the Green Deal's success in influencing homeowners' renovation decisions. Using a repeated measures design in which households were questioned before and after the Green Deal's launch in January 2013, we assess the policy's success in raising awareness of energy efficiency. In particular, we test the effectiveness of the Green Deal's positioning to overcome barriers to renovation among homeowners already interested in or considering energy efficiency measures. Using the innovation decision process (Rogers, 2003) as a conceptual framing of the renovation decision process, we examine whether new information on energy efficiency provided by the Green Deal strengthened intentions and its antecedents. We find that (1) energy efficiency is of potential appeal to all renovators regardless of their attitudes about energy efficiency, (2) energy efficiency opportunities need to be identified in the early stages of renovation when homeowners are thinking about ways to improve their home, and (3) homeowners' intentions towards energy efficiency are weakened by uncertainty about financial benefits, helping to explain the relatively slow uptake of the Green Deal to-date.

These choices must take account of different factors, as is the case with district heating, which is justified as a vehicle of renewable energy while subject to pressure in eco-districts because its techno-economic balances are destabilised by falls in demand. Our study focuses particularly on the city of Metz (France), which has chosen district heating as the primary source for provision for the municipal area and for its firsr eco-district. We analyse the tensions within these choices, with particular attention to the way in which they are negotiated inside municipal departments and with the local energy operator.

Global water and energy demand will increase significantly by 2030 while climate change will worsen water availability. Thus, it is important to ensure a sustainable energy supply despite the increasing severity of water resource constraints. Numerous studies have analyzed water requirements to produce energy from production perspectives. However, energy is generally supplied by both internal and external producers. Thus, it is necessary to consider the availability of water to produce energy from consumption perspectives also. We evaluate the water footprint of the energy supply of Liaoning Province, China. We apply the standard top-down approach using an input-output framework. We estimate the water footprint of the energy supply of Liaoning Province at 854 million m(3) in 2002, with 47% of water used for electricity and heating. Our results reveal that energy supply could depend on water resources in neighboring provinces; external producers met 80% of the water footprint of energy supply, although only 35% of energy supply was imported. If Liaoning Province decreased its external dependency, withdrawal of available water resources within the province would increase from 86% to 91%. To guarantee future regional energy security, it is important to manage water resources effectively through water-efficient electricity generation and by allocating water resources among sectors.

One aspect of the case for policy support for renewable energy developments is the wider economic benefits that are expected to be generated. Within Scotland, as with other regions of the UK, there is a focus on encouraging domestically based renewable technologies. This paper uses a regional computable general equilibrium framework to model the impact on the Scottish economy of expenditures relating to marine energy installations. The results illustrate the potential for (considerable) 'legacy' effects after expenditures cease. In identifying the specific sectoral expenditures with the largest impact on (lifetime) regional employment, this approach offers important policy guidance.","[Gilmartin, Michelle] Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Allan, Grant] Univ Strathclyde, Fraser Allander Inst, Dept Econ, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Stirling; University of Glasgow; University of Strathclyde,"Gilmartin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",michelle.gilmartin@stir.ac.uk; grant.j.allan@strath.ac.uk,,"Allan, Grant/0000-0002-1404-2768",,,,,29,16,19,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Drought stress is one of the main abiotic stresses influencing turfgrass growth and quality. Tall fescue is the most suitable cool-season turfgrass for the Mediterranean region. This species has a better heat tolerance than perennial ryegrass and Kentucky bluegrass. The analysis of radiation reflected by turfgrass can supply precious information on drought stress and nutritional status. In this study a Linear Gradient Irrigation System (LGIS) was adopted on a Festuca arundinacea turf with 9 water replenishment levels and 2 nitrogen conditions, to evaluate the proximity sensed spectral reflectance. ET0 was estimated using the Hargreaves and Samani method. The following parameters were determined: turf quality, drought tolerance, pest problems, temperature of the surface, clippings weight and relative nitrogen content, turf growth and soil moisture. Spectral reflectance data were acquired using a LICOR 1800 spectroradiometer. Pearson correlation coefficients were studied among all parameters and vegetation indices. Nitrogen fertilization influenced significantly turf quality, clippings weight, nitrogen content and turf growth. Water replenishment influenced significantly all parameters except nitrogen content. Among all parameters the highest correlation coefficient was registered relating drought tolerance with turf quality (r = 0.88) and with surface temperature (r = -0.88). Among vegetation indices results showed that Water Index (WI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), are the most suitable to discriminate between different levels of water replenishment. Comparing WI with NDWI, the correlation coefficients were higher for Water Index in all the parameters, in particular the highest WI value was registered for drought tolerance (r = 0.91). This preliminary research demonstrates that spectral remote sensing can be a useful diagnostic tool to detect water stress in turfgrasses. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The panel data covers a large sample formed from 79 countries, divided in three categories depending on their income level - low, middle and high. The study regarded annual observations for a period of 31 years, from 1980 to 2010. The results have shown that the association between consumption and income is stronger in low and high income countries, compared with middle income countries. A small level of income determines its use especially for consumption and a high level of income increases consumption as there are more available resources to cover large investments as well. The relation between consumption, income and GDP is stronger for low and middle income countries, a logical conclusion since the high income countries allocate more capital to investments and are intense specialized in research and development activities.

Along with globalization, trading contracts, discounts in the applied tariffs and expanded trading networks have restored economics to a totalitarian structure. Favorable and unfavorable effects of this totalitarian structure, generated by rapidly expanding globalization, have revealed themselves in time. However, given the economic crises experienced in global economy during recent years, unfavorable and destructive effects of globalization are discussed a lot more. Hence, during the second quarter of 2007, the crisis, which started in the real estate market in USA and reflected in financial and real sectors, has folded into a global dimension and driven many EU countries to the brink of bankruptcy, particularly Greece, and this in turn has become the most prominent indication of destructive effects recently. Countries, especially USA, which experienced depression with the effect of the crisis, have been seeking solution for reinstating economic power in the centerline of protectionism. Indeed, a similar search was observed following 1929 Crisis and especially USA had increased protectionist measures following the crisis in its economy surrounded by high customs walls. These arrangements made in quota and tariffs in 1930s substantiate as interventions in the rate of exchange nowadays. Countries, which interfere in the rate of exchange and attempt to solve their economic problems by securing drop of their national currency against foreign currencies, influence exports of other countries and gain substantial power advantage. Thus, this war started years ago by China, one of the greatest economies in the world, was continued by USA due to 2008 Crisis and by Japan and China later on, and has carried the rate of exchange war appeal into the international agenda once again. However, USA, supporting the economy with dollars by purchasing bonds from the market starting in the first year the crisis emerged, announced a decrease in the bond program that was continued for five years by considering the improvement experienced in macroeconomic data by the end of 2013. Certainly this decrease would create unfavorable effects for economies struggling for financing the current deficit in developing countries specifically. Since the decrease in bond purchase would increase bond interests in USA, directing of capitals to USA market by foreign investors would affect countries unfavorably such as decrease in hot money flow in developing countries. In this study, the way the developed countries, for instance USA and Japan, referred to monetary expansion was scrutinized and the rate of exchange wars were examined, and negative effects of this policy on the economy of developing countries, especially in the economy of Turkey were studied, when decrease in monetary expansion was observed in USA in the macroeconomic data.

Unreliable rainfall has also limited seed production. Knowledge on water and nutrient use efficiencies in potato grown under different irrigation regimes with different nitrogen and phosphorus levels will help predict the best application rates for optimal seed potato production and yield. A study was conducted at Egerton University, Horticultural Research and Teaching Farm to determine the effect of integrated application of irrigation water, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) use efficiencies of water, N and P. In a split-split plot design, the irrigation water was applied to maintain soil water at 40, 65 and 100 % field capacity in the main plots, N (0, 75, 112.5 and 150 kg N/ha) to subplots and P (0, 115, 172.5 and 230 kg P2O5/ha), which translated into 0, 50.6, 75.9, 101.2 kg P/ha) to sub-subplots, with each treatment replicated three times and the trial repeated once. The irrigation water was applied throughout the potato growth period through drip tube lines, with N supplied as urea (46% N) in two splits, and P as triple superphosphate (46 % P2O5) at planting time. Data on seed potato yield was collected from each treatment at harvest and used to calculate water, N and P use efficiencies. High irrigation water at 100 % compared to 65 and 40 % rate resulted in relatively high N and P use efficiencies, but decreased water use efficiency. Application of intermediate to high N and P nutrient increased the water, N and P use efficiencies. It is recommended to apply low to intermediate irrigation water, intermediate to high N and P to increase their use efficiencies during seed potato production.","[Gathungu, Geofrey K.; Aguyoh, Joseph N.; Isutsa, Dorcas K.] Egerton Univ, Dept Crops Hort & Soils, POB 536-20115, Egerton, Njoro, Kenya; [Gathungu, Geofrey K.; Isutsa, Dorcas K.] Chuka Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Chuka, Kenya",Egerton University,"Gathungu, GK (通讯作者)，Egerton Univ, Dept Crops Hort & Soils, POB 536-20115, Egerton, Njoro, Kenya.",gkgathungu@yahoo.com,"Gathungu, Geofrey/HZH-6842-2023",,,,,,18,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-2010,,978-3-319-13000-2; 978-3-319-12999-0,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2015,,,,,,,171,183,,10.1007/978-3-319-13000-2_15,0.0,,,13,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BF2JL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380473000015,0

A phenomenon that occurs when individual's choice (as a direct indicator of individual's preferences) between two alternatives is inconsistent with the way an individual ranks selling price of these alternatives (where price serves as an indirect indicator of his preferences) becomes known as a preference reversals. This research aims to shed a new light on the respective subject by revealing potential differences among individuals' choice depending on their characteristics. In that manner the research provides an insight into individuals' preferences depending on their gender and household income.

Once again tourism has proved its resilience, with emerging markets playing a key role in its recovery. At the same time, the crisis has brought to the surface all weaknesses and showed an urge for innovation. Nowadays, consumers are more experienced, independent, better informed, relying more on word of mouth and social networks than on paid promotion. Additional value for money and unique experiences, have become more important than ever. This paper is pointing out these and some other trends in tourism, such as the increasing role of new tourism markets, modern technology, quality matters, etc. Despite its turbulent history and the fact that it is not a seaside destination, Serbia was one of the few countries which didn't report any negative results in international arrivals during the global economic crisis. Nevertheless, domestic tourism suffered and stakeholders need to implement some new strategies in order to stimulate domestic tourism and enhance the international one. A review of literature on tourism and the crisis, analyses of official data (mainly from UNWTO and tourism organizations), and field research conducted in Serbia on a stratified sample of 1005 interviewed citizens give an insight into the matter of the current situation in international tourism on the one hand and Serbian tourism on the other. The main conclusions are that stakeholders in tourism are now dealing with changed consumer behaviour. By improving service quality, adding value to tourism products, offering unique experiences and events, addressing new customer segments, focusing on the markets from the region and using modern technologies as a tool for promotion and communication better results could be achieved.

Avoiding the potential risk in its development process in a timely manner has certain significance on healthy and persistent development of the clusters and regional economy.

However, the efficacy of the PTC is hampered by repeated expirations and short-term extensions, and by the general uncertainty surrounding its future status. We examine the factors driving variation in public support for the extension of the PTC using a nationally representative, internet-based survey. Americans living near a coal-fired power plant are significantly more likely to support extending the PTC than are their peers who are more insulated from the externalities of burning coal. The evidence for this dynamic was strongest and most statistically significant among subjects experimentally primed to think about the adverse health effects of burning coal. Raising awareness of the public health ramifications of generating electricity from fossil fuels holds the potential to increase support for renewable energy policies among those living in proximity to coal plants, even in a highly politicized policy debate.

It aims to contribute to our understanding of how regime type and the quality of implementing institutions within political systems affect the prerequisites for successful electrification in SIDS. More specifically, we analyse the independent and interdependent effects of level of democracy and control of corruption on per capita household electricity consumption in SIDS, using data from 34 SIDS over the period 1996-2009. The results show that although the independent effects of level of democracy and control of corruption are sensitive to model specification, these two factors do have an interdependent impact on per capita household electricity consumption: democratization has positive effects on provision of electricity to the general population only when there is a certain level of corruption control in place. The results imply a) that it is important for policy actors to acknowledge the interaction between regime type and the quality of implementing institutions, and b) when planning electrification projects in SIDS, it is necessary to have information about the social and political context in order to design the most effective projects.

This is so, even though providing customers incentives to shape their power consumption patterns has substantial potential. This paper presents findings from an exploratory UK pilot study that trials financial payments and detailed energy feedback to incentivise load-shifting of residential electricity consumption. An intervention study was implemented measuring actual energy use by individual households as well as conducting surveys and interviews. From the trials it was found that the approaches resulted in reductions in peak time energy use. Evidence from the study found that the incentives-based approaches were able to overcome some of the barriers to response experienced in Time-of-Use studies, though less good on others. Interestingly, the height of the barriers varied by the electricity-using practice and the incentivising approach applied. The height of the barriers also varied by participant. The study concludes by identifying that broad participation in demand response is likely to require a suite of incentivising approaches that appeal to different people, a key policy finding of interest to international agencies, government, public and private sector entities.

These intermediaries combine a legal framework for establishing contracts with an organisational framework that facilitates contract negotiation and execution. This paper examines the nature and operation of these intermediaries in more detail, including their achievements to date and their similarities and differences. It uses ideas from transaction cost economics to develop a theoretical model of the contracting decision and shows how intermediary organisations can lower the transaction costs incurred by both clients and contractors, thereby increasing the viability of contracting.

In this paper, we examined to what extent the evaluations of these three attributes can also explain the actual adoption of smart energy systems that facilitate sustainable energy use. Results showed that adopters of smart energy systems (who agreed to participate in a project in which these systems were tested) evaluated the symbolic attributes of these systems more positively than non-adopters (who did not participate in this project), while both groups did not differ in their evaluation of the instrumental and environmental attributes of smart energy systems.

In these digital experiments, different units (people, devices, products) respond differently to the treatment. This article presents a fast and scalable Bayesian nonparametric analysis of such heterogenous treatment effects and their measurement in relation to observable covariates. New results and algorithms are provided for quantifying the uncertainty associated with treatment effect measurement via both linear projections and nonlinear regression trees (CART and random forests). For linear projections, our inference strategy leads to results that are mostly in agreement with those from the frequentist literature. We find that linear regression adjustment of treatment effect averages (i.e., post stratification) can provide some variance reduction, but that this reduction will be vanishingly. small in the low-signal and large-sample setting of digital experiments. For regression trees, we provide uncertainty quantification for the machine learning algorithms that are commonly applied in tree-fitting. We argue that practitioners should look to ensembles of trees (forests) rather than individual trees in their analysis.

These generation sources primarily include solar and wind which are growing rapidly and are new enough to the grid that the impact of high penetrations is not fully understood. The intrinsic nature of solar and wind power is very likely to present greater system challenges than conventional sources. Within limits, those challenges can be overcome, but at a cost. Later sections of the paper will draw on a variety of sources to identify a range of such costs, at least as they are foreseen by researchers helping prepare ambitious plans for grids to obtain high shares (30-50%) of their megawatt hours from primarily solar and wind generation.

Periods of high energy expenditure relative to GDP (from 1850 to 1945), or spikes (1973-74 and 1978-79) are associated with low economic growth rates, and periods of low or falling energy expenditure are associated with high and rising economic growth rates (e.g. 1945-1973). Over the period 1960-2010 for which we have continuous year-to-year data for control variables (capital formation, population, and unemployment rate) we estimate that, statistically, in order to enjoy positive growth, the US economy cannot afford to spend more than 11% of its GDP on energy. Given the current energy intensity of the US economy, this translates in a minimum societal EROI of approximately 11:1 (or a maximum tolerable average price of energy of twice the current level). Granger tests consistently reveal a one way causality running from the level of energy expenditure (as a fraction of GDP) to economic growth in the US between 1960 and 2010. A coherent economic policy should be founded on improving net energy efficiency. This would yield a double dividend: increased societal EROI (through decreased energy intensity of capital investment), and decreased sensitivity to energy price volatility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using location quotients (LQs) analysis and linking the production multipliers to their two digit NACE codes, this paper presents the first exploration of possible regional industrial specialization in related sectors in Ireland at the NUTS 2 level. Linking the production multipliers with NACE codes by region allows one to explore whether potential region specialization is associated with Jacobian externalities in Ireland. Using a relatively novel LQ approach, and a cut-off value of 1.25 or above as an indicator of industrial specialization and clustering, this paper found that in the Border, Midlands West (BMW) region and the South East region, 29 and 32 sectors respectively had LQ greater than the cut-off value of 1.25. In terms of Jacobian externalities, this paper found businesses in related sectors; particularly finance and insurance and transport and telecommunications are more likely to cluster in the BMW region. From a policy perspective this would indicate that there may be a role for the Regional Assemblies, particularly the Assembly for the BMW region to help develop and co-ordinate regional industrial policy in Ireland. From a regional science perspective, this paper adds empirical evidence to the literature on Jacobian and related variety in regional economies.","[Morrissey, Karyn] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Roxby Bldg, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Morrissey, K (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Roxby Bldg, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",karyn.morrissey@liv.ac.uk,"Morrissey, Karyn/HZK-6855-2023","Morrissey, Karyn/0000-0001-7259-1047",,,,,50,36,38,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

First, residential buildings should consume 80% less primary energy and second; the remaining energy demand should be covered primarily with renewables. This paper simulates the future German heating market under different policy scenarios in order to evaluate the impact and limits of recent and conceivable policies. The investigation is based upon a dual model approach, linking a residential heating model to a discrete choice model. The major finding is that current regulations are not suitable for the achievement of governmental targets. Scenario calculations show that additional carbon emission reductions, triggered by the current regulatory regime, are falling short of expectations. In terms of economic efficiency, all calculated policy alternatives outperform the regulation currently in place. This allows to draw the conclusion that carbon emission reductions can be achieved without a major increase in cost. The model results highlight two policy implications. First, a rising mandatory share of renewables in the heating market is needed for target achievement and can be cost effectively. Second, renewable obligations for heating systems must include the existing building stock to achieve the postulated political targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate infrastructure investment and trade in an imperfect market structure for various possible risks for both supply and demand. We focus on three possible scenarios in a stochastic global gas market model: (i) transit of Russian gas via Ukraine that may be disrupted from 2020 on; (ii) natural gas intensity of electricity generation in OECD countries that may lead to higher or lower natural gas demand after 2025; and (iii) availability of shale gas around the globe after 2030. We illustrate how the timing of investments is affected by inter-temporal hedging behavior of market agents, such as when LNG capacity provides ex-ante flexibility or an ex-post fallback option if domestic or nearby pipeline supply sources are low. Moreover, we find that investment in LNG capacities is more determined by demand side pull - due to higher needs in electric power generation - than by supply side push, e.g. higher shale gas supplies needing an outlet. We focus on Europe, North America, and China that are the world's most important gas consuming and supplying regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Skeptics contend that because efficiency lowers the price of energy and energy services, it may actually increase demand for them, causing total emissions to rise. While both sides of this debate have researched the magnitude of these so-called rebound effects among end-use consumers, researchers have paid less attention to the conditions under which direct rebounds cause CO2 emissions to rise among industrial producers. In particular, researchers have yet to explore how organizational and global factors might condition the effects of efficiency on emissions among power plants, the world's most concentrated sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Here we use a unique dataset containing nearly every fossil-fuel power plant in the world to determine whether the impact of efficiency on emissions varies by plants' age, size, and location in global economic and normative systems. Findings reveal that each of these factors has a significant interaction with efficiency and thus shapes environmentally destructive rebound effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We employ an-economic modeling approach to analyze two different network planning settings. In the first setting, there is no trade-off between transmission network development and generation dispatch, as is currently the case in Germany. A second setting alternatively allows for such a trade-off, and thus represents a welfare superior way of transmission network planning. Applications with the two model variants are carried out for the German electricity system in 2035. The results illustrate overinvestment in transmission capacity and decreased welfare associated with the Netzentwicklungsplan. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we conduct conditional demand analyses to break down total household electricity consumption into a set of demand functions for electricity usage, across 12 appliance categories. We then examine how the socioeconomic characteristics of the households explain their appliance usage. Analysis of micro-level data from the Nation Survey of Family and Expenditure in Japan reveals that the family and income structure of households affect appliance usage. Specifically, we find that the presence of teenagers increases both air conditioner and dishwasher use, labor income and nonlabor income affect microwave usage in different ways, air conditioner usage decreases as the wife's income increases, and microwave usage decreases as the husband's income increases. Furthermore, we find that households use more electricity with new personal computers than old ones; this implies that the replacement of old personal computers increases electricity consumption.

Evidence from German municipalities,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Servitization; Contracting; ESCo; LED; Lighting,PROCURING COMPLEX PERFORMANCE; SERVICE COMPANIES; PUBLIC PROCUREMENT; BUSINESS MODEL; INNOVATION; ESCO; GOVERNANCE; TRANSITION; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS,"Municipalities aiming at mitigating climate change by implementing new energy efficiency technologies face budgetary and capacity constraints. Outsourcing through energy service contracting could provide a solution. This paper reports results from a survey of 1298 municipalities concerning barriers to retrofitting public street lighting and the possible role of energy service contracting to overcome these barriers. Using a logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate determinants of opting for energy service contracts in the specific context of LED retrofits. Results point to an advantage of outsourcing in a financially and capacity-constrained environment, which corresponds with the main reasons for engaging in contracting: minimising investments and financial risks. However, municipalities often do not fully grasp the risks associated with retrofitting especially using a novel technology such as LED. In relation to that they underestimate the risk reduction potential of energy performance contracts (EPC). Previous experience with outsourcing increases the probability to engage in servitization although certain existing partnerships, particularly with utilities, prevent municipalities from considering energy performance contracts. Interestingly, engaging an energy consultant has a negative propensity to use energy service contracts, while pre-negotiated standardised contracts for energy performance contracts have a positive influence.

On the real estate market, it was expected that an energy label, rating the energy performance of a property based on a national energy performance certificate (EPC) might receive similar response. However, in Denmark no response to the energy performance rating was observed for 15 years. This was a surprise considering that Denmark was the first country to implement an A to G rating of the energy performance of buildings. A statistical examination of data on property sales prices and energy performance ratings was carried out. All relevant property transaction data from 2007 till 2012 were examined and they showed that energy performance ratings had an impact on property sales prices. However, before June 2010, the impact was modest, whereas after June 2010 the impact of energy performance ratings on property sales prices increased significantly as a result of an EU requirement to display the energy performance rating in connection with property sales. On this background, it was concluded that a public display of the energy performance rating is fundamental for market response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

PV utilization rates are highest when the thermal efficiencies of natural gas fired power plants are lowest, which reduces emissions of CO2 and CH4 by 0.3% relative to the annual average emission rate. There is a positive correlation between PV utilization rates and electricity prices, which raises the implied price of PV electricity by up to 10% relative to the annual average price, such that the average MWh reduces electricity prices by $0.26-$1.86 per MWh. These price reductions save Massachusetts rate-payers $184 million between 2010 and 2012. The current and net present values of these savings are greater than the cost of solar renewable energy credits which is the policy instrument that is used to accelerate the installation of PV capacity. Together, these results suggest that rooftop PV is an economically viable source of power in Massachusetts even though it has not reached socket parity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
