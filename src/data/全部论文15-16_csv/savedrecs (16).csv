It is puzzling that these firms use relatively less trade credit than their counterparts in developed countries. We argue that firms with more growth opportunities should rely mainly on internal financing owing to high asymmetric information, especially in a financial market environment biased towards state-owned enterprises (SOEs) such as China. To explore growth opportunities, these firms may reduce their level of trade credit in the trade-off they face in deciding where to invest. Using panel data of Chinese non-financial listed firms for the period 2003-2013, we find that the relationship between growth opportunities and trade credit (both accounts receivable and payable) is significantly negative and is more pronounced in private firms than in SOEs. Furthermore, we also find that subsequent to the new receivable pledge policy being introduced, Chinese firms with more growth opportunities have higher accounts receivable, but similar levels of accounts payable.","[Oh, Sekyung] Konkuk Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Woo Sung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Global Business & Technol, Yongin, South Korea",Konkuk University; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kim, WS (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Global Business & Technol, Yongin, South Korea.",ab1212@konkuk.ac.kr,,,Konkuk University,Konkuk University,This work was supported by Konkuk University in 2014.,,26,10,10,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The experience of incarceration incapacitates a criminal but can also expose a prisoner to more criminal peers and reduce future legal employment opportunities.

The intent is that by releasing Medicaid oversight to private organizations, competition will drive down healthcare expenditures so that savings may be passed to the state. Yet there are concerns that this competitive solution to cost savings might compromise safety-net hospitals. Managed care organizations cut costs by restricting the providers that enrollees are allowed to see. If movement in Medicaid patients disrupts safety-net hospitals' casemix, this could affect their ability to cross-subsidize care. This study estimates the impact of Medicaid managed care on safety-net hospitals by exploiting a Florida pilot program that required Medicaid recipients in five counties to enroll in managed care. The results suggest this mandate led to a small reduction in safety-net hospitals' average ratio of payment-to-cost. There is also some evidence that the effect on safety-net hospitals was disproportionate. This disproportionality was such that hospitals nearest the margin were pushed the furthest towards the edge.","[Woodworth, Lindsey] Univ South Carolina, Dept Econ, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Woodworth, L (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Dept Econ, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",lindsey.woodworth@moore.sc.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) through the Quality, Safety, and Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) Program [T32HS022236]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) through the Quality, Safety, and Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) Program","Thanks to Sarah Hamersma, Jonathan Hamilton and Ann Stevens for helpful comments, and Roger Blair and the Florida Center for Health Information and Policy Analysis for assistance in obtaining the data used in this study.

In addition to the pairwise analysis, this paper tests causality in a multivariate setting to take into account the effects of all variables by using a three-step multivariate filtering procedure. The paper also investigates the existence of nonlinear causal linkages of VAR/VECM filtered residuals to verify whether the observed causalities are strictly nonlinear and controls for conditional heteroskedasticity using a multivariate Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) GARCH model to test the hypothesis of nonlinear noncausality. Most of the nonlinear causal linkages were purged after multivariate GARCH filtering, a fact which indicates that volatility effects primarily induce nonlinear causality. Yet in some cases that nonlinear links pertained, possibly peripheral stock returns may exhibit statistically significant higher-order moments. Our results may be useful in explaining a significant part of the (non)predictability of peripheral stock markets but more importantly in quantifying the process of financial markets and banking integration in the Eurozone.

In a context of strong divergence in employment and working conditions among EU member states, migration can be seen as a way to increase employment opportunities but also to escape from poor working conditions at home.

We implement propensity score matching methods using data from the European Social Survey (2008) and indexes of employment vulnerability proposed by Bazillier et al. (2014). Overall, we show that migrants face the same level of employment vulnerability than natives, all other things being equal. But there are strong differences by skill-level.

A decision maker assesses a target group by overweighting its representative types, defined as the types that occur more frequently in that group than in a baseline reference group. Stereotypes formed this way contain a kernel of truth: they are rooted in true differences between groups. Because stereotypes focus on differences, they cause belief distortions, particularly when groups are similar. Stereotypes are also context dependent: beliefs about a group depend on the characteristics of the reference group. In line with our predictions, beliefs in the lab about abstract groups and beliefs in the field about political groups are context dependent and distorted in the direction of representative types.","[Bordalo, Pedro] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA; Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy; Harvard Univ, Innocenzo Gasparini Inst Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Oxford; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Harvard University; Bocconi University; Harvard University,"Bordalo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.",,,,Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior,Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior(Pershing Square Foundation),"We are grateful to Nick Barberis, Roland Benabou, Dan Benjamin, Tom Cunningham, Matthew Gentzkow, Emir Kamenica, Larry Katz, Eliana La Ferrara, David Laibson, Sendhil Mullainathan, Josh Schwartzstein, Jesse Shapiro, Alp Simsek, Neil Thakral, and four anonymous referees for extremely helpful comments and Jesse Graham, Jonathan Haidt, and Brian Nosek for sharing the Moral Foundations Questionnaire data.

Output, consumption and investment are assumed to respond to tax and spending changes in a nonlinear manner. Fiscal multipliers are time-varying because their size and sign depend upon the state of the economy (upturns and downturns). Keynesian effects appear essentially during downturns, while anti-Keynesian effects are observed during expansions. Transfer payments contributes to a higher private consumption when they are given to consumers in bad times. Reducing taxes boosts consumption in good times. Investment responds positively to lower taxes during downturns, but negatively in the upturn regime. Our results thus suggest that Keynesian effects have been associated to expansionary policies during recessions, while anti-Keynesian effects were observed during expansions illustrating situations of expansionary fiscal consolidation. The effectiveness of fiscal positive impulses increases in downturns relative to upturns. A corollary is therefore that austerity measures during recessions would have detrimental effects on the GDP and its components.","[Dufrenot, Gilles; Jambois, Aurelia; Jambois, Laurine; Khayat, Guillaume] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles; Jambois, Aurelia; Jambois, Laurine; Khayat, Guillaume] Aix Marseille Univ, EHESS, Marseille, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Univ, CEPII, Marseille, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles] Chateau Lafarge, Route Milles, F-13290 Aix En Provence, Les Milles, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Dufrénot, G (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France.;Dufrénot, G (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, EHESS, Marseille, France.;Dufrénot, G (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CEPII, Marseille, France.;Dufrénot, G (通讯作者)，Chateau Lafarge, Route Milles, F-13290 Aix En Provence, Les Milles, France.",Gilles.DUFRENOT@univ-amu.fr; aureliajambois@yahoo.fr; laurinejambois@yahoo.fr; khayat.ga@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

For the empirical analysis, linear error correction modeling framework is augmented to a threshold regression with further variables such as, an uncertainty measure and a reference portfolio in order to identify potential safe-have demand for housing in the UK. Moreover, region-specific equations allow the reference portfolio to be regime-dependent to capture asymmetric characteristics of safe-haven demand in times of higher uncertainty. As the reference portfolio of risky assets, this paper uses stock market performance in the UK relative to the region of interest. Moreover, a relative economic uncertainty index for the UK is added into regressions to count for economic uncertainty in both regions. This paper finds significant evidence for safe-haven demand for housing in London originating from the euro area and the US in times of higher uncertainty, whereas increasing stock wealth and improving economic circumstances drive the real estate investments from China and Russia.

The paper applies a forward recursive unit root tests and finds evidence of explosive behavior in the following periods: 1990/1991, 2005/2006, and 2007/2008. Currently existing oil price models are not capable of appropriately describing this type of behavior. A thorough discussion of the underlying reasons of these price hikes indicates these oil price episodes even though extreme are mainly fundamentally explained. This finding is insufficiently acknowledged in the literature on speculative oil price bubbles. Thus, policy interventions as response to extreme movements of this kind need to be very carefully thought through. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

That is a challenge since actual projects are often complex, featuring multiple sources of uncertainty as well as multiple investment and operating options. To meet the challenge, ROA has to take a clinical approach to project management and valuation, tailoring its framework to the specifics of each individual project to reflect its main sources of flexibility without becoming overly complex. This paper undertakes a ROA of an offshore oil development project of an integrated oil and gas company. The sequence and interconnections of available real options - exploration options, appraisal options, scaling options and abandonment options - as well as the calibration of the model's parameters, are developed in close collaboration with the Exploration and Production (E&P) division of the company, to assure realism and adherence to what management believes are the key sources of investment flexibility in a typical offshore project. The project assumes that there is joint uncertainty about reserve size and the price of oil. While the first source of uncertainty is resolved through exploration and appraisal activities the second is resolved through a diffusion model. The available real options add a substantial value to the project, with the option to abandon being the most valuable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By means of budget shares for these eight cultural services and a residual sector consisting of all other municipal services, we estimate a system of demand relations which are interdependently linked to each other by a budget restriction. Our analyses are based on data from 409 out of 429 Norwegian municipalities during the period 2002-2010. In the empirical analyses, we mainly focus on the effects of income variation for the cultural services. We estimate effects of free income, matching grants to each sector, and user fees and other sector-specific income for each sector. We also estimate crowding-out effects for the cultural sectors of demographic variables indicating higher demand for services such as education, childcare, and health services. Our results confirm previous results. There are interesting differences within the group of cultural services, and these are partly related to different levels of national standardisation and regulation among the cultural services.","[Hakonsen, Lars; Loyland, Knut] Telemark Res Inst, N-3800 Telemark, Bo, Norway; [Hakonsen, Lars] Telemark Univ Coll, N-3800 Telemark, Bo, Norway",Telemarksforsking; University College of Southeast Norway,"Loyland, K (通讯作者)，Telemark Res Inst, N-3800 Telemark, Bo, Norway.",lars.hakonsen@hit.no; loyland@tmforsk.no,,,,,,,36,8,8,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The seller prefers to conserve if the buyer is expected to buy, but the buyer is unwilling to pay as long as the seller conserves. This contradiction implies that the market for conservation cannot be efficient and conservation is likely to fail. A leasing market is inefficient for similar reasons and dominates the sales market if and only if the consumption value and the buyer's protection cost are large. The theory thus explains why optimal conservation often fails and why conservation abroad is leased, while domestic conservation is bought. (C) 2016 The Author.

Results indicate that coal-fired electric plants operating in deregulated electricity markets negotiate prices that are 6.1 C/MMBtu (3.5%) less than their regulated counterparts.

The emission rate of the polluting sector depends on its relative use of a clean and a dirty input. A unilateral policy combining clean research subsidies and a trade tax can ensure sustainable growth, while unilateral carbon taxes alone increase innovation in the polluting sector abroad and generally cannot ensure sustainable growth. Relative to autarky and exogenous technical change respectively, trade and directed technical change accelerate environmental degradation either under laissez-faire or with unilateral carbon taxes, yet both help reduce environmental degradation under the appropriate unilateral policy.

This paper estimates the expected poverty and distributional effects of a significant natural gas tariff reform in the context of Armenia that increased the country's residential tariff by about 40%. It is the first paper in the literature on energy tariff reforms to simultaneously try and control for substitution between all major energy sources (not just some), to take into account the seasonality of consumption over the full annual cycle, and to apply different methods to assess changes in household consumption on natural gas and shifts in natural gas between main and supplementary heating sources. Existing papers thus generally overestimate the potential effects of energy price increases on household welfare. The results here which face, like any statistical study, a set of important methodological constraints suggest nonetheless that this significant tariff increase led to an estimated 8% of households shifting away from gas, mainly towards wood, as their heating source. It consequently resulted in an estimated 2.8% of households falling below the national poverty line, while likely also influencing non-monetary human welfare that cannot be well captured econometrically. Finally, methodological assumptions and limitations in assessing these relationships, as well as potential policy implications are outlined. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To answer this question our article considers the effect of ER level, volatility and expectation on the Chinese outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) activities in 119 countries for a period of 2003-2013. We find striking evidence that Chinese Renminbi appreciation has a negative impact on Chinese outward FDI flows, and both higher ER volatility and expected depreciation encourage Chinese outward FDI flows. We introduce two complementary effects that explain these findings: repatriation effect and mercantilist effect. In view of the recent debate about the growing importance of Chinese Renminbi in the international transactions we believe that our research results shed light on the possible impact of ER policies on Chinese MNCs behaviour and global FDI distribution.","[Liu, Hai Yue] Sichuan Univ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Deseatnicov, Ivan] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan",Sichuan University; Hitotsubashi University,"Deseatnicov, I (通讯作者)，2-1 Naka, Tokyo, Japan.",ivan@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,"fang, li/JNS-8415-2023; Deseatnicov, Ivan/AAA-3291-2020; N, A/JUF-6197-2023","Deseatnicov, Ivan/0000-0001-6672-4886","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71072066, 71302183]; Social Science Fund of China's Education department [14YJC790053]; High-level Young Scholars Team-Building Fund of Sichuan University [SKGT20130]; Distinguished Young Scholars Fund of Sichuan University [SKJC201007, SKYB201402]; Sichuan Provincial Social Science Fund [SC14C054]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15F15009] Funding Source: KAKEN","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Fund of China's Education department; High-level Young Scholars Team-Building Fund of Sichuan University; Distinguished Young Scholars Fund of Sichuan University; Sichuan Provincial Social Science Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71072066, 71302183; the Social Science Fund of China's Education department under Grant 14YJC790053; the High-level Young Scholars Team-Building Fund of Sichuan University under Grant SKGT20130; the Distinguished Young Scholars Fund of Sichuan University under Grant SKJC201007, SKYB201402; and the Sichuan Provincial Social Science Fund under Grant SC14C054.

Heterogeneity misaligns equity bids' face values, monetary values, and bidder types, making the seller's revenues sensitive to the auction design. Given heterogeneity, I identify the mechanism that maximizes the expected revenue among all incentive-compatible mechanisms of equity auctions. I show how different sources of heterogeneity alter the optimal design, revenues, and allocational efficiency. Unlike optimal cash auctions (Myerson, 1981), where bidders' standalone values are irrelevant, the allocation of optimal equity auctions favors bidders with lower standalone values, because the seller can extract a larger proportion of their rents. By contrast, when bidders differ only in valuation distributions, optimal equity auctions feature more efficient allocations than optimal cash auctions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using data for over 100 countries over 2007-2012, the results indicate that, consistent with previous studies for trade, foreign direct and portfolio investment variables such as size and distance have significant effects on foreign real estate investment flows. Large positive size effects are consistent with a combination of scale economies and information externalities producing investment concentration across markets and in conjunction with direct and indirect transaction costs specific to real estate markets.

In the framework, forward-looking patients do not simply maximize underlying health or longevity. Rather, they choose labor supply and medicine in light of potential side effects in an effort to jointly manage two forms of human capital: their health and their work experience. I use the framework to examine the treatment and employment decisions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive men before and after a medical breakthrough known as highly active anti-retroviral treatment. A novelty of this application is my use of data containing both objective health measures along with reports of physical ailments. This allows me to model each HIV drug along two dimensions of quality-effectiveness and side effects. Using the framework, I am able to identify the impact of side effects on demand and show that counterfactual innovations that reduce side effects can be very valuable. I also show that when no treatment dominates along both dimensions of drug quality, patients exhibit health-state-dependent cyclicality in their medical treatment decisions, favoring effective treatments despite side effects when in poor health, but switching to less effective drugs with fewer side effects (or avoiding treatment altogether) when their health improves.","[Papageorge, Nicholas W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Papageorge, NW (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",papageorge@jhu.edu,,,,,,,46,12,17,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

These models make use of linear regressions models to provide this information. In particular, interest lies with the intercept parameter of these models and whether it is time varying. In applications to mutual fund performance, time varying alpha indicates a change in manager's stock selecting abilities. In applications to regulation of financial markets, time-varying alpha indicates potential changes to equity returns based on undisclosed information. These are importance concerns and emphasize the need to have accurate methods to disentangle changes in intercept from slope in these models. Here, a novel bivariate statistic is developed that can be used for this purpose. It has many attractive features. For example, the use of weight functions improves its power for discrete changes in intercept/slope that occur late/early in the sample, allows intercept/slope to change at different dates, allows for control of global error rates; and avoids trimming.

To this end, we employ a novel non-parametric causality-in-quantile approach that captures non-linearities in returns distribution. Based on our findings we conclude that the aggregate economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indicator and some components have predictive ability for real returns of the U.S. sustainable investments index. Moreover, if we split our sample to before and after the global financial crisis our results suggest that predictors carry causal information for real returns only in the after-crisis period. Finally, some marginal evidence of predictability from sovereign debt is also observed at the lower and upper ends of the conditional distribution of the real returns of sustainable investments.

Previous studies have focused on satisfaction differences between parents and ex post similar childless adults or between pre- and post-birth years of mothers. Mostly small and often negative effects of parenthood are reported. Both comparisons are problematic if life satisfaction increases before giving birth; that is, if dynamic self-selection into parenthood exists. In this study we exploit the extended longitudinal dimension of the panel to track self-reported life satisfaction of women eventually to become mothers and of women eventually attaining a completed fertility of zero. In our estimations we employ matching and regression techniques which account for the selection into motherhood. We find motherhood to be associated with positive satisfaction gains occurring over several years. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Murmann and Homburg (J Evol Econ 11(2):177-205, 2001) and Murmann (2003) argued that German firms came to dominate the global industry because of (1) the high initial number of chemists in Germany at the start of the industry in 1857, (2) the high responsiveness of the German university system and (3) the late (1877) introduction of a patent regime in Germany as well as the more narrow construction of this regime compared to Britain, France and the U.S. We test the validity of these three potential explanations with the help of simulation experiments.

The timing-of-events approach is applied to distinguish between the selection and causal effects of sanctioning. The results imply that the effect of sanctions differs according to the benefits received. Sanctions encourage unemployed individuals receiving flat-rate labour market support (LMS) to find jobs, whereas unemployed individuals receiving earnings-related (UI) allowances to leave the labour force. The encouraging effect of sanctions on active labour market policy programmes is relatively small and statistically significant only among LMS recipients. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The partial misalignment between the profit objectives within a partially integrated manufacturer retailer hierarchy implies a higher retail price than under full integration. This 'information vertical effect' translates into a 'competition horizontal effect': the partially integrated hierarchy's commitment to a higher price induces the competitor to increase its price, which strategically relaxes competition.

The parties' proposals depend on their membership, while the membership depends both on the proposals of the parties and on the unobserved idiosyncratic preferences of citizens over parties. An equilibrium of the model obtains when the members of each party prefer the proposal of the party to which they belong to, rather than the proposal of the other party. We prove the existence of such an equilibrium and study its qualitative properties. For the cases in which parties use either the average or the median to aggregate the preferences of their members, we show that if the unobserved idiosyncratic characteristics of the parties are similar, then parties make different proposals in the stable equilibria. Conversely, we argue that if parties differ substantially in their unobserved idiosyncratic characteristics, then the unique equilibrium is convergent.","[Gomberg, Andrei M.] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Ctr Invest Econ, Ave Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Marhuenda, Francisco; Ortuno-Ortin, Ignacio] Univ Carlos III, Dept Econ, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Gomberg, AM (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Ctr Invest Econ, Ave Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",gomberg@itam.mx; marhuend@eco.uc3m.es; iortuno@eco.uc3m.es,"Marhuenda, Francisco/AAA-5238-2019; ORTUNO, IGNACIO ISIDRO/Y-5541-2018","Marhuenda, Francisco/0000-0002-6336-7518; ORTUNO, IGNACIO ISIDRO/0000-0001-6721-5901",Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2013-42710-P],Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"We thank G.

Stanley",,,"Confounded, augmented and constrained replicator dynamics",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Replicator dynamics; Economic selection; Price's equation; Multi-trait selection; Statistics of evolution,PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH,"The quantitative methodology derived from replicator dynamics for empirical studies of economic evolution is becoming increasingly well developed in theory but is rarely applied in practice. One reason is the relatively na < ve nature of current methods, which focus on the evolution of a single characteristic in a single environment. This assumption constrains the analysis of real selection processes in which firms operate in several markets and their products have several characteristics that interact to determine fitness. This entails that measurement of economic selection becomes confounded: characteristics that are associated with firm growth are not becoming more frequent in the population. The reason for confounded selection is that characteristics interact to augment or constrain the rate and direction of evolution and one-dimensional, single trait replicator dynamics cannot cope with confounded selection. The contribution of this paper is to develop an approach that serves to explicitly analyse confounded selection. The primary elements of the method are the selection gradients of the characteristics and the covariance matrix of the characteristics.

This article extends their analysis by checking the interaction of statutory tax rates with countries' external public debt. In general, we found that the value added tax rates are changed procyclically in both developed and developing countries (i.e. taxes are raised in bad times and reduced in good times). However, when the external debt is high, in the developing countries the procyclicality increases, while the opposite result holds for developed economies. This pattern occurs mainly in times of recession, when the need for loans is the highest. Although we found that there was a reduction in procyclicality after the 2000s, these findings pose a challenge to policy-makers, who should think of ways of dealing with lack of foreign funds in difficult times.","[Srebrnik, Noa; Strawczynski, Michel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federman Sch Publ Policy, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Strawczynski, M (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federman Sch Publ Policy, Jerusalem, Israel.",Michel.strawczynski@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Strawczynski, Michel/0000-0002-9928-2620",Diego Ladowski Scholarships Fund,Diego Ladowski Scholarships Fund,Noa Srebrnik is thankful to Diego Ladowski Scholarships Fund for financial support.,,24,7,8,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Linking this analysis to the Tobin tax debate, we provide the first empirical corroboration that such a tax may be effective in limiting speculation and reducing exchange rate volatility, especially in turbulent times. Our study points to two main results. First, we show that nonlinearities should be taken into account to explain the MDH. When volatility, spreads, and volume are simultaneously high, the relationship between trading volume and volatility tends to grow stronger and thus the MDH holds in turbulent periods. Second, on the assumption of constant trading volume elasticity, a Tobin tax would have been stabilizing and effective in the 2008 crisis.","[Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Damette, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Fac Droit & Sci Econ, 13 Pl Carnot, F-54035 Nancy, France.;Damette, O (通讯作者)，LEF INRA, 13 Pl Carnot, F-54035 Nancy, France.",olivier.damette@univ-lorraine.fr,,"Damette, Olivier/0000-0002-7520-3780",BETA-CNRS [UMR7522]; ERUDITE,BETA-CNRS; ERUDITE,"I would like to thank G.

We construct a new database on the European share of the population during colonization and examine its association with economic development today. We find a strong, positive relation between current income per capita and colonial European settlement that is robust to controlling for the current proportion of the population of European descent, as well as many other country characteristics. The results suggest that any adverse effects of extractive institutions associated with small European settlements were, even at low levels of colonial European settlement, more than offset by other things that Europeans brought, such as human capital and technology.","[Easterly, William] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Easterly, William; Levine, Ross] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Levine, Ross] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Easterly, W (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Easterly, W (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",william.easterly@nyu.edu,,,,,,,34,99,107,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

In the northern zone, continuous increases in capacity with low variable costs cause large regional supply surpluses in the market dispatch, while in the southern zone conventional capacity decreases. As the spatial imbalance of supply and load is increasing, the current single bidding area more often results in technically infeasible market results, requiring curative congestion management measures. There is an ongoing discussion about the potential effects of introducing bidding zones in Germany. This paper applies an electricity sector model with network representation to analyze the system implications and the distributional effects of two bidding zones in the German electricity system in 2012 and 2015. Results show a modest decrease in cross-zonal re-dispatch levels, particularly in 2015. However, overall network congestion and re-dispatch levels increase in 2015 and also remain on, a high level for two bidding zones. Results are very sensitive to more than two bidding zones and additional line investments, illustrating the challenge to define stable price zones in a dynamic setting. With two bidding areas, prices in the model results increase in the southern zone and decrease in the northern zone. The average price deviation grows from 0.4EUR/MWh in 2012 to 1.7EUR/MWh in 2015, with absolute values being significantly higher in hours when price differences occur. Stakeholders within zones are exposed to the price deviations to a different extent. Distributional effects are surprisingly small compared to the wholesale price or different network charges.

The additional education generated by schooling expansions on the Continent did not lead to a decrease in the number of biological children nor to an increase in childlessness.

To answer this question we build a general equilibrium overlapping generations model of a closed economy featuring endogenous factor prices. Finitely-lived individuals are endowed with perfect foresight and make optimal choices over the life cycle. In addition to selecting age profiles for consumption and the hours of time supplied to the labour market, they also choose their schooling level and retirement age. Human capital is accumulated as a result of work experience, the extent of which is determined by the intensity of labour supply. As the agent gets older, biological deterioration sets in and human capital depreciates at an increasing rate. This ultimately prompts the agent to withdraw from the labour market. The microeconomic and macroeconomic effects of three ageing shocks are studied, namely an increase in the length of biological life (biological longevity boost), an increase in both biological and productive life span (comprehensive longevity boost), and a decrease in the net birth rate (baby bust). Robustness checks are performed by allowing for capital market imperfections and indivisibility of labour supply.","[Heijdra, Ben J.; Reijnders, Laurie S.

This paper characterizes all symmetric Markov-perfect equilibria of penny auctions and studies penny auctions' properties.

In a first step, we contrast the monetary-fiscal narrative for Germany, the U.S., and Italy with evidence obtained from simple regression models and a time-varying VAR. We find that the low-frequency relationship between the fiscal stance and inflation is low during periods of an independent central bank and responsible fiscal policy and more pronounced in times of non-responsible fiscal policy and accommodative monetary authorities. In a second step, we use an estimated DSGE model to interpret the low-frequency measure structurally and to illustrate the mechanisms through which fiscal actions affect inflation in the long run. The findings from the DSGE model suggest that switches in the monetary-fiscal policy interaction and accompanying variations in the propagation of structural shocks can well account for changes in the low-frequency relationship between the fiscal stance and inflation.

Firms can improve productivity by engaging in in-house research and developmenmt (R&D) or, alternatively, by trying to imitate other firms' technologies, subject to the limits of their absorptive capacities. The outcome of both strategies is stochastic. The choice between in-house R&D and imitation is endogenous, and is based on firms' profit maximization motive. Firms closer to the technological frontier face fewer imitation opportunities, and choose in-house R&D, while firms farther from the frontier try to imitate more productive technologies. The resulting balanced-growth equilibrium features persistent productivity differences even when starting from ex ante identical firms. The long-run productivity distribution can be described as a traveling wave with tails following a Pareto distribution as can be observed in the empirical data.","[Koenig, Michael D.; Zilibotti, Fabrizio] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lorenz, Jan] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Psychol & Methods, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",University of Zurich; Jacobs University,"König, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.koenig@econ.uzh.ch; post@janlo.de; fabrizio.zilibotti@econ.uzh.ch,"Koenig, Michael/IVH-5609-2023; Lorenz, Jan/D-1806-2010","Lorenz, Jan/0000-0002-5547-7848","Swiss National Science Foundation [PBEZP1-131169, 100018_140266]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PBEZP1-131169, 100018_140266] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank a co-editor, three anonymous referees, Chad Jones, Pete Klenow, Daron Acemoglu, and seminar participants at Stanford University, University of Zurich, the Annual Conference of the Association for Public Economic Theory in Bloomington, 2011, and the Annual Conference of the European Economic Association in Oslo, 2011 for helpful comments.

Six major determining types of entrepreneurs' characteristics were identified from the innovation and the growth literature: education, work experience, gender, motivations, nationality and age. The empirical results which are based on t-tests of the differences between upgraders and non-upgraders, the linear probability model and the logit model, all suggest that work experience and motivations are cornerstones in the likelihood that an MSE will upgrade.

After a relatively brief interlude of jitters, however, equity markets recovered and interbank stains were avoided (albeit with central bank support). The main durable financial market effect has been a substantial depreciation of the pound sterling. At the same time, economic signals from the U.K. economy have been mixed, with fairly robust consumer spending and exports sustaining the economy so far. The shape of the ultimate terms of trade between Britain and its former EU partners remains unclear, however, and the uncertainty seems likely to weigh on future investment and hiring. It is unlikely that substantial U.K. control over the free movement of EU persons across its borders a main objective of the pro-Brexit campaign will prove compatible with anything near full access to the Single Market. Moreover, any eventual loss of access to the Single Market, including for financial services, will very likely reduce the United Kingdom's steady-state income.","[Obstfeld, Maurice] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Obstfeld, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,0,2,3,0,13,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Demand and total factor productivity (TFP) shocks are equally important in shaping firm growth. However, the pass-through of shocks to growth is highly incomplete, more so for productivity shocks. We argue that incompleteness and asymmetry of the pass-through can be explained by frictions that, unlike those studied by the literature on factor misallocation, have differential effects according to the nature of the shock. We propose hurdles to firms' ability to reorganize as an example of these types of frictions.","[Pozzi, Andrea; Schivardi, Fabiano] Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy; [Pozzi, Andrea; Schivardi, Fabiano] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Schivardi, Fabiano] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy; [Schivardi, Fabiano] IGIER, Milan, Italy",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Pozzi, A (通讯作者)，Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy.;Pozzi, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.",andrea.pozzi@eief.it; fabiano.schivardi@unibocconi.it,,"SCHIVARDI, FABIANO/0000-0001-7708-1011",,,,,43,34,40,2,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Within the population of our economic system we distinguish two different social classes which differ for their level and quality of education and, as a consequence, for their human capital, wages and income per head. We vary the investment in education as a share of total investment, the share of investment in education allocated to each social class, and the quality of education each class receives. We show that while education can exert a positive effect on social mobility by increasing the population share of the upper social class it also leads to a tradeoff between income inequality and the rate of growth of income.

Under euroisation, the ECB's monetary policy has been acyclical in relation to Montenegrin inflation and significantly countercyclical in relation to the growth of production in the country. A comparison with Serbia does not suggest that an independent monetary policy would have improved cyclical stabilisation in Montenegro.

In this setting, government support for cooperative and public mills allows meaningful variation in ownership structure to be observed, while the command area zoning system - whereby mills are given monopsony power to operate within an assigned area - helps tackle the identification challenge. The borders of command areas allow for a geographic regression discontinuity design, where underlying soil, weather, and institutional characteristics are exactly the same but ownership structure changes across boundaries. Using satellite images overlaid on digital maps to measure sugarcane grown along the borders, as well as a survey to determine the effects of crop choices on farmer welfare, I find that private mills encourage sugarcane production. Greater cane cultivation is tied to better credit provided by private mills, and it results in higher income and consumption for farmers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the effects of the Bush tax cuts on U.S. investment using intervention analysis in conjunction with regression analysis that controls for relevant variables. Although intervention analysis has the advantage of allowing the behavior of investment to be influenced only by the time path of exogenous shocks such as tax reforms, control variables can test for the robustness of the results. We have found that the two tax reforms enacted in 2001 and 2003 had little impact on marginal investment incentives. The intervention analysis results are further reinforced by the evidence provided by alternative regression models that control for a host of variables. The failure of the tax reforms to stimulate investment spending may be attributable to several factors, such as a global savings glut, cheap global money, inappropriate designs for tax incentives, and budget deficits.","[Yuhn, Ky-Hyang; Bennett, Christopher S.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Yuhn, KH (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",yuhn@fau.edu,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Multivariate analysis using different estimation techniques suggests that parents are significantly more risk-averse when deciding for their child than for themselves. Higher risk aversion is linked to characteristics of parents, not of children. Mood and gender of the deciding parent play a key role.

We study a skill-biased dynamic general equilibrium R&D growth model in which the standard R&D technology is modified so wage inequality results from the direction of the technological knowledge, which in turn is induced by the price channel. By solving the transitional dynamics numerically, we show that the rise of the skill premium arises from the price-channel effect, complemented with a mechanism that reflects the impact of immigration on R&D. According to our quantitative results, our model is able to account for a significant proportion of the dynamics of the skill premium in the data for a number of European countries, thus, suggesting that differences in labour skills between immigrants and natives are, in practice, an important source of skill premium variation over time.","[Afonso, Oscar; Gabriel, Susana; Gil, Pedro Mazeda] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, R Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Afonso, Oscar; Gabriel, Susana; Gil, Pedro Mazeda] Univ Porto, CEF UP, R Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Gabriel, Susana] Univ Portucalense Infante D Henrique, Rua Dr Antonio Bernardino de Almeida 541, P-4200072 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade Portucalense Infante D.

We show that the combination of disaggregation into specific fuels and time variation gives more nuanced results than the alternatives for the USA. Specifically, we find that the Granger causal relationship between total energy and real US GDP is bi-directional through much of the 1990s, but unidirectional running from real US GDP to energy consumption in the 2000s. As for each fuel, similar patterns of change were observed in the causal relationship between coal consumption and real US GDP. Oil consumption largely shows a bi-directional relationship between consumption and US GDP, especially after 2009. And natural gas consumption shows a brief period in the early-to-mid 2000s where US GDP predicts energy consumption, but primarily shows that natural gas consumption and economic growth are independent.","[Arora, Vipin] US Energy Informat Adm, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC USA; [Shi, Shuping] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Shi, Shuping] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Macquarie University; Australian National University,"Shi, SP (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Shi, SP (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",shuping.shi@mq.edu.au,,"Shi, Shuping/0000-0001-8571-3066",,,,,29,44,45,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To understand these findings, we develop a two-sector matching model where firms endogenously choose between a safe technology and a risky technology. For firms that have chosen the risky technology, EPL raises the costs of shedding workers in case they receive a low productivity draw. According to our calibrated model, high-EPL countries benefit less from the arrival of new risky technologies than low-EPL countries. Parameters estimated through reduced-form regressions of employment and productivity on exit costs, riskiness, and in particular their interaction are qualitatively similar for actual cross-country data and simulated model data.

We conduct a nearly 50-year follow-up of an episode in which such constraints would have been plausibly relaxed by a random allocation of substantial wealth to families. We track descendants of participants in Georgia's Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832, in which nearly every adult white male in the state took part. Winners received close to the median level of wealth-a large financial windfall orthogonal to participants' underlying characteristics that might have also affected their children's human capital. Although winners had slightly more children than did nonwinners, they did not send them to school more. Sons of winners have no better adult outcomes (wealth, income, literacy) than the sons of nonwinners, and winners' grandchildren do not have higher literacy or school attendance than nonwinners' grandchildren. We can reject effects implied by the cross-sectional gradient of child outcomes by paternal wealth. This suggests only a limited role for family financial resources in the formation of human capital in the next generations in this environment and a potentially more important role for other factors that persist through family lines.","[Bleakley, Hoyt] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bleakley, Hoyt; Ferrie, Joseph] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University,"Bleakley, H (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Bleakley, H (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Ferrie, Joseph/N-9544-2014","Ferrie, Joseph/0000-0002-7261-3610",Center on Aging under NIH at the University of Chicago [P30 AG012857]; Center for Population Economics under NIH at the University of Chicago [P01 AG010120]; Stigler Center at the University of Chicago; Dean's Office of the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago,Center on Aging under NIH at the University of Chicago; Center for Population Economics under NIH at the University of Chicago; Stigler Center at the University of Chicago; Dean's Office of the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago,"For comments on early versions, we thank Lou Cain, Greg Clark, Robert Pollack, Chris Roudiez, Rachel Soloveichik, and seminar and conference participants at the NBER Cohort Studies meeting, the Stanford SITE meeting, the University of Washington, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, and the Minnesota Population Center.

Because most empirical research ignores these non-responses, the conventional wisdom on the determinants of support for economic reform ignores large groups of silent citizens. To correct this problem, we present a stylized model that accounts for support, opposition, indifference, and unawareness about reform. We argue that informed people and those who perceive the status quo as dysfunctional will form an opinion more readily than others. For evidence, we examine public opinion about electricity privatization from a large field survey in rural India. We find that information and perceived inefficiency have much larger effects on the likelihood of forming an opinion than on the direction of that opinion (yes or no), emphasizing the importance of accounting for opinion formation process. In this case, information and perceived inefficiency make reform a salient issue to a passive public, most of whom become vocal opponents of reform.","[Cheng, Chao-yo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, 420 West 118th St,712 Int Affairs Bldg, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, 420 West 118th St,712 Int Affairs Bldg, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,"Cheng, Chao-yo/0000-0002-4488-2450",,,,,53,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The objective of this study was to determine the land area requirements, biomass transportation distance, and expected profit consequences of restricting switchgrass biomass production, for use as biofuel feedstock, to marginal land relative to unrestricted land use. The USA soils capability classification system was used to differentiate between high quality land andland of marginal quality. Fifty years of historical weather data were used in combination with a biophysical-simulation model to estimate switchgrass biomass yield distributions for land of different quality for counties in the case study region. A mathematical programming model was designed and solved to determine the economic consequences.

Employing a Bayesian dynamic latent factor model, I decompose local credit reallocation rates into national, region-specific, and idiosyncratic allocation components. This paper uncovers evidence that the national factor, which explains the movement of credit reallocation across 14 administrative districts, intensified after the 1997 financial crisis and played a major role in driving local credit reallocation rates. Furthermore, district-specific factors, which exhibit heterogeneous patterns across districts, also account for a significant portion of credit reallocation fluctuations, which is attributable to districts' heterogeneous geographical properties and dominant industries. Importantly, district-specific factors are the main driver for reallocation dynamics for small firms, suggesting that small firms' financing is more affected by local financial market conditions, whereas the national factor explains more of large firms' debt financing.

Under the assumption that multinational firms use some measure of internal loans to finance foreign investment, we find that the optimal corporate tax rate is positive from the perspective of a small, open economy. This finding contrasts the standard result that the optimal-source-based capital tax is zero. Intuitively, when multinational firms finance investment in one country with loans from affiliates in another country, the burden of the corporate taxes levied in the latter country partly falls on investment and thus workers in the former country. This tax exporting mechanism introduces a scope for corporate taxes, which is not present in standard models of international taxation. Accounting for the internal capital markets of multinational firms thus helps resolve the tension between standard theory predicting zero capital taxes and the casual observation that countries tend to employ corporate taxes at fairly high rates.","[Johannesen, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Johannesen, N (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",niels.johannesen@econ.ku.dk,,"johannesen, niels/0000-0002-7850-2794",Danish Council for Independent Research,Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),I would like to thank Peter Birch Sorensen and Marko Koethenbuerger for valuable comments and suggestions.

Two theoretical mechanisms are studied: (1) social comparisons, which are hypothesized to increase conflict due to self-serving biases, and (2) rational learning, which is hypothesized to decrease conflict by reducing information asymmetries. Our experimental design allows for an interactive bargaining process and offers full control over the information available to negotiators. Consistent with studies of one-shot games, we find that spillovers resulting from social comparisons increase conflict; however, the bargaining process mitigates this effect.

We build a parsimonious game-theoretic model and analyse simultaneous entry of firms. The effect of differentiation is modelled as an additional cost incurred by both firms based on the degree of differentiation between the firms. The cost of positioning is modelled as a market level cost affecting both firms whereby firms incur a cost if they want to position themselves away from the centre of distribution of consumers. Our analysis provides some surprising results, explains some conflicting empirical observations documented in previous research and may also be useful for further empirical research in this area by providing sharper predictions about the impact of various types of costs on market outcomes. For example, we find that if the cost of positioning is sufficiently high, then a firm with lower cost of differentiation charges a higher price in equilibrium, even when no differences in exogenous costs exist. We also find that under some circumstances the cost disadvantaged firm can enjoy higher price-cost margins compared to the cost leader thereby suggesting that higher costs could be a blessing in disguise.","[Sajeesh, S.] CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Sajeesh, S (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10010 USA.",s.sajeesh@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Results of a series of tests show that corruption levels in both sides of the trade partnership reinforce the (positive) association between tariff rates and value and quantity gaps.

We use survey and interview data from a mixed-methods study of the employment intentions of Australian women working in aged care to investigate links between recognition, wage rates and intentions to remain working in the sector. Our findings suggest that low wages convey misrecognition and that both wages and misrecognition have adverse implications for the future labour supply of aged care workers.

Contrary to that intuition, one observes a broad range of group norms in the real world that impose large costs on group members. Iannaccone provides a rationale for harsh norms as a mechanism to reduce free-riding in supplying a club good. This paper proposes a new rationalization for harsh group norms as a mechanism under which harsh norms serve to screen out disloyal members, providing what is essentially a technology for measuring loyalty in environments where group leaders cannot reliably measure group members' loyalty. The model demonstrates that loyalty can be signalled through acts that are seemingly irrelevant to the group's core objectives and identity.","[Berg, Nathan] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Otago; Kyung Hee University,"Kim, JY (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",jyookim@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We find that revealing group size decreases bids, and therefore revenue, if units remaining are not shown. When group size is unknown the price also falls if the number of units remaining is revealed. The most efficient and largest revenue outcome occurs when bidders are not provided information on either group size or units remaining.

This rendition misses a vital capability that Marx articulates: labour as a potential to produce surplus. Accordingly, following Marx, I define labour as the ability, freedom and willingness to produce more than what labourers deem necessary to sustain themselves. I argue each has this capability and should willingly realise it in accordance with their ability. With this definition, additional questions arise as to who should appropriate the surplus or receive a portion of it. I contend that each, irrespective of their role in production, should have the capability to appropriate surplus, just as each should have the capability to claim and receive a portion of the surplus according to their needs. I finish by showing the prevalent normative framework of the capitalist economy, 'equal rights and equal exchange', is nothing other than exclusive rights (capabilities) and unequal exchange, which results in exploitation, now defined as a violation of capabilities equality. By contrast, I call for a non-exclusive, 'radical equality' A la Sen: no one is excluded from participating in or having access to any moment of this surplus economy, one that is non-exploitative and communal, as each capability is extended to each individual.","[Duzenli, Faruk Eray] St Marys Coll Maryland, St Marys City, MD USA",,"Düzenli, FE (通讯作者)，St Marys Coll Maryland, Dept Econ, 18592 E Fisher Rd, St Marys City, MD 20686 USA.",feduzenli@smcm.edu,,,,,,,53,4,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

There are large differences in honesty across countries. Average honesty is positively correlated with per capita GDP. This is driven mostly by GDP differences arising before 1950, rather than by GDP growth since 1950. A country's average honesty correlates with the proportion of its population that is Protestant. These facts suggest a long-run relationship between honesty and economic development. The experiment also elicited participants' expectations about different countries' levels of honesty. Expectations were not correlated with reality. Instead they appear to be driven by cognitive biases, including self-projection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Appelbaum, E; Melatos, M",,,,"Appelbaum, Elie; Melatos, Mark",,,How Can Uncertainty Affect the Choice of Trade Agreements?,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INFORMATION; TARIFFS; PRIVATE; QUOTAS; POLICY,"This paper analyses how uncertainty influences the formation and design of regional trade agreements (TAs). Two sources of uncertainty - in demand and costs - are considered. Using a multi-stage game, we show that, as long as some decisions are made after uncertainty is resolved, all TAs have option values. But, because TAs differ in their flexibility and degrees of coordination, these option values vary across TAs. Thus, under uncertainty, the usual cost-benefit analysis that underlies the formation and design of TAs is altered to reflect these option values. We also show that, due to the flexibility and coordination differences among TAs, their option values are affected differently by uncertainty. Consequently, the formation and design of TAs are also affected by the nature and degree of uncertainty. We demonstrate that the effects of an increase in uncertainty on the choice of TAs depend on the relative responsiveness of the TAs' option values with respect to the change in uncertainty, which in turn depend on the convexity properties of the countries' welfare functions under the different TAs. In particular, a TA whose option value is more responsive to a change in uncertainty becomes relatively more attractive when uncertainty increases. This enables us to predict which TAs are likely to emerge in an uncertain world. Using a specific example, we then show the effects of a change in both demand and cost uncertainty on the choice of TAs. We also examine the timing of the resolution of uncertainty and its effect on the choice of TAs and show that it can significantly impact the type of TA that countries wish to form.","[Appelbaum, Elie] York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Melatos, Mark] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",York University - Canada; University of Sydney,"Appelbaum, E (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",elie@yorku.ca,,,Australian Research Council [DP0665717]; Australian Research Council [DP0665717] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We wish to thank the editor and two referees for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

We focus on three main dimensions-openness, industrial structure and innovation-and analyze how changes in these factors, and the specific combination of them adopted by each country, have affected its income per capita growth. We apply Johansen cointegration approach to time series data for 18 Latin American countries. The analysis leads to two main results. First, we show that Latin American countries have followed different growth trajectories depending on the combination of policies they have adopted to catch up. Secondly, we find a clear correspondence between policy strategies, on the one hand, and growth performance, on the other.

A key ingredient of collective bargaining benefits is union wage premium which will force employers to retrench some workers. A macro-focused union differs from traditional union or micro-focused union in two ways. First, a macro-focused union will work together with the government and management to raise productivity and therefore shift the demand for labor curve upward. Second, the macro-focused union will want to maximize employment and therefore aim at competitive wage level for not only its members but non-union members too. Consequently, this may create a huge free ridership problem as workers may refuse to pay the member fee but still enjoy the club benefits. This paper focuses on a situation where a macro-focused labor union offers non-collective bargaining benefits through offering discount to a subset of consumption goods. However, individual workers' preference is not publicly observed. The union leader may pay a certain survey fee to find out. Therefore, in the equilibrium, the union leader needs to weigh the benefits of larger union size against the costs of survey fee. Similarly, on the workers' side, the tradeoff is the union member fee together with some psychology cost of being a union member against a discount on his favorable consumption goods. We develop a mathematical framework that incorporates all these elements above. We show both theoretically and quantitatively what determines the equilibrium union size and union leader's survey decisions. Moreover, we also examine at the aggregate level, how the union workers' and union leader's welfare levels may respond to certain changes in economic fundamentals, such as preference shift and changes in survey fee, etc.","[Chew, Soon Beng; Tang, Yang] Nanyang Technol Univ, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Chew, SB (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",ASBCHEW@ntu.edu.sg; TANGYANG@ntu.edu.sg,,"tang, yang/0000-0002-2663-0057",,,,,7,0,0,0,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Both countries' banking industries have strong ties with their governments and public sector, even after a series of significant reforms in the last two decades. Our analysis is built on the case studies of each country's two biggest banks. We employ a bivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) and vector error correction (VECM) framework to analyse the short- and long-run dynamics of the chosen CDS prices. We use Granger causality to describe the direction of the discovered dynamics. We find evidence of a stable long-run relationship between sovereign and bank CDS spreads in the chosen time period. The more stable relationship is found in cases where the biggest state-owned universal banks in emerging markets are closely managed by the government. But the fragility of those banks does not directly affect the state of public finances. However, in cases where state-owned banks directly participate in large governmental projects, banking fragility may result in the deterioration of state funds, while raising the risk of sovereign default.","[Deev, Oleg] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic; [Hodula, Martin] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Technical University of Ostrava,"Deev, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",oleg@mail.muni.cz,"Hodula, Martin/AAU-6220-2020; Deev, Oleg/Q-5159-2019","Hodula, Martin/0000-0003-1296-6649; Deev, Oleg/0000-0003-0427-4159",GA CR [13-20613S]; Masaryk University [MUNI/A /0786/2013],GA CR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Masaryk University,"Authors acknowledge the support of GA CR project 13-20613S 'Institutional Structures of Financial Services Supervision and Monitoring of Systemic Risk in Central Europe' and Masaryk University Student Project Grant MUNI/A /0786/2013 'Analyza a predikce vyvoje cen financnich a investicnich nastroju'.

We show that differences in taxes alone explain to a great extent the time use patterns in a set of OECD countries once several key elasticities - the elasticity of substitution between market- and home-produced goods, the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, and the relative risk aversion are set according to empirical evidence. We also show that a realistic calibration of these key elasticities results to be more important than introducing government expenditures substitutive for home-produced goods in order to bring the model's time use predictions in line with data.

It is shown that in equilibrium each firm chooses to report truthfully without receiving any subsidy.

This study uncovered three major findings. First, anxiety levels about life at an older age partly depend on people's views of the future. Second, high financial status lessens people's anxiety levels only if prices are stable. Third, living with a child, contrary to expectations, does not necessarily lessen people's concerns about life after 65.","[Kadoya, Yoshihiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Kadoya, Y (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yoshi.kadoya@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Kadoya, Yoshihiko/AAN-4905-2021; Kadoya, Yoshihiko/W-1530-2017","Kadoya, Yoshihiko/0000-0003-3530-164X; Kadoya, Yoshihiko/0000-0003-3530-164X",JSPS [15K17075]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17075] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research used micro data from the Preference Parameters Study of Osaka University's 21st Century COE Program 'Behavioral Macrodynamics Based on Surveys and Experiments' and its Global COE project 'Human Behavior and Socioeconomic Dynamics'.

Transmission owners have to make decisions about investing in new assets while facing uncertainty in the generation plans, regulatory and environmental constraints, and current system endowments. In this paper, we demonstrate an analytical method for determining the economic value of individual transmission lines in a meshed network by calculating the total welfare effects for the system. While many regulators believe that traditional congestion rents provide the correct incentives for investing in transmission upgrades, we show that the uncertainty in system conditions breaks down this paradigm. The analysis uses an existing Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOFF) model and a test network to demonstrate how the method can be used to determine the welfare effects of changing the capacity of selected transmission lines. The results show that a substantial portion of the economic benefits for an individual line may come from maintaining system reliability when equipment failures occur. Furthermore, these benefits can change dramatically when inherently intermittent sources of renewable generation are added to a network, and the changes in benefits are not captured effectively by changes in the expected congestion rents.

Using data from the 1982 Chinese census, the traditional availability ratio is modified to reflect the degree to which men tend to marry women from different cohorts. This ratio reflects the average tendency of men to prefer women who are close in age to women who are several years younger than them by weighting cohort sizes using the proportion of people in the population who marry someone born in a different cohort. Given that men generally marry younger women, this ratio varies independently of the size of one's own birth cohort. Yet, the ratio fluctuates considerably across individuals, as the sizes of birth cohorts in China vary across time and regions. This enables us to examine how variability in such ratios may influence marriage decisions and household bargaining. The findings suggest that women exercise greater bargaining power once married. Results indicate that as women become scarcer in the marriage market, they have healthier sons. Men also delay marriage, and consume less tobacco and alcohol. This paper also highlights how sensitive findings may be to using this modified weighted availability ratio rather than a traditional unweighted availability ratio.","[Porter, Maria] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Porter, Maria] Univ Oxford, Oxford Inst Populat Ageing, Oxford, England",Michigan State University; University of Oxford,"Porter, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mporter1@anr.msu.edu,,,Oxford Institute of Population Ageing; Oxford Martin School; University of Chicago Center on Aging; Chicago Center for Excellence in Health Promotion Economics,Oxford Institute of Population Ageing; Oxford Martin School; University of Chicago Center on Aging; Chicago Center for Excellence in Health Promotion Economics,"I am very grateful to Gary Becker, Marianne Bertrand, Markus Eberhardt, Marcel Fafchamps, Soshana Grossbard, Ali Hortacsu, Steven Levitt, Albert Park, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We find that gross outflow migration of those with higher and lower levels of education, respectively, has human capital incentive and disincentive effects. Our estimates suggest that the incentive effect eclipses the disincentive effect in general; however, a surge of migration, particularly among less educated groups, implies more of a disincentive effect in China in the 1990s. We also find that changes in the relative labor supply resulting from net outflow migration mitigate a direct brain drain by both encouraging and discouraging school enrolments.","[Suzuki, Yui] Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, 1-26-1 Toyotama Kami Nerima Ku, Tokyo 1768534, Japan; [Suzuki, Yukari] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Suzuki, Y (通讯作者)，Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, 1-26-1 Toyotama Kami Nerima Ku, Tokyo 1768534, Japan.",yui-szk@cc.musashi.ac.jp; yukaris@umich.edu,,,,,,,30,4,4,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Is a Higher Debt Target for the Eurozone Desirable?,CESIFO ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,bubbles; dynamic efficiency; fiscal policy; Secular Stagnation,,"Bubbles are usually viewed as a threat to financial stability. This paper takes a more nuanced view. The world economy is going through an episode of Secular Stagnation, where the equilibrium rate of return on capital r is below the growth rate of the economy g. As is well-known, rational bubbles are sustainable when r <= g in a steady-state equilibrium. Bubbles can then implement a dynamically efficient equilibrium. We show that from a structural point of view, bubbles, Pay-As-You-Go pensions, and sovereign debt are perfect substitutes. However, when dealing with unexpected short-run fluctuations in investment, sovereign debt is far more efficient than bubbles in shifting consumption over time and in risk-sharing between generations. An increase in sovereign debt is, therefore, an efficient response to Secular Stagnation. Instead, the current Stability and Growth Pact for the eurozone embarks on an opposite course.","[Teulings, Coen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Teulings, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",Cnt23@cam.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,11,2,2,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

In contrast to the standard model, the optimal quantity/quality level for low valuation consumers without group buying is further distorted downward, whereas the levels for other consumers are socially optimal. Inducing group buying is more favorable when the proportion of high valuation consumers is higher, or the valuation differential is larger. We also discuss two extensions: one allowing for consumers' arbitrage behavior and the other one allowing for more potential group buying consumers.","[Wu, Chien-Wei; Chiu, Hsien-Hung] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 54561, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University,"Chiu, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 54561, Taiwan.",cwwu@ncnu.edu.tw; hhchiu@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,18,3,5,2,30,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

Unfortunately, obesity is often a persistent and dangerous health condition that is costly to manage. It is one of the leading causes of preventable death and combating the condition has become a national priority. To this end the two most common recommendations are: eat a healthier diet and increase physical activity. Using data from both the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the NLSY79 Children and Young Adult files, this study examines the relationship between physical activity and the persistence of childhood obesity. More specifically, Cox-proportional hazard techniques are used to quantify the impact a child's physical activity has on the likelihood that they exit an overweight or obese state. Results indicate that being physically active reduces the probability that an overweight or obese child remains overweight or obese. Strikingly, there is not a significant difference between children who are active daily and those who are active a few times per week, suggesting that being active may be more important than the frequency of activity.","[Dhar, Paramita; Robinson, Christina] Cent Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, New Britain, CT 06050 USA",Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State University,"Dhar, P (通讯作者)，Cent Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, New Britain, CT 06050 USA.",Paramita.Dhar@CCSU.edu,,,,,,,9,4,5,5,123,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We also find that such negative effect of EPL is slightly stronger for countries near the technology frontier, in the manufacturing sector and after the 1990s. We interpret these results suggesting that technology adoption depends on the skill level of the workforce and on the capacity of firms to adjust employment as technology changes: therefore, firing costs have a stronger impact in sectors where technical change is more skill-biased and technology adoption more important.

A possible remedy recently proposed in the literature is to introduce a shadow short rate (SSR) obtained from the yield curve model as an alternative monetary policy measure. This paper examines the usefulness of shadow rates as a policy stance measure for the Euro area. Moreover, the SSR can be used to study the country-specific monetary policy stance. We incorporate the shadow short rate in a standard vector autoregressive analysis to study the effects of monetary policy shocks both at the level of the Euro area and for two periphery EA countries, Italy and Spain, that endured significant financial stress during the crisis. Our analysis shows that monetary policy shocks identified form the SSR produce similar macro responses as shocks identified from the standard policy rate. The Euro area shocks can directly translate to a corresponding change in the country-specific financing conditions in the periphery, whereas the reverse effect is limited. The historical decomposition of the stochastic component of the SSR series shows that the unconventional policy measures were effective in stabilising the sovereign crisis in 2011, however, their relatively limited quantity provided only a weak stimulus to the economy.","[Damjanovic, Milan; Masten, Igor] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Masten, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Damjanovic, M (通讯作者)，Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",milan.damjanovic8@gmail.com; igor.masten@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,16,16,18,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2016,43.0,2,,,SI,,279,298,,10.1007/s10663-016-9328-4,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK6UV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375061900005,0

A large literature explains how accuracy can arise from diverse predictive models, typically captured as independent or non-perfectly correlated signals. Yet, that literature largely ignores how the diversity of models arises and is maintained. In this paper, we derive equilibrium levels of model diversity as a function of social structure, population size, the probability of experimentation, and the number of available models by building on a theoretical framework used to study biodiversity. We then link model diversity to collective accuracy by generalizing the bias-variance decomposition formula. Assuming equally accurate models, we find that for large populations collective accuracy depends primarily on the diversity of available models and that for small populations, social structure and rates of experimentation also matter. We then show, contrary to intuition, that dividing a population into isolated sub groups does little to increase equilibrium diversity levels. We also extend the model to allow for heterogeneity in accuracy and selection effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The substantial RMB appreciation following the exchange rate reform leads to higher bidder abnormal returns in the short-term, with no long-term reversal.

With a unique dataset from over 80 bank case studies in 2008-2014, we modelled the determinants of bailout costs and ranked the cost of each tool applied. We have found that the most important determinant was level of capital adequacy, while the most cost-consuming tool liquidation of a bank. Thus, our study provides implications on the selection of state aid tools and sheds a new light on their costs. Overall, we concluded that banks' higher loss absorption capacity, strengthened supervision over small and medium-sized banks and restrictive approach to diagnose bank's problems may limit the costs of future rescue operations.

There are two forces at work: the effort effect working against giving preferences and the selection effect working in favor of them. When education is costly and easy to obtain (as in the United States), the selection effect dominates. When education is heavily subsidized and limited in supply (as in India), preferences are welfare reducing.

The purposes of this paper are to empirically investigate inter-factor/inter-fuel substitution in China and to evaluate the determinants of China's energy-related carbon intensity as well as mitigation effects of carbon tax. Considering China's rapid increase in energy consumption and the slow adjustment in substitution, the two-stage estimation method and the dynamic error correction mechanism are employed in this study. The empirical results suggest substitutability among different types of energy sources as well as substitutability among energy, labor, and capital. The magnitude of cross-price elasticities indicates that the substitutions are inelastic, which limits the scope of the Chinese government to implement substitution strategy aiming at energy conservation and environmental management. China's carbon intensity declined during 1985-2012, most of which can be attributed to labor substitution and energy price increase. However, carbon-intensive technology being embodied in China's capital investment (energy consuming equipment) has contributed to the increase in carbon intensity. A carbon tax of RMB 50/tonne could reduce 332.9 million tonnes CO2 emissions on the basis of 2012. In addition, if ignoring the feedback between inter-factor/inter-fuel substitutions, CO2 mitigation potential would be underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this aim, forecasting with factor models offers a usual approach that utilizes large datasets, however; a forecasting model which simply includes all factors in state space equation and does not allow for time varying may be not suitable with a highly volatile market such as oil market. To overcome these limitations, an approach that accounts both for parameter and model uncertainty is employed. In particular, this study uses the Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) approach suggested by Koop and Korobilis (2012). The key element of the DMA approach is that it allows both for model and parameter to vary at each point of time. By doing so, the DMA is robust to structural breaks. Empirical findings show that DMA approach outperforms any other alternative model used in the forecasting exercise. Results also show that there is model but not parameter variation in this oil price forecasting exercise. Finally, the findings suggest that the DMA approach provides a better proxy of expected spot prices than future prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical model is derived from endogenous growth theory whereby the rate of technological progress is partly determined by technology transfers and spillovers from international contacts, our exclusive focus being on FDI-induced spillovers. The impact of FDI onto the firm-level productivity is evaluated via the channels of horizontal and vertical linkages. The empirical results show that horizontal linkages decrease the productivity of firms, whereas vertical linkages exert a positive impact onto the local productivity levels, thereby drawing attention of policy makers towards strengthening of supplier-buyer relationship between local and multinationals in order to optimize the benefits from FDI. This study also acknowledges the heterogeneity of local (foreign) firms and their differential capacity to absorb (exude) the FDI-induced externalities.","[Fatima, Syeda Tamkeen] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Dev Res & Dev Policy, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Fatima, ST (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Dev Res & Dev Policy, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany.",syeda.fatima@rub.de,,,Ruhr University Research School PLUS - Germany's Excellence Initiative [DFG] [GSC 98/3],Ruhr University Research School PLUS - Germany's Excellence Initiative [DFG],"I would like to acknowledge Prof. Dr Dieter Bender and Prof. Dr Mathias Busse for their valuable comments and suggestions.

Bunching analysis indicates that approximately 2% of divorces occurring in the 6 months after 10-year anniversaries would have occurred earlier if not for Social Security's 10-year rule. For older couples, who are likely more focused on retirement and have greater earning disparities, divorces are approximately 9% higher in the 2 years after 10-year anniversaries than would be predicted without the abrupt change in Social Security benefits. The increase in divorces after 10 years of marriage appears to come from couples with disparate earning records.","[Dillender, Marcus] WE Upjohn Inst Employment Res, 300 S Westnedge Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA",W.E.

Formal contracts are enforced by third-party institutions (courts), whereas relational contracts are self-enforcing agreements without third-party involvement. The novel feature of our model is that it demonstrates the co-evolution of these different enforcement modes and market equilibrium conditions, all of which are jointly determined. We then characterize the equilibrium paths of such dynamic processes and show the time structure of relational contracting in the process of development. In particular, we show that relational contracting fosters the emergence of a market-based economy in the growth phase of development; however, its role declines as the economy enters a mature phase.","[Ishiguro, Shingo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Osaka University,,ishiguro@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245031] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,33,4,4,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

It also discusses the implications for the resource allocations of the aggregate economy. Using an analytically tractable model with entry and exit, we show that reducing entry cost will increase average firm productivity by encouraging more entries of firms, whereas reducing overhead cost will decrease it by adversely lowering the selection standard.

I find that the model easily succeeds in matching the historical equity premium and its variability when the preference parameters are calibrated in line with micro evidence. The equity premium is high because expectations-based loss aversion makes uncertain fluctuations in consumption more painful. Additionally, loss aversion introduces variation in returns because unexpected cuts in consumption are particularly painful, and the agent wants to postpone such cuts to let his reference point decrease. This variation generates strong predictability. However, it also causes counterfactually high volatility in the risk-free rate, which I address by allowing for variation in expected consumption growth, heteroskedasticity in consumption growth, time-variant disaster risk, and sluggish belief updating.","[Pagel, Michaela] Columbia Grad Sch Business, Columbia, SC USA",,"Pagel, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Grad Sch Business, Columbia, SC USA.",MPagel@columbia.edu,,,,,,,63,23,26,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Using copulas to construct multivariate distributions of time-series data permit the calculation of the dependence structure between the series independently of the marginal distributions. Further, we implement the copula estimation using a rolling window method to allow for a time-varying effect of equity and economic policy uncertainty on oil returns. The results show that higher uncertainty, as measured by equity and economic policy uncertainty indices, significantly increase crude-oil returns only during certain periods of time. That is, we find a positive dependence prior to the financial crisis and Great Recession.

In this paper we analyse the effects of outliers on these cross-correlations and, consequently, on the identification of asymmetric volatilities. We show that, as expected, one isolated big outlier biases the sample cross-correlations towards zero and hence could hide true leverage effect. Unlike, the presence of two or more big consecutive outliers could lead to detecting spurious asymmetries or asymmetries of the wrong sign. We also address the problem of robust estimation of the cross-correlations by extending some popular robust estimators of pairwise correlations and autocorrelations. Their finite sample resistance against outliers is compared through Monte Carlo experiments. Situations with isolated and patchy outliers of different sizes are examined. It is shown that a modified Ramsay-weighted estimator of the cross-correlations outperforms other estimators in identifying asymmetric conditionally heteroscedastic models. Finally, the results are illustrated with an empirical application.","[Angeles Carnero, M.] Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Perez, Ana] Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ Aplicada, Valladolid, Spain; [Ruiz, Esther] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estad, C Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Ruiz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estad, C Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",acarnero@ua.es; perezesp@eaee.uva.es; ortega@est-econ.uc3m.es,"Pérez, Ana/GQA-6861-2022; Ruiz, Esther/L-1737-2014; Perez, Ana/H-4268-2015; Carnero, M.

It uses establishment-level data from Colombia to estimate an open economy dynamic model that links trade to job flows and wages. Counterfactual experiments imply that Colombia's integration with global product markets increased its national income at the expense of higher unemployment, greater wage inequality, and increased firm-level volatility.

Our identifying variation comes from the loss of the Child Tax Credit when a child turns 17. Using this age discontinuity, we find that despite this tax liability increase being lump-sum and predictable, households reduce their reported wage income upon discovering they have lost the credit. This finding suggests that households misinterpret at least part of this tax liability change as an increase in their marginal tax rate. This evidence supports the hypothesis that tax complexity can cause confusion and leads to unintended behavioral responses.","[Feldman, Naomi E.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Res, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Katuscak, Peter] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Katuscak, Peter] CERGE EI, Polit Veznu 7, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Kawano, Laura] US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; United States Department of the Treasury,"Feldman, NE (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Res, Washington, DC 20551 USA.;Katuscák, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.;Katuscák, P (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Polit Veznu 7, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.;Kawano, L (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",naomi.e.feldman@frb.gov; peter.katuscak@vse.cz; laura.kawano@treasury.gov,"Katuscak, Peter/H-2888-2014","Feldman, Naomi/0000-0001-7053-9683",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR P402/12/G130]; Global Development Network (GDN),Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Global Development Network (GDN),"Feldman: Research Division, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551 (e-mail: naomi.e.feldman@frb.gov); Katuscak: Faculty of Economics, University of Economics in Prague, namesti Winstona Churchilla 4, 130 67 Prague 3, Czech Republic and Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education-Economics Institute (CERGE-EI), Politickych veznu 7, 110 00 Prague, Czech Republic (e-mail: peter. katuscak@vse.cz).

To explain these dynamics, the model highlights the importance of liquidity spirals that arise from the interaction of search frictions and endogenous credit constraints. During housing busts, longer selling times spill over into higher foreclosure risk, thereby magnifying the response of credit constraints to the depressed housing market. This contraction in credit then deepens the downturn. During booms, the reverse occurs. Based on these insights, I consider a foreclosure reform that makes all mortgages full recourse, and I show that implementing such a reform would reduce foreclosures and dampen housing dynamics.","[Hedlund, Aaron] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Hedlund, A (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",hedlunda@missouri.edu,,,,,,,46,21,23,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Yet, with sufficient cost convexity, this movement to the center can actually increase welfare relative to Nash.

Using the quantile autoregression unit-root test, we examine housing prices in China's five major cities. The results show that the rising and falling of housing prices in these cities exhibits asymmetric reversion. When housing prices fall, market capital is highly sensitive to housing prices, and housing prices resist the pressure to fall further. However, when housing prices rise, the housing market becomes imbalanced, with housing prices tending to overreact in an upturn. The results of this study indicate that when housing prices rise irrationally, the government should intervene in the housing market promptly to prevent housing bubbles.","[Lin, Wen-Yuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Finance, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai; National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",linwy@bnuz.edu.cn; ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",,,,,33,10,11,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2016,24.0,2,,,,,107,126,,10.1111/cwe.12153,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001400006,0

In addition, we find significant feedback effects between monetary and fiscal policies in China, indicating that policy coordination is an important feature of China's monetary and fiscal policies.

Findings from a dynamic mixed multinomial logit model point to a significant decline in the likelihood of full-time and part-time work due to disability. Combined with strong state dependence in employment choices, this suggests a slow recovery from a disability shock. Model simulations suggest that high cross- and own-state dependence can amplify a one-off disability shock to alter the probability of full-time employment and non-participation over a long period, especially for low-skilled individuals.","[Oguzoglu, Umut] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Oguzoglu, U (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",umut.oguzoglu@umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,46,11,13,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The decompositions of the redistributive effect are based on new axioms concerning the vertical and horizontal equity of the overall fiscal system, including taxes and benefits. The method is based on pairwise comparisons of income units and the micro concepts of income supremacy change, deprivation from reranking, and income distance change. The decomposition results provide more detailed insights into the income redistribution process than is typical in the literature. This is illustrated by an empirical application of the method to the Croatian scheme of personal income taxes and non-pension social benefits, in which households are divided into two groups, those with and those without children.","[Urban, Ivica] Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Urban, I (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ivica.urban@ijf.hr,"Urban, Ivica/J-5821-2012","Urban, Ivica/0000-0001-6734-2791",,,,,27,7,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This study investigates the robustness of Random Regret Minimization (RRM) modelling outcomes towards one sort of model misspecification: the omission of relevant attributes. We explore the effect of omitted attributes (orthogonal and correlated) in the context of labelled and unlabeled data. In the context of labelled data, we show that - just as in RUM models - in RRM models Alternative Specific Constants (ASCs) can be used to capture the average effect of omitted attributes. However, in contrast to RUM models, ASCs in RRM models are choice set composition specific. This implies that in order to achieve consistent parameter estimates when the choice set composition varies across choice observations, different sets of ASCs need to be estimated for each unique choice set composition. In the context of unlabeled data, we show - using Monte Carlo simulations - that RRM models are fairly robust towards the presence of an orthogonal omitted attribute, though not as robust as the linear -additive RUM model. Specifically, we find that: (1) Aggregate Demand Elasticities (ADEs) implied by RRM models are less robust towards the presence of an orthogonal omitted attributes than those implied by linear -additive RUM models, and (2) Average Sample Effects (ASEs) implied by RRM models are - in the presence of an omitted orthogonal attribute - more sensitive towards misspecification in terms of the underlying decision rule than those implied by its linear -additive RUM counterpart.

We show that, when these mutations occur sufficiently infrequently, the dynamics over all population states simplify to an ergodic Markov chain over just the pure population states (where each population is monomorphic). This makes calculation of the stationary distribution computationally feasible. The transition probabilities of this embedded Markov chain involve fixation probabilities of mutants in single populations. The asymmetry of the underlying game leads to fixation probabilities that are derived from frequency independent selection, in contrast to the analogous single-population symmetric-game case (Fudenberg and Imhof, 2006). This frequency independence is useful in that it allows us to employ results from the population genetics literature to calculate the stationary distribution of the evolutionary process, giving sharper, and sometimes even analytic, results. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to a battle of-the-sexes game, a Crawford-Sobel signalling game, and the beer-quiche game of Cho and Kreps (1987). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the effect of new policy instruments (IRC, RRR and ROM) on the volatilities of US dollar, euro, British pound and basket rate for Turkish economy between January 2, 2002 and December 9, 2014 by using ARMA-GARCH, ARMA-EGARCH and SWARCH models. From the estimation results, we could not reach enough evidence that the IRC and RRR instruments could decrease the volatilities of exchange rates under investigation while the ROM instrument was successful, especially on US dollar and basket rate. We also found strong evidence in favour of asymmetric volatility, indicating that the positive shocks led to greater exchange rate volatility than negative ones.","[Akar, Cuneyt] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Dept Business Adm, FEAS, TR-10230 Bandirma, Balikesir, Turkey; [Cicek, Serkan] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, FBF, TR-48300 Fethiye, Mugla, Turkey; [Cicek, Serkan] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Res Dept, Rahlgasse 3, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University; Mugla Sitki Kocman University; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Çiçek, S (通讯作者)，Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, FBF, TR-48300 Fethiye, Mugla, Turkey.;Çiçek, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Res Dept, Rahlgasse 3, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",cuneytakar78@gmail.com; serkan.cicek@wiiw.ac.at,"ÇİÇEK, SERKAN/A-4217-2018; AKAR, CÜNEYT/A-1419-2019; cicek, serkan/AAH-1766-2019","AKAR, CÜNEYT/0000-0003-4595-5663; CICEK, SERKAN/0000-0002-6384-4476",,,,,28,5,6,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2016,43.0,1,,,,,141,165,,10.1007/s10663-015-9298-y,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DC1TB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368998600006,0

This paper evaluates the importance of this mechanism quantitatively by studying deficit-financed tax cut experiments. I use a heterogeneous-agents overlapping-generations economy with endogenously operative transfer motives to capture the fact that empirically transfers occur in some but not in all families. Altruism is calibrated to match aggregate transfer statistics. I find that the response of aggregate consumption to a tax cut is in the ballpark of a standard overlapping-generations economy, that is, an economy without altruistic family links.

When a production function has three or more inputs, the traditional modeling technique employs Allen elasticities of substitution to represent general functional forms. This paper builds an analytical general equilibrium model using the Morishima elasticity of substitution (MES). Specifically, an existing model using Allen elasticities is reformulated to employ the MES and the new, closed-form solutions are interpreted with additional insights from the reformulation. Importantly, the special case of constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production follows directly when using Morishima elasticities, but not Allen elasticities. This paper also provides a general technique for switching from Allen to Morishima elasticities in any existing AGE model and demonstrates a one-to-one numerical equivalence regardless of the elasticity measure employed. Replicating prior results, plausible parameter values are applied to the reformulated model to analyze the source-side, distributional effects of a pollution tax and highlight how the Allen and Morishima elasticities differ.

Furthermore, our results contradict the idea that crowdfunding reduces the inhibiting effect of donor-entrepreneur distance. In addition, the results show that a long project exposure is associated with higher values of pledges.

We find that plans to go abroad are more frequent among Roma compared to non-Roma, but the ethnic gap in emigration intentions is not explained by the more disadvantaged characteristics of Roma compared to non-Roma. Among the Roma population, potential emigrants are more educated and wealthier on average.

The direction of causal relationship between the series is examined by the VECM Granger causality approach and robustness of causality analysis is tested by innovative accounting approach (IAA).Our empirical evidence confirmed that the variables are cointegrated for long run relationship. The results exposed that economic growth and energy intensity increase CO2 emissions, while financial development condenses it. The VECM Granger causality analysis showed the feedback effect between energy intensity and CO2 emissions, while economic growth and financial development Granger cause CO2 emissions.

Also, some of these models are adapted to the conditions while some of the traditional presumptions of these theories are not valid. Inflation rate, therefore, can be explained using data for productivity, exchange rate, interest rates, wages or prices of some commodities. Moreover, each model form includes data from GT.

Our research is based on previous empirical results, related to the perceived needs of school principals for training and support. Namely, in 2011, the surveyed school principals required additional competencies to be developed in the fields of school marketing and management. At that time, the primary school principals are being surveyed, related to their managerial practices and the obtained results are interpreted in the context of the already announced, comprehensive school reform in Croatia, designed according to the constructivist educational theories. The empirical results demonstrate that the managerial practices of Croatian primary schools are not compatible with the constructivist theory of education. One group of principals (27.6%) have adequate delegation skills and focus on the specific fields of project management and school marketing, while the majority demonstrate one (or several) forms of ineffective practices.

Also, the heterogeneity across firms plays a significant role when it comes to loan granting, older firms with higher turnover are less likely to be rejected on their loan application. The firms in the stressed countries are most likely to be refused in their bank loan application after the crisis unfolded and have a higher probability of not applying to a bank loan compared to the firms from the non-stressed economies.","[Andries, Alin Marius; Ihnatov, Iulian; Foca, Mariana; Ursu, Silviu Gabriel] Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Blvd Carol 1,22, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Andries, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Blvd Carol 1,22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",alin.andries@uaic.ro; iulian.ihnatov@uaic.ro; focamariana@ymail.com; silviu.ursu@uaic.ro,"Ursu, Silviu/HZM-4936-2023; Andries, Alin Marius/B-5980-2011","Andries, Alin Marius/0000-0002-4415-4197; Ursu, Silviu/0000-0002-0137-9353","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0443]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0443.",,24,4,5,1,27,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

It is necessary to break away from a fixed asset allocation because of these unusual and unforeseen market movements, like the tech bubble during the late 1990s and the financial market crisis in 2008. With the dramatic decline in value across all asset classes, the neoclassical capital market theory lost its reputation. This research shows that a dynamic asset allocation process offers an attractive risk-return profile. Furthermore, this work seeks to demonstrate that the classical diversification is not appropriate and in a multi-asset portfolio, asset classes should be managed dynamically. The predictive power of the factors, absolute and relative momentum, is evaluated and analysed in a multi asset context. The data history ranges from 1992 to 2015. The calculations are based on the momentum of various equity markets (World, Emerging Markets, REIT's), government bonds (US Treasuries), foreign currencies (JPY/USD, EUR/USD) and commodities (energy, industrial metals, precious metals, agricultural commodities and livestock). Absolute and relative momentum portfolios are constructed using those three asset classes (731-3) that present the highest relative or absolute monthly ex-post return within the entire investment universe (p1-8). The research indicates that both absolute and relative momentum strategies are suitable approaches for constructing and managing high performing multi-asset portfolios, especially it was proved by the outperformance of the portfolios during dot com bubble, financial crises of 2008.","[Backhaus, Achim] Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers, Munich, Germany; [Zhakanova Isiksal, Aliya] Girne Amer Univ, Kyrenia, Cyprus",,"Backhaus, A (通讯作者)，Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers, Munich, Germany.",achim.backhaus@hauck-aufhaeuser.de; aliyazhakanova@hotmail.com,"Isiksal, Aliya/B-4560-2019",,,,,,61,6,6,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

This paper analyzes the economic effects of oil price on the major Turkish macro economic variables, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) on the basis of quarterly data from 2003Q1 to 2015Q3. Firstly, ADF, KPSS, PP unit root tests and Zivot-Andrews, Lumsdaine Papell unit root tests allowing for structural breaks are used to characterize the time series. Additionally, Granger causality test is performed to give a clearer picture of how these variables are related. The results show that Gross Domestic Product, Oil Price and Consumer Price Index are stationary, while Real Effective Exchange Rate have unit root in Turkey. Test results indicate that, there is a casual relationship from oil price to GDP and to CPI. Furthermore, there exist a bidirectional causality between GDP and CPI in Turkey.","[Balli, Esra; Tras, Mehmet Fatih; Sigeze, Ciler] Cukurova Univ, FEAS, Dept Econ, Adana, Turkey",Cukurova University,"Balli, E (通讯作者)，Cukurova Univ, FEAS, Dept Econ, Adana, Turkey.",esraballi@cu.edu.tr; mftras@cu.edu.tr; csigeze@cu.edu.tr,"BALLI, ESRA/AAA-2890-2019",,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,2,9,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100001,0

The research has shown that rural tourism in Croatia falls behind the sun-and-beach holiday tourism in coastal Croatia and that numerous and diverse natural and social resources in Eastern Croatia are insufficiently employed, especially in the eastern part of the country Past research of rural tourism in continental Croatia relied on individual entrepreneurial initiative and scarce funding resources, so that consequently a heterogeneous and fragmented rural tourism offer, based on various tourism forms and special interest tourism types, has developed in an unorganized way. Since the area in question is ecologically preserved and its resources need to be protected for future generations, the issue of rural tourism development unequivocally introduces the concept of sustainable development based on the balance of economic, ecological and social sustainability. From these results the basic hypothesis of this paper is derived that long-term sustainable development of rural tourism in Eastern Croatia may be provided only through integrated tourism offer of special interest tourism and that it is necessary to manage its development at the level of homogeneous region Eastern Croatia.

Managers and employees of culturally diverse organizations not only have to deal with new procedures, technology and policies, but also with new cultural and communication situations. Intercultural competences are essential for creating competitive advantage in international organizations by developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes that lead to visible behavior and communication which are both effective and appropriate in intercultural interactions. They affect all areas of running an international organization, such as management, communication, organizational behavior, corporate culture, etc. Due to this new trend, it is inevitable to consider possibilities of developing intercultural competences within an organization by various forms of intercultural training as a process of making others to be aware of the cultural differences and teaching them how to behave and adapt to various cultural conditions and situations. The primary research related to the use of intercultural training in Slovakia focused on multinational companies operating in the Slovak market. There are numerous educational institutions which offer different types of training for Slovak managers. However, only a very small percentage (8%) of the managerial training relates to intercultural issues. This paper provides an insight into the problem of intercultural training and its forms as applied in international business organizations in Slovakia, and suggests its further utilization within all types of international organizations intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and globally operating multinational corporations.","[Bencikova, Dana] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Poliak, Peter] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Arts, Tajovskeho 51, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Benciková, D (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",dana.bencikova@umb.sk; peter.poliak@umb.sk,,,VEGA [1/0934/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0934/16 Cultural intelligence as an essential prerequisite for competitiveness of Slovakia in global environment.,,15,7,7,1,12,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,151,158,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800020,0

The negative aspects of the regional development include also environmental loads. The aim of this paper is to provide detailed characteristics of the environmental loads in the Western Slovakia, which present limiting factors of regional development. The analytic data about the selected environmental loads have been obtained from field research, analysis of aerial photographs, as well as bibliography and other resourses, and last but not least from interviews. The level of detail of the presented results is, however, limited by the extent of the paper. Management of the issue of environmental loads in the Slovak Republic is being slowed down due to the absence of legislation, lack of financial resources, failure to clearly assign responsibilities for environmental loads, and high number of localities. Solving the issue of environmental loads in the territory of Slovakia will not be possible without financial support of European funds by means of Operational Programme for Environment and from the state budget. However, the solution to the whole issue will be a long-term matter and it is assumed to last until 2030. The year 2027 is the target year for sanitation of the most risky environmental loads resulting from the application of allowed exceptions, e.g. EU general directive on water according to which the member states must reach good quality of surface and underground waters.","[Boltiziar, Martin] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Trieda A Hlinku 1, Nitra 94975, Slovakia; [Michaeli, Eva; Solar, Vladimir; Ivanova, Monika] Presov Univ Presov, Fac Humanities & Nat Sci, Dept Geog & Appl Geoinformat, Ul 17 Novembra, Presov, Slovakia",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra; University of Presov,"Boltiziar, M (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Trieda A Hlinku 1, Nitra 94975, Slovakia.",mboltiziar@ukf.sk; eva.michaeli@unipo.sk; vladimir.solar@unipo.sk; monika.ivanova@unipo.sk,"Boltiziar, Martin/AAC-1010-2020; Solár, Vladimír/JRX-7005-2023","Boltiziar, Martin/0000-0003-3514-711X; Solár, Vladimír/0000-0003-1900-061X",,,,,15,1,1,1,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,648,656,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-83,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500084,0

Thousands of refugees seeking to enter Europe are a reminder of the tragic consequences of dysfunctional states. Standard international development programs - emphasizing economic growth and fighting poverty - are counter-productive because they fail to address the underlying institutional incoherence in fragile states. They are flawed because they focus on symptoms rather than reasons. A focus on the reasons for current dysfunctional states would bring attention to the defective institutional architecture - legal relations - that prevents the emergence of economic coherence where dysfunction now reigns.

Furthermore, when estimating the cost of equity capital, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is usually used. With the aim of testing and analyzing the possibility of applying the CAPM model to making capital budgeting decisions in underdeveloped markets, the authors conducted research on a sample of 62 randomly selected project proposals generated in the period from 2003 to 2014 and planned to be implemented in Eastern Croatia. Through this research, cash flows, profitability, and the investment structure of the projects were analyzed and put into relation with profitability of the investment in a created stock portfolio. The results showed that, when using the CAPM in underdeveloped markets, certain adjustments in defining calculation input values are needed in order to get relevant output information. Even without the specificities of underdeveloped markets, the use of the CAPM is still not without controversies. The questions regarding beta calculation, a premium market rate and an adequate risk-free rate, are still being discussed. Nevertheless, it was found that the CAPM could give a satisfactory insight into investors' minimum required returns and the riskiness of investment options. The authors emphasize that investors must not ignore the shortcomings of this model regarding the characteristics of capital markets it was tested on, the specificities of the industry being invested in and the fact that the CAPM model strongly responds to highly variable cash flows and a project period to achieve full production capacity.","[Bukvic, Ivana Bestvina] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Osijek, Croatia; [Starcevic, Dubravka Pekanov; Fosic, Ivana] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bukvic, IB (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Osijek, Croatia.",ibbukvic@unios.hr; dpekan@efos.hr; ifosic@efos.hr,"Bestvina Bukvić, Ivana/J-3206-2019","Bestvina Bukvić, Ivana/0000-0002-9157-1479",,,,,27,1,2,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,25,35,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100004,0

We propose a model where the government hires law enforcers to report those who engage in a harmful activity. Offenders are allowed to respond by offering bribes to the law enforcers in exchange for their silence. When standard anti-corruption policies are costly to implement, we show that an alternative tax-and-legalize policy can yield significant benefits, especially in countries with weak institutions and for activities that are not too harmful. However, a tax-and-legalize scheme eliminates the distortions stemming from the threat of corruption by increasing the equilibrium number of harmful activities, which might explain why it is not as widespread a policy as the theory suggests.

The database distinguishes qualities and quantities of water endowments, sectoral water requirements, and wastewater discharges. We estimate that global water treatment costs could be reduced by several trillion dollars if water endowments were maintained at higher quality than currently is the case. Under scenarios where water quality degrades further, the treatment costs more than double even without taking account of likely increases in quality requirements. This modeling framework provides a starting point not only for more detailed empirical investigations of water management strategies, but also for examining prospects and associated costs for recovering other resources, such as metals, which can be reused multiple times.","[Cazcarro, Ignacio] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao, Spain; [Lopez-Morales, Carlos A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Sch Econ, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Duchin, Faye] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Duchin, F (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",duchin@rpi.edu,"López-Morales, Carlos A/AAM-6293-2020; C, Ignacio Cazcarro/AFA-1858-2022","C, Ignacio Cazcarro/0000-0001-7517-0053; Lopez Morales, Carlos Andres/0000-0001-9296-7136",United States National Science Foundation [CNH] [1115025]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1115025] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,United States National Science Foundation [CNH]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This work was supported by the United States National Science Foundation grant [CNH #1115025].,,47,18,19,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

In this paper, I analyze the equilibrium as well as welfare properties of tune-ins in a duopolistic TV market that lasts for two periods. Importantly, each TV station is fully informed about its own as well as its rival's program. Viewers receive information via tune-ins, if any, or alternatively by sampling a program for a few minutes (and switching across stations). I find that equilibrium tune-in decisions do not necessarily depend on TV stations' knowledge of their rival's program. In this case, the opportunity costs of tune-ins could be so high that a regime without any tune-ins may be socially better. However, when tune-ins depend on both of the upcoming programs, it is possible that they enhance welfare by helping viewers avoid some of the inefficient program sampling they would otherwise do in a regime without any tune-ins.

The article deals with the possibilities and applying the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in a supply chain context in the process of globalization. Corporate social responsibility is an impulse and a mean to discuss the extent of any obligations of the organization towards its immediate environment. With increased globalization and offshore sourcing, global supply chain management is becoming an important issue for many businesses. Supply chain management is an area with increasing of strategic importance due to global competition, outsourcing of noncore activities to developing countries, short product life cycle, and time compression in all aspects of the supply chain. Management attention has moved from competition between firms to competition between supply chains. The capability to establish close and long-term relationships with suppliers and other strategic partners has become a crucial factor in creating competitive advantage. The aim of the article is to focus attention on the most important application area of corporate social responsibility within an integrated supply chain.","[Ceniga, Pavel; Sukalova, Viera] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Ceniga, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",pavel.ceniga@fpedas.uniza.sk; sukalova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Sukalova, Viera/P-3330-2015; Ceniga, Pavel/P-3333-2015","Sukalova, Viera/0000-0003-3203-6633;",scientific grant VEGA [1/0024/15],scientific grant VEGA,This contribution is a partial output of scientific grant VEGA n. 1/0024/15 The funadamental research of perception of corporate social responsibility as a value for customer and VEGA 1/0696/16 Proposal for a methodology for measuring quality of life in a regional context.,,23,1,1,0,12,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,303,311,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800039,0

This paper focuses on the capped credit risk, the risk of default related to borrower health states. We show that government capital injection helps to reduce default risk for the bank, but indirectly increases the default risk for the borrowing firm. Government capital injection is more likely to produce greater safety for the bank when the borrowing firm is in a distressed situation (e.g., a high-risk and low-return one). The capital effect on bank safety is underestimated when the capped credit risk is ignored.

This paper takes this possibility into account and examines whether there are periodically collapsing bubbles in four international stock markets, i.e., the US, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. We test for the presence of periodically collapsing bubbles by examining the nonstationarity of the log dividend yields based on the dividend discount model. Among the main results, it is found that the hypothesis of the rational bubbles cannot be rejected for these stock markets. In addition, the empirical evidence does not favor the hypothesis of the periodically collapsing bubbles provided that nonlinear adjustment and structural break are allowed. The presence of the rational bubbles, but not the periodically collapsing bubbles, is in line with the rational expectations and efficient market hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This provides an opportunity to investigate whether institutions or individuals are informed short sellers. The empirical results indicate that institutions and individuals take more heavy short positions in stocks with lower fundamental values. Institutional short selling is positively associated with institutional holdings, but individual short selling is negatively related to institutional holdings. Moreover, heavy short selling results in negative abnormal return significantly, and there is no difference of abnormal return between institutional and individual short selling. Finally, the finding is still robust during the financial tsunami.

There is a need, however, to better understand how and why institutions emerge and change. Informed by evolutionary theory and complexity science, this chapter develops a conceptual framework that follows models of cultural evolution in viewing institutions as part of a nongenetic system of inheritance. This framework is used to examine how broad historical factors (not just economic factors) influence present-day institutional arrangements and economic outcomes, as well as how noninstitutional aspects of culture (e.g., values, beliefs) interact with institutions to shape behavior in particular contexts. Overall, this framework emphasizes the processes by which institutions evolve, and how they can coevolve with other institutions and culture. This approach is illustrated using four examples to demonstrate how evolution theory and complexity science can be used to study institutional emergence and change. Explicit models of the processes of institutional evolution need to be developed and then tested and assessed with data. This framework holds promise to bring together and synthesize the findings and insights from a range of different disciplines.","[Currie, Thomas E.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Turchin, Peter] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bednar, Jenna] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Richerson, Peter J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Schwesinger, Georg] Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Steinmo, Sven] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy; [Wacziarg, Romain] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wallis, John J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Exeter; University of Connecticut; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Bremen; European University Institute; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Currie, TE (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",,"Wacziarg, Romain/F-1110-2011","Wacziarg, Romain/0000-0002-2394-7593","Tricoastal Foundation; John Templeton Foundation; NSF; European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, ERC [295675]","Tricoastal Foundation; John Templeton Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, ERC(European Research Council (ERC))","T.

It is based on the works of Celso Furtado - a Brazilian economist, a member of ECLAC's first generation of scholars (along with Raul Prebisch), and a notable intellectual of sub-development and development in Brazil and Latin America. For Furtado, economic development is an endogenous social process that leads to human ingenuity and creativity. However, Furtado argued that creativity does not occur haphazardly. It is conditioned by cultural structures that can take two forms: material (means) or immaterial (ends). The former steers creativity toward serving material accumulation and consumption, while the latter guides it toward individuals' existential way of life. Furtado's central claim is that, in the industrial civilization, such values as rationality and efficiency bring human creativity into the production process.","[do Amaral Filho, Jair] Fed Univ Cearas, Dept Theoret Econ, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Farias, Deborah B.

An analysis of the latest data on educational outcomes among boys and girls reveals extensive disparities in grades, reading and writing test scores, and other measurable educational outcomes, and these disparities exist across family resources and race. Focusing on disadvantaged schoolchildren, I then examine whether time investments made by boys and girls related to computer use contribute to the gender gap in academic achievement. Data from several sources indicate that boys are less likely to use computers for schoolwork and are more likely to use computers for playing games, but are less likely to use computers for social networking and email than are girls. Using data from a large field experiment randomly providing free personal computers to schoolchildren for home use, I also test whether these differential patterns of computer use displace homework time and ultimately translate into worse educational outcomes among boys. No evidence is found indicating that personal computers crowd out homework time and effort for disadvantaged boys relative to girls. Home computers also do not have negative effects on educational outcomes such as grades, test scores, courses completed, and tardies for disadvantaged boys relative to girls.","[Fairlie, Robert W.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Fairlie, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2 Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rfairlie@ucsc.edu,,,"Computers for Classrooms, Inc.; ZeroDivide Foundation; NET Institute","Computers for Classrooms, Inc.; ZeroDivide Foundation; NET Institute","I would like to thank Computers for Classrooms, Inc., the ZeroDivide Foundation, and the NET Institute for generous funding for the project.

This paper uses data on about 100 nations to address this aspect, focusing on the long, medium and short-term research intensity. Across two measures of a nation's institutional history, we find that broader national stability positively affects research intensity both in the long and the medium terms, while the narrower path dependence measure supports these findings, albeit with weak statistical significance. The effects on short-term research intensity lack statistical support across both measures. Comparing institutional path dependence with research inertia, we find that both factors significantly affect research intensity. The main findings are robust to various modifications.

Although over the recession that lasted in the US from the fourth quarter 2007 to the third quarter 2009, was followed by a relatively weak recovery, specially in Europe. Despite the differences unemployment rates are high throughout the industrialized economies with little sign that redundant workers will be reabsorbed into employment any time soon. The crisis is therefore ongoing. It casts a considerable doubts on the prospects of the global economy. Underneath much of the discussion there seems to be the idea of a resumption of growth based on a return to normal scenario, which implies that growth would resume along similar lines as before the crisis. In fact the question is that of the pattern of growth on which industrialized economies will settle in and whether it will provide the conditions for an expansive transformation. On the other hand we have observed the return to a discussion of secular stagnation, prompted by Lawrence Summers comments at the 2013 IMF conference in honor of Stanley Fisher. The reemergence of what two historians of economic thought Backhouse and Boianovsky, call a heresy in macroeconomics suggests a new awareness on a question that almost disappeared from the economic discourse.","[Gualerzi, Davide] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Managerial Sci DSEA, Via Santo 23, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Gualerzi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Managerial Sci DSEA, Via Santo 23, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",davide.gualerzi@unipd.it,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,136,144,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389416500012,0

When conducting analysis inside institutions, it is necessary to recognize, observe, and model the rules, regulations, and requirements which are formulated to be consistent with the normative belief, technological, and ecological criteria of institutions. Generally, social scientists have emphasized belief criteria, and ignored technological and ecological criteria.","[Hayden, F.

Analysis of regional competitiveness must be based on multi-criteria analyze, because the growth in competitiveness is significantly linked with a number of economic, social and innovative factors. In the analysis were calculated selected regional indicators of these countries for the period 2012 to 2013. The data show that the potential of regional competitiveness is more different in qualitative parameters, than in macroeconomic indicators, it can lead to divergent than convergent development processes. Higher potential of regional competitiveness is typical for regions with a higher share of urbanization, the lowest potential of regional competitiveness have peripheral regions or regions with worse geographic location, it is particularly significant for the region in Slovakia.

The debate between Fukuyama and Huntington began more than 20 years ago. In light of current affairs in Europe and processes in the Middle East, their concepts have become even more relevant. In The End of History (1989), Fukuyama argues that because of the rise of modernization, the worldwide spread of Western consumer culture and liberal democracy as the prevailing political system, that the evolution of human ideology is at its endpoint and in the absence of a better alternative. In contrast, Huntington in The Clash of Civilizations (1993), argues that the biggest threat to Western civilization is a coming period that will be characterized by conflicts erupting as the world's civilizations reach their breaking points.

The EU is not a great power in the region and cannot compete with China, Russia or the US in hard power politics. However, the European Union has developed a common strategy towards the Central Asia region as a whole. In turn, bilateral relations are based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements where the strategy areas are outlined. The author indicates that the European Union strategy towards the region is based mainly on a political and security approach. The EU wants to play a normative role in its relations with external partners. Thus, economic development does not always reflect the political dimension, however, political initiatives can have a strong economic impact. Recently, the mutual relations of the EU with the post-Soviet republics of Central Asia have increased over the last years.

It refers to digitising industrial production. The concept outlines the vision of a smart factory, which is characterised by the complete networking of all production processes: real time control via ITC and the increased use of robots, which control themselves, are developments that should contribute to greater productivity and efficiency. The concept of Industry 4.0 is shaping the digital discourse in the Czech Republic as well. Industry 4.0 is precisely where two differing standard regimes meet: one from the IT sector that is more influenced by US standards and another regarding machine and vehicle engineering, which is more European. The question is which regime will prevail. Therefore, Europe should reflect on its strengths and should establish dominance in the most important areas at an early stage. Economic integration remains one of Europe's major strengths, a huge advantage when it comes to setting global standards. Unfortunately, these opportunities are still neglected too often, as the economic actors follow their own short-term national interests. This leads to fragmentation and small-time plays that miss the big win. Common standards, norms and rules could make a major contribution to more positive globalization, integration and cohesion, and therefore to more growth and social progress.

We document that an increase in the size of the banking system relative to equity and private bond markets is associated with more systemic risk and lower economic growth, particularly during housing market crises. We argue that these two phenomena arise owing to an amplification mechanism, by which banks overextend and misallocate credit when asset prices rise, and ration it when they drop.

Industrial differences and subjective model design are generally considered the primary cause. In static comparisons across industries, dynamic industrial changes are ignored, but this might lead to differing results when attempting to identify the driving forces of evolutionary change in an industrial environment. This study applies nonparametric regression methods with an expansive industry grouping to overcome the industry-difference interference and empirical model error, typifying traditional studies. First, a comparative analysis of the forces driving US and Chinese manufacturing is performed. Results indicate that US and Chinese manufacturing are in different industrial growth stages. Chinese manufacturing takes the traditional elements and R&D input as its main driving factors, which require objectively, expansive scale of enterprise, therefore showing characteristic Schumpeterian innovation. US manufacturing is driven by both R&D and non-R&D inputs; so it can maintain continuous innovation through cooperative networks under conditions of constant or contracting firm size.","[Li, Yu; Mao, Peipei] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business Adm, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Zhang, Yanming] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Dalian University of Technology,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",louisli@dufe.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yanming/AAP-1932-2020","Zhang, Yanming/0000-0002-8026-9290",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472028]; National Natural Science Foundation of China for youth [71103027],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China for youth(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Funding for this project was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472028] and National Natural Science Foundation of China for youth [71103027].,,36,6,7,4,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Such a high level of executive pay raises the question of whether a steep rise in executive pay affects firm value. This study examined the relationship between executive pay and firm value. A panel smooth transition regression model is adopted to determine an optimal level of executive pay that maximizes firm value for a sample of 512 Taiwanese-listed firms over the period 2006-2011. The finding is that when the ratio of executive pay to net income after tax exceeds 2.71%, the firm value increases. The results suggest a correlation between large executive ownership (corresponding to high executive pay) and both increased operational efficiencies and firm value. These findings may be useful when contemplating executive compensation policy.","[Lin, Feng-Li] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan",Chaoyang University of Technology,"Lin, FL (通讯作者)，Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, Taichung, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,40,1,1,2,11,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63.0,4,,,,,411,424,,10.2298/PAN1604411L,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DX5CR,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384397900002,0

The EU funds should contribute to the development of transition economies through reducing regional disparities between transition economies and the rest of EU member states and promoting growth. Late 1980s brought the collapse of a communist system in Europe and left behind its economies in an unprepared state for a capitalist tournament. Nowadays, many of these countries belong to a group of new EU members who are still facing a problem of convergence towards their advanced colleagues. The main goal of this paper is to answer whether the EU funds affect the development of transition economies. Findings from the literature up to now result in different conclusions regarding the impact of EU funds, ranging from those which prove that they have a significant effect to the ones who deny the positive influence of EU funds. The empirical analysis in this paper conducted on ten transition economies over 14 years showed that the effect of analyzed EU funds is indeed positive, i.e. EU funds promote growth in transition economies. The planned economy left a certain heritage to transition economies in form of lack of entrepreneurship, infrastructure and weak institutions, which can present an obstacle for efficient EU funds usage. Transition economies should not fall into a trap of EU funding overenthusiasm and they should be fully aware that they, foremost, need to develop and implement appropriate economic policies on their own, after which the EU funds will assist them on their path of convergence.","[Nakic, Martina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,,tlovrinovic@icloud.com; mnakic@efzg.hr,"Solenički, Martina/AAP-3606-2021","Solenički, Martina/0000-0001-6380-1700",,,,,18,2,2,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,142,151,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100016,0

The juridical literature often considers it to be a perversion in the separation of powers within the State, and the motivations behind it are always under scrutiny. In this paper we seek to establish whether there are specific factors that affect and determine pardons. Using a database of all pardons granted in Spain between 1995 and 2013, including our own elaborated individual data, the econometrical estimations produce the following conclusions: firstly, Spain's right-wing political party processes pardons faster than that of the left; secondly, and due to public concern, pardons are less frequent near elections; and thirdly, the higher the fine, the faster the pardon. These results show that the pardon is used in a discretionary way and in most cases greatly distorts the separation of powers that should provide the basis of any healthy democratic system.","[Luis Jimenez, Juan] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Despacho D,2-12,Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Abreu, Jose] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Jiménez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Despacho D,2-12,Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",juanluis.jimenez@ulpgc.es; jose.abreu101@alu.ulpgc.es,,,Spanish Ministry of Innovation [CSO2013-40870-R]; Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Publicas) [I.E.F. 154/2014],Spanish Ministry of Innovation(Spanish Government); Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Publicas),"Juan Luis Jimenez acknowledges financial support by the Spanish Ministry of Innovation through grant CSO2013-40870-R and by Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Ministerio de Hacienda y Administraciones Publicas), through grant I.E.F. 154/2014.

According to them, it threatens the creation of a United States of Europe. British society is highly polarized in these days.

We consider a model where agents have different abilities in acquiring education and belong to different social groups (for instance, races or genders). Under the information constraint that the abilities of agents are unobservable but group memberships are observable, we derive two sets of education policies derived under Rawlsian and utilitarian social welfare functions. Our main results show that the utilitarian planner does not discriminate agents by their social group membership, while the Rawlsian planner provides a form of affirmative action policy. We also study second-best optimal education policies in the case of general degrees of inequality aversion. In this case, it is shown that affirmative action is not necessarily supported, and the differences in education levels are determined by the agents' marginal effects of utility to their group's aggregated welfare.","[Miyagishima, Kaname] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Aoyama Gakuin University,"Miyagishima, K (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",Kaname1128@gmail.com,,,KAKENHI; Waseda University,"KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Waseda University","The author thanks Mayu Atoda, Yoshio Kamijo, Eiichi Miyagawa, Yasuyuki Miyahara, Koji Shirai, John E.

The structure of municipalities revenues was analysed, considering among others the distribution of share in own revenues in total revenues, revenues from shares in PIT and CIT in total revenues and the dynamics of revenues. For the researched municipalities the shares in PIT ensure on average from 10% to 15% of revenues in general, constituting a significant addition to taxes and local fees. For the majority of municipalities shares in CIT constitute a marginal source of revenues which is caused by the functioning of a relatively small number of economic entities within their territory, which are covered by this tax. The key problem associated with gathering of these revenues is their instability stemming, above all, from business fluctuations impacting the tax base, secondly-stemming from changes in the structure of taxes themselves not compensated entirely by increasing additional financial resources.","[Olejniczak, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Ecnom Sci, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Ecnom Sci, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,14,0,0,1,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,868,875,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-112,0.0,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500113,0

The capacity of local companies to exploit knowledge from MNEs can be affected by the technology gap between foreign and local enterprises at both horizontal (in the same industry) and vertical (in different industries) level. Whereas most of the empirical literature has focused exclusively on the analysis of horizontal and backward spillovers (i.e. between MNEs and local suppliers), the present paper also examines the relationship between FDI-related spillovers and technological gap in the Italian manufacturing sector at forward level (i.e. between MNEs and local buyers). Results suggest that at both intra-industry and forward level, the technological gap is of considerable importance for the spillover effect, particularly in the case of low-medium gap.","[Pittiglio, Rosanna] Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Naples, Italy; [Reganati, Filippo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Polit Sci Sociol & Commun Sci, Rome, Italy; [Sica, Edgardo] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Foggia, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Sapienza University Rome; University of Foggia,"Pittiglio, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Naples, Italy.",rosanna.pittiglio@unina2.it; filippo.reganati@uniromal.it; edgardo.sica@unifg.it,"Reganati, Filippo/F-4225-2011; SICA, EDGARDO/AGG-3654-2022; Sica, Edgardo/AAC-8732-2020","SICA, EDGARDO/0000-0001-9054-8309; Sica, Edgardo/0000-0001-9054-8309; PITTIGLIO, Rosanna/0000-0002-1717-2453; REGANATI, Filippo/0000-0002-5028-0421",,,,,45,4,5,5,25,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63.0,3,,,,,313,323,,10.2298/PAN1603313P,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP2FK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378303300004,0

From a national point of view, this subset of the whole enterprise population is of particular interest, since these companies have both managed to grow their sales significantly, as well as greatly increase the number of people they employ. We utilised a database comprising the financial information of over 80 million European companies to identify all Finnish HISMEs. We analysed in detail 125 SMEs that met the criteria for a high-impact SME operating in the ICT cluster. The results indicate that the firms studied contribute considerably to the growth and stabilisation of the Finnish economy.

For the first issue, our results show that a quadratic relationship is satisfied, but an out-of-sample turning point is generated.

This calls for an empirical approach that permits the joint analysis of the three interrelated and consecutive stages of the overall diversification process: diversification decision, degree of diversification and outcome of diversification. We apply parametric and semi-parametric approaches to control for sample selection and the endogeneity of the diversification decision in both static and dynamic models. For the analysis, we use the census dataset on the whole firm population in Vietnam, as a representative of transition countries. After controlling for industry fixed-effects, the empirical evidence from the firm-level data shows that diversification has a curvilinear effect on profitability: it improves firms' profit up to a point, after which a further increase in diversification is associated with declining performance. This implies that firms should consider optimal levels of product diversification when they expand their product offerings beyond their core business. Other noteworthy findings include the following: (i) the factors that stimulate firms to diversify do not necessarily encourage them to extend their diversification strategy; (ii) firms that are endowed with highly technological resources and innovation investment are likely to successfully exploit diversification as an engine of growth; and (iii) while industry performance does not have a strong influence on the profitability of firms, it impacts their diversification decision as well as the degree of diversification.","[Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Hien Thu Tran] RMIT Univ, Ctr Commerce & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",University of Bologna; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",enrico.santarelli@unibo.it; hien.tran@rmit.edu.vn,,"Tran, Hien/0000-0002-1399-9146; SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755",,,,,84,26,30,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

For this purpose, the autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach to cointegration is used to examine cointegration among the variables. The ADF, P-P, and ADF-GLS unit root tests are applied to test the integrating order of the variables. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and error correction method regressions are used to investigate the marginal impact of military spending on external debt in the long and short run. Our findings indicate the existence of cointegration that confirms the presence of a long-run relationship among military spending, external debt, economic growth, and investment. Further, our results reveal that a rise in military spending increases the stock of external debt; an increase in investment also increases external debt; however, there is an inverse effect of economic growth on external debt. An implication of the findings reported herein is that there is a need to formulate a comprehensive economic policy for curtailing external debt in case of Pakistan.","[Shahbaz, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Lahore Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Shabbir, Muhammad Shahbaz] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA; [Butt, Muhammad Sabihuddin] Univ Karachi, Appl Econ Res Ctr, Karachi, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Karachi,"Shahbaz, M (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Lahore Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",shahbazmohd@live.com,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997;",,,,,49,11,12,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Wellness centers are no longer only healing centers, but also places for active rest and recreation. Selection of a wellness center, along with the visitor satisfaction, is determined by numerous factors. On one side, there are health services, as a primary function of a wellness center, and on the other side, there are additional tourist contents that impact their attractiveness. Especially in this segment, there is a need to research if health services or additional tourist content, offered by wellness centers, are more important to visitors. Therefore, the main aim of the research is this paper is determination of factors that impact the selection of a wellness center and visitor satisfaction. Through primary research, two groups of surveyed have been included. The first group consisted of thirty experts, who were questioned on the following criteria on wellness center selection: health services, recreation and sports activities, Spa & Beauty center, gastronomy, and proximity of other tourist attractions. The observed criteria have been graded by the experts in five resorts on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Wellness Center Dvorovi, Fojnica - Reumal, Gradacac - Ilidza, Teslic - Vrucica and Visegrad - Vilina Vlas. The data collected from the experts have been analyzed using the SAW method. The second group of surveyed consisted of sixty visitors to three wellness centers on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Wellness Center Dvorovi, Wellness Center Ilidza Gradacac - Wellness Center Teslic - Vrucica, and they have graded the same criteria as the experts did. The analysis of data collected from the visitors has been conducted though the application of the analytical-hierarchy process. The collected research results show that wellness centers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are still perceived mainly as health centers, but also that visitors, choosing between two wellness centers offering relatively similar health services, will chose the one that has a developed the additional tourist content, such as: wellness, gastronomy, recreational and sports activities.","[Smajlovic, Ermina] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Ninic, Boro] BH Govt Brcko Dist, Dept Finance, Filipa Visnjica Br 5, Brcko Dist BiH 76100, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Smajlovic, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",ermina.mustafic@untz.ba; boro.ninic@hotmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,2,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,308,317,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600030,0

The paper is informed by practical experience and reflections from the point of view of a manager who manages one of the world's largest challenge funds with a capitalisation of USD 250m and 200+ investments across 23 different markets. A challenge fund, which by nature, is a risk taking and risk-sharing PSD mechanism is used to support innovative, for-profit business ventures, which, by the virtue of being innovative, and therefore, more risky than other business ventures have restricted access to capital. A challenge fund, in a developing or frontier market context, will invest in innovative for-profit companies that exhibit strong intentionality on social impact, i.e. they will implement the inclusive business model concept. Essentially, inclusive businesses engage low income communities in a formal way either as suppliers of raw material, such as cocoa seeds, which the company then processes, or they engage low income communities as customers who buy and consume products and services which cater to them specifically. In this way, an inclusive business makes a profit and at the same time increases the income of low income communities. In this arrangement social impact remains sustainable because the business sees that it can make a profit by collaborating with low income communities. A challenge fund, by financing innovative and risky SMEs doesn't only support PSD and social impact, it also creates a tested and proven deal flow of companies for more commercial investors such as private equity funds or development finance institutions such as the International Finance Corporation. Therefore, the challenge fund mechanism serves a critical function in sustainable business and social development.","[Stawicki, Boleslaw] AGRA, Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, West End Towers,Wing A,4th Floor,Kanjata Rd, Nairobi 00800, Kenya",,"Stawicki, B (通讯作者)，AGRA, Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, West End Towers,Wing A,4th Floor,Kanjata Rd, Nairobi 00800, Kenya.",bstawicki@agra.org,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,155,162,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389416500014,0

Yet, the impact of migration on remittances seems to be very important part of globalization process and possible source of growth in developing and poor countries. Through remittances, migrants transfer funds, information, ideas and practices. Remittances link societies of origin and destination by processes of mobility and exchange and they are consist of financial and non-financial part (e.g. ideas and values). Growth of remittance flows is accelerating in last decades and it is higher than official developing assistance.

Therefore, spatial planning is of great importance for the State, local and regional community and ultimately its citizens. Spatial planning is the basis for balanced development of specific areas and for the financing from the different sources. Often there is not enough attention for infrastructure and its representation in spatial plans. A significant amount of EU funds are planned as an incentive for the construction or reconstruction of the existing infrastructure. Construction of infrastructure without considering real needs/requirements can result in unfounded investments. Delays in planning can be an obstacle in the development of projects which are intended to be financed from EU funds. The practice in the spatial planning documents is to define the main infrastructure corridors. Engineers in their projects work on detailed planning to position the infrastructure in a functional way coordinated with other infrastructure elements. Spatial planners receive all input data for existing and planned infrastructure exclusively from utility companies. This practice should be changed, because the development of the area should not be left to chance. Input data for spatial planning as geodetic survey, cadastre, land register and cadastre of infrastructure cables are very important for physical planning of infrastructure. However, those data needs to be updated. There is a difference in planning infrastructure corridors, when there is the necessity to form a building plot or when that is not obligatory. Application of the Expropriation Act in resolving property issues on infrastructure is conditioned by the planning documents. For those reasons, the process of spatial planning needs to be improved with obligatory multidisciplinary approach and the inclusion of a larger number of spatial data.","[Suljic, Azra] Ask Atelier Doo, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Ambros, Franjo; Draskovic, Vladimir] Geoprem Doo, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Suljic, A (通讯作者)，Ask Atelier Doo, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",azra.suljic@ask.hr; franjo.ambros@geoprem.hr; vladimir.draskovic3@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,991,1002,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600099,0

We employ the innovative nonlinear vector autoregressive model of Kilian and Vigfusson (2011), which allows us to observe the effect of different stances (tight or loose) and different sizes (small or large) of monetary policy actions. Our empirical evidence reveals that tight monetary policy, which, in this case, is captured with a positive shock to interest rate, decreases exchange rate, output and prices, as economic theory suggests. Loose monetary policy, which is captured with a negative shock to interest rate, has the opposite effect on these variables. However, the effects of loose monetary policy are weaker than the effects of tight monetary policy because loose monetary policy shocks are less effective than tight monetary policy shocks. Moreover, as the magnitude of a shock increases, the difference between the effects of tight and loose monetary policy policies also increases.","[Uelke, Volkan] Int Burch Univ, Fac Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Berument, M.

Both static and dynamic fixed-effects models are estimated using a 5-year panel data set consisting of about 90 developed and developing countries for the 1970-2005 period. Estimation results from the dynamic panel data specification suggest that wage inequality has a significant and slowly changing component. The overall KOF and EFI indexes are found to be statistically insignificant in the full sample, but the results show that economic freedom is associated with more wage inequality, especially in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The estimation results from country groups indicate that more deregulation is associated with more earnings inequality in OECD countries. The results from the models with subcomponents of the EFI imply that access to sound money has a negative effect on wage inequality. A more stable price system in an economy implies a more equal wage distribution in emerging markets (EM), non-OECD countries, and European Union (EU).","[Yay, Gulsun; Tastan, Huseyin; Oktayer, Asuman] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Tastan, H (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Tastan, Huseyin/AAB-2088-2021; Yay, Gülsün/AAZ-6080-2020; Oktayer Buzluca, Asuman/E-7447-2016","Tastan, Huseyin/0000-0002-2701-1039; Oktayer Buzluca, Asuman/0000-0003-1426-8588; Yay, Gulsun/0000-0003-1931-7246",,,,,47,4,4,2,31,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63.0,5,,,,,581,601,,10.2298/PAN130515024Y,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EG1XA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390826400005,0

This study illustrates a new approach to gain those weights based on expert judgments and then select best material using ranking-based MADM methods. Specifically, we applied the SWARA method for the criteria weight assessment of the material selection process, and subsequently prioritize the candidate materials based on WASPAS and MOORA. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the robustness of the solution after a comparison is made between WASPAS and MOORA in ensuring the consistency of the results.

It is shown that, for fast transformation into a developed economy, the initial distribution must be such that extreme poverty is not prevalent so that most people can take education to acquire basic skills and the size of the middle class is large enough so that an adequate number of people can access education to acquire advanced skills. Both conditions seem to have held in successful East Asian nations, where, as in the model economy undergoing such transformation, the fraction of workers with advanced skills rose greatly and inequalities between these workers and others fell over time. In contrast, if the former condition holds but the latter does not, which would be the case for many nations falling into the middle income trap, consistent with facts, the fraction of workers with basic skills and the share of the modern sector rise, but inequality between workers with advanced skills and with basic skills worsens and the traditional sector persists for long periods. If the former condition does not hold, which would be true for the poorest economies, the dual structure and high inequality between workers without basic skills and others persist for very long periods.

The present study examines this issue by exploring how trade participation impacts on the R&D investment of manufacturing firms through various channels. Merging China 's Annual Manufacturing Survey Dataset and the Chinese Customs Dataset allows us to study such a relationship at the individual firm level. The empirical results suggest that channels such as geographical diversification of export markets, share of imports from high-income countries, average unit value of imports, number of intermediate goods and capital goods imports, and the trade regime are significant factors that influence firm-level R&D investment. The study discusses the policy implications of the empirical findings in relation to industrial and trade policies that may be potentially beneficial for China's transition towards an innovative economy.","[Zhou, Yixiao] Curtin Univ, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Song, Ligang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Curtin University; Australian National University,"Zhou, YX (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",yixiao.zhou@curtin.edu.au; ligang.song@anu.edu.au,,"Zhou, Yixiao/0000-0001-7712-2776; Song, Ligang/0000-0002-5700-2352; Zhou, Yixiao/0000-0003-2962-9841",Rio Tinto-ANU China Partnership,Rio Tinto-ANU China Partnership,Funding for this research through Rio Tinto-ANU China Partnership is gratefully acknowledged.

He discusses the situation, where labor market and macroeconomic policies were largely inefficient in reducing high levels of (youth) unemployment after 2007. He rises the question why an increase in (youth) unemployment had been observed although the labor market becomes more flexible due to the associated structural reforms in 2010 and 2012. He calls this the Spanish Puzzle. The main reason for this observation can be found in the phenomena of downward nominal rigidity, the existence of a liquidity trap and pessimistic private expectations regarding future economic developments. Given the recovery of the Spanish economy in 2015, this development is grounded on (besides the increase in private consumption and a trade surplus) several policy interventions in order to strengthen entrepreneurial activity in 2013. The corresponding boost in private investment expenditure can be identified as the sustainable main driver for job creation in the long run.","[Sacht, Stephen] Univ Kiel, Inst Reg Res, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Sacht, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Reg Res, Kiel, Germany.",sacht@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,31,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 18,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201544.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-44,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CZ5IU,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367136900001,0

We know that households that lost access to credit, for example, were forced to adjust and increase saving, But, will households keep on saving more than they would have done otherwise had the global financial crisis not occurred? And for how long will this increased saving persist? Here, we study the degree to which past adverse income shocks increase the saving rates of affected households. We find evidence consistent with history-dependent dynamics: more experience of past crises tends to increase household saving. We follow up with an investigation of the importance of historical exposure for current account dynamics, but find no strong indication that our measure of past exposure is important to the current account's determination. We conclude by estimating the likely impact of the 2008 GFC on future saving. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a dynamic general equilibrium model to dynamically evaluate whether economic growth triggered by an increase in public education expenditure on behalf of those with high learning ability eventually trickles down to low-ability workers and serves them better than redistribution through labor income taxation or education policies targeted to the low-skilled. Our results suggest that promoting higher education implies that low-skilled workers first lose in terms of consumption and income but eventually gain. Policies that aim at expanding the skills of low-ability workers make them better off only moderately because of adverse general equilibrium effects. Low-ability workers typically benefit most from redistribution.

Our results from a common threshold model estimating the adjustment of gasoline prices and the spot oil price suggest a long-run relationship between retail and wholesale gasoline prices and the crude oil price.

Using external instruments in a structural VAR for identification, we estimate the response of domestic variables like the output gap, inflation, the exchange rate, stock prices, credit growth, and interest rates to an exogenous shock to debt- or equity-based capital inflows. An exogenous increase in debt inflows leads to a significant increase in the output gap, inflation, stock prices and credit growth and an appreciation of the exchange rate. An exogenous increase in equity-based capital inflows has almost no effect on the same variables. Thus the short-run macroeconomic effects of exogenous capital inflows are almost entirely due to changes in debt, not equity-based, capital inflows. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find no evidence of asymmetry in the response of job flows to positive and negative oil price innovations. We then inquire whether firms, when facing positive shocks, shed jobs faster than they create jobs. We show that positive innovations lead to a decline in net employment and an increase in job reallocation, possibly due to search and matching issues. Yet, the latter effect becomes statistically insignificant when we control for data mining. We demonstrate that the cumulative one-year effect of oil price shocks on job creation and destruction was smaller during the Great Moderation, but it was larger for gross job reallocation. These variations were caused by a change in the transmission channel and not by smaller oil price shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this context the need for modeling complex macroeconomic interactions, has led us to develop an upgraded compact global (macro) econometric GVAR model, which is capable of incorporating both the complex interdependencies that exist between the various economic entities and the fact that in the global economy more than one of these entities could have a predominant role, without neglecting the channels of trade and finance. Additionally, based on the trade weight matrix that lies in the core of the GVAR framework, we provide both an analytical procedure and an ex-post econometric criterion for the selection of dominant entities. We demonstrate the dynamics of our model by focusing on the impact of a potential slowdown in the BRICs on the US and EU17 economies. According to our findings, the dominant economies are those of the USA and EU17, while the results suggest that EU17 is more vulnerable than the USA to shocks from the BRICs, implying that a potential slowdown in the BRICs will primarily affect the EU17 economy. Clearly, the proposed model can be easily used for analyzing a number of transmission mechanisms, contagion effects and network interdependencies in various settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Self-esteem is of interest to economists because it is an established determinant of important socioeconomic outcomes such as wages, crime, marriage, health, and civic engagement. Previous research suggests that leaving school in a downturn can depress career trajectories, and social psychological theory predicts that career success is an important determinant of self-esteem. We model responses to a standard measure of self-esteem (the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale) as a function of the state unemployment rate at school-leaving. We address the potential endogeneity of time and location of school-leaving with instrumental variables. Our results suggest that leaving school in an economic downturn can undermine self-esteem over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse four countries, namely Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia and, for comparison, the US stock market. The sample period begins on May 1, 2004, and ends on April 30, 2013, i.e. it includes the 2007 US subprime crisis. We use the statistical method of dividing market states into bullish and bearish markets. Our results reveal October 2007-February 2009 as the common down-market period of the recent global financial crisis, except for Slovakia. It is instructive to formally identify crises, as it enables sensitivity analyses of various relationships and linkages among international stock markets using econometric and statistical tools, with respect to the pre-, post- and crisis periods. Moreover, we investigate the effect of increasing cross-market correlations in the crisis compared to the pre-crisis period, applying both standard contemporaneous correlations and volatility-adjusted correlation coefficients. The results confirm that accommodating heteroskedasticity is critical for detecting contagion across economies. A number of studies document that cross-market correlations vary over time, thereby making the benefits of international portfolio choice and diversification questionable.","[Olbrys, Joanna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Theoret Comp Sci, Bialystok, Poland; [Majewska, Elzbieta] Univ Bialystok, Fac Math & Informat, Inst Math, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology; University of Bialystok,"Olbrys, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Theoret Comp Sci, Bialystok, Poland.",j.olbrys@pb.edu.pl; elam@math.uwb.edu.pl,"Majewska, Elzbieta/AAB-6039-2021; Olbrys, Joanna/P-8237-2018","Majewska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-2914-7941; Olbrys, Joanna/0000-0002-0928-0040",,,,,41,20,20,0,25,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

A social choice function (SCF) is robustly partially implemented if it is perfect Bayesian incentive compatible for all possible beliefs. It is shown that this is possible if and only if the SCF is ex-post incentive compatible. Robust full implementation imposes the stronger condition that, for all possible beliefs, all Perfect Bayesian Equilibria induce outcomes consistent with the SCF. Characterizing the set of such equilibria is a key difficulty in studying this problem. This paper shows that, for a weaker notion of equilibrium, the set of all such equilibria can be computed by means of a recursive procedure which combines the logic of rationalizability and backward induction reasoning. These results are then used to show that, in environments with single-crossing preferences and well-behaved intertemporal effects, strict ex-post incentive compatibility and a condition which limits the strength of preference interdependencies are sufficient to guarantee robust full implementation.

This claim is evidenced by the amount of research and effort devoted to understanding South African-specific economics, interest rates and risks. The aim of this research is to debunk this perception with a simple yet robust and highly replicable statistical model (best-subsets regression) for the majority of the traded South African equity indices. We show how the South African equity market is mostly a one-way mirror of a confluence of international factors, all arguable largely unrelated to South Africa. We discuss why these models are currently less useful than their longer-term predictive averages and note the current relevance of including implied volatility and interest rates as predictors.","[Flint, Emlyn James] Peregrine Secur, 4th Floor Montclare Pl,21 Main Rd, ZA-7708 Cape Town, South Africa; [Polakow, Daniel Adam] Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, Actuarial Sci Div, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Flint, EJ (通讯作者)，Peregrine Secur, 4th Floor Montclare Pl,21 Main Rd, ZA-7708 Cape Town, South Africa.",emlynf@peregrine.co.za,,"Polakow, Daniel/0000-0003-2512-5638; Flint, Emlyn/0000-0003-0626-3525",,,,,38,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Under free trade, if the population growth rate is negative and its absolute value is small, the home country becomes an agricultural country. Then the long-run growth rate of per capita consumption is positive and depends on the world population growth rate. On the other hand, if the population growth rate is negative and its absolute value is large, the home country becomes a manufacturing country. Then the long-run growth rate of per capita consumption is positive and depends on both the home country and the world population growth rates.

We quantify model risk in a non-parametric way, i.e., in terms of the divergence from a so-called nominal model. Worst-case risk is defined as the maximal risk among all models within a given divergence ball. We derive several new results on how different divergence measures affect the worst case. Moreover, we present a novel, empirical way built on model confidence sets (MCS) for choosing the radius of the divergence ball around the nominal model, i.e., for calibrating the amount of model risk. We demonstrate the implications of heavy-tailed risks for the choice of the divergence measure and the empirical divergence estimation. For heavy-tailed risks, the simulation of the worst-case distribution is numerically intricate. We present a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which is suitable for this task. An extended practical example, assessing the robustness of a hedging strategy, illustrates our approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, we discuss the sources of asymmetric shocks causing exchange rate variability and the role of the RER as a shock absorber or generator. Secondly, we use data for 21 advanced and late transition economies to gauge the extent to which medium-term bilateral real exchange rate variability can be explained by various fundamental factors. Using Bayesian model averaging, we find that out of 22 factors under consideration, four types of dissimilarities within a given pair of economies are likely to be included in the true model: dissimilarities as regards (i) financial development, (ii) per capita income growth, (iii) central bank autonomy, and (iv) the structure of the economy. A regression based on these four factors indicates that they explain about 96 percent of the sample average level of three year RER variability. In the logic of our approach, the remaining part of the total variability represents an upper estimate of the influence of the foreign exchange market itself. For our sample, the contribution of the real exchange rate itself to asymmetric shocks therefore appears to be very low. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION,"On June 1, 2015, the Japanese government has announced that the fuel mix will consist of nuclear generation with a range between 20% and 22% and renewable generation with a range between 22% and 24% of the total electricity generation by 2030. A difficulty in understanding the governmental future energy plan is that it does not contain any scientific evidence concerning why Japan needs to maintain the amount of nuclear generation and that of renewable at the level between 20% and 22% and between 22% and 24%, respectively. To investigate the future energy plan, this study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a methodology. The proposed DEA approach incorporates the property of translation invariance. The property indicates that an efficiency measure should not be influenced even if inputs and/or outputs are shifted toward a same direction by adding or subtracting a specific real number. The property makes it possible that we can evaluate the performance of organizations, whose production factors (i.e., inputs, desirable and undesirable outputs) contain many zeros and negative values in a data set. Such an occurrence of zero and negative in production factors is widely observed in many DEA performance evaluations. This study first uses the desirable property for DEA environmental assessment in a time horizon. The proposed DEA environmental assessment identifies that the reasonable ranges for Japanese future fuel mix are (a) combustible fuel generation within the range between 34.5% and 56.1%, (b) hydro generation within the range between 22.4% and 40.5%, (c) nuclear generation within the range between 10.4% and 13.7%, (d) pumped hydro generation within the range between 3.9% and 6.9% and (e) renewable generation within the range between 3.7% and 8.4%, all of which are measured by these generation capacities. It is clearly identified that the future fuel mix proposed by the Japanese government is inconsistent with the estimated one, which we determine by relatively comparing it with the energy structures of 33 industrial nations. The comparison indicates that the Japanese future energy plan will be too ambitious to implement the future goal. It is easily envisioned that the energy plan will have a considerable difficulty in future. It is hoped that the electric power industry can access drastic technological advancements, including eco-technology innovation, and then Japan will be able to change the future direction on fuel mix as the government expects.

This paper estimates industry contribution to economic growth in both Canada and the United States. It argues that industry contribution should be evaluated on the basis of the performance of an industry in terms of creating economic value relative to other industries. In particular, it calls for the quantity and the price effects, which is consistent with real GDP in the chained-Fisher index that values the industry more when its price rises and less when its price declines. This is an important departure from the traditional methodologies that consider only quantity effect. This paper shows that the contribution from demand-driven industries is significantly more than the finding based on traditional thinking.","[Tang, Jianmin] Ind Canada, Ottawa, ON K2G 7B8, Canada; [Wang, Weimin] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Tang, JM (通讯作者)，Ind Canada, 235 Queen St,Room 1006C, Ottawa, ON K2G 7B8, Canada.",jianmin.tang@ic.gc.ca,"JIANMIN, TANG/JBS-6054-2023","JIANMIN, TANG/0000-0001-6091-9682",,,,,27,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Possible reasons for the contradictory evidence include minimal price variation within a city, greater homogeneity of household units, more being spend on rent leading to greater benefits of sharing living space, and application of the unitary household model to a more appropriate setting.

The empirical results demonstrate that higher income inequality within cities is significantly related to a higher housing cost burden, a smaller per capita living space, and lower housing quality for low-income households. Further studies demonstrate that the negative impacts of income inequality could be moderated by product differentiation in housing markets, as a higher degree of differentiation in the size of housing units corresponds to a smaller effect of income inequality on housing affordability.

However, African firm-or sector-level studies have failed to identify a similarly strong effect for average worker schooling levels on productivity. This has been interpreted as evidence that schooling does not increase productivity levels, but may also indicate that the schooling effect cannot be identified when using a schooling measure with limited variation. Using a novel South African industry-level dataset that spans a longer period than typical firm-level panels, this article identifies a large and significant schooling effect. This result is highly robust across different estimators that allow for correlated industry effects, measurement error, heterogeneous production technologies and cross-sectional dependence.","[Burger, Rulof P.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Burger, Rulof P.; Teal, Francis J.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Studies African Econ, Oxford, England",Stellenbosch University; University of Oxford,"Burger, RP (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, CGW Schumann Bldg, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",rulof@sun.ac.za,"Burger, Rulof/AAA-5632-2020","Burger, Rulof/0000-0002-5800-4528",,,,,44,4,4,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The Balassa-Samuelson (1964) model predicts that a rise in the sectoral productivity ratio by 1% raises the relative price of non tradables by 1% while leaving the non traded wage-traded wage ratio unchanged. Applying cointegration methods to a panel of fourteen OECD countries over the period 1970-2007, our estimates show that the relative price rises by only 0.78% and the relative wage falls by 0.27%. While our first set of empirical findings cast doubt on the quantitative predictions of the Balassa-Samuelson model, our second set of evidence highlights the role of imperfect labor mobility: the relative price responds more to a productivity differential between tradables and non tradables while the reaction of the relative wage is more muted in countries with higher intersectoral reallocation of labor. We show that the ability of the two-sector model to account for our evidence quantitatively relies upon two ingredients: i) imperfect mobility of labor across sectors, and ii) physical capital accumulation. Finally, our numerical results reveal that the model predicts the relative price response fairly well, and to a lesser extent the relative wage response. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that the two risk attitude measures are at best only weakly correlated. Only the questionnaire measure shows high test-retest stability, while virtually no such stability is found in the lottery-choice task. In addition, only the questionnaire measure shows the expected correlations with a Big Five personality measure and is correlated with actual risk-taking behavior. With respect to behavior in the trust game, we find a high retest stability of transfers.

Using the firm-level employment data reported in the Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprises, we find that net employment in the Chinese manufacturing sector has been expanding since 2002 at an average rate of 5.4%. The underlying forces of this are the simultaneous job creation and job destruction affected by not only the reforms on SOEs, but also the changes in the foreign trade environment. Increasing China's openness to international trade and engagement in the global economy has affected the rate of job reallocation significantly and extensively. It is clear from parametric analyses at the industry level that trade liberalization has encouraged job creation and generated net job growth and that the depreciation of industry-specific real exchange rates has led to a significant increase in net employment by reducing the rate of job destruction.

This pattern may be related to the relative competitiveness of each country: Japanese firms are strong in electronics and automobiles, where production process improvement is important, while US firms flourish in science-based industries, such as pharmaceuticals and software, where interacting with the local science base is a critical factor.","[Motohashi, Kazuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Motohashi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Dept Technol Management Innovat, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",motohashi@tmi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Motohashi, Kazuyuki/AAY-8180-2021; MOtohashi, Kazuyuki/GXH-8257-2022","Motohashi, Kazuyuki/0000-0003-0985-5331;",,,,,36,5,5,3,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2015,23.0,6,,,,,1,21,,10.1111/cwe.12133,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CX9RV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366043900001,0

Although some studies point to lower dropout rates, most do not follow a large number of students over time or account for student and school characteristics expected to influence one's educational path. We fill this gap in the current literature by tracking nearly 175,000 first-time 9th-graders for 5 years using survival analysis with longitudinal administrative data from Texas. We find that cumulative credits in the arts are consistently associated with reduced dropout, even after controlling for prior achievement and contemporaneous course completion in core subjects.

Despite the efforts exerted by countries in the region, little has been known about the EMI progress. This paper innovatively applies the dynamic principal component analysis to measure the EMI and its evolution in East Asia between 1995 and 2011. The EMI is measured by using information from all the five dimensions that have been identified in the literature: (1) energy trade liberalisation; (2) investment liberalisation; (3) development of energy infrastructure and its associated institutional arrangements; (4) domestic market openness; and (5) energy pricing reform. Results show that although significant progress has been made for EMI in East Asia, there are significant crosscountry disparities in different aspects. Moreover, we show that further efforts towards EMI in general should focus on liberalising national markets first, then phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and finally, liberalising investment regime since national market liberalisation is the least developed dimensions. Certain countries that lag behind in EMI need to learn from either their past experiences or from other nations and focus their efforts on their relatively weak dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The case of Ukraine is exceptionally interesting because the particularly severe contagion from the global financial crisis turned into a prolonged economic crisis resulting in large loan loss provisions. It seems, however, that both macroeconomic and bank-specific variables have an effect on loan quality as the banks have not been uniformly affected by the crisis. It seems that banks that do not specialise in loans were particularly affected with deteriorating asset quality.

It includes 12 producers, 12 households, government and 2 external sectors. There are four types of labour and real wages that depend on unemployment rates. Private investment is determined by private savings and public and external surpluses. Domestic products and imports are imperfect substitutes. All exogenous variables and tax parameters are updated every year with the best available information. The model provides rather accurate predictions in 1991, a normal year, but it underestimates the intensity of the 1992-1993 recession. It also predicts dramatic reversals of trade balances in response to devaluations. These results suggest both that investment savings-driven models provide useful insights in the medium term but underestimate the consequences of downturns, and that Armington's elascitities typically assumed may be too large.","[Polo, Clemente] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Viejo, Raimundo] Agencia Turismo Galicia, Hotel Management Sch Galicia, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Polo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",clemente.polo@uab.es,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Spain [SEJ2007-61046],Ministry of Science and Technology of Spain(Spanish Government),The authors acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Spain [grant number SEJ2007-61046].,,30,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We examine its influence on agribusiness goals and decisions in the Argentine Pampas. Study 1, a survey of agribusinesses, finds differences in goal focus based on land ownership: Ownership positively predicts a focus on longer-term economic and social goals, as well as pro-environmental attitudes. Land ownership negatively predicts short-term profitability goal focus, which in turn mediates the use of futures/options to maximize profit, and influences land use for cash crops. Study 2 unpacks within-business differences via interviews with agribusiness that farm both owned and rented land. Ownership-based differences are observed in underlying intentions: the same individual focuses on enhancing the value of owned land, but on maximizing returns from rented land. This focus on deriving immediate value may be motivated by the initial rental cost incurred by the tenant, which can be thought of as a loss, making immediate profitability a more salient goal. This short-term focus, though logical in light of prevailing one-year leases in the Pampas, ignores that over 85% of leases are renewed by the same agribusiness, suggesting that the same tenant may well be the person facing future consequences. We explore the possibility that tenants may be effectively caught in a two-person social dilemma with their future selves. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, if consolidation reduces competition in the local school market and reduces efficiency, any savings from exploiting economies of scale may be lost to increased inefficiency. We use a stochastic cost function to investigate these effects for districts in Texas. We find important economies of scale, but we also find that increased market concentration leads to increased cost inefficiency. Finally, we illustrate the practical importance of these two potentially offsetting factors in a simulation that considers consolidating Texas school districts to county-level districts. We find that failure to consider the effect on competition can lead to large overestimates of the benefits of consolidation.","[Gronberg, Timothy J.; Jansen, Dennis W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Karakaplan, Mustafa U.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Persons Disabil, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Taylor, Lori L.] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Jansen, DW (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",tjg@econmail.tamu.edu; dennisjansen@tamu.edu; mukarakaplan@yahoo.com; lltaylor@tamu.edu,"Taylor, Lori/AAH-2766-2019; Karakaplan, Mustafa/AAG-7441-2020","Karakaplan, Mustafa/0000-0003-2869-4553",Education Research Center at Texas AM; Private Enterprise Research Center,Education Research Center at Texas AM; Private Enterprise Research Center,"The authors thank the Education Research Center at Texas A&M for research support on this project.

We build and estimate an equilibrium search model with education, marriage/divorce/remarriage, and household labor supply decisions. A key feature of the model is that women bear a larger share of the divorce burden, mainly because they are more closely tied to their children relative to men. Our focus on education is motivated by the fact that divorce laws typically allow spouses to keep the future returns from their human capital upon divorce (unlike their physical assets), making education a good insurance in divorce. In the model, women overtake men in college attainment during the 1990s, a feature of the data that has proved challenging to explain. Our counterfactual experiments indicate that the divorce law reform of the 1970s played an important role in these trends, explaining more than one-quarter of college attainment rate of women post-1970s and one-half of the rise in labor supply for married women. Further, results suggest a higher insurance value of education in divorce than marriage market signaling benefits of education especially for women post divorce reform. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of endogenous peer effects is achieved by exploiting a scheme that extended free school meal entitlement to all children in some areas.

Randomly selected individuals from villages in Bangladesh were invited to take part in dictator experiments where they received endowments worth up to five months of average household income and were asked to distribute the endowment between themselves and other individuals. We manipulated whether dictators could GIVE to or TAKE from another individual (i.e. whether the endowment was allocated to the dictator or other individual) and whether the endowment was moderate (LOW) or very large (HIGH). We also provided dictators with the option to reconsider their original decision. We find that dictators allocate almost nine times more to other individuals under the TAKE than the GIVE frame when stakes are HIGH, even after they could reconsider their choices. In addition, we find that proportions allocated to other individuals dramatically drop when stakes increase under the GIVE but not the TAKE frame. The results provide novel evidence on the role of framing and stakes for pro-sociality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our experiment tests predictions that the decision to trust an unknown other can be motivated by exogenous factors. We consider the effects of changes to incentives as well as psychological state by manipulating the trustors' possible gains from trusting and their mood. Results indicate that a happy mood, as well as higher possible gains from trusting, increase the likelihood of trust behavior. The motivating power of these incentives, however, depends on the mood of the trustor. We also find that a happy mood motivates a higher degree of trust, while higher potential gains from trusting do not. Implications for trustworthiness behaviors are also discussed.

Empirical contribution of the paper is numerical evaluation of the approximation of the ideal band-pass filters in the discussion of the filters' theoretical properties (gain and attenuation within the business cycle frequencies, as well as the leakage in the remaining frequencies). We consider the truncation factor for the Baxter-King filter and the sample size for the latter two. We show that the leakage and attenuation of the Christiano-Fitzgerald and the Hamming window filter perform similarly across the range of chosen sample sizes and better than the Baxter-King filter. Moreover, we apply the filters to data of selected EU countries and point out differences in their estimation of growth business cycles. Our findings indicate that Christiano-Fitzgerald filter and the Hamming window both are appropriate for the identification of a business cycle.

Multiple studies attributed such persistence to sunk market-entry costs. This paper shows that similar patterns of exporting are also consistent with a learning mechanism and finds a strong empirical support for such a mechanism in the context of Colombian plant-level data. Second, the paper empirically discriminates between the two competing theories, and finds that once learning is controlled for, the role of sunk costs in generating export persistence is at most forty percent of what is currently estimated in the literature. Finally, while in differentiated-products industries export persistence arises primarily due to learning, in the homogeneous-products industries such persistence arises primarily due to the sunk-cost mechanism.

Perturbing the model with a slightly broader class of behavioral types that allows the informed player to delay making his initial demand still achieves powerful equilibrium refinement. But there is substantial delay to agreement, and predictions depend continuously on the ex ante probabilities of the patient and impatient types of the informed player, counter to what the literature suggests.","[Abreu, Dilip] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Pearce, David; Stacchetti, Ennio] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",Princeton University; New York University,"Abreu, D (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dabreu@princeton.edu; david.pearce@nyu.edu; ennio.stacchetti@nyu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [0922125, 0922167]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0922167] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922125] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Awards 0922125 and 0922167.

We derive conditions under which adaptive learning obtains in such setting and show that, when actions are strategic substitutes, the information structure affects the speed of convergence: while more precise private information is beneficial, better public information has negative effects. We also show that adaptive learning dynamics converge to the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which means that agents can learn to act strategically by relying only on observable (exogenous) information.

Using a two-stage stochastic programming approach, model results suggest that the two most critical risks in the near-term planning process of the uncertainties considered here are natural gas prices and the stringency of climate policy. Stochastic strategies indicate that some near-term hedging from lower-cost wind and nuclear may occur but robustly demonstrate that delaying investment and waiting for more information can be optimal to avoid stranding capital-intensive assets. Hedging strategies protect against downside losses while retaining the option value of deferring irreversible commitments until more information is available about potentially lucrative market opportunities. These results are explained in terms of the optionality of investments in the electric power sector, leading to more general in-sights about uncertainty, learning, and irreversibility. The stochastic solution is especially valuable if decision-makers do not sufficiently account for the potential of climate constraints in future decades or if fuel price projections are outdated.

I find that restrictions reduced the average occupational standing of Chinese immigrants, suggesting substitution between observed and unobserved skills. Conversely, children of restricted immigrants have greater human capital than those of unrestricted immigrants, despite restricted immigrants themselves having lower skill. This suggests particularly strong intergenerational transmission of skill among Chinese immigrants of the exclusion era.

We use the performance of foreign banks as the benchmark because foreign banks, subject to intensive worldwide competition, are perceived as possessing superior governing structure and organization, more advanced technologies and better trained labor force. On the other hand, competition in China's banking sector is mainly in the form of nonprice measures, thus putting foreign banks at a disadvantage. We find domestic banks have gradually caught up the cost advantage of foreign banks in a manner consistent with the increased competitive pressure. On the other hand, the profit advantage of domestic banks over foreign banks is widening because of institutional arrangements, cultural and social networks as well as the profit scope and revenue scale economy.

In this paper, I analyze households' optimal mortgage and unsecured loan borrowing and default decisions in the context of the recent recession. I model households as able to default on mortgage debt to walk away from capital losses, at the price of foreclosure. However, a household can also default on unsecured debt to maintain its home, in exchange for a longer exclusion from credit markets following default. Depending on the costs of each alternative, financially constrained households exhibit heterogeneity in optimal default decisions. Next, I analyze how mortgage loan modification policies, after a sudden drop in house prices, affect household choices in the mortgage and unsecured loan markets. The quantitative exercise shows that the government-driven mortgage rnodification program, initiated in 2009, reduces the mortgage default rate by 0.27% points. However, this increases the unsecured loan charge-off rate by 0.66% points. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Direct and indirect transmission channels to growth are investigated. Financial integration commonly influences growth through encouraging cross border capital flows, transferring technologies and managerial expertise and promoting risk sharing. These market developments that are realized translate into enhanced access to finance as intermediation channels improve. Our empirical results are in line with previous literature in that financial depth does occur in the wake of the financial integration era and positively influences growth in Botswana. Not withholding, our results reveal that market depth has not promoted access to private sector's credit in Botswana so far. To a larger extent, a negative impact of financial integration on growth is observed as there could be short-term risks associated with increased financial openness. Nonetheless, an indirect, significant and positive influence from financial integration through financial access to growth is also observed. This indirect transmission demonstrates that financial integration increases financial innovation which in turn fosters growth in the country. Financial innovation enhances service delivery and improves access to financial services. We observe a positive influence from macroeconomic and institutional variables implying prevalence of sound and prudent supervisory structure and the rule of law in Botswana. Policy wise, there is still need and scope for greater financial integration, financial development and financial access which can contribute to national development goals of sustainable economic growth, diversification, employment creation and poverty reduction in Botswana.

For French conventionalists (FCs), convention coordinates behavior in complex market situations. Brazilian economist Fabio Erber contributed to this debate by formulating a concept of development convention (DC) and thus making this subject particularly interesting to economists and policymakers in developing countries. Because development refers to long-term structural changes, DCs are identified over the long term. Further, multiple DCs can coexist in a given society; however, only one can be hegemonic or dominant at any particular point in time. DCs can be revealed by examining the historical evidence pertaining to that society. Accordingly, this paper analyzes the Brazilian development experience during the latter half of the twentieth century. There has been a struggle for hegemony between two types of DCs in Brazil: the pro-growth state-led DC and the pro-stability free-market DC. From World War II until the 1970s, the former DC was hegemonic, but it has since been replaced by the pro-stability free-market DC. The conservative conduct of monetary policy in Brazil since the 1990s has been built on the hegemony of the stability convention. This perspective has created space for a research program based on political economy and devoted to the study of Brazilian contemporary monetary policy, which helps explain why Brazil has consistently maintained the world's highest interest rates for so long.","[Modenesi, Andre De Melo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Modenesi, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,CNPq,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),Our special thanks to Fernando J.C.

I develop a model of the international commodity supply chain, with monopolistically competitive final goods producers and consumers who value the ethical quality of goods. A small number of oligopsonistic intermediaries purchase the raw commodity from farmers in a given country and then sell to final goods producers in the world market I consider the effects of a Fairtrade program that is too small to have an effect on the world price of the commodity. I show that the Fairtrade program decreases the intermediaries' market power and consequently, even farmers that are not selected into the program receive a higher wage than in the absence of the program. I establish the Pareto optimal Fairtrade price and assess the overall efficiency of the program. The program is a more efficient way to transfer income to farmers than a direct transfer equal to the premium commanded by certified products if the Fairtrade price is not set too high above the efficient wage for farmers. If the number of intermediaries were large, however, then the direct transfer would be more efficient than the program for all binding Fairtrade prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It can be used to identify not only global spatial patterns in the country, but also characteristic locations at micro levels. In this research, we used spatial autocorrelation methodologies, including Global Moran's I and Local Getis-Ord Gi statistics to identify the intensity of the spatial clustering of municipalities in Serbia by the level of average monthly net earnings from 2001 to 2010. We identified and mapped local clusters (hot and cold spots) by the level of average monthly net earnings for the same period. The results show that overall spatial segregation between municipalities with high and low average monthly net earnings was predominantly increasing during the investigated period. Local statistics illustrated that overall spatial segregation followed a broad north-south divide, with a concentration of municipalities with high net earnings in the north of Serbia, and low net earnings in the south. Closer inspection showed that at the beginning of the study period, there were three statistically significant hot spots in the north. As time passed, only one highly clustered hot spot remained - the Belgrade region. One cold spot retained a relatively stable position in the country's southeast. This research shows that spatial changes of net earnings can be successfully studied with respect to statistically significant global and local spatial associations in the variables using spatial autocorrelation analysis.","[Stankov, Ugljesa; Dragicevic, Vanja] Univ Novi Sad, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Fac Sci, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Stankov, U (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Fac Sci, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",ugljesa.stankov@dgt.uns.ac.rs; vanja.dragicevic@dgt.uns.ac.rs,"Pavlukovic, Vanja/AAO-4957-2020; Stankov, Uglješa/ABV-0997-2022","Stankov, Uglješa/0000-0002-7731-592X; Pavlukovic, Vanja/0000-0001-7093-3656","Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development of the Vojvodina Province, Serbia [114-451-2644/2014-01]","Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development of the Vojvodina Province, Serbia","This paper is part of project No. 114-451-2644/2014-01 funded by the Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development of the Vojvodina Province, Serbia.",,36,8,9,1,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Video game platforms compete for software publishers and garners and may invest into in-house publishing of own software (games) before they enter competition. Such investments affect the strength of the indirect network externalities between gamers and publishers in equilibrium. If publishers multihome, i.e., if they can release games for multiple platforms, and garners singlehome, i.e., if they use only a single platform, in-house games reduce the profits obtained by platforms in equilibrium. Consequently, one may suppose that they refrain from investing into in-house games. However, the analysis reveals that an equilibrium where platforms credibly commit to do so cannot be sustained, transforming the game into a prisoner's dilemma. This no longer holds if gamers also multihome, granting monopoly power to platforms on both sides of the market. The benefit obtained by garners and the level of social welfare are always enhanced with in-house publishing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, recent studies focusing on precise and unbiased estimates of effects of economic integration agreements (EIAs) on members' trade may be biased upward owing to inadequate control for time-varying exogenous unobservable country-pair-specific changes in bilateral export costs (possibly decreasing the costs of international relative to intranational trade); we find evidence of this bias using a properly specified gravity equation. Second, our novel methodology yields statistically significant estimates of the declining effect of international borders on world trade, now accounting for endogenous EIA formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity in initial levels. Third, we confirm recent evidence providing a solution to the distance-elasticity puzzle, but show that these estimates of the declining effect of distance on international trade are biased upward by not accounting for endogenous EIA formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity. We conclude our study with numerical general equilibrium comparative statics illustrating a substantive difference on trade effects of EIAs with and without allowance for the declining effects of international borders on world trade.

I combine unique micro-data from a large Swedish occupational pension plan with rich national administrative data to study the choice between life annuities and fixed-term payouts with a minimum payout length of 5 years for 183,000 retiring white-collar workers. I find that low accumulation of assets is strongly associated with the choice of the 5-year payout. Consistent with individuals selecting payout length based on private information about their mortality prospects, individuals who choose the 5-year payout are in worse health, exhibit higher ex-post mortality rates and have shorter-lived parents than annuitants.

The profitability of hiring a worker to a fast-track job depends not only on his or her observable talent, but also on incontractible effort. We investigate whether self-fulfilling expectations may lead to higher hiring or promotion standards for women. If employers expect women to do more household work than men, thereby exerting less effort in their paid job, then women must be more talented to make it profitable to hire them. Specialization in the family will then result in women doing most of the household work. Such self-fulfilling prophecies can be defeated by affirmative action or family policy. However, it is unlikely that temporary policy can move the economy to a symmetric equilibrium: policy must be made permanent. Anti-discrimination policy need not enhance efficiency, and from a distribution viewpoint this is a policy with both winners and losers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Population planning has been integral in Singapore's national development strategy, balancing the economy's needs for more and better qualified workers with social considerations such as the dependency burden and the integration of large numbers of foreigners in a global city-state. This paper considers Singapore's population and manpower planning policies, with an account of the country's passage through the various stages of its demographic transition, and how its working age population composition has evolved. Population and labor force policies are examined with specific consideration of the social, economic and political implications resulting from those policy choices. A final section considers the challenges for the future stemming from these demographic trends.","[Teng, Yap Mui; Gee, Christopher] Inst Policy Studies, Singapore 259599, Singapore",,"Teng, YM (通讯作者)，Inst Policy Studies, 1C Cluny Rd,House 5, Singapore 259599, Singapore.",yap.muiteng@nus.edu.sg; christopher.gee@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,33,3,3,1,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Vice versa, relative labor costs affect real exchange rate dynamics. The optimal choice of exchange rate regimes cannot neglect this nexus. We assess such a choice using a two-country model with frictional labor markets. The monetary authority faces a tension between the classical insulating property of floating exchange rates and the destabilizing effects of currency fluctuations on (relative) job flows. Results show that the second motive is important: optimal monetary policy prescribes (some) response to the exchange rate.

For that purpose, an applied model of general equilibrium was built, which includes, among some other things: a disaggregation of homes in 10 income levels, the tax and transferring structures of the country, and the productive and consumer spheres. The scenario confirms that to achieve a significant addition in tax collection, and, at the same time, to diminish the income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient), imply increases of rates and bases, which is difficult to achieve in the present conditions.","[Casares, Enrique R.; Guadalupe Garcia, Maria S.; Ruiz, Lucia A.

Our answer is based on archaeological, historical and ethnographic as well as contemporary evidence over the past three thousand years. The countries exemplifying the Nordic model are not exceptionally equal in the ownership of material wealth. Moreover, the advent of social democracy in the Nordic nations did not result in a more equal distribution of years of schooling. But intergenerational economic and social mobility appears to be exceptional in the Nordic nations, and by most measures, inequalities in living standards in the Nordic economies are less than in other advanced economies. The closest Nordic analogy in our data set is to the egalitarian distribution of well-being and limited intergenerational transmission of wealth found in some horticultural and (especially) forager economies.

Our Bayesian approach combines estimates obtained from ARMA, ARFIMA, and ARIMA specifications so that it is able to take into account model uncertainty. Exact posterior distributions corresponding to all the features of interest (fractional orders of integration, impulse responses, HLs, etc.) are derived. Our results suggest that model uncertainty is high, which implies that uncertainty estimates can be severely biased downwards when the former is not explicitly considered. In spite of that, support for the long-run holding of the PPP is substantial in most countries. However, the speed at which this happens seems to be much slower than what has been suggested, as shown by the fact that the probability of the HL lying in the three-to five-year interval is very small.","[Gadea, Maria Dolores] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Mayoral, Laura] CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Madrid, Spain; [Mayoral, Laura] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics,"Gadea, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ, Gran Via 4, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",lgadea@unizar.es; laura.mayoral@iae.csic.es,"Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/K-1547-2014","Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-6609-4247","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2011-30260-C03-02, ECO2011-25293]; Axa research fund",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Axa research fund(AXA Research Fund),"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (ECO2011-30260-C03-02 to M.D.G., ECO2011-25293 to L.M.); Axa research fund.",,50,2,2,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Building on a multi-region global modeling framework, we explicitly consider both indigenous R&D and foreign technology diffusion as the dual drivers of endogenous technical change (ETC) for domestic carbon savings. Simulation results show that 1) traditional economic globalization policies like trade and FDI liberalization can boost the growth of production output, but this is at the cost of more fossil energy uses and carbon emissions; 2) technology globalization policies like removals of technology transfer barriers can facilitate the inflows of foreign technologies for domestic carbon savings; and 3) domestic emission control policies have an effect to induce restructuring and reorganization of production technology into a knowledge-intensive one and thus help lower climate compliance costs. Consequently, to create China's domestic carbon savings from globalization, policy should focus on promoting cross-country technology diffusion, beyond traditional cross-border transactions of product and capital goods. Domestic emission-based climate regulation should also be implemented to create market demand for carbon-efficient technologies and thus induce inflows of foreign advanced technologies.

For an empirically relevant parametrization of sectoral production functions, an increase in the share of services in GDP reduces both aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) growth and volatility, thus reducing GDP growth and volatility. When the model is calibrated to the US manufacturing and service sector, the rise of the service sector occurring as income grows can account for a large fraction of the differences in per capita GDP growth and volatility between high-income economies and upper middle income economies.

Even if we fail to find a long-run relationship between aggregate output and total employment, there are long-run relationships for the aggregate output with non-agricultural employment and sectoral employment levels for seven of nine sectors that we consider. However, a further investigation for the output and employment relationship within a short-run perspective does not reveal statistically significant relationships for either total employment or non-agriculture employment, or eight of the nine sectors that we consider. Although there are various long-run relationships between output and employment, the short-run links between demand and employment are weak. The various implications of this for the economy and the labour market are discussed. As a result, maintaining high levels of output in the long-run creating demand is essential for employment generation.","[Sahin, Afsin] Gazi Univ, Dept Banking, Sch Banking & Insurance, TR-06571 Ankara, Turkey; [Tansel, Aysit] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Tansel, Aysit] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Tansel, Aysit] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Tansel, Aysit] Econ Res Forum ERF, Cairo, Egypt; [Berument, M.

This paper offers an overview of the strengths and limitations in current empirical research on the measurement of state capacity. The paper also surveys the fast emerging literature on the determinants and effects of state capacity. We argue that existing measures on governance quality used in cross-national research can be usefully exploited to capture different aspects of state capacity, and show that post the end of the Cold War, developing economies have experienced improvements in legal, administrative and bureaucratic capacity, but the gap with advanced economies is still wide. Future research should address the short temporal coverage of available measures of state capacity, as well as providing a systematic quantitative assessment of the determinants of capacity and of its effects on development outcomes, such as health and education, which have not received sufficient scrutiny.","[Savoia, Antonio; Sen, Kunal] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Savoia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,"Savoia, Antonio/T-1168-2019","Savoia, Antonio/0000-0003-0639-9705",,,,,77,45,56,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The purpose is to analyze the tax policy implications of gender norms represented by a market work norm for men and household work norm for women. We show how the optimal (corrective) tax policy depends on the definition of social norms, the preferences for obeying these norms, and whether men or women have the comparative advantage in market work. Two extreme results are that (i) corrective taxation should not be used at all if the norms are based on the mean value of market work and household work, respectively, given that all households have the same preferences, and (ii) only the majority household type should be taxed at the margin if the norms are instead based on the modal value.

Rolling regressions are also performed, and show the existence of some elasticities instability over time, fundamentally related to the profound economic and institutional changes affecting the clothing trade in the period under consideration. The analysis suggests that most advanced economies, including Hong Kong, changed their position in the global value chain towards an organizational'' role.

The model provides a counterintuitive result: that equilibrium congestion can become worse as the quantity restriction becomes more severe. Intuitively, stricter regulation makes the detection probability lower due to the crowding effect, which makes agents more likely to violate the regulation. The effect of the regulation standard is, however, not monotonic. This implies that the optimal standard should be neither too strict nor too permissive.

J,"Di Giovinazzo, V; Naimzada, A",,,,"Di Giovinazzo, Viviana; Naimzada, Ahmad",,,A model of fashion: Endogenous preferences in social interaction,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fashion cycles; Endogenous preferences; Snob and bandwagon effects; Bifurcation; Complex dynamics,,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of the fashion cycle as originally described by Simmel (1904). The theoretical models used in the more recent economic literature (Coelho and McClure, 1993; Corneo and Jeanne, 1997; Karni and Schmeidler, 1990; Matsuyama, 1992; Stigler and Becker, 1977) have the undeniable advantage of making the cycle widely applicable, and consequently appropriate for the analysis of the most varied fields of consumption activity. However, in the process, the originality of Simmel's thought has been lost. Since they are built on the principles of standard economics, the above-mentioned models generally assume that preferences are exogenous and overlook the fact that individual tastes change in time, partly in line with choices previously made by the social group. The present paper proposes a model of the fashion cycle in which conspicuous consumption 'snob' and 'bandwagon' preferences (Leibenstein, 1950) are determined endogenously and depend on previous consumption experience, both personal and that of other consumers. Thus the particular contribution of this work in comparison to the preceding economic literature is dual in nature. By assuming preferences to be endogenous, it reflects more accurately the dynamics causing perpetual motion in the fashion cycle. By assuming preferences to be shaped through the social interaction of a heterogeneous community of individuals, the model manages to identify more closely the psycho-sociological nuances that, according to Simmel, give rise to the cycle.

A key theme of cognitive economics is finite cognition (often misleadingly called bounded rationality), which poses theoretical challenges that call for versatile approaches. Cognitive economics brings a rich toolbox to the task of understanding a complex world.","Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kimball, M (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,"National Institute on Aging [P01-AG026571, R01-AG040787]",National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),Conversations with Robert Willis inspired this paper.

The methodology is used to calculate the PPP between the Indian Rupee and the Vietnamese Dong. The study allows for regional variation in preferences and price changes both inside the country and between countries. It proposes and applies a methodology for constructing prices from unit values after adjusting them for quality and demographic effects. The adjusted unit values are used as prices in the demand estimations, and the demand parameter estimates are used to calculate both spatial prices within each country and the PPP between the two countries within a consistent framework. The study illustrates the usefulness of preference consistent methods to calculate the PPP by applying the PPPs to compare living standards between India and Vietnam. The significance of the results follows from the fact that the levels of living comparisons are quite sensitive to the PPP used in converting the Rupee expenditure into Vietnamese Dong. The present results on food PPPs question the relevance of the PPPs from the ICP project in cross-country welfare comparisons especially in a period of high food inflation.","[Majumder, Amita] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India; [Ray, Ranjan; Sinha, Kompal] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; Monash University,"Majumder, A (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, Kolkata, India.",amita@isical.ac.in,"sinha, kompal/GMX-3941-2022","Sinha, Kompal/0000-0003-4318-6100; Ray, Ranjan/0000-0002-0411-6268",Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Note: Part of this research was carried out when Amita Majumder visited the Economics Department in Monash University in July 2011.

This result implies that, other things held the same, the higher the LABMKTFREE index, the greater the FLFPR.

This paper contributes to the literature by addressing these two issues via a heterogeneous firm model of a small open economy with endogenous firm entry and VAT compliance. The results found indicate that the VAT collected on intermediate inputs consumed by the informal sector not only reduces the benefits of evading VAT, but also diminishes the production distortion between the formal and the informal sectors. The use of a change in the VAT threshold to offset lost tariff revenue leads to welfare gains; however, the source of such gains is different from that of a change in the VAT rate. While an increase in the VAT rate expands informality, a revenue-equivalent decrease in the VAT threshold reduces informality. These novel results suggest that the VAT threshold plays an important role in the design of revenue-neutral tax reforms.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13104 USA",Syracuse University,"Paz, LS (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13104 USA.",lspaz@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Paz, Lourenco/0000-0001-8953-6087",,,,,38,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The regulator should optimally offer a menu of incentive compatible two-part tariffs. If the firm's energy efficiency activities have a high impact on demand reduction, the consumer should pay a high fixed fee but a low per unit price, approximating the tariff structure to a decoupling policy, which strengthens the firm's incentives to pursue energy conservation. Instead, if the firm's effort to adopt energy efficiency actions is scarcely effective, the tariff is characterized by a low fixed fee but a high price per unit of energy consumed, thus shifting the incentives for energy conservation on consumers. The optimal tariff structure also depends on the cost of the consumer's effort (in case the consumer can also adopt energy efficiency measures) and on the degree of substitutability between the consumer's and the firm's efforts.

After the policy change, the observed pricing pattern shifted from cost-based to sticky-leadership pricing. Second, using a dif-in-dif estimation and a synthetic control group, we show that the causal effect of the new policy was to significantly increase prices through sticky-leadership pricing.

Using firm-level data on multinationals located in France, we show that firms are more likely to outsource the production of intermediate inputs to external suppliers when importing from countries with high worker bargaining power. This effect is stronger for firms operating in capital-intensive and differentiated industries. We propose a theoretical mechanism that rationalizes these findings. The fragmentation of the value chain weakens the workers' bargaining position, by limiting the amount of revenues that are subject to union extraction. The outsourcing strategy reduces the share of surplus that is appropriated by the union, which enhances the firm's incentives to invest. Since investment creates relatively more value in capital-intensive industries, increases in worker bargaining power are more likely to be conducive to outsourcing in those industries. Overall, our findings suggest that global firms choose their organizational structure strategically when sourcing intermediate inputs from markets where worker bargaining power is high.

Using firm-level data from the Gulf Arab stock markets, we find that stocks that are more sensitive to oil price changes indeed yield significantly higher returns, suggesting that oil price exposure can serve as a return predictor in these stock markets. However, we also find that it is the absolute exposure of a stock that drives returns, suggesting fluctuations in the oil price as a source of stock return premia in these markets. Our tests further suggest that a portfolio strategy based on a stock's absolute exposure to oil price risk yields significant positive subsequent returns as well, suggesting an investment strategy based on the absolute oil price risk exposure of stocks in net exporting nations.

This study provides a novel perspective on multivariate dynamic correlations for studying the oil market by using an optimal wavelet analysis on the basis of grey correlation. We used China-Daqing and its three reference benchmark oil prices (Brent, Dubai and Minas) as empirical data. Our main findings are as follows. First, the time-frequency phenomena of the analysis results from one-to-one and many-to-one correlation time series support the hypothesis of the regional and global characteristics of the oil market, respectively. Second, the U-shaped wavelet variance plot indicates that the fluctuation intensity of the shortest and longest time-frequency domains plays a leading role in the dynamic process of oil price correlation. For the Chinese government, the oil price adjustment strategy in the short term should reduce the reference weights of Brent, and the long-term strategy should reduce the reference weights of Minas to avoid the risk of a single reference. The investor's portfolio management should pay more attention to the leading oil price of the corresponding period to make clear market timing. Third, the significant lead-lag relationships of oil price correlations showed a time-varying spread phenomenon of benchmark oil prices' relative influence on Daqing, which provides a useful time reference when crafting an oil price adjustment strategy and intertemporal arbitrage.

We also test and do not find support for the main prediction of the Campos and Giovannoni (2006) model. In addition to testing the theory, we tackle an important policy-oriented issue of why a large number of efficient firms disappeared during mass privatization in the booming economy of Montenegro. Econometrically, we present the first study to look at firms that disappeared during a mass privatization transition, improving upon prior studies that focused only on existing firms and ignored survival bias. Our analysis suggests that asset stripping and firm disappearance were present, and that asset stripping was a likely reason for the loss of efficient firms. We show that because more productive firms were liquidated, it is important to model survival bias in the selection of firms remaining in samples when estimating the effects of privatization or other ownership changes. We also show that one needs to distinguish between true start-ups and liquidated firms that re-appear as start-ups. In the absence of the rule of law, many firms that appear to have disappeared were in fact appropriated by managers and politically connected individuals.

The main result of this paper shows that every partition model for incomplete information can be decomposed into the conjunctions of a unique non-redundant model and a unique individually uninformative correlating device. The separation of the correlating device from the underlying non-redundant model allows us to separate their strategic implications. As an application, we use this correlation device to define correlated equilibria. Separating the common-prior property of the correlating devices from the underlying state space sheds light on the difference between interim independent and correlated rationalizability.

There are two contrasting explanations of why cultural participation is stratified. The status hypothesis predicts that people come to appreciate particular forms of art because it expresses their belonging to a certain social group. The cognitive hypothesis stipulates that cultural participation depends on a person's cognitive abilities, which is why educational stratification in cultural consumption is so evident, especially among consumers of high culture. However, to test these explanations, previous work predominantly relied on an individual's level of education, thus confounding the two mechanisms. We test the status and cognitive hypothesis using data from the International Adult Literacy Survey, covering 18 countries. First, by including an individual's literacy skills, we separate the effect of cognitive ability from that of education. The remaining effect of education can be seen as a better measure of the status-related motives for cultural participation. Second, we examine whether stratification varies across countries. The findings show that the status-related effect of education on cultural participation is smaller in societies with larger educational expansion and intergenerational educational mobility. This is in line with the status explanation, which holds that boundaries between educational groups are less exclusionary in societies that are educationally less stratified. In contrast, the relation between cognitive skills and cultural participation is unaffected by distributional variation in education, as the cognitive hypothesis predicts.","[Notten, Natascha] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Lancee, Bram] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van de Werfhorst, Herman G.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Ctr Inequal Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ganzeboom, Harry B.

Termination is costly, but it allows the agent to pursue the available outside opportunity and the principal to return to an external market to hire a new agent. The principal acts strategically with respect to the agent's outside offers and we show that it is optimal to terminate the current relationship if and only if the agent's outside offer is above a cutoff level. The optimal contract generates both voluntary and involuntary terminations. Severance compensation arises endogenously and we show that it may be paid only in involuntary terminations. Conditional on termination, the size of the optimal severance compensation depends positively on the agent's current compensation, but negatively on his outside offer. The optimal contract dictates an inverted-U relationship between compensation and the probability of termination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper uses unique data and innovative methods to explore the perceived satisfaction impacts of transport improvements at a very detailed geographical scale. The results quantify new evidence on the links between rail access and perceived satisfaction measures with respect to different dimensions of living environment. The empirical evidence suggests that rail access is significantly valued by households and that these subjective valuations are not distributed evenly across space or social groups. The results also reinforce the impression that changes in perceived satisfaction measures might be reflected in changes in housing demand so in some way may be capitalized into local real estate markets.

These countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, collectively known as the BRICS countries, have achieved robust growth and steadily outpaced the advanced economies in the last quarter of a century or so. In spite of their recent slowdown, on the basis of their demographics, vast natural resources, physical and human capital accumulation and overall progress, they are likely to remain the engines of global economic growth and development for some time in the future. In the light of the rising role of BRICS countries in the world economy, this paper aims to study the relationship between their domestic saving and investment rates in the vein of Feldstein-Horioka but on a country-by-country basis using time-series econometric techniques. The results suggest that the basic Feldstein-Horioka regression is misspecified for each BRICS country. The preferred autoregressive-distributed-lag specifications imply that capital is not perfectly mobile internationally in any of the BRICS countries, but it is more mobile in South Africa and Russia than in India, Brazil and China.","La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Kónya, L (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",l.konya@latrobe.eu.au,"Konya, Laszlo/C-3118-2008","Konya, Laszlo/0000-0001-5613-7258",,,,,31,3,4,2,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The paper finds that the optimal long-run annual inflation rate is around 1.5% if the economy is hit by a total factor productivity (TFP) shock and nearly 2.5% if the economy is subject to a markup shock. The shadow value of the collateral constraint is akin to an endogenous cost-push shock. Differently from usual cost-push shocks, however, this shock is asymmetric as it takes non-negative values only. Since the mean of this asymmetric endogenous cost-push shock is positive, inflation is also positive on average. In addition, a binding collateral constraint resembles a time-varying tax on labor, which the monetary authority can smooth by setting a positive inflation rate. More generally, the basic result is related to standard Ramsey theory in that optimal policy smoothes distortions over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Adoption is based on a cost-benefit criterion. We find that retrospective payment systems require a large enough patient benefit to yield adoption, while under DRG-linked payment, adoption may arise in the absence of patients benefits when the differential reimbursement for the old vs new technology is large enough. Also, mixed cost reimbursement leads to higher adoption under conditions on the differential reimbursement levels and patient benefits. In policy terms, mixed cost reimbursement system may be more effective than a DRG payment system to induce technology adoption. Our analysis also shows that current economic evaluation criteria for new technologies do not capture the different ways payment systems influence technology adoption. This gives a new dimension to the discussion of prospective vs retrospective payment systems of the last decades centered on the debate of quality vs cost containment.","[Martinez-Giralt, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona CODE, Barcelona, Spain; [Barros, Pedro Pita] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Barros, Pedro Pita] CEPR London, London, England",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Martinez-Giralt, X (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona CODE, Barcelona, Spain.",ppbarros@novasbe.pt; xavier.martinez.giralt@uab.eu,"Martinez-Giralt, Xavier/B-8178-2008; Barros, Pedro Pita/P-3586-2019","Barros, Pedro Pita/0000-0002-0881-4928; Martinez-Giralt, Xavier/0000-0002-5185-8395","Accao Integrada [E97/04, PTDC/Eco/71867/2006]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; [2009SGR-169]; [ECO2012-31962]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ECO/71867/2006] Funding Source: FCT","Accao Integrada; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD; ; ; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","We acknowledge our gratitude to A.

This view neglects two important dynamic effects: the role of migration networks, which could reduce the quality of migrants, and the responsiveness of education decisions to the prospect of migration. We propose a model of self-selection into migration with endogenous education choices, which predicts that migration networks and the quality of migrants can be positively associated when destination countries adopt sufficiently selective immigration policies.

We investigate the empirical evidence in favor of this prediction by using a time-varying VAR. Two main results emerge from the analysis: First, global slack is found. to affect the dynamics of inflation in many countries, yet its influence did not become stronger over time. Second, a panel analysis that exploits the cross-sections characteristics of our dataset shows that globalization, measured in terms of trade and financial openness, is positively related to the effects of global slack on inflation. We conclude that integration in the global economy is in fact important, but globalization has not yet induced changes in openness large enough to justify significant brakes in inflation dynamics.

A key contribution is that firms are also matched based on the heterogeneity of institutional legacy systems at the firm level as such burden is commonly associated with firms in transition economies and affects internationalization. The empirical results show that internationalization raises a firm's tendency to innovate. More specific, outsourcing is connected to product innovation, whereas exporting and FDI are associated with R&D spending and patenting.","[Boermans, Martijn Adriaan] Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Boermans, Martijn Adriaan; Roelfsema, Hein] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; Utrecht University,"Boermans, MA (通讯作者)，Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.a.boermans@dnb.nl,,"Boermans, Martijn/0000-0002-7809-1868",,,,,51,24,30,2,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The objective of this modeling exercise is to investigate the interplay between technological change and product life span in extended industrial dynamics. Change in product characteristics is driven by an endogenous stochastic process relying on the interplays between heterogeneous consumers and firms. Special attention is paid to demand-side modeling, which allows analyzing more thoroughly how decisions of bounded rational consumers affect the dynamics of the system. Although most existing models on product life span investigate durable goods monopolists, our study highlights the notion that diversity matters. Diversity of supply and demand in a bounded rationality context can push firms to market products with longer life spans, but their diffusion is restrained by the sensitivity of consumers to product obsolescence and their willingness to pay for longer-lasting products. The dynamics of consumer preferences influenced by firm marketing activities tend to maintain this situation which contributes to locking the market into short product-life trends. Unlocking the system requires changes in consumer behavior and better information about product life span and cost per use for consumers.","Univ Bordeaux France, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Brouillat, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux France, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",eric.brouillat@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,76,8,10,2,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The experiments implement the Abreu and Gul (2000) bargaining model that demonstrates how introducing behavioral types, which are obstinate in their demands, creates incentives for all players to build reputations for being hard bargainers. The data are qualitatively consistent with the theory, as subjects mimic induced types. Furthermore, we find evidence for the presence of complementary types, whose initial demands acquiesce to induced behavioural demands. However, there are quantitative deviations from the theory: subjects make aggressive demands too often and participate in longer conflicts before reaching agreements. Overall, the results suggest that the Abreu and Gul (2000) model can be used to gain insights to bargaining behavior, particularly in environments where the process underlying obstinate play is well established.","[Embrey, Matthew] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Frechette, Guillaume R.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Lehrer, Steven F.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Lehrer, Steven F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Maastricht University; New York University; Queens University - Canada; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Embrey, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",,,"Embrey, Matthew/0000-0002-3423-4142","NSF [SES-0519045, SES-0721111, SES-0924780, SES-1225779]; CV Starr Center; Center for Experimental Social Science (CESS); SSHRC",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CV Starr Center; Center for Experimental Social Science (CESS); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We wish to thank Jim Andreoni, Colin Camerer, John Kagel, Muriel Niederle, Tom Palfrey, Ennio Stacchetti, Leeat Yariv and three anonymous referees, as well as seminar participants at Caltech, Maastricht University, New York University, Paris School of Economics, Royal Holloway, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Universita Bocconi, University of Michigan and University of Texas-Austin, and the ESA Asia-Pacific meetings, ESA North American meetings, the FSU Workshop on Experimental Game Theory, the Stony Brook Game Theory Festival, Econometric Society World Congress, the CEA Annual meetings, and the SITE Conference on Experimental Economics for helpful comments and suggestions that improved the article.

Employing a very detailed data set covering the whole of the United Kingdom, we find that, over the course of time, many entrants have begun to take advantage of unbundling. LLU entry only had a positive effect on broadband penetration in the early years, and no longer in the recent years as the market reached maturity. In contrast, LLU entry continues to have a positive impact on the quality of the service provided, as entrants differentiate their products upwards compared to the incumbent. We also assess the impact of competition from an alternative form of technology (cable) which is not subject to regulation, and what we discover is that inter-platform competition has a positive impact on both penetration and quality.","[Nardotto, Mattia] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Valletti, Tommaso] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Verboven, Frank] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Verboven, Frank] Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France",University of Cologne; Imperial College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata; KU Leuven; IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Nardotto, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",mattia.nardotto@uni-koeln.de; t.valletti@imperial.ac.uk; frank.verboven@kuleuven.be,"Verboven, Frank/GLV-3358-2022","Verboven, Frank/0000-0002-5686-3820",Orange Innovation and Regulation Chair at Telecom ParisTech/Ecole Polytechnique,Orange Innovation and Regulation Chair at Telecom ParisTech/Ecole Polytechnique,"We thank the editor, three anonymous referees, as well as Bruno Basalisco, Marc Bourreau, Francine Lafontaine, Michal Grajek, Marc Lebourges, Pantelis Koutroumpis, Pasquale Schiraldi, and seminar participants in Bologna, Crete (CRESSE), Dusseldorf, Florence School of Regulation, Leicester, Lisbon, London (Imperial and LBS), Manchester, Paris (CREST and PSE), Rome (EIEF and Tor Vergata), Toulouse, and Turin for many useful comments and suggestions.

In classical model EPQ only applies where the demand for a product and production rate is constant over the year. But in reality these parameters vary with time in different scenarios. In this paper we have considered a production inventory model for deteriorating items with ramp type demand rate under the effect of inflation and shortages under fuzziness. The deterioration rate is represented by a two-parameter Weibull distribution. As inflation erodes the value of money so we have also considered the effect of inflation when there is shortage in the stock under finite time horizon. Some parameters are vaguely or unclearly defined or whose values are imprecise or determined based on subjective beliefs of individuals. Therefore the inventory model is solved under fuzzy environment to evaluate the optimum solution of the model in different cases. We have optimized our solution by considering production time and production rate as decision variables in two separate cases. While incorporating symmetric triangular fuzzy number we use total K-integral value to defuzzify the solution. Finally, utility of the model is presented by using some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis and the results are analyzed. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that health improvements for older workers have a much greater effect than similar improvements for younger workers, due to the sensitivity of workforce participation to health for older workers relative to younger workers.

However, the empirical results of energy substitution are contradictory. The source of discrepancies in the results remains controversial, which provides ample motivation for further interpretation. The present paper is to identify the discrepancies of energy and non-energy substitution from the perspective of energy efficiency. The case study is based on the elasticities between energy and non-energy of China's 36 industrial sectors during the period 1994-2008. The results show that there is overwhelming evidence of a threshold effect which separates the substitution of energy and non-energy, on the basis of energy efficiency. The findings imply that when the same energy-saving capital is invested to the industries, the energy intensive sectors are of more energy-saving potential. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For the purposes of the analysis, farms were divided into area groups: group I - farms with an area up to 20 ha and group II - farms with an area above 20 ha. The following indicators are calculated: family farm income, current ratio, re-investment fixed assets rate, return on equity (ROE). Higher influence of public funds was observed in farms with an area of 20 ha of utilised agricultural area. The income per working person was almost double in larger farms while equity profitability was four times higher than in smaller farms. Only larger farms had the ability to reproduce their used assets. The organic farms realise many important functions in maintenance of the natural environment and so support of these farms by public funds is justified.","Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Koloszko-Chomentowska, Z (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Wiejska St 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",z.koloszko@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,54,7,7,1,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In this paper we analyze the required adjustments of exchange rates for rebalancing in current accounts. We set up a two-country two-sector model for the US-China with two asymmetries. First, we assume that the size of China initially is one third of the US but its size becomes half in the next 10 years. Second, we assume that China initially runs a net export surplus. Then we quantitatively study two adjustment scenarios. First scenario, called Slow Adjustment, assumes that in the process of growth, Chinese demand composition moves more towards domestic non-tradable sector. In this case, Chinese real exchange rate appreciates gradually and net export surplus decreases slowly. Second scenario, called Quick Adjustment, assumes that net export surplus against US goes to zero quickly in five years. In this case, net export adjustment happens quickly and real exchange rates in China appreciate at a higher rate. Even though, global imbalances are eliminated faster in the Quick Adjustment case, high real appreciation in China hurts importers in the US. A comparison in terms of output shows that Slow Adjustments is preferred for both countries. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The empirical implementation includes 18 EU Member States. Our findings show that the constant tax rate that stabilizes the public debt converges to 50 percentage of GDP for all the sample countries and tax revenues are the main driving forces for fiscal sustainability. Also our findings suggest that the contribution in terms of GDP growth is relevant in countries with low (high) debt-to-GDP ratio in the long (short) term. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling.

Integration of banking across localities reduces the degree of local monopoly power of financial intermediaries. The economy that implements this form of deregulation experiences increased producer entry, real exchange rate appreciation, and a current account deficit. The foreign economy experiences a long-run increase in GDP and consumption. Less monopoly power in financial intermediation results in less volatile business creation, reduced markup countercyclicality, and weaker substitution effects in labor supply in response to productivity shocks. Bank market integration thus contributes to moderation of firm-level and aggregate output volatility.

An investigation of EPC ratings and transaction prices in England,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy efficiency; House price; Hedonic model; Repeat sales model,HOUSING-MARKET CAPITALIZATION; SELECTION BIAS; DEMAND; INDEX; ECONOMICS; QUALITY; LABELS; IMPACT,"This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings, as measured by mandatory Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are reflected in the sale prices of residential properties. This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that in the steady state, the economy gets stuck in the growth trap where the economy still achieves positive growth, but at the lowest level. The most efficient remedies for the growth trap are to facilitate relation-specific investment among sectors and to decrease the degree of specialization in the economy. Thus, the relation-specific investment is indeed instrumental in improving economic efficiency in the face of the growth trap.

The partial adjustment model used addresses the endogeneity of the electricity price that results from the increasing-block pricing. The estimated results show that there is a significant seasonal difference in the demand for electricity between the summer and non-summer periods. Both the adjustment speed and own price elasticity during the summer months are found to be lower than those in the non-summer months due to the hot weather in summer. It is easier for consumers to adjust their electricity consumption in response to the changes in electricity pricing during the non-summer time. The estimated inelastic short-run and long-run income effects show that electricity is a necessity for consumers. Moreover, the controversial electricity-conservation policies are found to be ineffective measures for reducing electricity consumption in Taiwan. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Monthly data retrieved from the Bank of Korea from January 1999 to March 2012 are examined. A cointegration test, a vector error correction model, the Wald test and impulse responses techniques are applied to analyze the data. The present study finds that, first, long-run causation between exchange rates and FDI flows exists, which implies that a change in exchange rates negatively affects FDI flows in the long run. Second, short-run causation between exchange rates and FDI flows exists, which confirms that there is reciprocal feedback between the two variables. Finally, the study finds evidence of a structural break from the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 shock to FDI flows in Korea. An external shock affects changes in the endogenous variables and, thus, causes instability in the cointegrating vector in the system.","Boston Univ, Adm Sci Dept, Metropolitan Coll, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Adm Sci Dept, Metropolitan Coll, 808 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jwlee119@bu.edu,"N, A/JUF-6197-2023; Lee, Jung Wan/C-1180-2014","Lee, Jung Wan/0000-0002-8885-6385",,,,,26,7,7,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Specifically, after a preliminary outline of the theoretical discussion on the EU's new/old governance, the analysis focuses on two empirical fields. The first one enables an assessment of the contradictions between old and new governance in EU equal pay policy. This analysis highlights the inconsistencies between the architecture of the antidiscrimination framework, established following the EU's old governance-by-law approach, and the assessment of equal pay public policy measures in the context of the EU's new governance-by-numbers approach. To this extent, the problems related to the political use of the unadjusted gender pay gap (GPG) indicator are pointed out. The second empirical field enables an assessment of the tensions within the EU's new governance system itself, specifically between the approach in the area of equal pay and in the area of economic policy, with specific regard to the participatory role of the social partners in tackling the GPG. If the role of the social partners is emphasised in several policy documents, the potentialities of their action are seriously jeopardised by the push for decentralisation of collective bargaining, aimed at anchoring wages to productivity, fostered by the EU's governance reforms responding to the crisis, in particular by the Euro Plus Pact and by the 'six-pack' regulations of 2011. As the paper finally remarks, both empirical fields of investigation confirm a narrowing down of pay equality in the context of an EU flexibility-centred and neoliberalist political perspective.","[Peruzzi, Marco] Univ Verona, I-37122 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Peruzzi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci Giurid, Via C Montanari 9, I-37122 Verona, Italy.",marco.peruzzi@univr.it,,,,,,,104,9,10,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using a methodology that evaluates the contribution of an industry to economic growth, the present paper shows that the post-2000 subperiod marked an increased reliance on the services sector as a source of growth in the Chinese economy. Much of the acceleration in real GDP or aggregate labor productivity growth in China in the post-2000 subperiod compared to the pre-2000 period can be traced to an increased contribution from service-producing and high-technology exporting manufacturing industries. The evidence indicates that the Chinese economy has been rebalancing toward domestic consumption and shifting its export sector toward high-technology manufacturing industries.","[Zhao, Jingfeng] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jianmin] Ind Canada, Prod & Trade, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Northwest University Xi'an,"Tang, JM (通讯作者)，Ind Canada, Prod & Trade, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",171545892@qq.com; Jianmin.tang@ic.gc.ca,"Zhao, Xujun/IRZ-4119-2023; JIANMIN, TANG/JBS-6054-2023","JIANMIN, TANG/0000-0001-6091-9682",,,,,21,12,13,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2015,23.0,2,,,,,1,21,,10.1111/cwe.12104,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CE8MV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352097700001,0

We find that skilled and unskilled labour tax smoothing maintain quantitatively under externalities and exogenous shocks in skill acquisition, as well as when the relative skill supply is exogenously determined. We further find that the government finds it optimal to reduce both the size of the wedge between the marginal rates of substitution and transformation in skill attainment in the long-run and the standard deviation of this wedge over the business cycle.

This research investigates the economic implications of this strategy. It develops a conceptual framework of brand extension success in the movie industry that builds upon the sensations and familiarity that a movie offers and uses this framework to illustrate how remakes differ from other movie brand extensions (e.g., sequels). The sensations-familiarity framework is complemented by a contingency model that identifies factors which influence revenues and risk of movie remakes. Using a dataset of 207 remakes released in North American theaters between 1999 and 2011 and a matched sample of other movies, the authors find that, on average, remakes do not increase revenues but do reduce financial risk. The authors also provide evidence of the contingency role of several factors, including the original movie's awareness and image and the relationship between the original movie and the remake. These insights should be valuable for the movie industry, as they can guide movie producers in their selection of movie brands that, if remade, should be more successful at the box office than the average movie remake.","[Bohnenkamp, Bjoern] Karlshsch Int Univ, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Knapp, Ann-Kristin; Hennig-Thurau, Thorsten; Schauerte, Ricarda] Univ Munster, Mkt Ctr Muenster, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Hennig-Thurau, Thorsten] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",University of Munster; City University London,"Bohnenkamp, B (通讯作者)，Karlshsch Int Univ, Karlstr 36-38, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany.",bbohnenkamp@karlshochschule.de; ann-kristin.knapp@wiwi.uni-muenster.de; thorsten@hennig-thurau.de; ricarda-schauerte@t-online.de,,,,,,,43,28,30,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

A school finance reform, aimed at equalization of school finances, can in principle weaken this link between housing choice and choice of schools. In this paper, we study the impacts of the Michigan school finance reform of 1994 (Proposal A) on spatial segregation. The reform was a state initiative intended to equalize per pupil expenditures between Michigan school districts and reduce the role of local financing. We find that Proposal A led to a decline in neighborhood sorting within education markets, as measured by changes in the value of housing stock and several socioeconomic indicators. We also find that the reform affected the dispersion of incomes and educational attainment within school districts, increasing within-district heterogeneity in the lowest spending school districts, while decreasing the same in the highest spending districts. However, there is a continued high demand for residence in the highest spending communities. These findings are robust to various alternative definitions of education market, and survive several sensitivity checks. These spatial segregation patterns are not replicated in neighboring Ohio that did not face similar school finance equalization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Investing volatile resource revenues, however, may subject an economy to macroeconomic instability. This paper studies fiscal approaches to investing resource revenues, using Angola as an example. With spend-as-you-go, resource revenues are spent as received, resulting in little external saving; public investment can be interrupted, driving up the capital depreciation rate and undermining stability. Gradual scaling-up, instead, allows countries to build up external saving to shield investment from revenue volatility. The framework adopted here can be used as a planning tool to define a medium-term fiscal strategy.","[Richmond, Christine] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Richmond, Christine; Yackovlev, Irene; Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; International Monetary Fund; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Yang, SCS (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",syang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,,,UK's Department for International Development (DFID),UK's Department for International Development (DFID),"Address for correspondence: Shu-Chun S.

I look at the global effects of the euro debt crisis, using an event study approach. After identifying a number of euro crisis events in the period that goes from 2010 to 2012. I analyse their impact on equity returns, exchange rates and government bond yields in 40 non-euro area countries. The main finding of this study is that euro debt crisis events have contributed to a rise in global risk aversion accompanied by a fall in equity returns, mainly in the financial sector. Moreover, I find that the effect on bond yields is not statistically significant for the whole set of countries, but it has a significant though small - impact on countries with a high risk rating. Finally, the paper also focuses on transmission channels by looking at how pre-determined country characteristics influence the strength and direction of the contagion effect. I find that the most consistent conduits of contagion are: (i) trade exposure to the euro area, (ii) EU membership, and (iii) whether a currency is pegged to the euro. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is assumed that typically such countries are price takers, which means low price elasticity of exports and imports. If this assumption is true, then it is impossible to make an impact on the trade balance through the price mechanism and, accordingly, fiscal devaluation will not have significant effects. To confirm or reject this hypothesis it is necessary to determine causal relationships between changes in the fiscal devaluation indicator and trade balance dynamics. Applying a series of causality tests to Ukrainian data, the authors argue that the dynamics of trade balance cause changes in VAT and social security contributions. The opposite causality was not detected. This is treated as evidence of fiscal devaluation's inefficiency in economies like Ukraine on one hand and of the price-taking characteristics of Ukraine on the other. The potential null effect of fiscal devaluation was confirmed with SVAR modeling.","[Vdovychenko, Artem; Zubrytskyi, Artur] Natl Univ State Tax Serv Ukraine, Res Inst Financial Law, Irpin, Ukraine",Ministry of Finance of Ukraine; State Tax University,"Vdovychenko, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ State Tax Serv Ukraine, Res Inst Financial Law, Irpin, Ukraine.",aspirant1984@gmail.com,,"Zubrytskyi, Artur/0009-0004-8781-2403",,,,,20,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2015,27.0,1,,,,,23,40,,10.1080/14631377.2015.992221,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CA6OK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349034200002,0

The analysis of this study indicates that within the limits of proven oil reserves, Kazakhstan's oil production capacity would collapse to negligible amounts after the peak period of 2035. This envisaged scenario will have undesirable impacts on the economy, balance of trade and fiscal balance both prior and after 2035. To avoid these erratic impacts, the study examines an alternative conservative production scenario that would enable the country to maintain its level of oil production until 2050, and to manage better the transition to a non-oil economy.

Evidence based on the GVAR model showed the importance of second and higher order effects, in the international transmission mechanism of shocks from the U.S. to Eastern European countries. The results of generalized impulse response functions (GIRFs) suggest that the U.S. equity shocks are transmitted very fast to others markets and that the Eastern European equity markets tend to overshoot the U.S. response. The U.S. adverse equity and output shocks revealed asymmetric responses and greater volatility of real exchange rates in the countries of Eastern Europe compared to the Euro Area, suggesting a flight to quality from emerging to developed economies.

We find that the VaR estimates obtained from the models for daily returns and realized volatility give comparable results. Both long memory features and asymmetry are found to improve the VaR forecasts. However, when loss functions are considered, the models based on daily data allow minimizing regulatory loss function, whereas the models based on realized volatility allow minimizing the opportunity cost of capital.","Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bedowska-Sójka, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",,"Będowska-Sójka, Barbara/K-1112-2019","Będowska-Sójka, Barbara/0000-0001-5193-8304",,,,,32,2,3,2,20,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

On the one hand, the Arrow effect implies that increased competition caused by the interest rate deregulation motivates Hong Kong banks to speed up their development of OBSAs as an additional but riskier income source. On the other hand, the Schumpeterian effect implies that the deregulation may reduce the banks' financial capability in developing new products and thus downscale their OBSA adoption. Our findings show that, while the negative scale effect is statistically insignificant, the interest rate deregulation has a positive and significant impact on the adoption rate for all OBSA categories. We therefore conclude that the interest rate deregulation unambiguously leads to riskier bank behaviour in terms of higher OBSA adoption.","[Cheng, Arnold C. S.; Fung, Michael K.; Cheng, Louis T.

Our model does a good job of accounting for the joint behavior of labor and goods markets, as well as inflation, during the Great Recession.

For female participants in One-Euro-Jobs in the first period, especially in West Germany, the results imply that participating in two consecutive One-Euro-Jobs compared with receiving only welfare benefits for two consecutive periods better facilitates integration into regular employment. Moreover, taking part in a One-Euro-Job directly after entry into welfare receipt is also more effective for participants in One-Euro-Jobs in the first period than taking part in a One-Euro-Job in a later period, especially for East German men (although not for West German women). However, I also find evidence of so-called programme careers and stepwise integration into regular employment.","Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany",,"Dengler, K (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany.",katharina.dengler@iab.de,,,Graduate Programme (GradAB) of the IAB; University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,Graduate Programme (GradAB) of the IAB; University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,Financial support by the Graduate Programme (GradAB) of the IAB and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg is gratefully acknowledged.,,37,9,9,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Politicians are experts who specialize in observing the true state of the economy. Budget maximizing politicians are better informed than the electorate about the level of public spending necessary to manage public affairs. Voters, who are able to observe the size of the budget but not the necessary level of spending, affect the government's spending behavior via electoral control. A fiscal restraint limits the maximum spending a government can choose. We identify conditions under which such a fiscal restraint improves voter welfare and discuss the role of the political opposition as a second expert in situations in which the state of the economy requires a level of spending which exceeds the fiscal restraint.

The saving behavior of emerging economies and capital outflows to the United States can be attributed to their poor pay-as-you-go systems. The model predicts that emerging countries run a trade surplus only as long as the long-run growth rate of the economy is higher than the real interest rate (capital overaccumulation case). The low real interest rate in the US is therefore evidence in favor of the hypothesis that there is a global saving glut in the world economy. The model can explain why the US current account deteriorated gradually and only in the late 1990s, although the net foreign asset position had already turned negative in the early 1980s. Finally, the analysis also implies that an improvement of the pay-as-you-go system in China would have the effect of reducing the imbalances. In accordance with the theory, we find that the higher is the percentage of the working population covered by the pay-as-you-go system the lower are savings and the current account balance in a cross-section of countries.

We focus on the two specific dimensions of the Tunisian inflation rate: inflation regimes and persistence. We tackle this issue by adopting an evolutionary spectral approach, initially proposed by Priestley and Tong (1973). Our main findings indicate a stable inflation regime in the last 10 years, with an average inflation rate of around 5.5%. It is also found that the Tunisian inflation experienced a high degree of inertia which reflects its gradual responses to shocks. We also discuss the policy implications of these results, which typically require policy-makers to implement sound institutional reforms to reduce inflation.","[Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, Paris, France; [Guesmi, Khaled; Duc Khuong Nguyen; Teulon, Frederic] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France",IPAG Business School,"Nguyen, DK (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France.",duc.nguyen@ipag.fr,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019; Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104; Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787; Guesmi, khaled/0000-0002-0015-0805",,,,,49,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the face of this, the decision to own a home involves a long-term perspective, associated with a wide array of determinants expressing the degree of success of immigration projects. Thus, this article uses homeownership in the host country to analyze the acculturation process of immigrants in Spain. We conclude that being foreign-born significantly reduces the likelihood of being a homeowner. Moreover, this feature represents the key variable explaining the significantly low homeownership rate exhibited among immigrants compared to natives in Spain. We argue that acculturation processes, when using the homeownership approach, rely on information-acquisition processes, which in turn present distinct patterns by immigrants' region-of-origin.","[Gonzalez Fuentes, Mario V.] Trinity Univ, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Iglesias Fernandez, Carlos] Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Trinity University; Universidad de Alcala,"Fuentes, MVG (通讯作者)，Trinity Univ, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",carlos.iglesias@uah.es,"Garcia-Fernández, Carlos/KBB-3107-2024","Garcia-Fernández, Carlos/0000-0002-9329-3820",,,,,30,0,0,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This article provides new evidence from the Business Longitudinal Database, an Australian data set with unusually rich information on the causes and consequences of skill shortages in small- and medium-sized enterprises. We document the range of alternative strategies that firms adopt when responding to skill shortages and show that certain types of adaptation are used in some cases and not in others, depending on the type of shortage encountered and other attributes of the firm. Further, we show that certain types of skill shortage are more likely to be long-lasting and difficult to resolve, while others are alleviated relatively quickly with minimal adjustment.

When two parties write a long-term contract that has to be renegotiated after the realization of the state of the world, they take the initial contract as a reference point to which they compare gains and losses of the renegotiated transaction. We show that loss aversion makes the renegotiated outcome sticky and materially inefficient. The theory has important implications for the optimal design of long-term contracts. First, it explains why parties often abstain from writing a beneficial long-term contract or why some contracts specify transactions that are never ex post efficient. Secondly, it shows under what conditions parties should rely on the allocation of ownership rights to protect relationship-specific investments rather than writing a specific performance contract. Thirdly, it shows that employment contracts can be strictly optimal even if parties are free to renegotiate.","[Herweg, Fabian] Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, Bayreuth, Germany; [Herweg, Fabian; Schmidt, Klaus M.] CEPR, London, England; [Schmidt, Klaus M.] Univ Munich, CESifo, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Herweg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, Bayreuth, Germany.",,,"Schmidt, Klaus M./0000-0002-5011-0828; Herweg, Fabian/0000-0002-9874-1995",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB-TR 15]; Excellence Initiative of the German government,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Excellence Initiative of the German government,"We thank Philippe Aghion, Bob Gibbons, Paul Heidhues, Bengt Holmstrom, Andrei Shleifer, Philipp Weinschenk, and in particular Oliver Hart, four anonymous referees, and the editor (Philipp Kircher) for many helpful comments and suggestions.

Rather, the aim of this paper was to answer the question of whether a particular level of coffee quality is the same for all participants in the supply chain. Also, we wanted to respond to the issue of whether all participants in the supply chain equally valued its characteristic. As a possible remedy to the problem, two-stage PCA-I-distance approach has been performed. The results have shown that there are indeed differences in the quality perception of coffee among different participants in the supply chain. Also, we proposed framework for emphasizing significant components for respective participant, and within crucial quality characteristics. Therein, we determined the most significant component which encompasses following set of characteristics of the coffee supply chain for distributor: the coffee inventory turnover ratio, producer satisfaction with distributor services, customer satisfaction (retail) with distributor services. Likewise, same procedure was done for producer and analysis pointed out following quality characteristics: the coffee's country of origin, the manufacture date, the expiry date, storage cost of the final product, customs procedures, delays in procurement, and the temperature of at which the coffee is roasted.","[Horvat, Ana; Antic, Slobodan; Jeremic, Veljko] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Horvat, A (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",horvat@fon.bg.ac.rs; slobodan.antic@fon.bg.ac.rs; veljko.jeremic@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Antić, Slobodan R./AAK-7340-2021; Jeremic, Veljko/K-2096-2019; Kicanovic, Ana/AAN-2547-2020","Jeremic, Veljko/0000-0002-0266-5247;",,,,,32,5,7,1,33,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

These models have no representation of intermediate goods, or of the factors that generate and diffuse innovations, including learning-by-doing and scale economies; they are thus unable to picture how a suite of economic and institutional changes triggers waves of long-term economic progress, which in practice has been the long-term historical pattern. The absence of finance in these models is particularly problematic. The centrality of financial structures to understanding patterns of economic growth is acute concerning policies to shape efficiency, innovation and infrastructure in ways compatible with energy and climate security, since these require substantial upfront investment. However, uncertainty and a lack of confidence deter such investment. Environmental policy could reduce risk and thereby shape ultimately profitable investments. The paper outlines deep relationships between energy/carbon-related finance and wider debates about financial systems after the crisis. The paper finally proposes an agenda for future research towards alternatives to classical growth models, intended to address some of their limitations.","[Hourcade, Jean-Charles] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Grubb, Michael] UK Energy Regulator Ofgem, Sustainable Energy Policy, London, England; [Grubb, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Energy & Climate Policy Panel, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Grubb, Michael] Int Res Org Climate Strategies, Cambridge, England; [Grubb, Michael] Carbon Trust, London, England; [Grubb, Michael] Imperial Coll London, Climate Change & Energy Policy, London, England; [Grubb, Michael] Chatham House, Energy & Environm, London, England; [Grubb, Michael] UK Climate Change Comm, London, England; [Grubb, Michael] House Lords EU Comm Enquiry European Decarbonisat, London, England; [Mejean, Aurelie] CIRED, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Mejean, Aurelie] CIRED, IMACLIM Energy Econ Environm Modelling Team, Nogent Sur Marne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Hourcade, JC (通讯作者)，CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France.",,,,,,,,70,0,0,0,6,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-44613-8; 978-1-137-44612-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,233,271,,,,,,39,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380488600007,0

In the line with the related studies, we use the narrow definition of contagion - a considerable increase in stock market comovement as a response to a shock affecting one country (or a group of countries). We applied the DCC GARCH setting to compute the daily correlations for a time lapse beginning in 2000 and closing in 2015 to verify contagion in 49 stock indices. After that we calibrate a Markov switching analysis with two states on the series of correlations for each country with all the set of other countries.

In a first class the game has a unique Nash equilibrium, defined in mixed strategies. In a second class the game has two Nash equilibria, defined in pure strategies. In a final class of preferences the game has a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, and possibly also in mixed strategies. If there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we show that the equilibrium probability of attending the meeting increases when the quorum increases. Furthermore, if the number of players becomes very large, this equilibrium probability tends to the value of the quorum.

Most developing countries have experienced common changes within restructuring of the banking system and therefore, this issue has become crucial, especially after comparing poor empirical findings in these countries to the findings of developed countries. However, research related to this issue is non-existent in the Croatian banking sector. Moreover, among the few studies that were carried out on the territory of the Central and Eastern European banking markets, none of the studies have analysed the persistence of profit in terms of the Markov Chain stochastic process. In addition to the profit persistence analysis, authors defined and estimated a model that would enable the identification of the profitability determinants of Croatian banks. In this sense, the model incorporated three groups of profitability determinants: bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic. The variables with a statistically significant impact on the profitability of banks were identified using a dynamic panel model, while the application of the Markov Chains stochastic process revealed that profit persistence was less likely to occur in banks with higher profit.","[Pervan, Maja] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split 21000, Croatia; [Pelivan, Iva] Employment Serv Livno, Financial Dept, Livno, Bosnia & Herceg; [Arneric, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Split; University of Zagreb,"Pervan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskov 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",mpervan@efst.hr,"Pervan, Maja/D-9291-2017; Arneric, Josip/AAI-6473-2021; Arneric, Josip/AAE-2023-2022","Pervan, Maja/0000-0001-6895-5258; Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609; Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609",,,,,45,40,43,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We derive two main results. First, an increase in the bank's equity capital cost from an increase of the interest rate of the Federal funds results in a reduced loan risk-taking at an increased optimal bank interest margin, implying better bank performance. Second, by ignoring the dislike, we find that the better performance is reinforced during a financial crisis but is reduced during a normal time. Financial crises and the dislike preference as such contribute a relatively low return and the stability of banking activities.","[Tsai, Jeng-Yan] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Chen, Shi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Tamkang University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Tsai, JY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",tsaijy@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [102-2410-H-032-005],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This article received an aid of research fund from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [grant number 102-2410-H-032-005].,,39,1,1,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As a result, the ability of organizations to create, transfer, assemble, integrate and leverage relational capital is fundamental to achieving competitive advantage. Empirical research was developed on 125 companies of a representative business association X1 and other companies of the Algarve Region. The purposes of this study are to examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and relational capital and to identify potential stock of technology knowledge (T-knowledge) that can act as catalysts for these relationships. We also examine the relative importance and significance of 'intentional unlearning' as a bridge between 'relational capital' and 'technology knowledge' and the existence and enhancement of relational capital through an empirical investigation of 125 business association members. The results are then calculated using structural equation modeling. This leads to the main conclusion that the development of 'relational capital' is unlikely without it being fostered by the transformation of new knowledge and it therefore requires empowerment by T-knowledge. Our main conclusion is that creation of relational capital by association X will depend to a good extent on how managers acquire, analyse, interpret, and understand new external knowledge. However, this is not to say that implementation of ACAP alone will ensure relational capital, and in this regard our findings suggest an interesting relation between T-knowledge and the pattern of using an intentional unlearning context which has not been elaborated upon before. In addition, technology knowledge may be unwittingly acquired from unreliable and inaccurate sources (e.g. rumours gossip or partial truths). These issues may help to explain why an important part of T-knowledge can become obsolete and it needs to be validated and updated though an intentional unlearning context. It is with this in mind that we propose that T-knowledge needs to be more explicitly recognised and managed in organisations so that part of it can be updated and used later.","[Vieira, Carlos Lopez Cano] Univ Algarve, Faro, Portugal; [Juan Briones Penalver, Antonio; Cegarra-Navarro, Juan-Gabriel] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Murcia, Spain",Universidade do Algarve; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Vieira, CLC (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Faro, Portugal.",calocavi@gmail.com; aj.briones@upct.es; juan.cegarra@upct.es,"Briones-Peñalver, Antonio-Juan/K-1702-2019; Cegarra Navarro, Juan Gabriel/L-2291-2014; Briones-Peñalver, Antonio-Juan/B-3891-2013","Briones-Peñalver, Antonio-Juan/0000-0002-2893-007X; Cegarra Navarro, Juan Gabriel/0000-0003-3371-5670; Briones-Peñalver, Antonio-Juan/0000-0002-2893-007X",,,,,51,0,0,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,392,400,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600046,0

Furthermore, to identify upgrading possibilities and major obstacles to upgrading and summarize policy implications. In terms of education, R&D and innovation, labor productivity and competitiveness the Czech Republic has made progress. Nonetheless, increasing the share of foreign value added embodied in exports and profit repatriations limit the value that is captured in the Czech Republic. Upgrading possibilities were mainly identified in research areas and sectors where the Czech Republic already has comparative advantage and, innovative domestic SME's. Unstable regulatory frameworks and mismatch between the needs of employers and orientation of students have been identified as a major obstacle for upgrading. There is a need to strengthen linkages between business and the public sector, although, strategies of TNC's remain an important variable for upgrading.","[Vlckova, Jana; De Castro, Tereza; Antal, Jarolim] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vlcková, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.vlckova@vse.cz; tereza.castro@vse.cz; jarolim.antal@vse.cz,,,,,,,59,2,2,0,3,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2111-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,38,66,,,,,,29,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4CR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380618300002,0

An additional motivation for firms to invest abroad is the technological sourcing via spillovers, which flow from the host more efficient firm to foreign less advantaged firms. For intermediate values of the set-up costs associated with FDI entry, it is shown that foreign firms choose opposite entry strategies. An equilibrium where the less efficient foreign firm exports whereas the more efficient invests is more likely to happen when foreign firms become more heterogeneous, the larger the trade costs and not too big oligopolistic profitability. Interestingly, the opposite may also be an equilibrium thus finding that the more efficient firm does not choose to invest, a result that emphasizes the relevance of the strategic setting under consideration. The latter result identifies a market failure since welfare in the host market is higher when both firms undertake FDI; a finding that calls attention to how appropriate are host government policies towards internationalization strategies.","[Barac, Maja; Moner-Colonques, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Moner-Colonques, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Barac, M (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Valencia, Spain.",Maja.Barac@uv.es; Rafael.Moner@uv.es,"Moner-Colonques, Rafael/E-6302-2016; Barac, Maja/J-2594-2017","Moner-Colonques, Rafael/0000-0002-4389-0870; Barac, Maja/0000-0002-1984-3644","Generalitat Valenciana [BFPI/2007/125, PROMETEO/2014/Fase II]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45045-R]; Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia by Fundacion BBVA",Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia by Fundacion BBVA(BBVA Foundation),"Comments from Praveen Kujal, Arijit Mukherjee, Jose J.

Social capital serves only as an input in the production of human capital and it involves a cost in terms of the final good. In contrast to alternative specifications, this model ensures that social capital enhances productivity gains by playing the role of a timing belt that drives the transmission and propagation of all productivity shocks. We find that, depending on the measure of social capital, the elasticity of human capital with respect to social capital varies from 6% to 10%. Finally, we investigate the short-term dynamics and imbalance effect properties of the model, depending on the value of this elasticity. In particular, we show that when the substitutability of social capital for human capital increases, the economy is better equipped to surmount initial imbalances, as individuals may allocate more working time to the final good sector without impeding economic growth.","[Bofota, Youyou Baende] Univ Kinshasa, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO; [Boucekkine, Raouf] Univ Aix Marseille, Marseille, France; [Bala, Alain Pholo] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa",Universite de Kinshasa; Aix-Marseille Universite; University of Johannesburg,"Bala, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, APK Campus,D Ring 213,POB 524,Auckland Pk, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",apholo@uj.ac.za,,"PHOLO BALA, Alain/0000-0001-5541-5316","Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA), South Africa","Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA), South Africa","We thank one anonymous referee and Jean-Pierre Laffargue for helpful comments and suggestions.

In such situations, people can either make a choice without looking at the payoffs, or they can look and learn the exact payoffs involved before making the actual choice. Recent studies suggest that the mere act of looking at payoffs will be met with distrust by observers: lookers are both less trustworthy and perceived to be less trustworthy than non-lookers. Here we extend this line of work by changing the measure of pro-sociality: instead of trustworthiness, we consider altruism. Does looking at payoffs signal self-regarding preferences? Do observers' beliefs match decision makers' actions? Two experiments demonstrate that: (i) the level of altruism among lookers is not different from the level of altruism among non-lookers, but (ii) lookers are perceived to be less altruistic than non-lookers. These results hold both when the measure of altruism is the choice whether to help or not in the so-called envelope game (Experiment 1) or when the measure of altruism is the donation in a standard Dictator Game (Experiment 2). In sum, these results uncover a perception gap according to which looking at payoffs signals selfish behavior, but it does not actually mean so. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We find that while foreign media entry typically lowers local media bias, it can also exacerbate bias in countries with an incompetent government. The resulting deterioration in local media quality can outweigh the additional information from a foreign media of moderate quality, leaving citizens worse off. When analyzing a government's decision to suppress foreign media, we find that suppression is most heavily used in countries with a moderately competent government.","[Cheah, Hon Foong] Zhejiang Univ Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Science & Technology,"Cheah, HF (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",honfcheah@gmail.com,,"Cheah, Hon Foong/0000-0001-6575-1612",,,,,17,1,3,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

The findings suggest that short sellers, on average, are informed and sophisticated traders and they can exploit profitable opportunities contained in earnings announcements. Finally, we find that stocks with poor governance or more insiders have higher (lower) abnormal short selling in negative (positive) earnings surprise, indicating private information leakage from firms with weak governance; which is consistent with the tipping argument.

In addition, the teacher's assessment is more predictive of track allocation in 9th grade compared to cognitive test scores. Next, children who switch tracks are more likely to be placed in tracks based on test scores.

Using Czech soccer betting data, we estimate the functional forms of the value and probability weighting functions commonly used for the experimental validation of prospect theory. In line with the experimental evidence, we find that bettors are risk averse in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses and tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight medium and large probabilities. On the other hand, our findings suggest that bettors do not exhibit loss aversion. This might be at least partly explained by recent experimental evidence suggesting that loss aversion is weaker or absent if the decision-makers are experienced, if they face similar choices repeatedly, and if the decisions are made in a context where offers are usually accepted.

When the market index returns have a fat-tailed distribution, the risk measures computed from the normal distribution underestimate the tail-related risk. We also compare the computation results of the VaR based on the GPD approximations to those based on the RiskMetrics methodology and GARCH model estimation. The estimates of the VaR are robust to a variety of threshold values. Contrary to this, the VaR values based on the RiskMetrics methodology and the GARCH model are extremely volatile. From a risk manager's perspective, it would be difficult to adjust capital requirement of a financial institution to conditional market risk. Due to concerns raised for practical and statistical reasons, we can conclude that the GPD method for measuring unconditional market risk is more appropriate for measuring and managing the tail-related risk.","[Lee, Hojin] Myongji Univ, Dept Business Adm, 34 Geobukgol Ro, Seoul 03674, South Korea",Myongji University,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Myongji Univ, Dept Business Adm, 34 Geobukgol Ro, Seoul 03674, South Korea.",hlee07@mju.ac.kr,,,,,,,34,2,3,0,2,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

A new measure is proposed to identify a nontraditional monetary policy shock from policy packages under the zero lower bound of short-term nominal interest rates during the quantitative easing period, using data on intraday 3-month Euroyen futures rates. We find that stock markets do not react to a policy surprise in an expected manner and negatively respond to a monetary easing surprise. Moreover, we find an asymmetric response during a boom and a recession and a nonlinear reaction because of increasing uncertainty concerning future inflation dynamics and the enhancement of monetary policy transparency.

The results suggest that increased reliance on regulation leads to growth in regulatory court cases and defendants filed.

In this context, we characterize the discretionary behavior of Spanish fiscal policymakers in comparison with the euro-area one. For this purpose, we estimate cyclically-adjusted fiscal policy rules for the period 1986-2012 within a Markov-Switching framework. Our results show that the discretionary fiscal behavior of Spanish and euro-area governments has manifested switching properties throughout the last thirty years, uncovering the existence of two fiscal regimes which shift in accordance with the extent of deficit persistence and the intensity of debt-stabilizing and output-countercyclical measures.

The models produce similar parameter estimates and the filtered shocks are nearly identical when the Fed was not constrained, but the Rotemberg model has a higher marginal data density and it endogenously generates more volatility at the ZLB, which helps explain data from 2008-12011.

The main purpose of the paper is to analyze the differences in the roles of mothers and fathers in dual-earner and male-breadwinner couples. For this purpose, we use information derived from the question with whom the activity is done, which is included in the enumeration form of the Spanish Time Use Survey 2009-2010. The availability of time-use diaries for all the members of a household allows the use of the couple as a unit of analysis. The descriptive and multivariate results show that mothers spend more time with children than fathers do and that the employment-status variables are the most determining factors. Gender-balanced couples have lower differences in the time that fathers and mothers spend on activities with their children. However, the differences remain high, and mothers are still the main caregivers in the household. These findings apply to a specific context characterized by weak policies related to balancing family and work and by the persistence of a division of roles in the couple with some resemblances to the traditional model, especially in the role that considers mothers the main caregivers.","[Roman, Joan Garcia] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Populat Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Cortina, Clara] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Pompeu Fabra University,"Roman, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Populat Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jgarciar@umn.edu; clara.cortina@upf.edu,"Garcia Roman, Joan/M-1101-2015; Cortina, Clara/D-1765-2014","Garcia Roman, Joan/0000-0003-2254-5450; Cortina, Clara/0000-0002-2822-9339",Minnesota Population Center under NIH Center [R24HD041023]; Data Extract Builder of the ATUS (University of Maryland) [R01HD053654]; Data Extract Builder of the ATUS (University of Minnesota) [Z195701]; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia Demografia familiar y movilidad social [CSO2013-43461-R]; Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia El rol de los hombres en la dinamica familiar desde una perspectiva internacional [CSO2013-43482-R],Minnesota Population Center under NIH Center; Data Extract Builder of the ATUS (University of Maryland); Data Extract Builder of the ATUS (University of Minnesota)(University of Minnesota System); Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia Demografia familiar y movilidad social(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia El rol de los hombres en la dinamica familiar desde una perspectiva internacional(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors acknowledge support from the Minnesota Population Center under NIH Center Grant R24HD041023 and Data Extract Builder of the ATUS (University of Maryland, R01HD053654; University of Minnesota, Z195701) and from the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia Demografia familiar y movilidad social (CSO2013-43461-R) and El rol de los hombres en la dinamica familiar desde una perspectiva internacional (CSO2013-43482-R).",,64,24,28,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

First, we provide the conditions under which a decrease in mortality leads to a longer education period and an earlier retirement age. Second, those conditions are decomposed into a Ben-Porath mechanism and a lifetime human wealth effect vs. the years-to-consume effect.

We apply a recently developed time series procedure to detect, and time-stamp, bubbles in house price to rent ratios in Australian capital cities. The results show a sustained, yet varying, degree of speculative behaviour in all capital cities in the 2000s before the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) engulfing different housing markets. The onset of these bubbles was soon after the federal government introduced a major change to the capital gains tax law, and all of these bubbles collapsed with or before the GFC. As of January 2016 only Sydney exhibits significant evidence of an exuberant rise in house prices compared to rents. We believe that the method we apply has the potential to be a general early warning indicator to detect housing bubbles in other countries/markets.

We find that the large majority of transfers follow a given pattern whereby elder siblings support their younger siblings in the early stages of their lives who in turn reciprocate by supporting their elder siblings when they have children. We interpret this pattern as a generalised system of reciprocal credit within the extended family. We propose a simple overlapping generation model to investigate its welfare properties. We then explore the implications of this pattern on labour market outcomes and find evidence of large disincentive effects.

Since US immigration policy emphasizes family reunification, immigrants have lower education and earnings than natives, with unauthorized immigrants' education below legal ones. Using American Community Survey data, and Center for Migration Studies data, which allows us to distinguish legal from unauthorized immigrants, we examine the effects of requiring immigrants to meet 2 of 3 conditions: (1) a high school or college degree, (2) being less than 40years old and (3) working in a professional occupation, while admitting the same numbers of immigrants. This policy changes the source countries of immigrants and there are large positive effects on immigrant earnings. Immigrants' use of government transfer programs is reduced to below natives and income inequality falls. Finally, with existing policy, immigrant earnings growth is not enough to overtake natives given immigrants' entering earnings disadvantage. With this point system, immigrants start at a higher level and surpass natives relatively quickly.","[Brunner, Lawrence; Pate, Joseph] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",Central Michigan University,"Brunner, L (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",BRUNN1L@cmich.edu,,,Central Michigan University,Central Michigan University,This work was supported by Central Michigan University under a grant entitled 'Promoting Entry of High-Quality Workers through US Immigration Policy'.,,22,1,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this setting, we show that international integration needs not be welfare enhancing if the consumers' capacity to gather and process information is limited. Rather, it intensifies competition for scarce consumer attention, which causes mutual overbidding of producers in their advertising expenditures. The mutual overbidding renders advertisingwhich is informative in principlewasteful and diverts purchases to imported goods at an inefficient scale. Wasteful advertising provides scope for policy intervention in the form of an advertising tax. However, if the tax instrument is not allowed to discriminate against foreign producers, it cannot eliminate inefficient diversion of consumer purchases to imports; hence it needs not be successful in securing gains from international integration in this framework.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut; Falkinger, Josef] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut] GEP Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Hartmut] IfW Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Falkinger, Josef] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Falkinger, Josef] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Zurich; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",hartmut.egger@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,52,2,2,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

To develop and demonstrate the relevant framework, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was applied to establish the relative efficiency of plastering crews working in building projects located in different cities around Turkey. Data were collected from 40 crews of varying characteristics, and their technical efficiency scores were computed using the Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) model, which is based on variable returns-to-scale (VRS). The model yields efficiency scores that range between 0 and 1, and a company or crew is considered efficient if its score is 1.0 (100%). Efficient and inefficient crews were identified and ranked on this basis in the study. Cross tabulation analyses were subsequently conducted to gain further insights into the relationships between the efficiency scores and input factors of numbers of skilled and unskilled laborers, daily labor unit costs, work hours, average age of crew members, total crew experience, plastering location, plastering technique, and plaster type. No discernible relationship could be identified between the efficiency scores and productivity outputs of the crews. It was found that plastering technique, plastering location, and total crew experience had a significant association with crew efficiency. Efficiency improvement strategies identified included training, hiring experienced plasterers, adopting more advanced plastering technology, implementing better jobsite management practices, and enhancing workers' knowledge, skills and attitude towards productivity and quality.","[Gerek, Ibrahim Halil] Adana Sci & Technol Univ, Engn & Nat Sci Fac, Civil Engn Dept, Adana, Turkey; [Erdis, Ercan] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-31200 Iskenderun, Hatay, Turkey; [Mistikoglu, Gulgun] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Antakya Vocat Coll, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey; [Usmen, Mumtaz A.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Adana Alparslan Turkes Science & Technology University; Mustafa Kemal University; Mustafa Kemal University; Wayne State University,"Erdis, E (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-31200 Iskenderun, Hatay, Turkey.",eerdis@mku.edu.tr,,,TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey) [106M055],TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This paper is based on research work undertaken as part of a larger project (106M055) sponsored by TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey).

An emissions intensity standard, although geared towards the power sector, will have implications for these other sectors of the economy through its effect on economy-wide energy prices. Using a hybrid energy-economy simulation model (CIMS), we find the effect on aggregate emissions from final demand to mostly be small. However, after disaggregating final demand, we find significant changes in CO(2)e emissions for several of sub-sectors. Given that emissions reductions in final energy demand are needed alongside power sector reductions for the US to achieve deep emissions cuts, our findings provide needed insight as to whether these eventual reductions will be helped or hindered by a US electricity standard.

Based on the candidates' political positions and relative likability, voters vote for the preferable candidate without being tied to their party's choice. We show that (1) there exists a nontrivial equilibrium under natural conditions, and (2) the equilibrium party border and the ex ante probabilities of the two-party candidates winning are sensitive to the distribution of voters. In particular, we show that if a party has a more concentrated subgroup, then the party tends to alienate its centrally located voters, and the party's probability of winning the final election is reduced.

While the TPS case imposed a national emissions rate standard for the power sector, the CPP imposes its budgets at the state level and provides states a great deal of flexibility in designing their implementation approaches. States may convert their CPP rate targets to a mass basis, and they may join with other states in multi-state trading plans. Under the proposed rule, EPA also left open the question of how new gas units were to be treated under the CPP. This design flexibility leads to a range of possible outcomes when it comes to the impacts of the proposed CPP on emissions, policy costs, electricity generation patterns, and gas markets. We analyzed 40 CPP scenarios in the Framework for Analysis of Climate-Energy-Technology Systems (FACETS), permuting these three design dimensions along with energy efficiency and low shale resource scenarios. Many designs have significantly higher emissions than EPA's original June 2014 design, while others deliver greater emissions reductions. In particular, the EMF TPS is closest to one of the more stringent possible designs. We observed substantial potential for emissions leakage when generation is able to move from covered to uncovered sources or from lower to higher rate states. Movement of generation is stimulated by the very different incentives that are set up across states by the differences in state rates. We discuss the features in each design that drive emissions impacts along with measures that can be taken to mitigate leakage risks. Since the EMF 31 study was completed, EPA has released the final CPP rule, which differs from the proposed rule in many important respects. We discuss the impact of those changes on the leakage potential observed here. Policy impacts on the gas market are found to be highly sensitive to the levels of energy efficiency (EE) achieved. Without EE, the CPP boosts gas production and increases prices by stimulating a shift from coal to gas. However, when the EE levels projected by EPA are achieved as part of state compliance approaches, gas production and price fall below no-policy levels by the mid-2020s. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper finds that continuous job creation in both the tertiary and the non-state sectors helps explain the decreasing trend in unemployment rates. Meanwhile, the downward trend of the unemployment rates could also be explained by the fact that both the secondary industry and the state-owned sector have destructed fewer jobs because of the execution of macroeconomic stimulus policies since 2008.","[Zhang, Jun; Xu, Liheng; Zhang, Huihui] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",junzh_2000@fudan.edu.cn; 12210680129@fudan.edu.cn; 14210680127@fudan.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333002]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA008],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),They also thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for financial support through research grant No. 71333002 and the National Social Science Foundation of China for support through research grant No. 15ZDA008.,,23,4,4,5,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2016,24.0,6,,,,,1,18,,10.1111/cwe.12178,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EJ3GG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393100000001,0

This paper extends recent attempts in the literature to improve the fit of the NKPC, by introducing a fuller marginal cost proxy, unit total costs, that is derived from both labor and nonlabor unit costs; the latter include capital-related costs and production taxes. Borrowing costs are examined separately, as in the cost channel literature. Unit total costs are shown to improve the fit of the short-run variation in inflation and strengthen the empirical support for the role of expectations-based inflation persistence. They also imply a duration of fixed nominal contracts that is closer to those suggested by firm-level surveys. The cost channel becomes relatively less important when unit total costs, rather than unit labor costs, are used as a marginal cost proxy.","[Bratsiotis, George J.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Bratsiotis, George J.] CGBCR, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Robinson, Wayne A.] Bank Jamaica, Kingston, Jamaica",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Bratsiotis, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",george.bratsiotis@manchester.ac.uk,,"Bratsiotis, George John/0000-0001-8740-6254",,,,,56,1,1,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Standard monetary models imply that far future forward guidance has huge effects on current outcomes, and these effects grow with the horizon of the forward guidance. We present a model in which the power of forward guidance is highly sensitive to the assumption of complete markets. When agents face uninsurable income risk and borrowing constraints, a precautionary savings effect tempers their responses to changes in future interest rates. As a consequence, forward guidance has substantially less power to stimulate the economy.","[McKay, Alisdair] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nakamura, Emi] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Steinsson, Jon] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 W 118 St, New York, NY 10027 USA",Boston University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Mckay, A (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",amckay@bu.edu; enakamura@columbia.edu; jsteinsson@columbia.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1056107],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank the National Science Foundation (grant SES-1056107) for financial support.,,39,194,239,3,48,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Is China's economic growth a consequence of its purposeful investment? Is China a prodigy in delivering infrastructure from which rich democracies could learn? The prevalent view in economics literature and policies derived from it is that a high level of infrastructure investment is a precursor to economic growth. China is especially held up as a model to emulate. Politicians in rich democracies display awe and envy of the scale of infrastructure Chinese leaders are able to build. Based on the largest dataset of its kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that (i) infrastructure creates economic value, and that (ii) China has a distinct advantage in its delivery. Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure investment fails to deliver a positive risk-adjusted return. Moreover, China's track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich democracies. Investing in unproductive projects results initially in a boom, as long as construction is ongoing, followed by a bust, when forecasted benefits fail to materialize and projects therefore become a drag on the economy. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive projects results in the build-up of debt, monetary expansion, instability in financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy. China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other countries but one to avoid.","[Ansar, Atif; Flyvbjerg, Bent; Budzier, Alexander] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Lunn, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Ansar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",atif.ansar@sbs.ox.ac.uk; bent.flyvbjerg@sbs.ox.ac.uk; alexander.budzier@sbs.ox.ac.uk; d.lunn@stats.ox.ac.uk,,"Budzier, Alexander/0000-0002-2132-0412","BT Group plc via the Said Business School, University of Oxford","BT Group plc via the Said Business School, University of Oxford","This work was supported by funding from BT Group plc via the Said Business School, University of Oxford.

After re-examining them using nonlinear forms, the PPP puzzle for most sectoral real exchange rates in the study still remains. More specifically, we find that deviations from PPP by TAR are persistent and take much more time for mean reversions especially for non-tradable sectors using logistic STAR / exponential STAR (LSTAR/ESTAR). The major reasons might be that conventional studies have failed to control the possible nonlinearity of real exchange rates, and have disregarded the possible bias of any single numeraire country.

Based on a dynamic microsimulation model, this article proposes a decomposition of these two effects for France and discusses the financial incentives of enrolling in higher education. Results show that the incentives stemming from the marriage market are negligible for men. By contrast, for women, the marriage market effect corresponds to almost 1/3 of the median return of higher education. Moreover, the marriage market does play an insurance role concerning the returns on tertiary education. It increases the risk of not capitalizing on higher education for both men and women, because marriage adds the uncertainty of the partner's career to the uncertainty of an individual's career. However, the risks relating to the value of this education investment remain higher for women. Overall, the results in this paper provide evidence for the fact that a family-oriented public policy may affect the educational choices for women. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, the legal regime governing cross-border tax enforcement was based on information exchange upon request:In 2010, the US Congress enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which seeks to induce foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to participate in a global regime of automatic information reporting of the income of US residents to the US government This paper presents a simple theoretical model of cross-border investment that analyzes the consequences of this (unilateral) FATCA regime. The model emphasizes cross-border investors' (heterogeneous) intrinsic motivation to comply with tax law, as well as the impact of information reporting requirements on the cost of providing financial services. In FATCA-compliant equilibria (in which FFIs report information to the US government) FFIs face a higher cost of providing financial services, increasing the fees charged to their accountholders. Consequently, tax-compliant behavior - such as investing via their domestic financial sector - becomes more costly for foreign residents. Under certain conditions, a unilateral FATCA regime causes increased cross-border tax evasion among residents of foreign countries. This result is robust to various extensions.

We interpret the estimates obtained from the different approaches through the lens of the canonical model to demonstrate that they are not comparable. We then relax two key assumptions in this literature, allowing for inelastic and heterogeneous labor supply elasticities of natives and the downgrading of immigrants. Downgrading occurs when the position of immigrants in the labor market is systematically lower than the position of natives with the same observed education and experience levels. Downgrading means that immigrants receive lower returns to the same measured skills than natives when these skills are acquired in their country of origin. We show that heterogeneous labor supply elasticities, if ignored, may complicate the interpretation of wage estimates, and particularly the interpretation of relative wage effects. Moreover, downgrading may lead to biased estimates in those approaches that estimate relative effects of immigration, but not in approaches that estimate total effects. We conclude that empirical models that estimate total effects not only answer important policy questions, but are also more robust to alternative assumptions than models that estimate relative effects.","[Dustmann, Christian; Schoenberg, Uta] UCL, Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Stuhler, Jan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Econ, Madrid, Spain",University of London; University College London; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; u.schoenberg@ucl.ac.uk; jan.stuhler@uc3m.es,"STUHLER, JAN/L-2770-2014","STUHLER, JAN/0000-0003-0762-5591",,,,,71,139,167,5,39,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Aid may boost press freedom by incentivizing government to reduce media regulations and provide financial support for infrastructure. Alternatively, foreign aid may prevent press freedom by expanding the role of the state and promoting government over private enterprises. We contend that the magnitude of foreign aid's influence is conditional on the existence of democratic checks. Using panel data from 1994 to 2010, we find evidence suggesting that aid significantly increases press freedom in democracies but insignificantly relates to press freedom in autocracies. Collectively, the results suggest that a standard deviation increase in aid to a country at the mean level of democracy increases press freedom by approximately a 1/20th standard deviation. Overall, the findings suggest that donors should be cautious as most aid recipients are not democratic and aid leads to only relatively small marginal improvements in press freedom.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Williamson, Claudia R.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",University of Wisconsin System; Mississippi State University,"Dutta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",ndutta@uwlax.edu; claudia.williamson@msstate.edu,"Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019","Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217",,,,,67,11,15,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

First, I show that employees' reputational concerns provide them with an incentive to refer high-ability applicants. This result explains how firms that offer fixed payments, rather than bonuses contingent on the referral's posthire performance, can elicit high-ability referrals from their employees. Second, I consider the promotion competition as a potential mechanism that creates a conflict of interest between a firm and its employees concerning referral hiring. I show that referrals may still serve a screening function even when the promotion competition distorts employees' referral decisions.","[Ekinci, Emre] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Ekinci, E (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",emre.ekinci@uc3m.es,"Ekinci, Emre/AAA-1463-2020; Ekinci, Emre/GNH-1558-2022","Ekinci, Emre/0000-0003-3160-394X",Spain's Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-46091-P],Spain's Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"This article is based on Chapter 3 of my PhD dissertation submitted to Cornell University.

The article finds that at the end of 2014, Germany faced current costs of approximately EUR 17 billion in real terms. Calculating the costs and profits of every member country in the euro area reveals that the TARGET2 system mirrors an implicit distribution mechanism, with a volume of approximately EUR 40 billion.

The discouraged worker effect implies that the participation rate is procyclical with respect to the GDP and countercyclical with respect to the unemployment rate. The added worker effect yields contrary findings. We analyse the period 1994-2014 with quarterly data. We focus on the working age population, both males and females. We apply a range of methods to obtain robust results, some of which have never been employed to resolve this problem. They include ad hoc filtration, spectral analysis, unobserved component model, time-varying parameter model, and frequency domain regression. The results indicate that the added worker effect prevails in most of the business cycle frequencies. It is significant and varies over time. It is true for both males and females. It is considerably stronger in contractions than in expansions. In low business cycle frequencies, the discouraged worker effect prevails. Although the last case is rare, it proves the heterogeneity of labour force behaviour over the business cycle.","[Pater, Robert] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Macroecon, Rzeszow, Poland; [Galecka-Burdziak, Ewa] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Coll Econ Anal, Warsaw, Poland",University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow; Warsaw School of Economics,"Pater, R (通讯作者)，Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Macroecon, Rzeszow, Poland.",eburdz@sgh.waw.pl; rpater@wsiz.rzeszow.pl,"Pater, Robert/AAC-7854-2021","Pater, Robert/0000-0001-7619-9843; Galecka-Burdziak, Ewa/0000-0001-9020-8486",,,,,30,5,5,0,6,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Almost no research examines the impact of poor vision on school performance, and simple OLS estimates could be biased because studying harder may adversely affects one's vision. This paper presents results from a randomized trial in Western China that offered free eyeglasses to rural primary school students. Our preferred estimates, which exclude township pairs for which students in the control township were mistakenly provided eyeglasses, indicate that wearing eyeglasses for one academic year increased the average test scores of students with poor vision by 0.16 to 0.22 standard deviations, equivalent to 0.3 to 0.5 additional years of schooling. These estimates are averages across the two counties where the intervention was conducted. We also find that the benefits are greater for under-performing students. A simple cost-benefit analysis suggests very high economic returns to wearing eyeglasses, raising the question of why such investments are not made by most families. We find that girls are more likely to refuse free eyeglasses, and that parental lack of awareness of vision problems, mothers' education, and economic factors (expenditures per capita and price) significantly affect whether children wear eyeglasses in the absence of the intervention.

After discussing several theories on the nature of money, we reflect on the institutional significance of currency circuits as concurrent and rather stable pairs of trade and money.

This article focuses on the challenges that affluent countries face today in shifting to a sustainable development path. These challenges include improving the quality of life, achieving environmental sustainability, and addressing inequality. In the United States in particular, these challenges have increased in recent decades, despite significant economic growth. The neoclassical development model assumes that growth makes it easier to achieve sustainable development and that wellbeing rises with per capita income. We question these assumptions, and find a theory of economic development in institutional economics that better explains and accommodates sustainability. We draw on the work of many original institutionalist economists (OIE), and others working in this tradition, to analyze the challenges of sustainable development in affluent countries, especially in the United States.","[Greenwood, Daphne T.] Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Econ, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA; [Holt, Richard P.

Under the assumption of a lognormal distribution of gross income, we derive the required tax rate to align the observed gross and net Gini coefficients in OECD countries. This estimated tax rate is compared to the tax rate preferred by the median income earner, which gives a new index capturing a nation's deviation from the median voter position, measured as the difference between the estimated percentile position of the decisive voter and the 50(th) percentile position of the median voter.

They also suggest that FDI has a significant effect on all types of trade; however, the effect varies according to whether the partner country is a member of the CIS/CU or not, and whether the FDI is outward or inward.","[Konno, Yugo] Mizuho Res Inst Ltd, Res Dept Europe & Amer, Tokyo, Japan",,"Konno, Y (通讯作者)，Mizuho Res Inst Ltd, Res Dept Europe & Amer, Tokyo, Japan.",yugo.konno@mizuho-ri.co.jp,,,,,,,6,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP,2016,28.0,3,,,,,300,313,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1184427,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DT2HI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000381301000002,0

Uncertainty shocks in the model are able to both account for a significant portion of business cycle fluctuations observed in data and generate positive comovements between output, consumption, investment, and hours. The key assumption of the model is that firm managers endogenously choose what projects to undertake and that the menu of these projects lies on a positively sloped mean-variance frontier - high-return projects are also high-risk projects. In times of high aggregate uncertainty, managers choose to undertake low-risk projects, and thus low-return projects, which in turn leads to a recession. Moreover, the model also matches various stylized facts about time series and cross-sectional variations in TFP and suggests shortcomings in using TFP data to calculate exogenous TFP shocks.

Our contribution is both theoretical and empirical. On the theoretical side, we develop a model for the global oil market and integrate this within a compact quarterly model of the global economy to illustrate how our multi-country approach to modeling oil markets can be used to identify country-specific oil-supply shocks. On the empirical side, estimating the GVAR-Oil model for 27 countries/regions over the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1, we show that the global economic implications of oil-supply shocks (due to, for instance, sanctions, wars, or natural disasters) vary considerably depending on which country is subject to the shock. In particular, we find that adverse shocks to Iranian oil output are neutralized in terms of their effects on the global economy (real outputs and financial markets) mainly due to an increase in Saudi Arabian oil production. In contrast, a negative shock to oil supply in Saudi Arabia leads to an immediate and permanent increase in oil prices, given that the loss in Saudi Arabian production is not compensated for by the other oil producers. As a result, a Saudi Arabian oil supply shock has significant adverse effects for the global economy with real GDP falling in both advanced and emerging economies, and large losses in real equity prices worldwide.

Using the results of an online survey conducted in 2010, I examine the factors determining Japanese women's choice of contraceptive method by estimating multinomial choice models. The estimation results indicate that OC use is positively associated with age, willingness to pay for contraceptive effectiveness, frequency of intercourse and experience with abortion or emergency contraception. These findings suggest that OC use increases as women learn from experience and that the low and declining frequency of intercourse in Japan offers one explanation for the slow diffusion of OC. Additionally, the findings indicate that OC use is more prevalent among women with a higher risk of unintended pregnancies. Subjective probabilities regarding each contraceptive method's contraceptive effectiveness, disruption of romantic moods, partner disapproval, side benefits and minor, non-life-threatening side effects are important determinants of contraceptive choice. The perceived risk levels of OC side effects are significantly higher than the population-based probabilities, implying that increased medical knowledge might increase OC use.","[Nakamura, Sayaka] Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furocho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Nakamura, S (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furocho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",nakamuras@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,"Nakamura, Sayaka/0000-0002-7358-7792","Nitto Foundation; Japan Society for Promotion of Science [20830070]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03343, 20830070] Funding Source: KAKEN","Nitto Foundation; Japan Society for Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Nitto Foundation and from a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (start-up, No. 20830070) by the Japan Society for Promotion of Science.

We survey seven such markets in Navi Mumbai (a city on the outskirts of Mumbai), and find considerable incidence of contract enforcement problems in the form of employers reneging on wage payments to labourers. We find that payments to labourers with access to social networks and a record of work done are less likely to be reneged. Further, consistent with the literature on the limits of informal enforcement, we find that labourers in large markets, with greater linguistic and caste-based diversity, are more likely to be reneged. We argue that interventions aimed at facilitating access to formal mechanisms might help overcome some of the limitations with informal enforcement.","[Naraparaju, Karthikeya] Indian Inst Management Indore, Econ Area, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore,"Naraparaju, K (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Indore, Econ Area, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India.",karthikeyan@iimidr.ac.in,,"Naraparaju, Karthikeya/0000-0002-3333-0191",,,,,27,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Utilizing longitudinal data from 1970 to 2009, the analysis suggests that wine consumptions and food-related consumptions are co-integrated. The investigation of orthogonal impulse response functions suggests that food-related items, such as bread, vegetables and eating out are positive factors for wine consumptions. With the expansion of wine consumption and diversification of food consumption patterns, wine is deemed to have gained its place in Japanese ordinary life, regardless of the general state of economy. The estimated results also provide a supporting evidence for previous cross-sectional study findings by others that wine consumers tend to have healthier diet. Despite the downward forecasts for economic performance and some food items, wine consumption is predicted to grow continuously.","[Omura, Makiko] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",,"Omura, M (通讯作者)，Meiji Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",makiko@eco.meijigakuin.ac.jp,,"Omura, Makiko/0000-0002-6970-7181",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03472] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,0,0,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Contrary to what is often suggested in the literature, we find that full annuitization remains optimal if saving is possible after retirement. This holds irrespective of whether real or only nominal annuities are available. Whenever liquidity is desired, individuals save sizeable amounts out of their annuity income to smooth consumption shocks. Similarly, adding equity-linked annuities to the menu does not increase welfare significantly, since individuals can invest in stocks in order to get the desired equity exposure.

The importance and influence of competition between different classes on the factor markets was understood to be a constant feature of capitalism in classical political economy. I have been able to translate this classical conflicting-claims approach in a consistent stock-flow model, with a working banking system, two classes, capitalists and workers, and a vertically integrated firm sector. National income is divided between workers and two sets of capitalist interests: industrial and financial. Results of the model reinforce the intuition of Kalecki's 1943 essay on Political Aspects of Full Employment. The output of capitalist economies, as well as profits of capitalists, could be higher, with policies of low interest rates and a high worker income share. However, as the paper shows, these hypothetical results are not tenable under a capitalist regime, with long-run changes in the power structure endangering the current social order. Finally the disconnect between the community and capitalists becomes even clearer when we see that a high profit rate implies a lower national income.","[Susnik, Urban] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Gosarjeva Ulica 9, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Susnik, U (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Gosarjeva Ulica 9, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",urban.susnik@outlook.com,,,"European Union; Republic of Slovenia, Ministry for Education, Science, and Sport","European Union(European Union (EU)); Republic of Slovenia, Ministry for Education, Science, and Sport","This paper is also a result of doctoral research, in part financed by the European Union, European Social Fund, and the Republic of Slovenia, Ministry for Education, Science, and Sport within the framework of the operational program for human resources development for the period 2007-2013.

Our primary insight is that rulers reduce public goods expenditures to a greater degree when there are privately-provided substitutes excludable by religion. The basic idea is that if the good is provided privately to the ruler's co-religionists, the ruler faces weaker incentives to provide this public good because his co-religionists receive lower marginal utility from its provision. Testing such a conjecture is an empirical challenge, however, since the religious identity of rulers rarely varies over time and place. We address this problem by exploiting variation in the religion of rulers in the Indian Princely States. Using data from the 1911 and 1931 Indian censuses, we find that Muslim-ruled states had lower Hindu literacy but had no significant impact on Muslim literacy. This result is consistent with our model, as Muslim religious schools provided a substitute for public schools that served both Hindus and Muslims. The model is further substantiated by the fact that the religion of the ruler had no statistically significant impact on railroad ownership or post office provision, neither of which had privately-provided substitutes.

This article elaborates that cost structure plays an essential role in resolving the inconclusive relationship between market concentration and price rigidity. When the industry is characterized by decreasing returns of scale, the degree of price flexibility decreases as market competition intensifies. The reverse is true when the industry exhibits increasing returns of scale. The factors that cause price rigidity also foster price adjustment asymmetry and price adjustment lag. During times of recession, the model exhibits upward price flexibility as costs increase, but downward price rigidity as costs decrease. Even under forward-looking expectations, the way in which firms adjust prices could look as though they have adaptive expectations. If price stickiness is a characteristic of market competition, then public policies determined by price level could be too drastic for firms in competitive markets.","[Chen, G.

Such stochastic discounts are a feature of markets in which some consumers bargain explicitly and of markets in which sellers use the marketing practice of couponing. Even though bargainers receive reductions off the posted prices, the potential to discount dampens competitive pressure in the market, thus raising all prices and increasing profits. Welfare falls because of the stochastic nature of the discounts, which generates some misallocation of products to consumers.

Using a control function approach, I find that one-standard deviation in the potential replacement rate from UI (about 12.5 percentage points) discourages on-the-job search by 0.55 percentage points, thereby reducing the probability of starting a new job at a different employer. This average effect is small because UI does not affect the search behaviour of workers who do not believe to be at risk of job loss, the majority of the employed population over 50. In contrast, a one-standard deviation increase in the potential replacement rate reduces the probability of on-the-job-search by as much as 3.5 percentage points for workers who state a 90% probability of losing their jobs.

This paper attempts to assess the qualitative competitiveness of Macedonia as a candidate country for European Union (EU) accession. EU remains a main trading partner of the country, making up around two-thirds of its foreign trade. Having a small economy implies that Macedonia has to rely mainly on export-led growth. As such, addressing external competitiveness has become a more prominent issue than ever before, while improving the competitiveness is quite important in terms of EU accession. We calculate unit values to signal the Macedonia's quality position, and then perform a country-specific segmentation of markets according to the revealed price elasticity concept (REVELAST 1). The findings suggest that Macedonia exhibits low export unit values due to the country's specialization mostly in industries at the lower end of the quality spectrum. The analysis of product groups indicates a certain weakening-inadequate position prevails both for the levels and the type of competitive performance. The rising number of product groups in the segment with structural problems is particularly worrisome, and specifically for sectors which are the most important for achieving competitiveness with dynamic potentials. The only way for Macedonia to establish an adequate structure of foreign trade and higher levels of competitiveness is to create an appropriate environment, so that some product groups of this segment move into the segments of successful quality-and/or price competition.","[Kostoska, O.] St Clement Ohrid Univ, Fac Econ, Prilep, North Macedonia; [Mitrevski, P.] St Clement Ohrid Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Bitola, North Macedonia",St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola; St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola,"Mitrevski, P (通讯作者)，St Clement Ohrid Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Bitola, North Macedonia.",olivera.kostoska@eccfp.edu.mk; pece.mitrevski@uklo.edu.mk,"Mitrevski, Pece/V-6000-2019","Mitrevski, Pece/0000-0002-0300-7115",,,,,50,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2016,43.0,3,,,,,633,655,,10.1007/s10663-015-9308-0,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR9PW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380229600008,0

We analyse determinants of numbers beatified and canonized (non-martyrs) since 1590 across seven world regions. The number beatified is roughly proportional to a pope's tenure and a region's Catholic population, responds positively since the early 20th century to Catholic-Protestant competition and to secularization, and falls after the virtual ending of warfare between European Catholics and Protestants with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. There is bias in favour of Italy, then Other Western Europe and Eastern Europe countries, and against Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America. The number canonized rises with the stock of beatifieds not yet canonized, rises with Catholic-Protestant competition, and drops after the Peace of Westphalia. Regional bias is minor for canonization, given stocks of beatifieds. The last two popes before Francis, John Paul II and Benedict XVI are large positive outliers in numbers beatified, and John Paul II is also an outlier for numbers canonized.","[Barro, Robert J.; McCleary, Rachel M.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Barro, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Paul M.

This comparative disadvantage with respect to bidders from exemption countries violates ownership neutrality, which results in production inefficiencies due to second-best ownership structures. This paper empirically estimates the magnitude of these effects. The abolishment of repatriation taxes in Japan and in the U.K. in 2009 has increased the number of acquisitions abroad by Japanese and British firms by 16.1% and 1.6%, respectively. A similar policy switch in the U.S. is simulated to increase the number of U.S. cross-border acquisition by 11.0%. The yearly gain in efficiency is estimated to be 108.9 million dollar due to the Japanese reform and 3.9 million dollar due to the U.K. reform. Simulating such a reform for the U.S. results in a yearly efficiency gain of 537.0 million dollar. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We study this question in a model that incorporates two competing views about the underlying causes of these crises: selffulfilling shifts in investors' expectations and deteriorating economic fundamentals. We show that - in both cases - the desirability of allowing intervention depends on a tradeoff between incentives and insurance. If policy makers can correct incentive distortions through effective regulation and supervision, then allowing intervention is always optimal. If regulation is imperfect and the risk-sharing benefit from intervention is absent, in contrast, it is optimal to prohibit intervention. Our results show that, in some cases, it is possible to provide meaningful policy analysis without taking a stand on the contentious issue of whether financial crises are driven by expectations or fundamentals.

In practice, however, reform and de-regulation of parastatals is typically partial in nature. We specify a model that allows us to consider the effects of partial reform and partial de-regulation on various metrics of food security. We show that how these metrics change depends on the market structure that defines the starting point as well as the market structure that emerges after de-regulation. In this second-best world, partial de-regulation does not necessarily enhance food security and we identify the determinants of that outcome. The assessment of the desirability of de-regulation is also contingent on the food security metric used.","[McCorriston, Steve] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Streatham Campus, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England; [MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, FBE Bldg, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Exeter; University of Melbourne,"McCorriston, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Streatham Campus, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England.",d.maclaren@unimelb.edu.au; d.maclaren@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Econometrically, we employ a matching approach to account for differences in the countries' economic and political environment and the likelihood of being exposed to US sanctions. Our results indicate that US sanctions are adversely affecting those living in poverty as we observe a 3.8 percentage point (pp) larger poverty gap in sanctioned countries compared to a control group that is as close as possible in terms of observable pretreatment characteristics. In addition, we show that the impact of sanctions on poverty (i) increases with the severity of sanctions, (ii) is larger for multilateral sanctions than for unilateral sanctions imposed by only the United States, and (iii) is long-lasting as the poverty gap increases over the first 21 years of a sanction regime.

As a consequence, the Japanese government introduced a new taxation system in 2009 - the so called dividend exemption system - which was aimed at reducing the effective tax burden of foreign dividends of Japanese multinational companies in order to increase tax revenue and stimulate economic growth. Applying a theoretical framework which allows comparing the repatriation incentive of the old and new Japanese tax systems, we find that in the long-run the tax regime change fails to incentivize foreign subsidiaries to repatriate foreign profits. Especially subsidiaries with high leverage located in countries with low corporate taxes and low dividend taxes might reinvest rather than distribute their earnings in the dividend exemption method.","[Bachmann, Carmen; Baumann, Martin] Univ Leipzig, Chair Business Adm Taxat, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Bachmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Chair Business Adm Taxat, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",carmen.bachmann@uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,34,3,3,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Their findings in support of community policing dealt a blow to the popular belief that consolidation and centralization of services was the only way to effectively provide citizens with public goods. However, subsequent empirical literature suggests that the widespread implementation of community policing has been generally ineffective and in many ways unsustainable. We argue that the failures are the result of strategic interplay between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies that has resulted in the prioritization of federal over community initiatives, the militarization of domestic police, and the erosion of genuine community-police partnerships.","[Boettke, Peter J.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Lemke, Jayme S.] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Palagashvili, Liya] SUNY Coll Purchase, Dept Econ, Purchase, NY 10577 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University; State University of New York (SUNY) System,"Boettke, PJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",pboettke@gmu.edu; jlemke@mercatus.gmu.edu; liya.palagashvili@purchase.edu,,,"F.

We characterize the unique Bayesian-Nash equilibrium, in which each firm type chooses a distributional strategy with interval support in the salary space. The main result shows that competition is localized, in the sense that firm types with a common most preferred worker choose non-overlapping, adjacent supports.

Given the extent of the dependency of the Greek economy on tourism income and also the perishable nature of the tourist product itself, results have important implications for policymakers in Greece.","[Chatziantoniou, Ioannis] Univ Portsmouth, Subject Grp Econ & Finance, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Degiannakis, Stavros] Panteion Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Athens, Greece; [Degiannakis, Stavros] Hellen Open Univ, Postgrad Dept Business Adm, Patras, Greece; [Eeckels, Bruno; Filis, George] Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England",University of Portsmouth; Panteion University; Hellenic Open University; Bournemouth University,"Chatziantoniou, I (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Subject Grp Econ & Finance, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",ioannis.chatziantoniou@port.ac.uk,"Chatziantoniou, Ioannis/O-8271-2019; Filis, George/HHS-1048-2022; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019; Filis, George/N-5012-2017","Chatziantoniou, Ioannis/0000-0002-1114-2544; Filis, George/0000-0002-4912-0973; Degiannakis, Stavros/0000-0003-1931-5494",,,,,75,28,28,0,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This idea is captured in the common saying, People believe what they want to believe. But people don't simply believe what they want to believe. Psychological research makes it clear that motivated beliefs are guided by motivated reasoning--reasoning in the service of some self-interest, to be sure, but reasoning nonetheless. People generally reason their way to conclusions they favor, with their preferences influencing the way evidence is gathered, arguments are processed, and memories of past experience are recalled. Each of these processes can be affected in subtle ways by people's motivations, leading to biased beliefs that feel objective. In this symposium introduction, we set the stage for discussion of motivated beliefs in the papers that follow by providing more detail about the underlying psychological processes that guide motivated reasoning.","[Epley, Nicholas] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Behav Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilovich, Thomas] Cornell Univ, Psychol, Ithaca, NY USA",University of Chicago; Cornell University,"Epley, N (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Behav Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",epley@chicagobooth.edu; tdg1@cornell.edu,,,,,,,25,133,169,2,31,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

It uses subsampling confidence interval methods that are more informative than simple unit root tests to describe the underlying process of energy consumption. Because subsampling requires fewer assumptions on the nature of the data generating process, inference is less prone to a number of potential misspecification errors. By focusing on the degree of persistence in the process describing a country's energy consumption, the analysis not only provides evidence on the stationarity or nonstationarity of the energy consumption but also gives insight into the likely success of environmentally oriented government intervention. The analysis finds that the 107 countries can be grouped into three persistence classes: those whose energy consumption is explosive (highly populated countries with high growth rates); those with nonstationary energy consumption (developing and highly oil dependent economies); and those whose energy consumption is stationary (developed and energy-rich countries). In nonstationary cases, government intervention can be effective and produce permanent improvements in energy conservation and other environmental concerns. In stationary cases energy conservation and environmentally-oriented demand management policies can have only temporary effects and thus designed to speed re-adjustment to the longer run underlying trend.

We implement one-way communication by allowing one player to send a message indicating whether she intends to volunteer and investigate the message's effects on behavior and efficiency in the subsequent game. We theoretically demonstrate that there are asymmetric mixed-strategy equilibria in the volunteer's dilemma and argue that one of these is likely to emerge through one-way communication.

Political democracy gives people power in public life parallel to that afforded by markets in private life: the power to turn their preferences into social outcomes. However, rational choice models of voter behavior dramatically underpredict voter turnout in all but the smallest elections. Fiorina (1990) has called this the paradox that ate rational choice theory. This anomaly is the centerpiece of Green and Shapiro's (1994) critique of rational choice methodology in political theory. This paper proposes a form of social rationality that strengthens the classical rational actor model.

CCS systems increase electricity prices, to about A 100 pound/MWhr. CCS on industry is cheaper and storage costs minimal (A 5-20 pound/tonne). CCS reduces whole economy costs of carbon transition by 2.5 times. Policies of capex subsidy, oversupplied emissions certificates, weak carbon pricing, and weak emissions standards have all failed to develop large cost CCS mega-projects.

The approach also allows statistical testing of previous identification strategies, which may help discriminate between them and hence also explain differences between various fiscal multiplier estimates.

Interestingly, the model highlights that housing prices and frictions in the housing market have a profound impact on labor market activity through the desire of workers to eventually purchase a home, the American Dream. In particular, higher housing prices adversely affect workers' incentives in the labor market as employment can eventually lead to access to housing through the ability to purchase a home. Similarly, labor market frictions can impact housing market activity. Notably, tighter housing markets are associated with higher unemployment rates and less job creation.

This paper studies the possibility of such a phenomenon, which we label political entrenchment. We use a two-party dynamic model of redistribution with probabilistic voting. Political entrenchment by the Left occurs only if incumbency rents are sufficiently high. Low-skill citizens may vote for this party even though they rationally expect the adoption of these policies. We discuss: the possibility of entrenchment by the Right; the scope for commitment to avoid entrenchment policies; and the effect of state capacity, income inequality and party popularity on the likelihood of entrenchment. We illustrate our theory with a number of historical examples.","[Saint-Paul, Gilles] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; NYU, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; IMT Inst Adv Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy; Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy",Paris School of Economics; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Saint-Paul, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",gilles.saint-paul@psemail.eu,,"TICCHI, Davide/0000-0003-4166-1692","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (PRIN); CRISIS LAB; Collegio Carlo Alberto","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (PRIN)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); CRISIS LAB; Collegio Carlo Alberto","We thank two anonymous referees, the editor Frederic Vermeulen, the seminar participants at the University of Bologna, the Politics, Information and the Macroeconomy Workshop 2011 at CREI-University Pompeu Fabra, the University of Minho, Hamburg University, Sebastian Edwards, Nicola Gennaioli, Torsten Persson, Susan Stokes, Paolo Vanin and, especially, Giacomo Ponzetto for useful comments and suggestions.

It is assumed that baselines defining climate finance payments, and required emissions reductions under a treaty, depend positively on current emissions. It is then shown that making such future options available reduces current GHG mitigation in NP countries, leading to higher emissions in the short run. This effect is stronger when future climate finance payments are higher; the required relative emissions reductions under a treaty are greater; when commitments under a treaty are longer-lasting; and mitigation targets depend more on current emissions. Such short-run increases in emissions can (sometimes, more than) fully eliminate the effect of the subsequent policy. When climate finance and treaties are both future alternatives, more generous climate finance can make it harder and more expensive to induce the country to join a climate treaty.

Using multinational panel data covering 85 countries from 2002 to 2012, this research investigates the relationship between government ideology and environmental quality, while for the first time employing comprehensive indicators for environmental quality, i.e. EPI, EHI and EVI, in an empirical study. We utilize the bias-corrected least square dummy variable (LSDVC) method to first introduce the dynamics and control for potential endogeneity. Then, we incorporate the interactive terms of the ideological indicators and GDP to examine the possible indirect impact of ideology on environmental performance through its influence on economic development. Finally, we investigate the policy area specific position of political parties in coalition governments as well as the plausible role of Christian democratic parties in their environmental attitude in depth. Overall, we find that left-wing governments prefer environmental quality to economic performance, while right-wing governments care more about economic growth than environmental issues. However, when under pressure for a better economic performance, both left- and right-wing governments tend to forgo environmental goals for higher economic, growth. More evidence is shown that parties classified as promoting anti-growth economy and environmental protection exhibit a better environmental performance, and that Christian democratic parties tend to promote an environment-friendly policy in OECD countries.

Apart from liquid assets, a single commitment (illiquid) asset is available that allows to commit to a planned consumption path. We compare general equilibrium allocations of the two models: one, where households choices are determined using Gul and Pesendorfer (2001, Temptation and Self-Control. Econometrica 69:1403-35; GP, henceforth) model and the other, where households choices come from a (beta-delta) quasi-hyperbolic discounting model. Contrary to the results of Kocherlakota (2001, Looking for Evidence of Time-Inconsistent Preferences in Asset Market Data. Quarterly Review 13-24) or Gabrieli and Ghosal (2013, Non-Existence of Competitive Equilibria with Dynamically Inconsistent Preferences. Economic Theory 52: 299-313), we show that, when a production sector is incorporated into the economy with commitment asset and credit constraints, we can restore the equilibrium existence (without recalling measure space of consumers (see Luttmer and Mariotti 2006, Competitive Equilibrium When Preferences Change Over Time. Economic Theory 27: 679-90)) and unlike Gul and Pesendorfer (2004b, Self Control, Revealed Preferences and Consumption Choice. Review of Economic Studies 7:243-64), we show that the equilibrium allocations of both models (GP and beta-delta) imply positive consumption of the commitment asset and corner consumption of one of the liquid assets.

Using the supermodular stochastic order to arrange the structures of information increasingly in terms of preferences, we provide novel, easily interpretable and verifiable, though restrictive conditions under which the value of information is increasing and convex, and study the implications in terms of the equilibrium configuration. Increasing marginal returns to information leads to extreme behavior in that agents opt either for the highest or the lowest quality signal, so that the final analysis of this complex game simplifies greatly into that of a two-action game. This result can rationalize the complete information game as an endogenous outcome. Finally, we also establish that higher-quality information leads players to select more dispersed actions in the Bayesian game. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

First, it tests whether an effect of over-indebtedness on self-assessed health exists. Fixed-effects panel regression models based on panel data for 25 European countries show that being in arrears increases the likelihood of reporting bad/very bad health. However, effects are weak in terms of economic significance. The second research question focuses on the effect heterogeneity of overindebtedness among different European countries. It asks whether country-level factors moderate the effect of problematic debt on health. These macro-variables are the accessibility of health services, debt management and debt discharge regulations, dispute resolution with banks/insurance companies, and the social stigma of being over-indebted/in debt. Descriptive analyses showed that some aspects of the legal debt-collection process (e.g., higher costs of debt collection) are associated with a stronger effect of overindebtedness on subjectively assessed poor health. There is also some evidence that easier dispute resolution with banks and insurance companies is correlated with smaller effects of over-indebtedness on health.","[Angel, Stefan] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Vienna, Austria; [Angel, Stefan] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Angel, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Vienna, Austria.;Angel, S (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Social Policy, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",stefan.angel@wu.ac,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",", Stefan/0000-0002-3740-3204",,,,,39,18,18,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2016,69.0,2,,,,,208,227,,10.1111/kykl.12109,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK1VI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374702600002,0

We implement an algorithm describing path-dependent play-hysteresis into a regression framework. The hysteretic impact of real exchange rates on Greek exports is estimated based on the period from 1995Q1 to 2014Q4. Looking at some of the main export partners of Greece, the euro area, Turkey and the US, and some of its most important tradeable sectors we identify significant hysteretic effects for a part of the Greek exports. We find that Greek export activity is characterized by bands of inaction with respect to changes in the real exchange rate and calculate the further real depreciation needed to trigger a spurt in Greek exports. To check for robustness we (a) estimate Greek export equations for a limited sample excluding the recent financial crisis, (b) use export weight instead of deflated nominal exports as the dependent variable, (c) employ a political uncertainty variable as a determinant of the width of the area of weak reaction. Overall, we find that those specifications which take uncertainty into account display the best goodness of fit. In other words: the option value of waiting dominates the real exchange rate effect on Greek exports.","[Belke, Ansgar; Kronen, Dominik] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] IZA, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kronen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de; dominik.kronen@uni-due.de,,,,,,,48,17,17,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2016,43.0,2,,,SI,,349,390,,10.1007/s10663-016-9319-5,0.0,,,42,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK6UV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375061900008,0

Minsky analyzed the evolution of capitalism. This paper proposes a critical reading of this analysis, focusing on the institutional dimension of Minsky's research. From my point of view, if Minsky's analysis constitutes more a history of capitalism than a theory of capitalism, this is because of the weak conceptualization of institutions and the absence of a genuine analysis of institutional change. From this perspective, I believe it necessary to clarify and complete Minsky's institutional analysis. Only by doing so can we take full measure of Minsky's research on the evolution of capitalism and identify all the repercussions for an analysis of the instability and resilience of the current stage of capitalism.","[Diop, Samba] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UFR Econ & Management, CRIISEA, Amiens 1, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV),"Diop, S (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UFR Econ & Management, CRIISEA, Amiens 1, France.",samba.diop@u-picardie.fr,,,"Centre de Recherche sur l'Industrie, les Institutions et les Systemes Economiques d'Amiens (CRIISEA)","Centre de Recherche sur l'Industrie, les Institutions et les Systemes Economiques d'Amiens (CRIISEA)","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Support from the Centre de Recherche sur l'Industrie, les Institutions et les Systemes Economiques d'Amiens (CRIISEA) is gratefully acknowledged.",,50,0,0,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Fiji makes an interesting case because of its policy orientation towards a stable exchange rate and adequate foreign reserves. Our results suggest that the trilemma constraint is binding for Fiji and policy priority is given to exchange rate stability and monetary policy independence, while less emphasis is placed on financial market openness. We also find that the actual policy levels do not deviate substantially from optimal levels, which evidences that Fiji's policy management has been efficient under the trilemma constraint. Finally, we also study the effects of various trilemma policy combinations and foreign reserve holdings on output growth and inflation.","[Huh, Hyeon-seung] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Ji, Philip Inyeob] Dongguk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Cyn-Young] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, Manila, Philippines",Yonsei University; Dongguk University; Asian Development Bank,"Ji, PI (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",philipji0422@dongguk.edu,"Park, Cyn-Young/E-7489-2015","Park, Cyn-Young/0000-0002-9634-219X",,,,,26,4,4,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Their analyses of economic inequality are reviewed in connection with the Marshallian tradition, the impact of Fabianism and J. M. Keynes's views of social justice. Special attention is paid to some neglected aspects of Moore's Principia Ethica, which were debated in the Society and influenced the Apostles' social awareness.

The increase of capital stock leads to capital intensive agriculture and the reallocation of labor from agriculture to non-agriculture. People who migrate to urban areas create new intermediate goods and enhance non-agricultural productivity, which, in turn, causes capital accumulation and capital intensive agriculture. This mechanism causes a poverty trap, stagnation, and unbounded growth. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their main welfare conclusion is that freer trade has an unambiguously positive static effect while the sign of the dynamic effect, stemming from the change in the growth rate of varieties, depends on the type of technology imposed for innovations. This paper revisits these conclusions. By carefully following algebraic expressions in the original work, we point at inaccuracies and explore their consequences. Our main finding is that the sign of the static effect is not always positive. Consumers may experience an immediate loss from openness if the value of the firms they own decreases due to greater import competition. Moreover, the sign of the static effect on expenditure is always the opposite to that of the dynamic effect stemming from variety growth, so the results presented here highlight the existing tension between static and dynamic effects. Our results speak to the most recent literature on welfare effects in trade models. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that in the presence of limited absorptive capacity countries are not able- in terms of skills, institutions, and management - to translate additional public investment into sustained output growth. We test for the presence of absorptive capacity constraints using a large dataset of World Bank investment projects, approved between 1970 and 2007 in 80 countries. Our results indicate that projects undertaken in periods of public investment scaling-up are less likely to be successful, although this effect is relatively small, especially in poor and capital scarce countries. We also verify that this effect is unrelated to large aid flows and donor fragmentation. (C) 2016 The Author.

Firms face a sunk cost to enter the domestic market and an additional fixed cost to produce offshore. As such, the offshoring decision depends on the firm-specific productivity and on fluctuations in the relative cost of effective labor. The model generates a procyclical pattern of offshoring and dynamics along its extensive margin that are consistent with data from Mexico's maquiladora sector. The extensive margin enhances the procyclical response of the value added offshore to expansions in the home economy, as the number of offshoring firms mirrors the dynamics of firm entry at home. As a result, offshoring increases the comovement of output across economies, in line with the empirical evidence. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Alm, J; Martinez-Vazquez, J; McClellan, C",,,,"Alm, James; Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge; McClellan, Chandler",,,Corruption and firm tax evasion,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tax compliance; Corruption; Bribery,,"Although corruption and tax evasion are distinct and separate problems, they can easily become intertwined and reinforcing. A society that is more corrupt may enable more tax evasion as corrupt officials seek more income via bribes; conversely, higher levels of tax evasion may drive corruption by offering more opportunities for bribes. While a large body of work on each subject separately has emerged, the relationship between the two problems has remained a largely unexplored area. This paper focuses on how the potential for bribery of tax officials affects a firm's tax evasion decisions. To test how the potential for bribery affects a firm's tax reporting decisions, we use firm-level information on reporting obtained from the World Enterprise Survey and the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey. Our basic estimation approach uses instrumental variables methods to control for the potential endogeneity of evasion and corruption. We also use propensity score matching methods as a robustness check. Our results show that it is corruption that largely drives higher levels of evasion; that is, corruption of tax officials is a statistically and economically significant determinant of tax evasion. The presence of tax inspectors who request bribes results in a reduction of sales reported for taxes of between 4 and 10 percentage points. Additionally, larger bribes result in higher levels of evasion. Overall these results indicate that governments seeking to decrease tax evasion - and so increase tax revenues - must work first to ensure an honest tax administration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis highlights that the platform's capacity sharing management depends not only on the participation levels of both sides but also on the externalities running between them. It is not true that a group's capacity share uniquely depends on its size. Besides, we argue that the platform may not assign the smallest capacity share to the least congestion-sensitive group. Finally, we establish a management rule that a platform's decision maker, e.g. trade fair manager, clinic owner, airport planner, or Internet Service Provider, should adopt when she is confronted with a capacity sharing trade-off between interdependent parties.

In this study, we apply unique microdata from a natural policy experiment to assess the role of loss aversion in home purchase among nondisabled and disabled households. Results of survival analysis indicate that the physically disabled are substantially less loss averse in home purchase. Furthermore, loss aversion varies with other population characteristics and attenuates with degree of disability. Findings provide new evidence of diminished cognitive bias and more rational economic decision-making among the physically disabled.

We completely characterise the set of optimal contracts (consisting of observable effort levels and non-linear salaries) that depend on how workers' heterogeneity in ability relates to the heterogeneity in motivation. Accordingly, optimal contracts differ as to whether ability or motivation prevails in determining workers' performance. We show that full separation and full participation of workers' types is always implemented, when feasible, because it is preferred by the firm to either pooling or excluding some workers. Moreover, when ability prevails, there exist full screening contracts such that motivated workers are asked to provide the efficient level of effort, and such that the firm pays low information rents to its workers. Despite this fact, the firm makes higher profits when motivation rather than ability prevails because of labour donations from motivated workers.","[Barigozzi, Francesca] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Burani, Nadia] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Barigozzi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.;Burani, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",francesca.barigozzi@unibo.it; nadia.burani@unibo.it,,,,,,,23,15,15,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

For some contingencies the optimal contract has to specify ex post inefficiencies in the form of inefficient termination (firing the agent) or wasteful activities that are formally equivalent to third-party payments (money burning). Under the optimal contract, the use of these instruments depends not only on the precision of public information but also on job characteristics. Money burning is used at most in addition to firing and only if the loss from termination is small. The agent's wage may depend only on the principal's report and not on the public signal. Nonetheless, public information is valuable as it facilitates truthful subjective evaluation by the principal.","[Bester, Helmut] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Muenster, Johannes] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University of Cologne,"Münster, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",hbester@wiwiss.fu-berlin.de; johannes.muenster@uni-koeln.de,"Münster, Johannes/ABD-4164-2021","Münster, Johannes/0000-0001-9895-2672",German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TR 15],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank an associate editor and a referee for helpful comments.

These conditions are based on the ability that a regulator with perfect information has to induce the firms to emit any desired level with different combinations of the number of permits supplied to the market and the monitoring probability, assuming that firms are expected profit maximizers. In this paper, we test this hypothesis with a series of laboratory experiments. Our results suggest that firms may behave significantly different from what these models predict precisely when the different combinations of the supply of permits and the monitoring probability induce compliance versus noncompliance. More specifically, by allowing noncompliance in a manner consistent with theory, the regulator could produce a decrease in emissions and an increase in the market price of tradable permits that is not predicted by the theoretical models. The implications for the cost-effective design of environmental policy are discussed.","[Caffera, Marcelo] Univ Montevideo, Dept Econ, Prudencio de Pena 2544, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Chavez, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Chavez, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Montevideo; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion,"Caffera, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montevideo, Dept Econ, Prudencio de Pena 2544, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay.",marcaffera@um.edu.uy,"Chávez, Carlos/AAL-9080-2021","Chávez, Carlos/0000-0002-6045-2282",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion - Uruguay [FCE_2009_1_2801]; NEXUS Fulbright Program (Exchange Visitor Program) [G-1-00005]; CONICYT-FONDAP [15110027],Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion - Uruguay; NEXUS Fulbright Program (Exchange Visitor Program); CONICYT-FONDAP(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP),Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion - Uruguay (Grant/Award Number: FCE_2009_1_2801); NEXUS Fulbright Program (Grant/Award Number: Exchange Visitor Program No. G-1-00005); and CONICYT-FONDAP (Grant/Award Number: 15110027).,,21,4,4,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The reinsurance premium is assumed to be calculated via the variance premium principle. Under the objective of maximizing the insurance company's value, we identify the optimal joint strategies and consider the effects of transaction costs and arbitrary terminal value at bankruptcy. From the results, we see that refinancing should be considered if and only if the terminal value and the transaction costs are not too high and the company is on the brink of bankruptcy, and the amount of each capital injection remains constant; the optimal ceded proportion of risk decreases with the current surplus and remains constant when the surplus exceeds some constant level; the optimal dividend distribution policy is of barrier type when the dividend rate is unrestricted or is of threshold type when the dividend rate is bounded, respectively. In particular, the insurance company should declare bankruptcy as soon as possible if the terminal value is high enough. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Following a tradition in the Argentine social sciences, we see a structural inconsistency between the income aspirations rooted in society and the productive capacity of the economy. We give this inconsistency a precise definition: as a gap between two equilibrium levels of the real exchange rate (RER). The macroeconomic equilibrium RER is the one that allows the economy to simultaneously attain full employment and balance of payments sustainability. The social equilibrium RER occurs when fully employed workers obtain the real wage that they bargain/claim. These two levels of RER may not coincide. There is a structural distributive conflict when the macroeconomic equilibrium RER is significantly higher than social equilibrium RER. We build a model to provide a stylized characterization of Argentina's economy and precise definitions of the two levels of RER.

Thus this model can help us determine the role of the preventive actions and treatments in producing better health outcomes and study the links between an agent's choice of medical services and her diet. This framework suggests that wealthier individuals, on average, have lower morbidity rates and lead a healthier lifestyle than lower income agents.

With respect to students, the relative increase in grades in the previously low grading courses disproportionately benefited Black and Hispanic students relative to White and Asian students. In addition, the grade distribution shifted with previously below average grading courses increasing the share of A's and decreasing the share of B's and C's following the grade information provision.","[Lehr, Brandon] Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA",Occidental College,"Lehr, B (通讯作者)，Occidental Coll, Dept Econ, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",lehr@oxy.edu,,,,,,,31,1,2,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In particular, this paper studies the impact on inequality and poverty. The methodology employed is a micro-decomposition proposed by Bourguignon et al. (1998). This methodology allows to partially capture the effect of the increase on female employment and to distinguish between effects generated by changes in employment status and those produced by changes in worked hours. Results suggest that, the increase in female employment has had statistically significant effects, despite not being the most important when it comes to explaining the evolution of income distribution. Changes in female employment contributed to reducing poverty levels throughout the period studied and, although it had modest results on de concentration of income at the beginning of the period, effects were more pronounced towards the end.","[Parada, Cecilia] Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Distribut Laborales & Sociales CEDLA, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Parada, Cecilia] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",National University of La Plata; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Parada, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl La Plata, Ctr Estudios Distribut Laborales & Sociales CEDLA, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Parada, C (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",cparada@cedlas.org,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Municipalities consume 87.6 % out of predicted current revenues in the time period leading up to the implementation of the balanced budget rule, and they consume 76.3 % out of predicted current revenue in the time period following the implementation. Fiscally weak municipalities are found to be more consumption sensitive than fiscally strong municipalities. Very weak municipalities have become more consumption sensitive compared with very strong municipalities since the implementation of the balanced budget rule.

The impact depends on the lender's type, which is not observable to the investors. In a pooling equilibrium, the subsidy raises the lender's profit but distorts the loan portfolio choice of the low-quality lender. The lender's portfolio choice can be improved two different ways. One is through a separating equilibrium, where the lender specializes in the type of lending at which it is most effective. The other is through arms-length contracting, characterized by less informed external investors. In this case, less information implies that the lender wastes less resources trying to justify access to subsidies.","[Van Tassel, Eric] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Van Tassel, E (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",vantasse@fau.edu,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It is a new aggregation operator that uses generalized means in a unified model between the probability and the OWA operator. The main advantage of this new operator is that it is able to deal with probabilities (objective information) and ordered weighted averages (subjective information) in the same formulation. Moreover, it is also able to deal with uncertain environments that can be assessed with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, it uses generalized means providing a very general formulation that includes a wide range of situations. We study some of its main properties and particular cases such as the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (GIFOWA) operator and intuitionistic fuzzy probabilistic ordered weighted averaging (IFPOWA) operator. We end the paper by applying the new operator to a group decision making problem concerning the selection of investments.","[Zeng, Shouzhen] Ningbo Univ, Sch Business, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Shouzhen] Zhejiang Wanli Univ, Coll Compute & Informat, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Su, Weihua] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Math & Stat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chonghui] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Coll Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; Zhejiang Wanli University; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Zeng, SZ (通讯作者)，Ningbo Univ, Sch Business, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Zeng, SZ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Wanli Univ, Coll Compute & Informat, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zszzxl@163.com,"Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023","Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358","MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJC910006]; Zhejiang Province Natural Science Foundation [LQ14G010002]; Statistical Scientific Key Research Project of China [2013LZ48]; Key Research Center of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province - Modern Port Service Industry and Creative Culture Research Center, Philosophy and Social Science Planning Projects of Zhejiang [14JDHY01YB]; Projects in Science and Technique of Ningbo Municipal [2012B82003]","MOE Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Zhejiang Province Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Statistical Scientific Key Research Project of China; Key Research Center of Philosophy and Social Science of Zhejiang Province - Modern Port Service Industry and Creative Culture Research Center, Philosophy and Social Science Planning Projects of Zhejiang; Projects in Science and Technique of Ningbo Municipal","We would like to thank the anonymous referees for valuable comments that have improved the quality of the paper.

We investigate whether correlated beliefs among sophisticated, but imperfectly informed, traders can account for the patterns of return correlations across countries. We take a unique approach by turning to direct data on market participants' information namely, real-time firm-level earnings forecasts made by equity market analysts. The correlations of firm-level forecasts exceed those of fundamentals and are strongly related to return correlations across countries. A calibrated information-based model demonstrates that the correlation of beliefs implied by analyst forecasts leads to return correlations broadly in line with the data, both in levels and across countries the correlation between predicted and actual is 0.63. Our findings have implications for market-wide volatility the model-implied correlations alone can explain 44% of the cross-section of aggregate volatility.

Optimal price-setting for verifiable dimensions of quality is well-described in the theoretical literature on incentive design. We seek to narrow the large gap that remains between actual price-setting behaviour in pay for performance schemes and the incentive design literature. We present a stylised model for hospital price setting for process measures of quality and show that optimal hospital prices should reflect the marginal benefit of the expected health gains, the weight given to patients' benefit relative to profits, and the opportunity cost of public funds. Based on published estimates, we derive the optimal prices for three measures of quality that have been incentivised in the English National Health Service since April 2010 (treatment in an acute stroke unit, rapid brain imaging, and thrombolysis with alteplase). We then compare the optimal prices with the actual prices offered to hospitals in England under the Best Practice Tariffs scheme for emergency stroke care. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We derive four interactive channels between the two sectors where two channels are strictly microfounded. We analyze the impact of the different channels on economic stability and derive optimal (conventional and unconventional) monetary policy rules. We find that coefficients of optimal Taylor rules do not significantly change if financial market stabilization becomes part of the central bank's objective function. Additionally, we show that rule-based, backward-looking monetary policy creates huge instabilities if expectations are boundedly rational. Our model is externally validated by showing that it generates fat tailed output growth rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the Federal Reserve data on capacity utilisation, which have been used by both sides of this debate, are the wrong kind of data for the issue under examination. Instead, a more appropriate measurement can be derived from the data on the average workweek of capital. We argue that the long-run dynamic adjustment, proposed by Kaleckian scholars, lacks a coherent economic rationale. We provide an alternative path towards the endogeneity of the desired utilisation at the micro and macro levels. Finally, we examine the proposed adjustment mechanism econometrically.

Using unique firm-level panel data covering the years 2001-2008, the efficiency estimates are obtained for firms in 14 industrial sectors by using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The analysis accounts for multi-output technologies where undesirable outputs are produced alongside with the desirable output. The results show that there was potential to improve energy efficiency in all the sectors and relatively large energy inefficiencies existed in small energy-use industries in the sample period. Also, we assess how the EU ETS, the carbon dioxide (CO2) tax and the energy tax affect energy efficiency by conducting a second-stage regression analysis. To obtain consistent estimates for the regression model, we apply a modified, input-oriented version of the double bootstrap procedure of Simar and Wilson (2007). The results of the regression analysis reveal that the EU ETS and the CO2 tax did not have significant influences on energy efficiency in the sample period. However, the energy tax had a positive relation with the energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas a large number of observers explain German competitiveness by the labour market reforms implemented from 2003 to 2005 (Hartz laws), we suggest that (i) the gains in competitiveness are essentially due to offshoring and (ii) the labour market reforms have subsequently reduced the offshoring-related unemployment by decreasing the reservation wage, creating thereby low skilled jobs in non-tradable services. These reforms have also reinforced inequality already generated by offshoring. In contrast with the traditional explanation based on the Hartz reforms, our model findings and simulations fit well with the sequence of observed facts. This experience could be extended to other EU countries, but with higher cost and lower efficiency. Finally, as the reduction in unemployment is based on the extension of non-tradable services, we suggest alternative policies that reach the same goal without increasing inequality.

Specifically, changes in implied volatility are found to be meaningfully associated with crude returns only over the period spanning the recent financial crisis.

If one individual solves the problem, the team solves it as well. Advisees whose advisors play strategically have significantly higher levels of strategic play, but fall well short of the truth wins benchmark as (i) many advisors who play strategically do not provide advice to this effect, and (ii) many advisees fail to follow sound advice. Effect (i) is largely attributable to female advisors who are far less likely to provide advice than men.

Between 2007 and 2012 we have the Great Recession, which had a mild impact in the German labor market while it had a more profound impact on the Ukrainian labor market. This enables us to investigate whether and how the crisis impacted on the risk attitudes in the two countries. By focusing on self-employment we also investigate whether the reduced willingness to take risks as a consequence of the Great Recession affects labor market dynamics and outcomes.

Specifically, contemporary migration increases income inequality, whereas lagged migration has a strong income inequality-reducing effect on the sending villages.

However, because the IRF-based Wald test is conditional on the magnitude of an oil price shock, it can sometimes prove to be impractical, especially when producing contrasting evidence for shocks of different sizes. To circumvent this problem, this paper suggests considering a nonparametric IRF-density-based test in addition to the Wald. The former allows the analysis of (a)symmetries in dynamic impulse responses to positive and negative oil price shocks of a wide range of magnitudes. The test permits inference about a general tendency of (a)symmetries in impulse responses as opposed to (a)symmetries pertinent to a shock of a given size only. The examined (a)symmetry is thus unconditional of the magnitude of a shock. Importantly, the testing procedure allows accounting for the relative likelihood of observing the disturbance of a given size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This theory is consistent with the views of many managers and personal administrators, who tend to ascribe primary importance to wage setting as an incentive to increase effort. We use a micro panel data set of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 2004-2009 to simultaneously estimate a stochastic frontier of a firm's value added and the inefficiency determinants.

The underlying theoretical argument is that bifurcation of tight-knit minority communities between countries nurtures separatist or irredentist sentiments among affected community members, thus prompting terrorist activity, while minority community members in other countries might mobilize financial and political resources to support terrorist activity among their compatriots. In this study, we empirically test whether transnational dispersion, versus domestic concentration, of minority communities in countries produces higher incidents of terrorism. Conducting a series of negative binomial estimations on a reshaped database of around 170 countries from 1981 to 2006, derived from the Minorities at Risk database and the Global Terrorism Database, we determine that both transnational dispersion of kin minority communities and domestic concentration of minorities within countries increase terrorism and that transnational dispersion is a particularly robust predictor of terrorist attacks.","[Arva, Bryan J.; Piazza, James A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Piazza, JA (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jap45@psu.edu,,,,,,,63,6,6,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Jordan and Lebanon are hosting the majority of them. This paper utilizes data regarding unemployment rates, employment rates, labor force participation, the number of refugees, and economic activity at the level of governorates. The vector autoregressive methodology is used to examine time series data from the most affected governorates in Jordan.

Our results suggest that providing social insurance coverage for the entire population may, in this case, be feasible from a revenue point of view even when payroll taxes are eliminated. The model suggests that alternative sources for the financing of social insurance may also be efficient, and that the reallocation from energy subsidies to social insurance subsidies may be, in fact, a more sensible policy.

An aggregation rule is a function mapping this information into a unique social ordering. In a recent paper, Bossert and Sprumont (2014) introduced betweenness-based notions of efficiency and strategyproofness for aggregation rules and identified three broad classes of rules which satisfy them. The current paper suggests that such betweenness-based requirements may at times be too weak and introduces stronger concepts based on Kemeny distances, namely K-efficiency and K-strategyproofness. When there are three alternatives, all Condorcet-Kemeny rules are both K-efficient and K-strategyproof for a large subdomain of profiles. Moreover, all status-quo rules are K-strategyproof, though not K-efficient. When the number of alternatives exceeds three none of the rules discussed by Bossert and Sprumont satisfies K-strategyproofness, while just Condorcet-Kemenyrules satisfy K-efficiency. The existence of a nondictatorial and onto K-strategyproof rule is an open question. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

(2) Wage differentials cross primary, secondary and tertiary sectors accounted for a substantial portion of measured overall labour misallocation; the secondary sector's wage deviations from value of the marginal product of labour (VMPL) also contributed to labour misallocation. (3) There was persistence in labour misallocation, but a higher level of urbanization, the development of the tertiary sector, increasing trade openness and the growth of the nonstate sector appear to have contributed to more efficient labour allocation.","[Bai, Peiwen] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Wenli] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Xiamen University; Monash University,"Bai, PW (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",bpw_888@163.com,,"Cheng, Wenli/0000-0002-9788-8717",China National Social Science Fund [13BJY037],China National Social Science Fund,The author acknowledges with gratitude the financial support from China National Social Science Fund [13BJY037].,,27,17,17,9,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

During cyclical movements, fiscal policy can play an important role in order to help stabilise the economy. But discretionary policy usually implies implementation lags and is not automatically reversed when economic conditions change. In contrast, automatic fiscal stabilisers (SFA) ensure a prompter, and self-correcting fiscal response. The present study aims to tackle the topic of discretionary vs nondiscretionary characteristic of fiscal stabilisers (SF). In this context, the scope of the research undertaking is to launch a scientific debate over the definitions of the concepts of non-automatic fiscal stabilisers (SfnA) and SFAs. We describe how we can quantify the discretionary and non-discretionary character of the fiscal policy, by the analysis of the structure of the conventional budget balance (SBc), budget balance associated with the current GDP. In the final part of this article, we propose a quantitative equilibrium model for establishing the mathematical prerequisites for an SF to become automatic. Likewise, on the basis of the proposed mathematical model we have performed a qualitative analysis of the influence factors.","[Bratian, Vasile; Oprean, Camelia] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Dept Finance Accounting, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania; [Bucur, Amelia] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Informat, Sibiu, Romania; [Tanasescu, Cristina] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Oprean, C (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Dept Finance Accounting, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania.",camelia.oprean@ulbsibiu.ro,"Tanasescu, Cristina/AAM-3983-2020; Tanasescu, Cristina/ABE-9989-2020; Bucur, Amelia/AGU-1269-2022; Oprean-Stan, Camelia/AAL-5673-2020","Tanasescu, Cristina/0000-0001-8347-4014; Oprean-Stan, Camelia/0000-0003-3492-2401",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu [LBUS-IRG-2015-01],Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,This work was supported by Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu [grant number LBUS-IRG-2015-01],,20,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We first show that, when there is no technical progress, the duration of the plant is longer for a profit-maximizing firm. We then consider technical progress leading to either capacity expansion or to operating costs reduction. We show that duration tends to increase when the installed capacity increases over time, while it tends to decrease when technical progress reduces operating costs, both for profit-maximizing and welfare-maximizing firms.

These sources have been identified as competing explanations for time-varying features of major industrial economies during the 1980s and 1990s. Although hardly distinguishable through the lens of standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, lower nonpolicy shock variances and tighter monetary policy regimes imply higher and lower term premia, respectively. As a result, moving to tighter monetary policy alone cannot explain the improved U.S. macroeconomic stability in the 1980s and 1990s: term premia would have shifted downward, a fact inconsistent with the evidence of higher premia from early 80s onward. Conversely, favorable shifts in nonpolicy innovation variance imply movements in term premia that are at least qualitatively consistent with historical patterns.","[Carboni, Giacomo] European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Carboni, G (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",giacomo.carboni@ecb.int,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Then, we apply the concept of endogenous propensity to import, varying with capacity utilization, to a neo-Kaleckian model of growth and distribution.

Our results indicate that there is a one-directional linear causality from stock returns to investor sentiment on the original series, while there is a strong bi-directional nonlinear causality between stock returns and investor sentiment at different timescales.","[Chu, Xiaojun; Qiu, Jianying] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210044, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xiaojun; Wu, Chongfeng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jianying] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Chu, XJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210044, Peoples R China.;Chu, XJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",lpchxj@nuist.edu.cn,,"Chu, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3589-9218",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M571546],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the [project number 2015M571546] of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.,,29,38,39,3,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These analysed multinational companies gained the institutional support in the form of investment incentives. Based on the comparative analysis of data from the companies' annual reports and Czech statistical office and CzechInvestin 1999-2013, foreign presence is calculated. The foreign presence is together with the technology gap considered as key determinant of spillover effects' creation. The calculated values illustrate low degree of foreign presence till - 8 %, more precisely low potential for the creation of spillover effects. This conclusion confirms the technology gap probed by the Shift-share analysis. It means the decomposition of the technology level of region on the technology, sectors and combination of both these effects. The result is conesponding with the localization of manufactures or manufactures' fragmentation with low added value to the analyzed region. In addition to that, the paper quantifies cultural distance between source countries of the investment and the Czech Republic. The calculation of cultural distance is based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions by Kogut-Singh index and Euclidean index. In examined time period, investors from total 10 countries invested in Pardubice region and 36 % of them came from Germany. Differences between Germany and Czech Republic in cultural dimensions prove previous studies about their relation to the development of foreign direct investment. Significantly highest cultural distance between Czech Republic and considered countries was found out with Denmark, followed by Netherlands and Great Britain.","[Cuhlova, Renata] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic; [Kotikova, Sylvie] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; Technical University Liberec,"Cuhlová, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",renata.cuhlova@tul.cz; sylvie.kotikova@tul.cz,"Cuhlova, Renata/ABH-3653-2020","Cuhlova, Renata/0000-0002-5109-6693",science project SGS grant,science project SGS grant,This paper is an output of the science project SGS grant - Foreign Direct Investment and the Impact on Regional Labour Markets in the Czech Republic.,,22,1,1,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,337,344,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800043,0

Evidence is presented that the current framework is conducive to fiscal sustainability, especially after the reforms in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Second, the paper analyses the impact of transfers and oil and mining royalties and the effort to raise own tax revenues at the departmental level. Overall, there is little evidence of a negative effect of transfers from the central government on departmental tax revenue, the so-called fiscal fatigue.

Thus, from the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal it is possible to estimate the approach/ withdrawal index, and this index has been largely investigated and validated in scientific literature, regarding visual and acoustic stimuli. In this work, we present an innovative study aimed to prove, in a systematic way, that such brain AW index is actually correlated with the pleasant or no-pleasant perception also of olfactory stimuli, conveniently produced by standardised methods in the sensory specific scientific literature. In particular, we recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal from a group, gender balanced, of 24 healthy and no-smokers subjects during the perception of ten different smells, presented by means of the Screening test-odour identification set (Sniffin' sticks, Burghart). The cerebral AW indexes of all the subjects, for each odorous stimulus, were compared with the appreciation numeric score assessed by the subject during the experiment, by performing a statistical correlation test. Findings show that it is possible to evaluate the pleasantness or no-pleasantness of odorous substances by means of the analysis of EEG signals collected during the presentation of such substances, making way for new applications of such measure kind in experimental environments more and more ecological, as the typical ones of the marketing research areas.","[Di Flumeri, Gianluca; Trettel, Arianna] BrainSigns Srl, Via Sesto Celere 7c, I-00152 Rome, Italy; [Herrero, Maria Trinidad] Univ Murcia, Sch Med, Inst Biomed Res Murcia IMIB, Clin & Expt Neurosci, Campus Mare Nostrum, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Cherubino, Patrizia] IULM Univ, Dept Econ & Mkt, Milan, Italy; [Cherubino, Patrizia] Via Gigi Peronace, I-88068 Soverato, CZ, Italy; [Maglione, Anton Giulio] BrainSigns Srl, Via Sesto Celere 7c, I-00155 Rome, Italy; [Colosimo, Alfredo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Anat Histol Forens Med & Orthoped Sci, Via Alfonso Borelli, I-00161 Rome 50, Italy; [Moneta, Elisabetta; Peparaio, Marina] Agr Res Council, Food & Nutr Res Ctr CRA NUT, Via Ardeatina, I-00178 Rome 546, Italy; [Babiloni, Fabio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Mol Med, Via Macchia Palocco 107a, Rome, Italy",University of Murcia; IULM International University Languages & Media; Sapienza University Rome; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Sapienza University Rome,"Di Flumeri, G (通讯作者)，BrainSigns Srl, Via Sesto Celere 7c, I-00152 Rome, Italy.",gianluca.diflumeri@uniroma1.it; mtherrer@um.es; arianna.trettel@brainsigns.com; patrizia.cherubino@brainsigns.com,"Di Flumeri, Gianluca/I-7196-2019","Di Flumeri, Gianluca/0000-0003-4426-051X; Cherubino, Patrizia/0000-0001-7669-5855",,,,,12,37,37,0,20,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-28419-4; 978-3-319-28417-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,373,381,,10.1007/978-3-319-28419-4_23,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF9OA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385789700023,0

For every country it is necessary to ensure internal and external security. Defense should be seen as preventative spending as well as like an insurance policy. In terms of that, many policy makers have to decide how much money should be spent on defense. This paper investigates the tendencies and relationships of defense spending and economic growth in the European Union (EU) countries taking into consideration the level of countries' economic development over the period of 2004-2013. The authors have done this by considering a number of descriptive statistical indicators and applying Granger testing. Based on the real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the European Union countries have been classified into five categories. The association between defense spending and economic growth has been estimated. On the basis of causality testing, the prevailing causality direction is from defense spending to economic growth in the group of countries of a very high level of economic development. However, in the group of countries of lower or mid-level of economic development the causality runs from economic growth to defense spending. For the remaining group of countries, no causal relationship has been detected between these two variables. The paper is concerned with defense spending and economic growth only. The authors have not considered all the other factors. That is the major limitation of this paper. Despite of this, the research highlights the key trends and relationships, which should be of particular interest to policy makers. However, every country is unique, and the economic growth or decline do not imply spontaneous change in defense expenditure. Prospective threats may be the most important factor for the expansion of defense spending.","[Dudzeviciute, Gitana] Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Silo St 5a, LT-10322 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dudzeviciute, Gitana; Peleckis, Kestutis; Peleckiene, Valentina] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Dudzeviciute, G (通讯作者)，Gen Jonas Zemaitis Mil Acad Lithuania, Silo St 5a, LT-10322 Vilnius, Lithuania.;Dudzeviciute, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",gitana.dudzeviciute@vgtu.lt,"Peleckienė, Valentina/JXN-9424-2024","Dudzeviciute, Gitana/0000-0002-4891-224X",,,,,34,5,5,2,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The article examines statistics of the bankruptcy and restructuring of enterprises, problems and ways of their resolution and analyses mergers and acquisitions and their causes. The majority of enterprises merge in order to expand their activities and to diversify the risks associated with such activities. Smaller enterprises, which are incapable of competing in the international market, are forced to bring themselves under the protection of large international enterprises. The mergers and acquisitions of enterprises take place also in order to capture new technological opportunities, to enhance an enterprise's trademark, to achieve a variety of synergistic effects, economies of scale and management, improved allocation of resources and market power gains and to attain a number of other goals. Thus, in times of globalisation and the free movement of capital the issues of mergers and acquisitions are becoming increasingly topical due to the emerging opportunities of seeking alliance or acquisition in international markets.

I then outline ten principles that reflect the models and propositions. While very different in form than the familiar Walrasian price-auction model, this relatively succinct approach to wage determination leads to many testable hypotheses. It also explains questions, such as: Why can the minimum wage not often be raised without causing unemployment? Why has wage inequality increased within occupations and educational levels, as well as between? Why does high pay tend to be accompanied by better benefits, working conditions, and on-the-job training (rather than compensating for the lack of one of these)? The insights of many contemporary institutional economists, including Robert Prasch, are particularly important to this analysis, along with earlier work of John R.

Both agreements, if implemented, are likely to globalize international trade even further. Since the United Kingdom is an important trading partner for both Canada and the United States, the question arises whether its decision to leave the European Union can compromise the future fate of these two free trade agreements. The aim of this paper is to examine the possible impact of Brexit on the future of CETA and TTIP and to analyze the legal steps necessary for these free trade agreements to come into force since their legal nature has not been clarified yet. Both of these agreements can be treated either as agreements negotiated within the exclusive mandate of the EU which would greatly simplify the ratification process or as mixed agreements interfering with the shared powers between the European Union and its Member States. The latter scenario would make the ratification process much more difficult, since the veto by a single Member State could stop the entire agreement from becoming effective.","[Grmelova, Nicole] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Grmelová, N (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",grmelova@vse.cz,"Grmelova, Nicole/JNE-6880-2023",,,,,,16,1,1,0,8,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,540,546,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800067,0

Low variable cost renewables increasingly make investments in gas-fired generation unprofitable. At the same time, growing feed-in from intermittent RETs amplifies fluctuations in power generation, thus entailing the need for flexible buffer capacity currently mostly gas-fired power plants. A real options approach is applied to evaluate investment decisions and timing of a single investor in gas-fired power generation, We investigate the necessity and effectiveness of capacity payments. Our model incorporates multiple uncertainties and assesses the effect of capacity payments under different degrees of RET penetration. In a numerical study, we implement stochastic processes for peak-load electricity prices and natural gas prices. We find that capacity payments are an effective measure to promote new gas-fired generation projects. Especially in times of high renewable feed-in, capacity payments are required to incentivize peak-load investments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Similar to certain arrangements in the market for bank loans, household borrowing is restricted by a household-specific wealth dependent upper bound on credit lines in all states of uncertainty in the second period. We first establish that, generically in the set of the economies, equilibria exist and are finite and regular. We then show that equilibria are generically suboptimal. Finally, we provide a robust example demonstrating that the equilibrium allocations can be Pareto improved through a tightening of the participation constraints. This suggests, contrary to what is often cited as economic wisdom in the popular press, that in a setting with frictions resulting in an inefficient allocation the regulation of markets may have a Pareto-improving effect on the economy.","[Hoelle, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Pireddu, Marina] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dip Matemat & Applicaz, I-20125 Milan, Italy; [Villanacci, Antonio] Univ Florence, Dip Sci Econ & Impresa, I-50127 Florence, Italy",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Florence,"Villanacci, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dip Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",mhoelle@purdue.edu; marina.pireddu@unimib.it; antonio.villanacci@unifi.it,,"VILLANACCI, ANTONIO/0000-0002-0309-4618",,,,,24,5,6,0,5,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The odds of supporting redistribution decrease for people living in the Aegean region according to both the surveys. For 2007, being in the highest income category relative to the middle is associated with a decreased opposition to inequality and support for redistribution.

This agreement includes that both sides, the EU and the Ukraine, will mutually open their markets for goods and services based on predictable and necessary trade rules and values of the EU. These rules of the DCFTA provide the Ukraine with an ambitious agenda for political and economic reforms and the equality of standards and rules of the Ukraine with the EU in areas such as competition, public procurement and intellectual property rights. The Ukrainian market for Slovakia and mutual foreign trade is very important from the point of view of the size of the market of Ukraine, geographical and linguistic proximity. Foreign trade between the Ukraine and Slovakia during the period of 20082015 has been gradually decreasing. Results for the first half of 2016 reflect the implementation of the DCFTA: the DCFTA improved the business and investment climate in the Ukraine through the removal of customs tariffs, tariff burdens and administrative burdens. For several years now, the Ukraine has been trying to draw nearer to those EU member states that will attract new investment, thus creating new jobs, increasing purchasing power and living standards in the Ukraine, thereby strengthening foreign trade between the Ukraine and Slovakia.

Therefore, today the time to release the industrial policy from the shadows has come, which led to the concept of a new industrial policy. Today the economy has entered its post-industrial development phase when the services sector, insensible assets, etc. play an enormous role. All these result in a certain terminological confusion. Thus, some authors say that the industrial policy is outdated and discredited within the classical meaning. However, this point of view seems to be a bit incorrect. The fact is that in modern conditions the principles of plant placement changed, the geographic dispersion of plants increased and that resulted in an illusion that the industry made a small contribution to the economic well-being.

The contribution is methodically based on the socio-economic, comparative and statistical analysis of the available literature, references, sources of data, interpretation of information, synthesis and generalization of knowledge. It is clear that the peak of the mining in SHR is behind us and it is in decline. But it does not mean that its meaning will be negligible in the near future. In this district, the mining industry has the deep roots and it is closely related to the entire region. And it will be again the man who will decide to break this tight relationship. Presently discussed territorial limits and their eventual breaking determine how slow will be the decline of mining and how strong will be the further economic, social and environmental impacts, which can be seen from the 90s of the last century. It is almost certain that the mining activity in the region will count with decades, but it is also possible that the mining in the district will benefit even in a hundred years. Whatever it is though, it will be the last chapter in this important period of the history of the region. A new phase begins at the end of this period, probably quite different and perhaps better for the local residents and the entire region.","[Kurka, Bohumil; Kunc, Josef] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Kurka, B (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",kurka@mail.muni.cz; kunc@econ.muni.cz,"Kunc, Josef/C-4309-2014",,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,673,681,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-86,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500087,0

This article proposes the contrary argument that financialization is a functionally useful feature of contemporary capitalism that is entirely in keeping with the latter's continuing development as a commodity system. Specifically, it will be argued that just as globalization represents the extension of the commodity principle along the axis of geographical space, financialization represents the extension of this same principle along the axis of time: the future is being colonized so as to make it take the overspill of the pressures on organizations operating in the present.","[Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ CITYPERC, Polit Econ Res Ctr, London, England",City University London,"Lysandrou, P (通讯作者)，City Univ CITYPERC, Polit Econ Res Ctr, London, England.",,,,,,,,65,14,16,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Trade reforms had a positive impact, while investment and the policies implemented in the mid-1990s had negative effects on structural change.

Studies based on the European Regional Innovation Scoreboard (RIS) have demonstrated that R&D investments, support to the high technology industry and patenting intensity of the public sector differ in high-and low-income European countries. This fact refers to the need for adequate IP strategic indicators' system facilitating innovation in less developed countries. The paper aims to conceptualize and suggest a strategic indicators' system of IP for a small efficiency-driven economy. In contrast to the rather modest level of patenting by industry, universities of the Baltic States file approximately 50 % of PCT patent applications. Therefore, it is crucial to overcome barriers, hindering universities' IP commercialization. Academia-Industry collaboration includes two types of IP strategies: Active non-linear and Passive linear behavioural models of universities and public sector. An essential part of the active approach focuses on the soft measures for networking with firms in collaborative platforms such as AIMday (R) at the Uppsala University in Sweden. The proposed IP strategy system involves qualitative and quantitative indicators at the state as well as university and company level. The comparison of academic publishing and patenting by the staff of Tartu and Uppsala universities testifies to their rather same levels of productivity. Three times wider patent families of the inventions of Uppsala origin characterize actors' market ambition as well as the strength of the University-Industry linkages that are more developed in Uppsala than in Tartu.","[Mets, Tonis] Queensland Univ Technol, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Kelli, Aleksei; Mets, Ave; Tiimann, Tiit] Univ Tartu, Ulikooli 18, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Tartu,"Mets, T (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",mets.tonis@gmail.com; aleksei.kelli@ut.ee; ave.mets@ut.ee; tiimann.tiit@gmail.com,"/AHD-4125-2022; Mets, Tõnis/AAH-2926-2019; /ABA-9691-2021; Mets, Ave/AAW-1124-2021; Mets, Ave/F-7741-2017; Kelli, Aleksei/J-2986-2015","Mets, Tõnis/0000-0003-3972-5204; Mets, Ave/0000-0003-3105-1313; Kelli, Aleksei/0000-0002-0856-1000",European Social Foundation through the Research and Innovation Policy Monitoring Programme,European Social Foundation through the Research and Innovation Policy Monitoring Programme,This publication has been supported by the European Social Foundation through the Research and Innovation Policy Monitoring Programme.,,37,2,4,2,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Many successful companies have already realized that they must have a sense of responsibility not only for their business activities but also for the development of the whole society. Responsible behaviour cannot be just a one-off random action. This often requires a fundamental change in thinking of owners, managers and employees of companies in the ethical, social and environmental area; it must be long-temi and consistent business philosophy. On that basis the paper focuses on selected innovative approaches in socially responsible marketing in a global environment environmental marketing and cause related marketing. The aim is to define the essence of those approaches and indicates the application potential of them in the practice of companies. The environmental marketing is responding to the current negative trends in the natural environment and to the requirements of developing segment of environmentally oriented consumers. Cause related marketing is the commercial activity through which the company and non-profit organisation create a partnership in order to promote the image, product or service because of mutual benefit and together they contribute to the promotion of good things or to solving some of societal problem. The selected results of exploratory surveys are included, in which we focused on examining of companies responsible marketing activities effects on consumer decision processes and behaviour.","[Musova, Zdenka; Musa, Hussam; Huliakova, Zuzana] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Musová, Z (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",zdenka.musova@umb.sk; hussam.musa@umb.sk; zuzana.huliakova@umb.sk,"Musa, Hussam/C-9944-2019",,,,,,20,6,6,0,8,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1466,1473,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800181,0

The paper describes the zone of tolerance for patients' service expectations and determines patient satisfaction level for public and private hospitals. The 'zone of tolerance' is recognized in the service-quality literature as representing a range of expectations (desired and adequate) and an area of acceptable outcomes in service interactions. The patient satisfaction level of public and private hospitals is identified and compared. The conceptual model, HEALTHZOT, is presented in this study and the results demonstrate that the evaluation of services can be scaled according to different types of expectations - 'desired' and 'adequate' - and that patients use these two types of expectations as a comparison standard in evaluating healthcare services. The results obtained for public and private hospital services represent a narrow zone of tolerance. Patients' perceived service received' in public hospitals was lower when compared to private hospital services. The results of an exploratory factor analysis reveal that the SERVQUAL model is found to be unidimensional for both the public and private hospitals in this study. The results, managerial implications and future research implications are discussed below in detail.","[Nadiri, Halil] Cyprus Int Univ, Dept Business Adm, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Hussain, Kashif] UCSI Univ Kuala Lumpur Campus North Wing, Fac Hospitality & Tourism Management, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Cyprus International University; UCSI University,"Nadiri, H (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Dept Business Adm, Nicosia, Cyprus.",,"Hussain, Kashif/JDN-2995-2023; Hussain, Kashif/A-6326-2014","Hussain, Kashif/0000-0002-2923-3575",,,,,107,4,5,1,22,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The results demonstrate that trust is a robust and positive determinant of stock market depth and liquidity, and that trust is the most relevant component of social capital in market development. Macroeconomic instability in the form of inflationary changes has a dampening effect on trust in the trading of stock. Further, social capital and its components, particularly trust, are more relevant to stock market development in countries with weak rule of law, non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (non-OECD) and Organization of Islamic Co-operation (OIC) countries that are generally characterized by lower formal institutional quality.

We employ the Theil's inequality coefficient to investigate the magnitude of assessment errors and its partitioning in to bias, slope and random components. Furthermore, this article also evaluates the efficiency, biasedness and persistence of forecast errors. The robustness of the efficiency results are confirmed with the application of maximum entropy bootstrap. The objective of this study is to examine the structural basis on which FCs make their awards rather than examining the predictability of the forecasts. The story of FC's assessments reflects an interesting political economy theatre of contention between aspirations and outcomes. Our key findings are as follows: First, source of errors for assessments of tax revenue, nontax revenue, interest payments, defence revenue expenditure, plan revenue expenditure and fiscal deficit is principally due to random component. However, the errors in the remaining economic parameters originate due to systematic components i.e. mean and slope errors. Second, the expenditure side predictability is lower than the revenue side predictability.","[Nithin, K.] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, New Delhi, India; [Roy, Rathin] Natl Inst Publ Finance & Policy, New Delhi, India",National Institute of Public Finance & Policy (NIPFP),"Nithin, K (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Foreign Trade, New Delhi, India.",nithink.k@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, ISLM is an essentially orthodox model based on neoclassical foundations and fails completely as an adequate representation of central elements of Keynes's macroeconomic thought. This article proposes IYLM as areplacement for ISLM, the new model being General Theory-compatible in that it is grounded only on key propositions in that work. Its purpose is to contribute, within the constraints of a two-market framework, to the resuscitation of Keynes's macroeconomics as an alternative to the inadequacies of much current macroeconomics. The first part of the article derives the model and argues that those sympathetic to The General Theory can accept the IYLM framework whilst simultaneously rejecting ISLM. The second part shows that Hicks-Hansen ISLM is based on an income-augmented form of orthodox loanable funds theory.","[O'Donnell, Rod] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Rogers, Colin] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Adelaide,"O'Donnell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",rod.odonnell@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,22,10,10,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, there is little evidence to suggest that such correlations are causal, that is, for the sake of relationship public goods such as the pleasures of the enlightened conversations that only a common high level of education might support. Being empirical studies, they cannot rule out couples matching on other characteristics like income, height or health, which are correlated with education, from driving results. We contribute to this literature by randomly assigning high and low education and income levels to 388 artificial male and female profiles on a large online dating website in China. We then counted thousands of 'visits' - clicks on abbreviated profiles, which included education and income information, from search engine results. We found that men's visits to female profiles were unaffected by the profile's assigned education level, while women's visits to male profiles increase with the profile's education. However, that increase was not increasing on the women's own level of education, though their visits to the higher income male profiles was increasing on their own education. Our findings suggest that the relationship public goods that stem from a common level of high education are not at the forefront of either men's or women's minds before their first dates, when one might expect such goods to play a critical role in the decision to develop the relationship further.","[Ong, David] Peking Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Ong, David] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Peking University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Ong, D (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Ong, D (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dvdong@gmail.com,"Ong, David/AAJ-3336-2020","Ong, David/0000-0002-9373-0795",,,,,27,7,8,4,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Underlying data for analysis were obtained mainly from the Employment Services Administration of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs statistics. The basic method is to compare the results of different methods for calculating the unemployment rate and to measure the variability using standard statistical indicators (variation range, coefficient of variation). The analysis confirmed that the new registered unemployment indicator (introduced since 2013) caused the reduction of the disparities between districts and smaller territorial units. Using the new indicator (Share of unemployed) is therefore not as suitable indicator for assessing the socio-economic level of regions and the situation on regional labor markets as was the former indicator (Registered unemployment rate).","[Palcrova, Sarka; Novak, Vaclav] JE Pukryne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dep Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Pasteurova 1, Usti Nad Labem 40001, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Palcrová, S (通讯作者)，JE Pukryne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dep Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Pasteurova 1, Usti Nad Labem 40001, Czech Republic.",palcrovas@seznam.cz; vaclav.novak@ujep.cz,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,392,401,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-50,0.0,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500051,0

At the moment, in Croatia there are three closed-ended investment funds on the Zagreb Stock Exchange. For them, in the period of 5 years (from the period 2010-2014) is observed a correlation between the two variables: earnings per share and the market share price. The assumption is that the market share price is positively correlated with the business results achieved by the company, because generally movement of the market share price is accompanied by the profitability of the company. That is because the investors while making investment decision about buying shares are observing the business results of a company as well as potential earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there is the assumption that there is a positive correlation between earnings per share, which is one of the indicators of investment companies based on the business performance of the company and the market share price. Earnings per share is one of the most important indicators for the investors on the capital market, whose methodology for calculating is regulated according to International Accounting Standard 33 Earnings per share. The aim is to prove evidence that there is a positive correlation between earnings per share and the market share price for each of the three closed-ended investment funds in the period observed. In order to achieve the aim of the paper, secondary data obtained from the Zagreb Stock Exchange d. d. were used. Those data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics methods. Results of the research conducted showed that there is a positive correlation between earnings per share and the market share price in closed-endedinvestment funds in the period of 2010-2014 in Croatia.","[Percevic, Hrvoje; Hladika, Mirjana; Micin, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Percevic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",hpercevic@efzg.hr; mhladika@efzg.hr; mmicin@efzg.hr,"Perčević, Hrvoje/JXR-7488-2024; Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018; Hladika, Mirjana/I-1145-2018; Ercegovic, Marina/H-8303-2018","Perčević, Hrvoje/0000-0001-9410-0755; Hladika, Mirjana/0000-0003-3170-9138; Ercegovic, Marina/0000-0003-1156-6416",,,,,11,1,1,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,1069,1077,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600106,0

Capping of direct payments would affect about 500 farms if salaries and social security payments are not considered and around 50 farms if salaries and social security payments are considered. Capped farms differ from farms that are not affected by the capping measure. Large farms affected by the measure of capping are politically the most influential ones. For that reason capping was not supported by the Slovak government in the negotiation process and Slovakia opted for redistributive payment which has smaller impact on large farms in Slovakia. Characteristics of the would-be capped farms show that they might be a really effective interest group able to influence the government position of no capping. The would-be capped farms have enough members to utilize economy of scale in lobbying within Slovakia. They would lose significant amount of money from capping. On the other hand, small farms are too dispersed, have high communication and organizing costs and their preferences are not homogenous. From economic point of view it is rational to reduce direct payments to large farms because large farms in Slovakia have fewer employees, lower value added, and lower sales per hectare than smaller farms. Large farms also specialize mostly in cereals or oilseed with very limited animal production and therefore contribute to rural development less than small farms.","[Pokrivcak, Jan; Toth, Marian] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",jpokrivcak@yahoo.com; marian.toth@uniag.sk,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019",,"Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0552, VEGA 1/0912/14, VEGA 1/0930/15]",Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),"This paper was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-15-0552 with the title Impact of financial markets and agricultural policies on the agri-food sector, VEGA 1/0912/14 with the title The Common Agricultural Policy 20142020 and its impact on the financial situation of farms in Slovakia, VEGA 1/0930/15 with the title Impact of agricultural subsidies on productivity of farms and food safety.",,21,2,2,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1744,1752,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800216,0

Unfavorable socioeconomic trends are particularly evident in Southeast Europe, of which Croatia is a part of, especially in the countries bordering the European Union. In these bordering countries every other citizen is exposed to the above stated risks. Without neglecting the necessity of economic growth, social entrepreneurship addresses these problems by investing profits in the community, which evens the distribution of wealth, by means of practicing equality in decision-making (one member one vote), increasing possibilities for the disadvantaged and taking greater care of the environment. Such organizations foster inclusion and employment, equitable distribution of goods and informing the public about its activities. Social entrepreneurship in Southeast Europe is still a very rare, but increasingly common kind of work and business - it is insufficiently institutionalized due to the lack of tradition and awareness about civic activism, as well as the lack of legislative and strategic support for these companies in terms of clear criteria and benefits, funding sources, education, training, consulting etc. Therefore, the European Union encourages networking in Southeast Europe by (co) funding projects that do not exclude social responsibility from market competitiveness. Benefits of such an approach could become apparent in Croatia, not only in the form of new jobs but also in increasing possibilities for further community development. In this regard, the aim of this study is to present experiences and perspectives on social entrepreneurship in Southeast Europe countries, based on the conducted comparative analysis of policy documents and published research. The results should lead towards a better understanding of present patterns, the role and the importance of the given phenomenon and form a starting ground for future research.","[Popovic, Toni] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Poljana Kraljice Jelene 1-3, Split, Croatia; [Relja, Renata] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Sociol, Put Iza Nove Bolnice 10c, Split, Croatia; [Gutovic, Tea] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Put Iza Nove Bolnice 10c, Split, Croatia",,"Popovic, T (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Poljana Kraljice Jelene 1-3, Split, Croatia.",tonpop@ffst.hr; rrelja@ffst.hr; teagut@ffst.hr,"Relja, Renata/L-5625-2019","Relja, Renata/0000-0002-5684-4558",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,799,815,,,,,,17,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600080,0

The present article aims to assess the European Union support in terms of differences in the adjustment of aid in sectors in different regions. We assume that regional policy should support those sectors in regions that are competitive. This means across the board should not only be supported selected sectors but the policy must respect specific situation of sectors in various regions. Empirical analysis is based on evaluation of support in two selected countries of Central and Eastern Europe - the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Specifically, the paper provides an analysis of competitiveness support of companies and distribution of this aid by sectors and regions. Conclusions of empirical research indicate significant differences in sectoral and territorial distribution of aid, despite the fact that there are two neighbouring countries with similar support setting and with common history, which joined the European Union at the same time.","[Sipikal, Miroslav; Nemethova, Valeria] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Sipikal, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",miroslav.sipikal@euba.sk; valeria.nemethova@euba.sk,"Šipikal, Miroslav/HJY-0623-2023","Šipikal, Miroslav/0000-0002-7205-3385",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0512],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-14-0512.,,12,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,764,770,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200080,0

Indeed, its positive outcomes on social and economic development have been mostly documented on a local level. In Slovakia, the concept of social capital in local and regional development is rather new both in academic and public administration context. Whereas the academia should define the concept and operationalise it, it is up to public administration planners to apply it to the strategic programmes on national and regional levels in order to promote its deployment on a local level. The aim of this article is, first, to review the literature on social capital and planning in order to provide rationale for incorporating goals and indicators connected with social capital into development programme documents. In the literature, two ways of promoting social capital through planning on a local level are proposed. Apart from including the goals and measures directly connected with the social capital into plans, involving citizens in preparing the plans themselves is seen as crucial. Secondly, we evaluate the results of the survey conducted in municipalities regarding their use of development strategic plans in supporting and utilising social capital in local development. The results show that in the Slovak municipalities of the given size, the social capital is supported via planning and included in strategic plans only in limited ways.","[Svihlova, Dana; Kubisova, L'uboslava] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dep Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Svihlova, D (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dep Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",dana.svihlova@umb.sk; luba.kubisova@umb.sk,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,7,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,402,409,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-51,0.0,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500052,0

This chapter looks at that relationship over two scales (millennial and centennial) and attributes the transitions (tipping points) between adaptation and maladaptation to the unintended consequences of human actions. These, in turn, are due to the difference in dimensionality between the environment and humans' perception of it. Transitions between adaptation and maladaptation occur when a society's value space (i.e., the total set of values that the society knows, which keep that society functionally together) does not expand at a sufficient pace to keep up with the growth of the society's population. This seems to be linked to a second-order dynamic that develops as societies are overwhelmed by the consequences of their own (earlier) actions; their focus turns inward and becomes short term (i.e., tactical instead of strategic). This chapter argues that this is the case in the current, Western-dominated global system, and suggests that an inversion of global information flows (i.e., spreading information rather than concentrating it in the West) has the potential to reenergize the global economic system. This needs to be achieved while respecting the environment, hence the term green growth. It implies rephrasing the current economic and political debates from burden sharing to opportunity creation, both for the developing and for the developed world.","[van der Leeuw, Sander E.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"van der Leeuw, SE (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,"van der Leeuw, Sander/AAF-7850-2019",,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,239,269,,,,,,31,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200013,0

Malapportionment results when decision-making power is not allocated evenly across the population. Two well known institutions with malapportionment have emerged: bicameralism and weighted voting. This paper studies experimentally how agenda setting power affects the distribution of resources, comparing across those two institutions. Conventional wisdom suggests that malapportionment favors scarcely populated states. I find that this is the case under weighted voting, but not necessarily in a bicameral system. In the later case, the allocation of agenda setting power can be used to eliminate distortions stemming from malapportionment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of our exercise is to clarify the effect on systemic failures of the interplay between network interconnectedness and financial acceleration. In particular, we investigate the probability of individual and systemic failures with varying levels of interconnectedness. We find that, in the absence of financial acceleration, connectivity makes the system more resilient.

The model was set on the basis of a sample of construction companies located in south Bohemia. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks were used for its creation.

It has been suggested that investors are likely to shun countries where such rights are strong; in contrast, radical labour market deregulation is seen as encouraging both local business and multinationals to invest. This study explores whether labour market deregulation in South-Eastern Europe has really encouraged multinationals to invest in the region. We find that the weakening of important aspects of employment rights under the law appears to detract from, rather than encourage, foreign direct investment (FDI). We also show that stronger employment rights are more likely to attract FDI when the host country is located within the European Union. This finding suggests that the complementarities associated with stronger employment rights and more committed labour may offset the overall deterrent effects of the greater regulation associated with EU membership.","[Wood, Geoffrey] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Yin, Shuxing; Cheah, Jeremy Eng-Tuck] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Mazouz, Khelifa] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales",University of Warwick; University of Sheffield; Cardiff University,"Yin, SX (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",shuxing.yin@sheffield.ac.uk,"Cheah, Jeremy Eng-Tuck/AAD-7895-2019; Wood, Geoffrey/ABA-5274-2020; Cheah, Jeremy/B-1429-2016","Wood, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9709-1823; Cheah, Jeremy/0000-0003-2953-3815",,,,,80,11,11,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The motivation is to establish the causal and cointegrating relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic variables. The results indicate that cointegration holds between these variables in all countries. Temporal causality results are mixed, from unidirectional causality to bi-directional and even no causality between stock prices and macroeconomic variables. Causality results generally support the 'portfolio approach' that stock prices lead changes in exchange rate. However, the results of impulse response analysis, based on the structural VAR model, support the 'traditional approach' and suggest that it is exchange rate innovations that affect stock prices. Variance decomposition analysis also supports the findings of impulse response analysis.","[Zakaria, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Xi Junyang] SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Zakaria, M (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan.",,"YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/F-1270-2019","YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/0000-0001-5240-1023",,,,,40,0,0,0,6,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

In spite of this, and in contrast to what is found in many industrialized countries, income levels per inhabitant in the capital are below the country average and far from the levels in the wealthiest regions. This was a result of the weakness of agglomeration economies. At the same time, the mining cycles have had an enormous impact in the evolution of the location of economic activity, driving a high dispersion at the end of the 19th century with the nitrates (very concentrated in the space) and the later convergence with the cooper cycle (highly dispersed). In that context, this article describes the evolution of the location of economic activity in the long run, showing the tensions among Heckscher-Ohlin and New Economic Geography forces. I also offer a deeper analysis of the main drivers of this spatial distribution, focusing in the economic structure of the regions, the productivity levels of each specific economic sector and the evolution of market potential.","[Badia-Miro, Marc] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist & Inst Econ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Badia-Miró, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist & Inst Econ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",mbadia@ub.edu,"Badia-Miró, Marc/D-8431-2011","Badia-Miró, Marc/0000-0001-5326-1819","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2009-13331-C02-02, ECO2012-39169-C03-03, ECO2012-39169-C03-02]; Antoni de Campany Centre of Economy and Economic History - Catalan Government [2009SGR153, 2014SGR1345]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Antoni de Campany Centre of Economy and Economic History - Catalan Government,"This work acknowledges the financial support of the research projects financed by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, leaded by Alfonso Herranz (ECO2009-13331-C02-02 and ECO2012-39169-C03-03) and (ECO2012-39169-C03-02) leaded by Daniel A.

OLS estimates based on cross-province and time-series data reveal that the share of dividend income reported by children aged 19 and under declines by 86 % after the introduction of this anti-avoidance rule. The estimates also reveal that the share of capital gains (income not covered by the legislation) reported by minor children increases by 70 % in the post-legislation period, suggesting that parents are switching to an alternative income splitting technique. However, the latter percentage effect is on a small base, and thus, the decrease in dividend income is much larger than the increase in capital gains income. Hence, our analysis suggests that the kiddie tax is an effective method to deter income splitting.","[Bauer, Andrew M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Accountancy, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Macnaughton, Alan] Univ Waterloo, Sch Accounting & Finance, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Sen, Anindya] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Bauer, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Accountancy, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",ambauer@illinois.edu; amacnaug@uwaterloo.ca; asen@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The strike lasted 5 months, ending in June 2014 when producers reached an agreement with the main labour unions. The immediate impacts on local mining towns were particularly severe, but our research shows that the strike could also have long lasting negative impacts on the South African economy as a whole. We find that it is not the higher nominal wages itself that caused the most damage, but the possible reaction by investors in the mining industry towards South Africa. Investor confidence is likely to be, at least, temporarily harmed, in which case it would take many years for the effects of the strike to disappear.

A recent literature goes further to illustrate how historical events and variation can lead to the development of differing and consequential social norms. This paper examines the related questions of how persistent initial variations in social capital are, and the extent to which immigrant groups do or do not converge to the cultural and social norms of their recipient country by examining a unique and geographically concentrated immigration event in 16th century Italy. We demonstrate that despite the substantial time since migration these communities still display different behavior consistent with higher civic capital than other comparable Italian communities. Moreover, we demonstrate that this difference does not appear to have changed over the last 70 years. For instance, differences in voter turnout apparent in the late 1940s remain in the 21st century. This latter finding has implications for our view of the likelihood of assimilation of immigrant groups to local norms, particularly in cases of large-scale migration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These scenarios are not only empirically plausible, but also give rise to rather different policy implications. First, we show that if consumption and leisure are substitutes and their substitutability is relatively large, a temporary rise in inflation can raise, rather than lower, the shadow value of assets. This effect stemming from the rise in the shadow price of assets plays a crucial, but opposite, role vis-a-vis the direct effect of inflation. The induced effect of the shadow price is long-lasting persistence and has a permanent consequence, even though the policy is temporary. As a result, in the steady state, employment, capital, and output increase, rather than decrease, in response to a temporary increase in inflation. Second, if consumption and leisure are complements, we find that in response to a temporary decrease in inflation, employment, capital and output suffer short-run costs in the transition, but reap long-run benefits in-the steady state. This transitional result is in accordance with the Canadian responses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, the literature provides mixed results where bilateral tax treaties have a positive impact on FDI flows in some studies and a negative impact in other studies. Using US FDI outflows disaggregated into financing modes, equity capital, reinvested earnings, and inter-company debt, we estimate fixed-effects quantile regression models that include controls for new tax treaties, existing treaties (in place prior to the start of the sample period), and the total number of tax treaties a host country has in effect. Results, in general, indicate that both new and existing US bilateral tax treaties are associated with lower FDI outflows to the host country, while the total number of treaties a host country has in place is associated with greater US FDI outflows to the host country. These results also hold for reinvested earnings flows and equity capital flows. For debt flows, however, existing treaties are associated with greater flows, while new treaties and the total number of host treaties show no consistent statistically significant effect.","[Daniels, Joseph P.] Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [O'Brien, Patrick] Marquette Univ, Ctr Global & Econ Studies, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [von der Ruhr, Marc B.] St Norbert Coll, De Pere, WI 54115 USA",Marquette University; Marquette University,"Daniels, JP (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",joseph.daniels@mu.edu; obrin37@gmail.com; marc.von-der-ruhr@snc.edu,,,Fulbright Canada; Political Science Department at McMaster University; Center for Global and Economic Studies at Marquette University,Fulbright Canada; Political Science Department at McMaster University; Center for Global and Economic Studies at Marquette University,Daniels gratefully acknowledges support provided by Fulbright Canada and the Political Science Department at McMaster University.

Assessments in teaching & research, and development ability reflect the short-term and long-term performance respectively. Development ability, consisting of human & physical capital, is an essential determinant, which is hardly found in the former evaluation. The performance of universities suggests that current fiscal expenditure allocation mechanism on Chinese universities is unreasonable, and Chinese higher education as a whole is inefficient Furthermore, the performance of universities within the eastern region is better than the universities within the central and western regions, and that of the comprehensive universities is better than most specialist universities. Research and development ability largely determine the overall performance of universities. And the superiority and inferiority still co-exist in Chinese universities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This relationship is difficult to pin down in most IOs because agenda items constantly change and donor coalitions fluctuate with them. I exploit the fact that the IWC has, on the one hand, seen two fixed aid donor blocs opposing each other for three decades over a single issue, but has on the other hand seen rich variation in both membership and voting behavior of aid recipient countries. Using an identification strategy that relates changes in bilateral aid to within-recipient variation in IWC voting-bloc affiliation and fixed cross-sectional variation in donors' voting bloc, the evidence suggests that Japan rewards joining the pro-whaling bloc, and that countries who recently experienced aid reductions from the three big anti-whaling donors - the U.S., the U.K., and France - are more likely to join the pro-whaling bloc.

Trading reveals private information to managers and improves their real decisions, enhancing fundamental value. This feedback effect has an asymmetric effect on trading behavior: it increases (reduces) the profitability of buying (selling) on good (bad) news. This gives rise to an endogenous limit to arbitrage, whereby investors may refrain from trading on negative information.

We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline's ability to fix the world's problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists' objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists' practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.","[Fourcade, Marion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fourcade, Marion] Sci Po, Max Planck Sci Po Ctr, Paris, France; [Ollion, Etienne] Univ Strasbourg, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Strasbourg, France; [Algan, Yann] Sci Po, Paris, France",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Fourcade, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fourcade@berkeley.edu; ollion@unistra.fr; yann.algan@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,76,369,389,4,115,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Empirical results suggest that developed and developing countries exhibit the positive price-income association for different reasons. Specifically, we find only for the inter-developed-country case that the positive price-income association is attributable, at least partly, to the Balassa-Samuelson productivity differential effect. The idiosyncrasy of the inter-developing-country relationship is not dissolved by controlling for the effects of a variety of real and financial variables.

We first show that the separation theorem is still alive under regret aversion by proving that regret aversion is independent of the level of optimal production. On the other hand, we find that the full-hedging theorem does not always hold under regret aversion as the regret-averse firms take hedged positions different from those of risk-averse firms in some situations. With more regret aversion, regret-averse firms will hold smaller optimal hedging positions in an unbiased futures market.

We test this hypothesis in a world sample of countries, in a sample of European regions, as well as among immigrants and children of immigrants living in the US. This evidence reveals a significant negative relationship between years of agriculture and female labor force participation rates, as well as other measures of equality in contemporary gender roles. This finding is robust to the inclusion of an extensive set of possible confounders, including historical plough-use and the length of the growing season. We argue that two mechanisms can explain the result: (1) societies with longer agricultural histories had a higher level of technological advancement which in the Malthusian Epoch translated into higher fertility and a diminished role for women outside the home; (2) the transition to cereal agriculture led to a division of labor in which women spend more time on processing cereals rather than working in the field.","[Hansen, Casper Worm] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jensen, Peter Sandholt; Skovsgaard, Christian Volmar] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark,"Hansen, CW (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",casper.worm.hansen@econ.ku.dk; psj@sam.sdu.dk; chsko@sam.sdu.dk,"Jensen, Peter/ABC-1916-2021","Jensen, Peter/0000-0003-1905-6859; Volmar Skovsgaard, Christian/0000-0003-2064-9942",,,,,89,73,85,2,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

(2002) and Tone (2002), to analyze the influence of banks' internationalization and risk on efficiency. Most former works focused on the effects of risk, but they seldom emphasize the impact of internationalization. Therefore, in addition to the modification of the empirical model, this study also considers internationalization as an external factor into the efficiency measurement. The results show Taiwan's commercial banks could increase its degree of internationalization to improve efficiency, whether by using the strategy of foreign direct investment or increasing foreign shareholding. This study also evidences that several banks have a fine management capacity, but they are easily affected by external factors to be defined as inefficient units.","[Liu, Hsiang-Hsi; Huang, Hsiao-Chin] Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Int Business, New Taipei 151, Taiwan; [Huang, Chin-Wei] Kainan Univ, Dept Business & Entrepreneurial Management, Taoyuan 33857, Taiwan; [Chiu, Yung-Ho] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10048, Taiwan",National Taipei University; Nan Kai University Technology; Soochow University,"Chiu, YH (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10048, Taiwan.",hsiang@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; davy641126@yahoo.com.tw; echiu@scu.edu.tw; a-chin1011@hotmail.com,"chiu, yung-ho/H-5231-2019",,,,,,65,1,1,0,29,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

Using a unique dataset of Chinese private firms, this paper examines the impacts of joining the most prominent business association in China, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) which was initiated and strongly controlled by the government We find that ACFIC members have much higher chances to obtain formal political identities, that is, the deputy of People's Congress (PC) or the People's Political Consultative Conference (PPCC). However, ACFIC membership itself cannot help entrepreneurs acquire scarce resources that are controlled by the government. Rather, ACFIC members bear heavier tax burdens and make more informal payments to government officials. These findings suggest that the ACFIC act as a springboard into politics, rather than an effective collective action committee that can bring common benefits to its members or protect members from government predation.

This is done by modifying the structuralist thesis about the (overstated) positive effects of a rise in TOT on the balance-of-payment equilibrium gross domestic product growth rate. The theoretical analysis follows Thirlwall's law and its subsequent modifications. The paper's main contribution will be to explain and formalize the low and even null effects of TOT on balance-of-payment constraints due to the quasi-rent generated in the export sector of a UPS. To reinforce this idea, the empirical section econometrically shows the existence of a significant and positive relationship between TOT and FAF in developing countries.","[Medici, Florencia] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CITRA UMET, Ctr Innovat Workers, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Medici, Florencia] Natl Univ Moreno UNM, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Medici, Florencia] Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Tupac Panigo, Demian] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CITRA UMET, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Tupac Panigo, Demian] UNM, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Tupac Panigo, Demian] Natl Univ La Plata UNLP, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of La Plata,"Médici, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CITRA UMET, Ctr Innovat Workers, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,"Médici, Florencia/AAU-5516-2021","Médici, Florencia/0000-0001-5741-0519",,,,,34,8,11,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Labor extraction and technological change are related to the production and distribution of surplus and thus are endogenous. Unproductive labor is shown to have potentially contradictory effects. It can squeeze profits and reduce growth or increase work intensity and develop productivity enhancing technological change, which increase profitability and growth. Empirical evidence indicates that both effects occurred in the postwar United States. Marx's reproduction schemes are also shown to rely on a classical growth dynamic in which the profit and savings rates determine the rate of growth.","Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Olsen, EK (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 5100 Rockhill Rd, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",olsenek@umkc.edu,,,,,,,23,6,6,3,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

However, in the presence of structural changes, it is well known that the estimate of long memory will be spurious. Consequently, two modeling approaches are developed to incorporate structural changes into the FIGARCH framework. One approach is to model the intercept in the conditional variance equation via a certain function of time. Based on this approach, the Adaptive-FIGARCH (A-FIGARCH) and Time-Varying FIGARCH (TV-MARCH) models are proposed. The second approach is to model the time-series in separate stages. In the first stage, a certain algorithm is applied to detect the change points. The FIGARCH model is fitted to the time-series in the next stage, with the intercept (and other parameters) being allowed to vary between change points. An example of a recently developed algorithm for detecting change points is the Nonparametric Change Point Model (NPCPM), which can be readily applied to the standard FIGARCH framework (NPCPM-FIGARCH). In this paper, we adopt the second approach but use the Markov Regime-Switching (MRS) model to detect the change points and identify three economic states depending on the scale of volatility. This new 2-stage Three-State FIGARCH (3S-FIGARCH) framework is compared with other FIGARCH-type models via Monte-Carlo simulations and high-frequency datasets. From the comparison, we find that the 3S-FIGARCH model can largely improve the fit and potentially lead to a more reliable estimator of the long-memory parameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For U.S. industries, we find that the stock performance of import-oriented companies moves positively with the performance of the dollar, but the stock performance of export-oriented companies tends to move against the dollar. Based on this finding, we use the imports and exports information to enhance the identification of the dollar risk exposure for different industries, and analyze how each industry's expected stock return varies with its dollar risk exposure. We identify a strongly negative risk premium for bearing positive exposures to the dollar.

While centralizing redistribution allows to pool and redistribute resources at the country level, it may decrease the degree of solidarity in the society as a result of group loyalty. We show that total welfare maximization is closely linked to the minimization of income inequality within and between regions. Analyzing separately two particular cases under direct democracy-no interregional inequality and no group loyalty-we stress the existence of a scope effect and a pooling effect of centralized redistribution, respectively. In both cases, centralization welfare-dominates decentralization, from which it follows that the rationale for decentralizing redistribution only arises when the two sources of cross-regional heterogeneity interact.","[Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Flamand, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain.",sabine.flamand@urv.cat,,"flamand, sabine/0000-0003-2124-4592",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-04756],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"I wish to thank Caterina Calsamiglia and Hannes Mueller for helpful discussions, comments and suggestions.

We investigate whether changes in political power for various parties have an effect on tax policies. We use an instrumental variable approach where close elections provide the exogenous variation in our variable of interest: voting power. In order to isolate close elections in a proportional election system, we develop a new simulation algorithm. Using data from German municipalities in the state of Bavaria, our estimation results suggest that political power does matter for policies. Somewhat surprisingly, the center-left party SPD is found to lower all three locally controlled taxes, whereas The Greens increase both property taxes considerably. These results remain robust across a range of specifications. Our partisan effect for the SPD is also confirmed by a simple regression discontinuity estimation using mayoral elections.

We demonstrate empirically that key features of legislative production prior to 1967 (when House members' support for a bill was indicated by introduction of duplicate bills) and post-1967 (when political support for a bill is indicated by co-sponsorship) are strikingly similar. Specifically, the raw number of supporters of a bill, whether indicated by duplicate bills or by co-sponsorship, is not nearly as critical to advancement of that bill through the House of Representatives as is the political power of the individual who introduces it and those who support it. The relative sizes of these effects are highly consistent over time. In effect, this finding means that the underlying factors of importance in the House's legislative production function did not change significantly when bill co-sponsorship was adopted. This suggests that the change in operating procedure may have been driven by an intra-chamber struggle to control the legislative outcomes. We present empirical evidence that is highly consistent with this hypothesis-adoption of bill co-sponsorship in 1967 coincides exactly with the post-World War II peak in a concentration ratio of legislation passed in the US House of Representatives. Prior to the 90th Congress, there was a more-or-less steady increase in concentration of legislation passed by the five busiest committees that peaked at over 0.4 in the 90th Congress and then declined precipitously to under 0.15 by the 93rd Congress.","[Laband, David N.] Georgia Inst Technol, Ivan Allen Coll Liberal Arts, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Seals, Richard A., Jr.; Wilbrandt, Eric J.] Auburn Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Laband, DN (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Ivan Allen Coll Liberal Arts, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",david.laband@econ.gatech.edu; alan.seals@auburn.edu; ejw0017@auburn.edu,,"Seals, Alan/0000-0002-2191-3154",,,,,33,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We present a model, in which countries choose whether to participate in preferential or multilateral trade agreements under political pressures from domestic special interest groups. We show that heterogeneity in political preferences across countries plays an important role in determining the relative merits of preferential and multilateral approaches to trade liberalization. On one hand, the opportunity to liberalize preferentially may be necessary to induce countries with strong political motivations to participate in multilateral free trade negotiations. On the other hand, when countries share similar political preferences, multilateral free trade that would have been politically supported otherwise becomes unattainable if countries can pursue preferential liberalization.

Despite this, export participation rates-including those of micro enterprises-remained low at 13 per cent in computer services and 8 per cent in business services in 2010. Based on uniquely linked firm-level datasets with full coverage of micro enterprises, this study investigates the determinants of the export participation of Swedish SMEs in the computer and business service industries. Exports include both goods and services. Estimates based on the conditional fixed-effects logit model show a significantly positive relationship between initial labour productivity and the decision to export. One new and interesting finding is that the magnitude of the relationship between the probability to export and initial labour productivity is low when controlling for firm effects. Surprisingly, the impact of labour productivity on exporting in computer services does not differ between micro enterprises and other SMEs (10-249 employees). In business services, the relationship between export probability and labour productivity on the one hand and skill intensity on the other is significant for micro enterprises, but not for other SMEs (10-249 employees).","[Falk, Martin] WIFO, Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria; [Hagsten, Eva] Stat Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden",Statistics Sweden,"Falk, M (通讯作者)，WIFO, Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria.",Martin.Falk@wifo.ac.at,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019; Hagsten, Eva/AAL-7086-2020; Hagsten, Eva/AAH-7574-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513; Hagsten, Eva/0000-0001-7091-1449",,,,,41,4,4,1,17,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 15,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201532.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-32,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CU4XZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363536100001,0

The focus is on the option available to EPF members to invest part of their savings in approved unit trusts. A survey of EPF members allows a contrast with existing empirical evidence, largely drawn from developed countries. Three significant factors are identified: perceived importance of financial advisor; financial risk tolerance and perceived plan design. Gender and marital status were also significant predictors of investing in the unit trusts, though religion and religious commitment were not significant. Several implications emerge from these findings. First, results highlight the important role of unit trust consultants in individuals' choices which in turn highlights the important role of the governing body of consultants in ensuring appropriate advice is delivered to clients. The study is relevant to the EPF as policy-maker, on the behaviour and attitudes of its members.","[Jamaludin, Nurasyikin] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Maritime Business & Management, Accounting & Finance, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia; [Gerrans, Paul] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Accounting & Finance, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; University of Western Australia,"Jamaludin, N (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Maritime Business & Management, Accounting & Finance, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia.",asyikin@umt.edu.my,"Jamaludin, Nurasyikin/AAF-7762-2019","Gerrans, Paul/0000-0002-5690-7141; JAMALUDIN, NURASYIKIN/0000-0003-2158-2268",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE); Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; Edith Cowan Universit,"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE)(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; Edith Cowan Universit","This research is sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE), Universiti Malaysia Terengganu and Edith Cowan University.",,58,6,7,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The analysis is conducted for a two-symmetric-country world under three levels of international integration: that of a closed economy, a financial autarky, and full financial integration. Different degrees of trade openness are considered in the form of home biases, while the economy is left vulnerable to total factor productivity and innovation shocks. Full financial integration is found to reduce firm-size volatility and volatility in the mass of operative firms following a productivity shock and to increase them after an innovation shock. Moreover, the interaction between international sharing of profits and terms of trade transmissions determines the non-linear behaviour of consumption-to-output ratio volatility found in empirical studies.","[Arespa, Marta] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Arespa, Marta] CREB, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Arespa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",marta.arespa@ub.edu,"Arespa, Marta/HPC-6801-2023","Arespa Castello, Marta/0000-0002-8207-6855",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2012-34046],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"The financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through grant ECO2012-34046 is gratefully acknowledged.

To thoughtfully explore the optimal spending, two distinct scenarios where the government spending is financed by labor/capital income taxes are considered. Our analysis shows that the optimal growth-maximizing government spending is inconsistent with the welfare-maximizing government spending. Moreover, the growth-maximizing/welfare-maximizing government spending have quite different responses to distinctive market imperfections (markups in the goods and labor markets), particularly in the scenarios with distinctive financing modes. Our numerical study indicates that the growth-maximizing and welfare-maximizing government expenditures, in general, are more responsive to the change in the labor market friction than that in the product market friction and the growth-maximizing government spending is more likely to be lower than the welfare-maximizing government spending.","[Chang, Shu-hua] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Taxat, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Chang, Juin-jen] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chang, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Taxat, 129 San Min Rd,Sect 3, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",shchang@nutc.edu.tw; jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,,,,,48,3,3,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We find dishonest behavior across all communication channels, with important treatment differences. Reporting of extreme outcomes that maximize payoff increases in distance and anonymity. To the contrary, partial lying decreases in distance and anonymity. Furthermore, we find gender to moderate the effects and women tend to drive these results.

As a result, the instrument provides stronger identification of the impact of trade on income and increases the efficiency of the two-stage least square estimation. An important advantage of the corrected procedure over the benchmark is that the estimated effect of trade on income remains large, positive, and statistically significant even after controlling for regional indicators and endogenous institutional quality.","[Gervais, Antoine] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Gervais, A (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",agervais@nd.edu,,"Gervais, Antoine/0000-0002-4363-0155",Kellogg Institute for International Studies,Kellogg Institute for International Studies,"I am grateful to the Kellogg Institute for International Studies for research support and Tihtina ZenebeGebre for research assistance.

Subjects who participated in a paid study were given the option to donate from their payment to a local orphanage, under treatments that varied the publicity of the donation and the salience of Islamic values using either Arabic or French instructions. In the salient Islamic treatment, anonymity of donations significantly increased donation incidence from 59% to 77% percent as well as average donations for religious subjects from 8.90 to 13.00 Dh out of possibly 30 Dh.

Since newspaper coverage is endogenous, we use the match between newspaper markets and judicial districts to identify effects.

Relatedly, within a conference fans are more likely to target rivalrous feelings toward the winningest teams and, in Bowl Championship Series conferences, teams who have been conference members for a longer proportion of time. While the stakes are different from other settings, such as warring nations, college football teams compete for resources and often have loyal followings with strong emotional ties. Thus, examining rivalrous feeling in this setting provides insights into rivalry more generally besides being of interest in its own right as college football is a multi-billion dollar industry.

Traditionally, a typical IDA study uses a single dimensional energy dataset, such as industrial energy consumption by industrial sector or transportation energy consumption by transport mode. More recently, there have been a growing number of studies using more sophisticated datasets, e.g. energy consumption by geographical region and by economic sector in a single dataset. For IDA studies using energy data with multiple attributes, intermediate decomposition results can be generated using subsets of the entire dataset, and these results provide further insight into the energy system and problem studied. To ensure that these intermediate results are consistent and meaningful, the IDA method used should ideally satisfy two properties: perfect in decomposition at the subcategory level and consistency in aggregation. It is shown that the logarithmic mean Divisia index method I (LMDI-I) satisfies these two properties in both additive and multiplicative decomposition analysis. It is therefore the recommended IDA method when dealing with energy data with multiple attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ang, B.

This article reviews the performance of IT in transition economies by focusing on its day-to-day policy conduct from the perspective of behavioral economics. The experience of the Czech National Bank (CNB) is used as a representative example of how IT is implemented in a transition economy. Our review of IT as practiced in the Czech Republic suggests that the CNB's theoretical assumptions may not be fully consistent with the economic behavior of economic agents as described by behavioral economics and therefore lead to biased forecasts. In addition, we find that CNB forecasts are not always turned into policy on the basis of a well-behaved monetary policy reaction function. We discuss the policy implications of our findings.","[Brada, Josef C.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kubicek, Jan; Tomsik, Vladimir] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kutan, Ali M.] Jiangxi Univ Econ & Finance, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Kutan, Ali M.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Econ, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Czech National Bank; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Brada, JC (通讯作者)，333 N Pennington Dr 57, Chandler, AZ 85224 USA.",josef.brada@asu.edu,,,Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR P402/10/0289],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This article was supported by Grant No. GACR P402/10/0289, Instability of the Financial Markets and Effectiveness of Their Regulation, financed by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (http://gacr.cz).

These findings cannot be reconciled easily with existing business cycle models. We extend the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model of search in the labor market by considering strategic interactions among an endogenous number of producers, which leads to countercyclical price markups. Although Nash bargaining delivers a countercyclical labor share, we show that countercyclical markups are fundamental to address the overshooting.

For identification, I use population-weighted, average temperature as an instrument for growth in agriculture, exploring exogenous variation in land yields. I find large short-run effects: a one-percentage point increase in growth in agriculture is estimated to raise growth in manufacturing by 0.47-0.56 percentage point (baseline), and 0.28-0.47 percentage point (conservative). Extensions of the empirical model suggest that growth in agriculture benefits the manufacturing sector by improving its domestic terms of trade, by increasing the share of investment and saving in GDP, and by increasing the capacity to import industrial inputs. Together, these findings lend support to the notion that agriculture plays key macroeconomic roles in the industrialization of developing countries by relieving saving, aggregate demand, fiscal, and foreign exchange constraints on the industrial sector.

Based on the method of Granger causality in risk, Value at Risk (VaR) is employed to measure market risk, and a class of kernel-based tests is used to detect negative and positive risk spillover effects. Empirical results reveal that there are significant risk spillovers between the two markets. Extreme movements, past or current, in one market may have a significant predictive power for those in the other market. Prior to the recent financial crisis, there are positive risk spillovers from stock market to crude oil market, and negative spillovers from crude oil market to stock market. After the financial crisis, bidirectional positive risk spillovers are strengthened markedly. The risk spillovers may occur instantaneously, and/or with a (long) time delay. Both positive and negative risk spillover effects exhibit asymmetric correlations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I present two analytical tools designed for this purpose. The first is a two-dimensional, diagrammatical exposition of the general equilibrium solutions of a large-scale model, reduced into a two-equation system. The second is a miniature representation of the large-scale model, which can sort out the main general equilibrium-responses of the CGE model. By reducing the miniature model into the same two equations, the two devices can be combined to shed light into the black box of the model. I demonstrate how the devices can be utilised to provide economic intuition on welfare and unemployment effects of changes in taxation, exemplified by CO2 taxes, VAT and payroll tax.

Access to credit, insurance and savings may stimulate technology adoption where new methods are riskier but higher-yielding or require sunk costs. In this paper, we employ a dynamic, stochastic, heterogeneous agent model where farm households have access to contingent credit and make savings, technology and loan repayment choices. Our approach is novel as insurance is modeled as a meso-level product, where the bank is indemnified before any payouts are distributed to borrowers; thus, it accounts for both supply- and demand-side concerns, showing a flow of effects when index insurance contracts are sold to risk aggregators for whom basis risk is lower. Results show letting the lender lay first claim on indemnities lowers default, which can decrease interest rates and expand credit access. Insurance and savings may also spur technology uptake.

We apply the method to a case study of CO2, SO2 and NOx produced by coal power plants operating between 1990 and 2010 in the United States. We find that DSP shows 1.1 times the maximal shadow prices estimated in the current literature.

The paper focuses on determining the energy system transformations that drive the changes in carbon emissions and identifying the model characteristics that lead to differences in the decarbonization strategies. First, we compare the decomposition over time of near-past carbon emissions and near-future model projections as a methodology to validate baseline scenarios. We show that a no-policy baseline scenario is in line with historical trends for all regions except China, where all models project higher improvements in energy and carbon intensity than the near-past historical development. Second, we compare regional decarbonization drivers across models in a scenario with moderate policy targets that represent the current fragmented international climate policy landscape. The results from the different models show that energy efficiency improvements represent the main strategy in achieving the moderate climate targets. Finally, we develop an LMDI decomposition analysis to determine the additional energy system changes needed to achieve a global GHG concentration target of 450 ppm compared to the moderate policy case. In all models, reducing regional carbon intensity of energy is the major decarbonization strategy after 2030. In the long-term (after 2050), most of the models find that negative carbon emissions are critical in such scenario, emphasizing the key role of biomass with CCS. However, the level of contribution of the decarbonization factor varies significantly across models, due to the large uncertainty in the availability of renewables and the development of CCS technologies. Overall, we find that the main differences in the decomposition results across models are due to assumptions concerning availability of natural resources and variety of backstop technologies.

Their identification method relies on choice reversals so the obtained revealed preference is often incomplete. We propose three approaches to address this problem. The first one is accommodating a model-free approach, which respects the DM's choice in making a welfare analysis, as long as it does not contradict the revealed preference of Masatlioglu etal. The second approach incorporates the DM's exogenously obtained attention/inattention information into the model of Masatlioglu etal. The third approach is to take framings that influence the DM's attention into effect for the identification.","[Masatlioglu, Yusufcan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nakajima, Daisuke] Otaru Univ, Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Otaru University of Commerce,"Masatlioglu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Masatlioglu, Yusufcan/AAB-2440-2020","Masatlioglu, Yusufcan/0000-0002-9423-3272",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [26780113]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780113] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We would like to thank Takashi Unayama for organizing our invited talk at JEA's spring meeting 2014.

The paper also argues that the deflationary effects of the conventional policy reaction to the euro-area crisis will aggravate recession over the medium-to-long run in that area, owing to their negative impact on demand in the product markets across the whole European Union, whose competitiveness will suffer under the very measures that are supposed to enhance it in the global economy.","[Mastromatteo, Giuseppe] Catholic Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Rossi, Sergio] Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Fribourg,"Mastromatteo, G (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Milan, Milan, Italy.",,"Rossi, Sergio/AAO-6365-2020",,,,,,55,15,15,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

More recently, proponents have begun to advocate extension of this work to organization studies. However, critics of entrepreneurial judgment have responded by claiming that the construct is only meaningful post hoc and vapid when examined ex ante. Instead, they claim that, if entrepreneurship theory is to progress, then judgment must be replaced by a process logic known as effectuation. This article examines their claims and redefines the judgment dilemma as one of scope rather than existence. Empathic accuracy is then introduced to offer a means of addressing their criticism without having to deny the existence of entrepreneurial judgment. Empathic accuracy is also shown to be capable of explaining some of the cognitive mechanisms necessary for effectuation and dynamic socio-economic order.","Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Mcmullen, JS (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, 1309 East Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mcmullej@indiana.edu,"McMullen, Jeffery S/GOK-0117-2022","McMullen, Jeffery S/0000-0001-6260-2507",,,,,116,93,102,4,48,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The GTAP model avoids this issue by converting values for each country into US dollars. This approach simplifies the model greatly; however, it ignores the important role of exchange rates in international trade and in world economic development. By adopting a multicurrency framework and adding bilateral exchange rates for any two regions, this paper provides a revised version of GTAP model, which can model the impact of exchange rate policy with ease. The impact of an appreciation of the Chinese Yuan is simulated in the paper to illustrate the way to model exchange rates. The simulation results are consistent with macroeconomic and trade theories and are well-explained by the economic structure of China and its trading partners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, much less attention has been given to the effects of the cycles, in particular, whether the cycles lead to higher or lower prices and margins. The leading theory for the underlying cause of the price cycles, Edgeworth price cycles, is silent on the issue. The challenge in addressing this most important question has been the difficulty in isolating cycle effects from other confounding factors, especially market structure. In this article, I exploit a unique natural experiment to isolate the effect of cycles a refinery fire that, in a matter of days, halted cycles that had previously persisted for decades.

The model is formulated as an optimal stopping problem, in which the number of successes required to complete the R&D project is finite and learning about the probability of success is incorporated. We show that the optimal R&D subsidy with the consideration of learning is higher than that without it. We also find that an R&D subsidy performs better than a Pigouvian tax unless suppliers have sufficient incentives to continue cost-reduction efforts after the new technology successfully replaces the old one.

We discriminate between heterogeneous wage effects on different skill categories of workers (low, medium and high skill). The main focus is on the labour market outcomes of vertical integration, so we augment a model of conditional wage convergence through the inclusion of sector-specific broad and narrow outsourcing/offshoring indices based on input-output data (World Input Output Database, April 2012 release). Two-way relations between trade and wages are addressed through the use of a gravity-based sector-level instrument. We find no evidence supporting unconditional skill-specific wage convergence in EU sectors. In a conditional setting, (slow) wage convergence takes place, but international outsourcing plays a negligible role in wage equalization. Moreover, even though regression results indicate that offshoring reduces the wage growth of domestic medium- and low-skilled workers, we show that this negative effect is economically small.","[Parteka, Aleksandra; Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Parteka, A (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",aparteka@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/O-4433-2018; Parteka, Aleksandra/AAN-5881-2020","Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/0000-0002-3392-5267; Parteka, Aleksandra/0000-0003-1149-6614","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/02134]; NCN","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland; NCN","The research has been conducted within the project financed by the National Science Centre (NCN), Poland (decision number DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/02134).

By making use of a recursive utility function, we estimate an Euler equation, via GMM. This procedure leads consumption growth rate to depend on asset returns, and on a time-varying variance, which captures the precautionary motive. When significant, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution estimates ranges from 0.4 to 1.8, which are higher than most of the results found in the literature. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that consumers react to risk; however, the contribution of precautionary motive to consumption growth seems to be limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using panel data from the RAND Health and Retirement Study, I show that rejected applicants for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) possess significantly more assets than accepted applicants immediately prior to application and exhibit lower attachment to the labor force. These empirical results are consistent with the theoretical prediction in Diamond and Mirrlees (1978) and Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006) that certain individuals with high unwillingness to work maximize utility by planning in advance for their future disability insurance application. Because the existing empirical literature on disability insurance does not account for this intertemporal channel, it may underestimate the total work-disincentive effect of SSDI.

It is customary for religious Jews to touch the mezuzah every time they pass through a door and kiss the fingers that touched it. However, kissing the mezuzah has also become customary for many secular Jews who think of the mezuzah as a good luck charm. In view of a recent revelation that kissing the mezuzah entails a health hazard, the present paper inquires whether it also has some observable benefit. In an experiment conducted among non-religious mezuzah-kissing economics and business students confronted with a logic-problem exam, some were allowed to kiss the mezuzah before taking the exam, whereas the others were asked not to do so or could not do so because it had been removed from the room doorframe. The experiment revealed that participants who did not kiss the mezuzah performed worse than those who kissed it, and that the stronger is one's belief in the mezuzah's luck-enhancing properties, the better he performs when he kisses it but the worse he performs when he does not.

Who occupies this profession, which is not very institutionalized and is ambivalent for public opinion? And what are their expectations? Are these middlemen between the private and public sectors involved in politics? A typology of lobbyists and an analysis of them as a professional group helps provide answers. This typology's major criterion of differentiation, which most lobbyists have in common, is a stint in the public sector. But it apparently has a paradoxical function. While fostering a practical and symbolic dependence on the public sphere, it provides lobbyists with control over the resources necessary for developing an autonomous status.","[Vargovcikova, Jana] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Sci Polit, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vargovcikova, Jana] ISP, Inst Sci Sociales Polit, Paris, France; [Vargovcikova, Jana] CNRS MAEDI, CEFRES, Paris, France",Charles University Prague; Universite Paris Saclay,"Vargovcíková, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Sci Polit, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.varg@gmail.com,,"Vargovcikova, Jana/0000-0001-9552-9174",,,,,67,2,2,0,10,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This paper assesses the empirical relevance of this premise using a novel data set. The authors find that Knightian uncertainty, which cannot be reduced to a probability distribution, underpins outcomes in the stock market. This finding reveals the full implications of Robert Shiller's ground-breaking rejection of the class of REH present-value models that rely on the consumption-based specification of the risk premium. The relevance of Knightian uncertainty is inconsistent with all REH models, regardless of how they specify the market's risk premium. The authors' evidence is also inconsistent with bubble accounts of REH models' empirical difficulties. They consider a present-value model based on a New Rational Expectations Hypothesis, which recognizes the relevance of Knightian uncertainty in driving outcomes in real-world markets. Their novel data is supportive of the model's implications that rational forecasting relies on both fundamental and psychological factors.","[Frydman, Roman] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Frydman, Roman] INET Program Imperfect Knowledge Econ, New York, NY USA; [Goldberg, Michael D.] Univ New Hampshire, Peter T Paul Coll Business & Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Goldberg, Michael D.; Mangee, Nicholas] INET Program IKE, New York, NY USA; [Mangee, Nicholas] Armstrong State Univ, Dept Econ, Savannah, GA 31419 USA",New York University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System of Georgia; Armstrong Atlantic State University,"Frydman, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",rf3@nyu.edu,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),The authors are indebted to the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) for supporting this research.

We conducted identical modified dictator games during both the recession and the preceding economic boom. The experiments capture subjects' selfishness (the weight on one's own payoff) and equality-efficiency tradeoffs (concerns for reducing differences in payoffs versus increasing total payoffs), which we then compare across economic conditions. Subjects exposed to recession exhibit greater selfishness and higher emphasis on efficiency relative to equality. Reproducing recessionary conditions inside the laboratory by confronting subjects with possible negative payoffs [weakly] intensifies selfishness and increases efficiency orientation, bolstering the interpretation that differing economic circumstances drive our results.

Using both parametric and semiparametric methods and controlling for region-to-region pairwise fixed effects, we find a non-monotonic relationship between income and migration. In richer regions, higher incomes result in lower migration outflows. However, in the poorest regions, an increase in incomes results in higher emigration. This is consistent with the presence of geographical poverty traps: potential migrants want to leave the poor regions but cannot afford to move. We also show that economic growth and financial development have allowed most Russian regions to grow out of poverty traps bringing down interregional differentials of wages, incomes and unemployment rates.

We develop a model economy where migrants make decisions in the face of uncertain border enforcement and transfers from the host country. The uncertainty is extrinsic, a sunspot, and arises due to ambiguity regarding government policy; the sunspot manifests itself as uncertainty in the commodity price of money. Immigration volatility stems from both the trade-off between the marginal benefits and costs (transfers and enforcement) to migrating and the existence of a sunspot. Finally, we examine the impact of changes in government policies on migration levels.","[Guzman, Mark G.] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England; [Haslag, Joseph H.] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX USA",University of Reading; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Guzman, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",m.g.guzman@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We focus on provincial leadersa pool of candidates for top political officeand examine how their chances of promotion depend on their performance in office and connections with top politicians. Our empirical analysis, based on the curriculum vitae of Chinese politicians, shows that connections and performance are complements in the Chinese political selection process. This complementarity is stronger the younger provincial leaders are relative to their connected top leaders. To provide one plausible interpretation of these empirical findings, we propose a simple theory in which the complementarity arises because connections foster loyalty of junior officials to senior ones, thereby allowing incumbent top politicians to select competent provincial leaders without risking being ousted. Our findings shed some light on why a political system known for patronage can still select competent leaders.","[Jia, Ruixue] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Kudamatsu, Masayuki] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Seim, David] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Seim, David] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Stockholm University; University of Toronto; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Jia, RX (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",rxjia@ucsd.edu; masayuki.kudamatsu@iies.su.se; david.seim@utoronto.ca,,"Jia, Ruixue/0000-0002-4381-4640",ERC [249580]; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [249580] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The previous version of this paperwas circulated under the title Complementary Roles of Connections and Performance in Political Selection in China.

Both processes are modeled as spectrally negative Levy jump-diffusions. The optimal stopping problem that determines the value of the project is solved under fairly general assumptions. It is found that the current value of the benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) decreases in the frequency of negative shocks to the construction process. This implies that the cost overruns that can be expected if one ignores such shocks are increasing in their frequency. Based on calibrated data, the model is applied to the proposed construction of high-speed rail in the UK and it is found that its economic case cannot currently be made and is unlikely to be met at any time in the next decade. In addition it is found that ignoring construction uncertainty leads to a substantial probability of an erroneous decision being taken. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find support for the conclusions of the above-mentioned studies: countries that trade more and have a higher stock of foreign direct investment have less child labor.

The study is developed on the basis of a bilateral trade database on 104 countries between 1998 and 2007. The empirical section estimates a two-stage gravity equation using panel data and shows a positive impact of financial development on the marginal variation of the extensive margin.

Three different groups of treatment are constructed: (1) firms that are involved only with import activities, (2) firms that are involved only with export activities and (3) firms that are involved with both export and import activities. The results of the study suggest that both exporting and importing have positive significant effects on total factor productivity (TFP) and labour productivity (LP) of firms. Importing is found to have a greater impact on productivity of firms compared to exporting. Further, two-way trade is found to have more significant effects than those of one-way trade on firm productivity.

We find that the size of an offshore banking sector and economic growth have a nonlinear relationship, and the growth effect tends to increase as the scale of offshore banking increases.","Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Yonsei Ro 50, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",dhkim2@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,36,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The author estimates a dynamic structural model of investment on a sample of 4672 Belgian firms for the period 2003-2010, permitting him to distinguish the 'ownership status' of firms. He considers a dynamic discrete choice model of a general specification of adjustment costs including convex and non-convex components. The author uses the method of simulated moments in order to estimate the structural parameters. His results indicate that multinationals' affiliates face lower capital adjustment costs than national firms.","Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Lapatinas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",alapatin@cc.uoi.gr,,"Lapatinas, Athanasios/0000-0002-1728-6522",,,,,44,0,0,0,10,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 2,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201516.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-16,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CM3JS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357578800001,0

Risk-free arbitrage opportunities arise frequently during matches (as information arrives and asynchronously shifts prices), but seldom arise before matches (when there is little information to move prices). I find that on the few occasions that arbitrage opportunities do arise before matches, they last substantially longer than average. This suggests, in line with the paradox, that traders neglect to acquire information (carry out research or watch markets) if they believe that markets are already efficient. This neglect, in turn, makes markets inefficient.","Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Brown, A (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,,,Research and Specialist Computing Support service at the University of East Anglia,Research and Specialist Computing Support service at the University of East Anglia,Part of the research presented in this paper was carried out on the High Performance Computing Cluster supported by the Research and Specialist Computing Support service at the University of East Anglia.,,22,3,3,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2015,82.0,327,,,,,420,447,,10.1111/ecca.12118,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CK6YD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356374000002,0

We build on this growing literature by investigating the impact of two applications of behavioral principles to mitigate summer melt, the phenomenon that college-intending high school graduates fail to matriculate in college anywhere in the year following high school. One intervention utilized an automated and personalized text messaging campaign to remind college-intending students of required pre-matriculation tasks and to connect them to counselor-based support. Another employed near-aged peer mentors to provide summer outreach and support. The interventions substantially increased college enrollment among students who had less academic-year access to quality college counseling or information. Both strategies are cost-effective approaches to increase college entry among populations traditionally underrepresented in higher education and, more broadly, highlight the potential for low-cost behavioral nudges and interventions to achieve meaningful improvements in students' educational outcomes.

These frictions are substantial; e.g. the firing delay can be almost a year. In the model hiring and firing costs depend on the firm size and the number of people hired or fired. Based on our simulations, hiring and firing elasticities without relocation are highest with respect to demand and productivity volatility and the hiring and firing variable costs. The elasticity of firing due to relocation is highest with respect to the firm-sized firing cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Since this group of economies faces both structural and systemic transformation problems, the original supply-side approach might not be sufficient to detect the most binding constraint. The results of the analysis indicate that the binding constraint on credit and investment growth in the region is the high and increasing share of nonperforming loans, primarily in the household sector, due to policy failures. This article compares the Balkan countries to a group of advanced transition economies. Single-country and panel regressions indicate that demand-side factors do not play a constraining role on growth in the West Balkan countries, but they do in the advanced transition economies.",,,"Gabrisch, H (通讯作者)，Friedrich Kruse Str 8, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",gab@antec-kabel.de,,"Gabrisch, Hubert/0000-0001-8825-4600",German Federal Ministry of Finance [fe 2/13],German Federal Ministry of Finance,The author would like to thank Michael Landesmann and Mario Holzner for their useful comments.

The vast majority assume that agents form habits strictly over consumption of an aggregate good, leaving open the question of whether it might be preferable to have them form habits over differentiated products instead-an arrangement known as deep habits. I answer this question by estimating a model that nests both habit concepts as special cases. Estimates reveal that the data favor a specification in which consumption habits are stronger at the product level than at the aggregate level. A mix of significance tests and simulation results indicate that including deep habits greatly improves model fit, most notably with regard to inflation dynamics.","[Givens, Gregory E.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Givens, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Box 870224,200 Alston Hall, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",gegivens@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.
