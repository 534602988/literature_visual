Although most financial decisions are made by adults, there is a burgeoning interest in providing financial education to children in the hope that they will develop the skills needed to successfully manage their finances in adulthood. This study uses an experimental design to evaluate a set of standardized financial education lessons delivered to fourth and fifth graders in two different school districts. We find that even a relatively brief program results in knowledge gains that persist one year later. While measuring financial behaviors in this age group is challenging, students exposed to financial education have more positive attitudes about personal finance and appear more likely to save. These results show that younger students can learn financial topics and that learning is associated with improved attitudes and behaviors which, if sustained, may result in increased financial capability later in life.","[Batty, Michael] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Collins, J.

In this communication a methodology based on the techniques of bootstrapping, to the robust statistical estimate of freight transport matrices is presented; this allows to generate the confidence intervals of travel between origin-destination pairs defined by each cell of the origin-destination matrix derived from a freight transport survey. This result is of interest in defining the dimensions of certainty for matrix cells and subsequent adjustment by techniques based on aggregate data (i.e. traffic counts, cordon line matrices, paths, etc.). The techniques of bootstrapping originated in the 70's, although widely used during the 90's, have not been fully exploited in the field of freight transport studies. To address this study a data set from a statistically reliable freight transport study conducted in Spain at the level of multi-province regions has been used.","[Benitez, Francisco G.] Univ Seville, Fac Engn, Transportat Engn, Seville 41092, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Benitez, FG (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Engn, Transportat Engn, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",benitez@us.es,"Caceres, Noelia/I-9344-2016","Caceres, Noelia/0000-0002-7160-1335; Romero, L.M./0000-0001-8963-9879",FEDER of European Union via project of the FEDER Operational Programme for Andalusia [G-GI3000IDII]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Science [TRA2012-36930],FEDER of European Union via project of the FEDER Operational Programme for Andalusia; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Science(Spanish Government),"The authors would like to thank the FEDER of European Union for financial support via project G-GI3000IDII of the FEDER Operational Programme for Andalusia 2007-2013, and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Science for the partial subsidy granted under the national R&D program, Project No. TRA2012-36930.",,17,0,0,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

I use detailed register data for offenders who predominantly serve incarceration spells of 1-2 months. I analyze the sample for several years prior to and after incarceration and show that the reform led to an exogenous increase in incarceration lengths. I find that the longer incarceration spells result in lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, possibly because marginal increases in short incarceration spells improve conditions and incentives for rehabilitation, while the costs of jail related to these outcomes are unaffected. I show that the estimates are robust to different econometric specifications and further provide evidence that my results are not driven by changes in macroeconomic conditions.","[Landerso, Rasmus] Rockwool Fdn, Res Unit, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Landerso, R (通讯作者)，Rockwool Fdn, Res Unit, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,,,,,47,23,28,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We investigate the implications of these decisions in the context of shareholder say-on-pay voting required in 2011 under the Dodd-Frank Act. We find three primary results: proxy advisory firm recommendations have a substantive impact on say-on-pay voting outcomes, a substantial number of firms change their compensation programs in the time period before formal shareholder votes in a manner consistent with the features known to be favored by proxy advisory firms in an effort to avoid negative voting recommendations, and the stock market reaction to these compensation program changes is statistically negative. These results suggest that outsourcing voting to proxy advisory firms appears to have the unintended economic consequence that boards of directors are induced to make choices that decrease shareholder value.","[Larcker, David F.; McCall, Allan L.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ormazabal, Gaizka] Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain",Stanford University; University of Navarra,"Larcker, DF (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,Ramon y Cajal Fellowship; Marie Curie Fellowship; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; Rock Center for Corporate Governance; Graduate School of Business Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford University,Ramon y Cajal Fellowship(Spanish Government); Marie Curie Fellowship(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Rock Center for Corporate Governance; Graduate School of Business Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford University,"We thank Yonca Ertimur, Fabrizio Ferri, Joseph Grundfest, Katherine Rabin, and seminar participants of the 2012 London Business School Accounting Symposium and the say-on-pay (SOP) symposium at Goethe University, as well as the accounting workshops at Harvard University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for helpful comments.

In this paper, the authors provide some empirical evidence related to the impact of two factors: R&D spending and export on the process of income convergence of European Union economies. R&D spending is strongly related to the technological innovations as well as technological spillovers and diffusion, while the relative level of export and consequent share in the international trade seems to be one of the most important engines of modern economic growth. Beginning with the absolute convergence model, the authors conducted research by concerning the conditional model with control explanatory variables as well as the model with spatial autocorrelation. The main goal of the paper is the assessment if there exists convergence process and if there occur spatial relations with a statistically significant influence on income convergence speed within the European Union. The received results confirmed the hypothesis that the speed of convergence in the conditional models especially with spatial autocorrelation is faster than in the case of absolute convergence.","[Batog, Barbara; Batog, Jacek] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econometr & Stat, Str Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Batog, B (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econometr & Stat, Str Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",barbara.batog@wneiz.pl; batog@wneiz.pl,,"Batog, Jacek/0000-0003-1413-7692",,,,,38,7,7,0,11,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

ADKAR model provides a goal oriented framework that helps change leaders achieve their objectives more quickly and completely to the new trends from the global market.","[Boca, Gratiela Dana] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, North Ctr Univ Baia Mare, Baia Mare 430122, Romania; [Erdogdu, Hamza] Afyon Kokatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Afyon, Turkey; [Mukaj, Lindita] DAR, Reg Dept Educ, Durres, Albania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Boca, GD (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, North Ctr Univ Baia Mare, 76 Victoriei St, Baia Mare 430122, Romania.",bocagratiela@yahoo.com; hamzerdogdu@aku.edu.tr; lindita_muka@live.com,"Erdoğdu, Hamza/AAC-9147-2020; BOCA, Gratiela Dana/HZL-1079-2023","BOCA, Gratiela Dana/0000-0003-3684-2384",,,,,18,0,0,2,15,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1871.0,1883,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700188,0

We assume that the quality of decisions made by the firm's management can be assessed by the firm's technical and cost efficiency levels. We argue that the decisions of management are an important determinant of firm market exit and hypothesise that the characteristics of the macroeconomic environment influence the impact of technical and cost efficiency on firm market exit. This is why we study whether the importance of decisions that are relevant for attaining technical efficiency and decisions that contribute to cost efficiency for firm market exit depend on the macroeconomic environment of the analysed firms. Such an analysis reveals which types of managerial decisions are relevant for firm market exit in differing macroeconomic environments. We use a logistic regression for rare events to estimate non-nested microeconomic models of firm market exit in Slovenia for two periods characterised by differing macroeconomic conditions. The results confirm that firms in which decisions of management result in inferior efficiency are more likely to exit the market. Even though a firm's management plays many relevant roles within the firm, our research demonstrates that those management decisions that refer to input selection and their substitution are those which are most crucial for preventing a firm from failing and ensuring its survival. We also find that in differing macroeconomic environments different types of management decisions explain firm market exit. The results show that technical efficiency has a more significant influence on a firm's market exit compared to cost efficiency in a favourable macroeconomic environment, while cost efficiency has a more significant influence on a firm's market exit than technical efficiency in unfavourable macroeconomic conditions.","[Bonca, Petra Dosenovic; Ponikvar, Nina; Tajnikar, Maks] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Pusnik, Ksenja] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Maribor,"Bonca, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",petra.d.bonca@ef.uni-lj.si; nina.ponivar@ef.uni-lj.si; maks.tajnikar@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Ponikvar, Nina/0000-0003-3976-211X",,,,,63,0,0,0,8,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The article focuses on application of the competency-based approach in organisation in the Czech Republic. The first part of the article concentrates on the theoretical background. The second part evaluates the results of the quantitative survey. The aim of the article is to evaluate the competency-based approach in organisations in the Czech Republic and also to identify areas and activities in which the competency-based approach is applied and test dependencies between selected qualitative characteristics that relate to the issues examined. The results of the survey show that if organisations employ the competency-based approach (35.8%), they do not use individual activities within their frame on an equal basis. This is also valid for individual categories of employees (organisations concentrate in particular on managers and specialists). The results further confirm that the application of the competency-based approach in organisations in the Czech Republic depends on the fact whether an organisation is part of a larger group of organisations (p-value = 0.003, Phi coefficient = 0.238); personnel management arrangements in an organisation (the existence of a personnel department (p-value = 0.001, Phi coefficient = 0.316), processed personnel strategy (p-value = 0.006, Phi coefficient = 0.310), work position analysis execution (p-value = 0.000, Phi coefficient = 0.444), the position of the person responsible for human resource management in top management (p-value = 0.036, Phi coefficient = 0.201)) and the application of knowledge management (p-value = 0.015, Phi coefficient = 0.278).

Evaluation of employees is significant for the results of organisation, for,evaluation of knowledge available and for learning from the experience, undoubtedly, the motivation of learning is related to incentive of employees' evaluation too.

In the context of visual design, a pedagogical agent simulating human tutor can either be realistic (3D-rendered and naturalistic) or unrealistic (2D-rendered and stylized/cartoon). Though design factors such as agent stereotypes, aesthetics, roles and gender has been studied extensively, the issue of pedagogical agent's realism has not receive sufficient attention from the research community. This is unfortunate, as decision regarding agent's visual realism must be faced by instructional designers when implementing pedagogical agent in virtual learning environment. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the relationship among agent's visual realism, learners' cognition and learner's socio-emotive behaviours in a virtual learning environment. One hundred forty-four university sophomores at an Asian university interacted with either a realistic agent (3D-rendered and naturalistic) or an unrealistic agent (2D-rendered and stylized/cartoon) in a virtual learning system that delivers a lesson on basic computer programming. Results showed that the unrealistic (cartoonish) agent imposed extraneous cognitive load and hindered learning transfer, particularly for male learners. Mediation analysis demonstrated that the effects of agent's design (realistic versus cartoonish) on learning transfer among males were fully mediated by learner's extraneous load. The hypothesis that a cartoonish agent will elicit higher socio-emotive responses from learners was not supported. On the contrary, the realistic agent induced a higher level of positive affect in learners than the unrealistic agent Theoretical and design considerations regarding agents' visual realism are discussed in this paper.","[Liew, Tze Wei; Tan, Su-Mae] Multimedia Univ, Melaka, Malaysia; [Zin, Nor Azan Mat; Sahari, Noraidah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia",Multimedia University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Liew, TW (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Melaka, Malaysia.",twliew@mmu.edu.my; azan@ukm.edu.my; nsa@ukm.edu.my; smtan@mmu.edu.my,"Zin, Nor Azan Mat/AAE-3363-2019; Sahari, Noraidah/C-8063-2017","MatZin, Nor Azan/0000-0002-7274-7248; Liew, Tze Wei/0000-0003-0153-8649",,,,,27,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1098.0,1105,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700106,0

Depending on the proponents of the SSDM, formalised methods are espoused. However, due to contextual issues, almost all formalised methods need to be tailored to fit to a particular organizational culture for successful development of system products. This state also applies to the newly introduced Development and Operations (DevOps) approach that is currently being adopted by system development organizations and teams in South Africa. There are prescribed ways of introducing the DevOps approach to software development teams but its successful adoption depends on the organizational environment, culture and situatedness of the problem to be addressed. This paper highlights the context upon which DevOps can be considered as a system development approach, the challenges that can be encountered during its adoption and use, and lastly, a DevOps adoption conceptual framework will be presented.

Business Process Management includes techniques allowing continuous business process improvement. Process mining is a mature technology allowing to extract knowledge from event logs commonly available in today's information systems. Business process model extension is a process mining technique covering different perspectives of the business process. Furthermore, financial cost incurred during business process execution is prominent information needed by decision makers to take the appropriate decisions for business process improvement in terms of cost reduction. We proposed a solution allowing Petri Net model extension with cost perspective based on process mining extension technique. With respect to the recommendations drawn from interviews with experts, we improved the proposed solution in order to enhance the provided decision making support. These improvements concern three main levels: cost data structure, cost data description and cost data analysis. However, Petri Nets are not used by all organizations as a modeling notation of their business processes. Therefore, there is a need for the generalization of the proposed solution so that it can be used in the context of business processes modeled with other notations. In this paper, we propose a cost extension of the High-Level Process Structure which is a meta-model allowing the integration of different perspectives of a business process into one model independently of its notation.","[Thabet, Dhafer; Ghannouchi, Sonia Ayachi; Ben Ghezala, Henda Hajjami] Natl Sch Comp Sci, Mannouba, Tunisia",Universite de la Manouba,"Thabet, D (通讯作者)，Natl Sch Comp Sci, Mannouba, Tunisia.",dhafer.thabet@isetso.rnu.tn; sonia.ayachi@isgs.rnu.tn; henda.benghezala@ensi.rnu.tn,"Ben Ghezala, Henda Hajjami/AAK-7052-2021; Thabet, Dhafer/IAP-9362-2023","Ben Ghezala, Henda Hajjami/0000-0002-6874-1388; Thabet, Dhafer/0000-0001-8354-3796",,,,,23,1,1,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,44.0,58,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700005,0

In order to reflect the behavioral characteristics of household consumption realistically, characteristics including wealth accumulation, consumption inertia, preference change, time inconsistency, precautionary saving motive, life cycle and insurance expenditure will be taken into consideration. These factors lead the analysis of inter-temporal consumption optimization into a complex combinatorial optimization problem. A three-dimensional path planning ant colony algorithm is chosen to find the optimal path of inter-temporal insurance decision-making from the perspective of life-cycle. The optimal path of insurance decision-making can be found through numerical simulation. The results show that rational insurance expenditure can smooth the consumption and improve the utility across life-cycle.","[Zhao Lei] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Financial Management, Dept Insurance, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Sun Qian] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Financial Management, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of International Business & Economics; Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Zhao, L (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Financial Management, Dept Insurance, 1900 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",zhaoleiswm@163.com; sqarrow1989@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,632.0,640,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700051,0

Both primary and secondary data are used in the analysis. Rate of car ownership and commuting data were taken from national censuses in 2001 and 2011 which surrounded the 2008 crisis. Primary data came from 1,023 interviews. The relationships among indicators are identified with the help of several statistical techniques whose results are analysed. Further, analyses have confirmed the dominant importance of passenger car ownership and car use in relation to decreased unemployment. It is particularly important in economically weaker areas with a poor access, that are endangered by social exclusions. Furthermore, it is necessary to emphasise the importance of public transport as a means of preventing social exclusion.","[Marada, Miroslav; Kveton, Viktor] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Albertov 6, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Marada, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Albertov 6, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",marada@natur.cuni.cz,"Kveton, Viktor/M-4523-2017","Kveton, Viktor/0000-0002-8339-0811",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P404-12-1035]; ESPON TRACC project: Transport Accessibility at Regional/Local Scale and Patterns in Europe [2013/1/10],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); ESPON TRACC project: Transport Accessibility at Regional/Local Scale and Patterns in Europe,"Authors are much obliged for kind support to the research project Spatial Dynamics of Transport Relationship in Settlement System of the Czech Republic (sponsored by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic, No. P404-12-1035) and the ESPON TRACC project: Transport Accessibility at Regional/Local Scale and Patterns in Europe (Applied Research 2013/1/10).",,44,12,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This article provides an overview of the economic literature on capacity and the role that capacity has played in actual antitrust and competition law enforcement. The goal is to aid the analysis in matters where capacity issues potentially play a significant role. For the most part, the theoretical role of capacity in various aspects of competition analysis is ambiguous and the empirical literature is similarly inconclusive. Moreover, in many situations, measuring excess capacity may be quite difficult. Given the theoretical and empirical ambiguity regarding the role of excess capacity, or the lack thereof, the overall conclusion is that capacity issues should play a role in competition analysis only when there is strong case-specific evidence regarding their effects.","[Sacher, Seth; Sandford, Jeremy] US Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Sacher, S (通讯作者)，US Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",ssacher@ftc.gov; jsandford@ftc.gov,,,,,,,50,2,2,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In the high-tech innovation management context, it has generally been accepted that tight integration between R&D and marketing successfully influences the development of an innovative product by stimulating a mutual understanding between people from different departments. However, a few researchers also pointed out that a too close relationship between R&D personnel and marketing personnel can cause important information to be overlooked, thus reducing NPD success. Our research results, which are based on empirical data and the application of the nonparametric regression method Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, show an even more diverse effect of integrating R&D and marketing if different performance criteria are considered. Results demonstrate that the effect of integration between R&D and marketing is nonconstant and nonlinear, a finding that could not be captured with parametric assumptions.

Drawing on methods of generalized blockmodeling, we demonstrate how formerly peripheral countries in the trade of stock photography have successfully upgraded their market positions over a period of 12 years through increasing integration of their firms in the global value network.

Despite this role, auto-rickshaws and their drivers face considerable criticism from the public, the media and policy makers. There is a contentious public debate about the perceived faults of auto-rickshaws and their drivers, and the policies to address these issues in Indian cities. Our objective is to provide balance and nuance to this debate, and to enable the perspective of drivers to be more effectively considered, along with that of auto-rickshaw users and the wider travelling public, in policy-making. To this end, we critically discuss the criticism and underlying perceptions; highlight the niche role of auto-rickshaws in urban transport; and present an investigation of the realities and economics of auto-rickshaw ownership and operation. The actual congestion, safety and air pollution impacts of auto-rickshaws are at strong variance with the criticisms and perceptions on the part of the public, media and policy makers. The realities of auto-rickshaw operation are extremely challenging, and unlikely to place the driver and his family above the poverty line, which may drive some of the actions, such as not going by the meter.

Using a sample of 3505 households who have expressed an interest in the future purchase of an economy car, the, paper operationalizes an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour in a structural equation model to quantify the impacts of personal beliefs on individual adoption intention towards electric vehicles. Model results show that attitude, perceived behavioural control, and norms (moral and subjective) have significant direct impacts on behavioural intention, while a household's concern for the environment has an indirect impact. Age, level of employment, and employment status are identified, among other variables, to significantly influence the adoption intention. Collectively, findings indicate that beliefs vary across socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. To best characterize the most likely group of early adopters, we then conduct a Two-Step cluster analysis on households with a high demonstrated intention to adopt EVs. This results in three distinct socio-economic and demographic segments: Typical Early Adopters, Emerging Early Adopters, and Interested Retirees. Each have their own unique socioeconomic and demographic profile. Insights derived from this work can help tailor marketing strategies that are important for accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In such a multi-actor setting, effective implementation of TOD requires governance instruments and strategies aiming for the promotion of actor mutual recognition, goal alignment, information communication and the management of actor interaction. Most of the empirical research on TOD in China has focused on economically developed cities in the prosperous East of the country. To what extent and how cities in China's far West, which feature a different developmental trajectory in their land use, housing provision and transport patterns, adopt TOD still remains unknown territory. This article makes a beginning with the exploration of this topic by studying the Urumqi city in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Based on network governance theory, this article investigates the governance strategies used in Urumqi to integrate urban transport and land use policies. It presents a network governance model consisting of three rungs and concludes that a coordinative umbrella organization plays a significant role in eradicating problems of early substantive selection and perceptional fixation; successful policy integration requires careful goal alignment strategies that force actors to shift from go-alone strategies to interaction and concerted actions; institutional design and trust-building are also imperative for joint action.

However, debtors can shield their assets in various ways and thereby reduce the power of enforcement. This paper studies the circumstances under which a debtor would choose to shield assets and the value of assets that would be shielded. A key idea is that borrower's wealth mutes shielding incentives. Intuitively, avoiding debts through shielding requires that enough assets will be shielded, for else the debts can be collected from exposed assets. A wealthier debtor would thus need to shield more assets, and at a greater cost, than a debtor with limited wealth. Using this basic understanding, I develop a theory of asset shielding and explore its implications for incomplete lending contracts, explaining the role of equity agreements, equity cushions and collateral, and debt forgiveness, and explore the some of the policy implications.

However, a high correlation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for confirmation, because GST is nonstationary. In addition, the tracking errors must also be stationary. Cointegration tests using monthly hindcast data for GST generated by 22 climate change models over the period 1880-2010 are carried out for testing the hypothesis that these hindcasts track GST in the longer run. We show that, although GST and their hindcasts are highly correlated, they unanimously fail to be cointegrated. This means that all 22 models fail to track GST historically in the longer run, because their tracking errors are nonstationary. This juxtaposition of a high correlation and cointegration failure may be explained in terms of the phenomenon of spurious correlation, which occurs when data such as GST embody time trends.

Despite the article's enduring influence, its results have never been formally proved, and doubts remain about their meaning, validity, and generality. This article makes two main contributions. First, it distinguishes six hypotheses plausibly attributable to Priest and Klein. Second, it mathematically proves or disproves the hypotheses under a generalized version of Priest and Klein's model. The Fifty-Percent Limit Hypothesis and three other hypotheses attributable to Priest and Klein (1984) are mathematically well-founded and true under the assumptions made by Priest and Klein. In fact, they are true under a wider array of assumptions. More specifically, the Trial Selection Hypothesis, Fifty-Percent Limit Hypothesis, Asymmetric Stakes Hypothesis, and Irrelevance of Dispute Distribution Hypothesis are true for any distribution of disputes that is bounded, strictly positive, and continuous. The Fifty-Percent Bias Hypothesis is true when the parties are veil/accurate in estimating case outcomes, but only sometimes true when they are less accurate.

Using Shenzhen as a case study, we test this hypothesis with metro planning examples and land transaction data from 2000 to 2014. We found that metro alignment and station placement has bypassed the core of established communities.

While not definitive, our current work suggests that the irreversible nature of many railroad capital expenditures supports a real-options approach and that such an approach could potentially improve assessments of railroad cost of capital.

J,"Carlton, DW; Flyer, FA; Shefi, Y",,,,"Carlton, Dennis W.; Flyer, Fredrick A.; Shefi, Yoad",,,DOES THE FTC'S THEORY OF PRODUCT HOPPING PROMOTE COMPETITION?,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article evaluates the effect on competition of adopting the FTC's product hopping theory as an antitrust doctrine. Courts have disagreed on the merits of the theory. According to this theory, a pharmaceutical manufacturer of a brand name drug can violate the antitrust laws by introducing a new product that reduces demand for rival legacy generic therapies and offers consumers no significant incremental therapeutic benefits over these legacy products. Under these circumstances, generic manufacturers are harmed because they lose sales to the new product and consumers are also harmed, because while they gain no significant therapeutic benefits from the new product they must pay a higher price. The FTC has applied the theory to the pharmaceutical industry because, in the FTC's view, the purpose of product hopping is to evade aspects of the Hatch-Waxman Act which was designed to promote competition between generics and brand name drugs. Although the FTC so far has applied the theory only to pharmaceuticals, nothing in the theory limits its application only to the drug industry. The article explains that the theory is at best a misguided attempt to use antitrust law to fix a regulatory problem in the pharmaceutical industry associated with the Hatch-Waxman Act and is premised on the proposition that competition does not work. Using antitrust law to fix such a regulatory problem, assuming one indeed exists, will not only potentially make things worse in pharmaceutical markets, but also create an undesirable antitrust precedent for other industries.","[Carlton, Dennis W.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Carlton, Dennis W.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Flyer, Fredrick A.; Shefi, Yoad] Compass Lexecon, Chicago, IL USA; [Shefi, Yoad] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"Carlton, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Carlton, DW (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dennis.carlton@chicagobooth.edu; fflyer@compasslexecon.com; yshefi@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,8,3,4,2,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The evolution of research topics over the 50 years shows that consumer issues have evolved from handling and resolving complaints to information search, decision making, consumer fraud, debt profiles, a hierarchy of saving needs, welfare reform, diffusion of innovations, identity theft, financial literacy, and health care reform.

This article studies the optimal choice of policy instrument in settings characterized by such features. We utilize a simple binary-choice model in which decision-makers are either active or passive; active choosers make their decisions by comparing perceived costs and benefits whereas passive choosers select whichever option is the default. From this simple model, a number of results emerge. First, manipulating the default option is preferable to imposing a mandate when active choosers tend to make correct decisions. Second, taxes and defaults are complements, not substitutes; employing the two types of instruments in conjunction can yield better results than utilizing either one alone. Finally, the optimal combination of taxes and defaults is typically preferable to a mandate even in settings where active choosers are prone to biases. The results establish important limits on the range of settings in which mandates are an efficient policy response to decision-maker errors.","[Goldin, Jacob] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lawson, Nicholas] Univ Quebec Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Stanford University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Goldin, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jsgoldin@law.stanford.edu,,,,,,,21,8,8,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Overall, the results suggest that there is a negative relationship between price discrimination and market competition, which is consistent with the traditional wisdom that the ability to price discriminate will be deteriorated by less market concentration.","[He, Qingxin] Winston Salem State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 106 RJ Reynolds,601 S Martin Luther King Jr Dr, Winston Salem, NC 27110 USA",Winston-Salem State University,"He, QX (通讯作者)，Winston Salem State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 106 RJ Reynolds,601 S Martin Luther King Jr Dr, Winston Salem, NC 27110 USA.",heq@wssu.edu,,"HE, QINGXIN/0000-0001-9485-3423",,,,,18,1,1,2,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

This study develops methods of calculating these savings goals for different types of families under various assumptions, using information from various sources. Our calculations also consider investment gains and differences in dollar values over time. We show that families should save between $155 and $572 every month to address all four savings goals. We find that the number of children in a family affects total monthly savings goals considerably but that the number of adults has limited impact.

However, using a market-based measure, the railroad industry underperforms two-thirds of industries.

The essay describes the many achievements of this book in terms of detecting and measuring cheating on cartel prices and its discussion of cartel practices of greater or lesser success. The essay also compares railroad practices for chiefly the transport of grain from Chicago to New York to practices over the same period for the transport of refined oil from Pittsburgh and Cleveland to various locations on the east coast. The principal difference as between grain and oil transport was the existence of competitive markets for grain shipment versus the monopsony of the Standard Oil Company over the shipment of refined oil.

Research has examined how design solutions, such as ticket barriers and ticket inspections, can reduce fare evasion. However little research examines how transit users think about fare evasion or attempts to understand why people fare evade. This research uses a quantitative cluster analysis to segment fare evasion behaviours into three categories which show distinct personality and behavioural characteristics. A web-based survey of was administered to residents of Melbourne, Australia with a total sample size of 1561. The questionnaire was introduced as a survey about transit travel and ticketing but included questions about various aspects of fare evasion behavior. Notably, three broad types of fare evasion were explored: 'accidental' fare evasion (e.g. meant to pay but machines were not working), 'unintentional' fare evasion (e.g. meant to validate but I was in a hurry or I forgot) and 'deliberate' fare evasion (e.g. decided not to pay because I was only going a few stops). A two-step cluster analysis was conducted using a range of categorical and continuous variables including fare evasion behavior, predicted likelihood of continuing to fare evade, age and frequency of transit use. Three clusters of fare evaders emerged: deliberate evaders, unintentional evaders and never-evaders. Deliberate evaders were the smallest cluster but the most frequent transit users. In contrast, unintentional evaders were more common but only fare evaded infrequently. The clusters also had distinct personality differences; deliberate evaders were more likely to be sensation-seekers and believed it was acceptable to bend the rules to save money. Implications for transit policy and practice are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This has led the AFL purposefully to schedule certain matches to be repeated each season with the remaining fixtures mostly randomly allocated. We explore the efficacy of this policy by estimating a fixed (rivalry) effects hedonic demand model for within-season AFL matches. Estimated rivalry effects are imputed into a binary integer program minimisation that provides an optimal profile of rematches against which we consider recent historic scheduling behaviour. As expected, rivalry effects are greatest for the large-market Melbourne 'troika' teams, which provides partial support for the AFL's maintained policy. However, there exists scope for increasing aggregate attendance in the unbalanced part of the season by further attention to selection of rematches. We also observe some decline in interest of the second within-season meetings of popular troika teams and a rise in popularity of the intrastate derbies. Finally, we compare our results to alternative scheduling arrangements for the unbalanced part of the season.","[Lenor, Stephan] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Heidelberg, Germany; [Lenten, Liam J.

Voluntary Payments by American Publishers to Authors Not Protected by Copyright,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; BOOKS,"The payments to British authors by American publishers during the mid-19th century, when the works of British authors lacked American copyright protection, have been presented as evidence that copyright might have little benefit to authors. This paper reexamines the evidence that has been used to support this claim and then presents previously unexamined information about payments to British authors by leading American publishers of the period. The main finding is that payments to British authors were minimal or nonexistent prior to the establishment of a no-compete agreement among leading American publishers. Even after implementation of this agreement, many British authors were not paid, and those who were paid received considerably less than they would have received under copyright. Because antitrust disallows such agreements, this 19th-century natural experiment indicates that the removal of copyright in modern economies would likely eviscerate payments to authors.","[Liebowitz, Stan J.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Liebowitz, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",,"Liebowitz, Stan J/B-4135-2010",,Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation,Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation,I would like to thank Alejandro Zentner and an anonymous referee for helpful comments and the Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation for financial support.,,21,3,3,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

There is no single method to determine the success of sustainable transport systems, but comparative studies can be illuminating despite inevitable data inconsistencies. This study brings to the forefront different styles of regulation and mix of policy tools used by cities that have been trying to implement sustainable transport systems. To this end, a classification scheme of policy instruments was developed based on asymmetries of information and legitimacy, generating four types of instruments: Self-regulative, Informative/Limited action, Proactive/Government and Interactive/Governance. Using 39 semi-structured interviews with key informants from different levels of government and stakeholders, this paper compares the instrument choice in terms of sustainable urban transport policy in Seattle, Montreal and Curitiba. The main conclusions drawn from our interviews is that the distinction between government/proactive instruments and governance/interactive instruments does not appear as dichotomous and clear as expected and that each city deploys somewhat different patterns of instrument choice, in accordance with its political and institutional context.

However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data. (C) 2016 The Authors.

These series can no longer be dealt with using the approximative methods that are appropriate for continuous probability distributions. In addition, it is not sufficient to calculate point forecasts alone: we need to forecast entire (discrete) predictive distributions, particularly for supply chain forecasting and inventory control, but also for other planning processes. However, tools that are suitable for evaluating the quality of discrete predictive distributions are not commonly used in sales forecasting. We explore classical point forecast accuracy measures, explain why measures such as MAD, MASE and wMAPE are inherently unsuitable for count data, and use the randomized Probability Integral Transform (PIT) and proper scoring rules to compare the performances of multiple causal and noncausal forecasting models on two datasets of daily retail sales.

Many of their undocumented foreign workers, however, are not deported but rather choose to return home voluntarily. This paper studies the optimizing behavior of undocumented immigrants who continuously face the risk of deportation, modeled by a stochastic process, and must decide how long to remain in the host country. It is found that the presence of uncertainty with respect to the length of stay abroad unambiguously reduces the desired migration duration and may trigger a voluntary return when a permanent stay would otherwise be optimal. Voluntary return is motivated by both economic and psychological factors. Calibration of the model to match the evidence on undocumented Thai migrants in Japan suggests that the psychological impact of being abroad as an illegal alien may be equivalent to as large as a 68 % cut in the consumption rate at the point of return.","[Vinogradova, Alexandra] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Vinogradova, A (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",avinogradova@ethz.ch,,"Brausmann, Alexandra/0000-0002-8769-8944",,,,,43,6,10,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This cumulative stress is expected to increase with the expected growth in commercial vehicle movements. While electric commercial vehicles (ECVs) may provide a possible technological solution, the research on the market penetration of ECVs is scarce. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for understanding the motivations and barriers of small and medium-size firms to the introduction of ECVs in commercial vehicle fleets. The framework is based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and it is modelled with a structural equation model with latent variables. The model is estimated on the basis of 1443 responses from a large-scale survey in Austria, Denmark, and Germany. The results establish a linkage between the ECV procurement intentions, the TPB constructs (i.e., positive attitudes and subjective norms towards ECVs, familiarity with ECVs and perceived operational ease) and their relative importance. It also provides information regarding the relationship between the TPB constructs and the characteristics of the fleet manager as the individual decision maker, the industrial sector and the fleet management and tour pattern. Last, it provides insights regarding the transferability of the revealed TPB- ECV procurement intentions across industrial sectors and across countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Brought under both federal and state laws, I discuss how legislators and courts have tried to deal with specific practices and argue that, in some cases, the laws (or the interpretation of those laws) can sometimes be counterproductive and actually harm competition. The practical consequence to downstream fuel sellers is that behavior which is perfectly pro-competitive and unilateral in nature still carries an unavoidable systematic risk of litigation. The first risk I discuss arises from parallel pricing. Well known in general and not illegal in itself, parallel behaviors still spawn substantial antitrust activity in the petroleum industry. I focus on two particular and unusual parallel pricing patterns specific to downstream petroleum that have caused recent international controversy. A second litigation risk sellers face arises from pricing too high in states with so-called price-gouging laws and a third risk arises from pricing too low in states with Sales-Below-Cost laws. Finally, a fourth litigation risk arises from the use of bundled discounts between fuel and non-fuel sales. Usually challenged under Sales-Below-Cost laws not well suited to address them, bundled discounting at the retail level has become an increasingly common pricing technique in the ongoing modernization of the downstream petroleum industry.","[Noel, Michael D.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Noel, MD (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",michael.noel@ttu.edu,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Motivated by the structural changes following the increased use of competitive tendering observed in the Norwegian local bus industry, this paper uses first-price single-bid auction theory to demonstrate that rational firms can respond strategically with cross-ownership when exposed to the uncertainty entailed to competitive tendering. This could raise the equilibrium bid implying that the subsidy reduction rationale for introducing competitive tendering is partly invalidated.

In this context, we distinguish three concepts of value-at-risk (VaR): the total VaR, the marginal (or per-time-unit) VaR and the instantaneous VaR. Since the market risk is obviously related to the duration between two consecutive trades, these measures are completed with a duration risk measure, i.e.the time-at-risk (TaR). We propose a forecasting procedure for VaR and TaR for each trade or other market microstructure event. Subsequently, we perform a backtesting procedure specifically designed to assess the validity of the VaR and TaR forecasts on irregularly spaced data. The performance of the HFR measure is illustrated in an empirical application for two stocks (Bank of America and Microsoft) and an exchange-traded fund based on Standard & Poor's 500 index. We show that the intraday HFR forecasts capture accurately the volatility and duration dynamics for these three assets.

To this end, using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), an input-oriented distance model has been estimated for a sample of 26 Port Authorities during the period 1986-2012. This paper contributes to the literature by establishing a direct correlation between the reform and the change in efficiency. Four regulatory changes have been carried out in the Spanish port system during the last three decades: Act 27/1992, Act 62/1997, Act 48/2003 and Act 33/2010. In line with other reforming countries around the world, the regulatory reforms rested on three key instruments: decentralisation (port autonomy), participation of private sector and introduction of competition. This paper supports that Act 62/1997 and Act 48/2003 focused on the promotion of port autonomy, privatisation and inter-port competition and had a positive impact on the efficiency of the Spanish port system.

Nevertheless, transit riders are not a homogeneous entity and understanding the distinctions between transit riders can help transit agencies in their efforts to provide satisfactory service to retain existing riders and attract new ones. To uncover how diverse aspects of bus services can differentially impact satisfaction of different riders, we use data from a large-scale, multiyear bus satisfaction survey from London, UK. Specifically, we model satisfaction using logistic regressions to learn how encumbered riders and riders with physical disabilities value different features of bus services compared to other types of riders. For riders traveling with large items, shopping bags, or children, we find that satisfaction depends on the presence and condition of a bus shelter and the availability of a seat. Satisfaction of riders with disabilities depends on information availability at the bus stop, as well as trip speed and reliability. Our findings indicate that improving waiting area conditions and providing information at the stop can increase the satisfaction of riders with encumbrances and disabilities, respectively. Findings from this paper can be of benefit to transit planners and policy makers as it offers new insights about the determinants of satisfaction of two groups of bus riders not often considered in the public transport literature.

Familiar ideas of causal analysis do not apply when causation is implementation neutral.

It is fundamental that health systems are able to maintain and improve social welfare. In relation to mobilization of resources and long- term sustainability healthcare expenditure, ongoing efforts by the stakeholders involved are occasionally made to revisit the current system and propose more innovative financing mechanisms. The Medical Saving Account (MSA) is one of the mechanisms being assessed to gauge the efficiency of cost containment. This study aims to examine the health and financial status of selected residents in Shah Alam, analyze the acceptance of the MSA, and determine the level of willingness to pay (WTP) for the MSA. Data collection was conducted by distributing 31 questionnaires as a pilot test. Respondents were randomly selected from Shah Alam and given a guided questionnaire. The data was analyzed using SPSS. Most of the respondents reported a good health status with no serious diagnosed diseases and a good financial status. However, none of the factors studied showed a significant association with the acceptance of the MSA implementation with a median WTP of RM72.30 (approximately 17USD).

In this paper, I discuss how and why the Flash Crash is being invoked as a significant event in debates about high-frequency trading and algo-financial markets. I analyse the mediatization of the event, as well as the variety of eventalizations of the Flash Crash - the different ways in which the Flash Crash is being mobilized as an illustrative event. I critically discuss the impact often associated with the Flash Crash - and on that basis, inquire into why the event nonetheless attracts so much attention. I suggest that a key reason why the Flash Crash is widely discussed is that eventalizations of 6 May 2010 evoke familiar tropes about the fear of technology and the fear of herding. Finally, and given their emphasis on herding, I argue that the Flash Crash eventalizations may contribute to discussions within economic sociology about resonance in quantitative finance.","[Borch, Christian] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Borch, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",cbo.mpp@cbs.dk,,,Danish Council for Independent Research's Sapere Aude Grant for the project 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets',Danish Council for Independent Research's Sapere Aude Grant for the project 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets',This work was supported by the Danish Council for Independent Research's Sapere Aude Grant for the project 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets'.,,74,43,45,4,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Unfortunately, one of the serious consequences of increasing inequality of income is that increasingly more young people face a world full of uncertainty and anxiety instead of starting on a journey full of promises that besides risks there are also sources of hope(OECD, 2014). Aspirations for higher income, the chance of a professional career and family relative independence (being alone, or without children) makes them more open to the jobs available abroad, if they fulfill expectations.

According to the authors welfare taxes are individual consumption, social security and wealth taxes related to the welfare of today and tomorrow. Long-run welfare tax (like excise, property tax, capital tax, etc.) is related with welfare in a long run. In Nordic countries where tax income level is higher wealth tax (property tax) are of bigger importance. In Baltic countries excise tax revenue has a bigger share.

There is an increasing need for cluster-based data to support research, facilitate comparisons of clusters across regions and support policymakers in defining regional strategies. This article develops a novel clustering algorithm that systematically generates and assesses sets of cluster definitions (i.e., groups of closely related industries). We implement the algorithm using 2009 data for U.S. industries (six-digit NAICS), and propose a new set of benchmark cluster definitions that incorporates measures of inter-industry linkages based on co-location patterns, input-output links, and similarities in labor occupations. We also illustrate the algorithm's ability to compare alternative sets of cluster definitions by evaluating our new set against existing sets in the literature. We find that our proposed set outperforms other methods in capturing a wide range of inter-industry linkages, including the grouping of industries within the same three-digit NAICS.","[Delgado, Mercedes] Temple Univ, 1801 Liacouras Walk,542 Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Delgado, Mercedes] Inst Strategy & Competitiveness, 1801 Liacouras Walk,542 Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Porter, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stern, Scott] MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA USA; [Stern, Scott] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Delgado, M (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, 1801 Liacouras Walk,542 Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.;Delgado, M (通讯作者)，Inst Strategy & Competitiveness, 1801 Liacouras Walk,542 Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",mdelgado@temple.edu,"Delgado, Mercedes/L-9707-2014","Scheifler, Alexandre Batista/0009-0000-8390-5777",Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce,Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce,"This article is a significantly revised version of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Working Paper 20375.

First, we describe communication infrastructure as a subsystem of economic infrastructure, and discuss the impact of communication infrastructure on the functioning of enterprises. Next, we empirically analyse the relationship between the development of communication infrastructure and the effectiveness of enterprises. The problem of the measurement of enterprise effectiveness, although studied in numerous research analyses, has not been comprehensively solved. In this article we attempt to create a synthetic measure of economic effectiveness of enterprises, seizing on an earlier selected set of diagnostic variables. The application of synthetic measures that use one aggregate indicator instead of a series of variables to describe objects, enables us to quantify the multidimensional nature of economic operations and systematize them in a linear way. Our analysis covers all 16 Polish voivodeships. The methodological approach is based on Hellwig's method, correlation and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The main criterion of variable selection was completeness and availability of data for the period 2003-2011.","[Fic, Maria; Malinowski, Mariusz] Wroclaw Univ Technol, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Fic, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Technol, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",maria.fic@pwr.wroc.pl; malinowski.mariusz@op.pl,,"Malinowski, Mariusz/0000-0002-9602-6672",,,,,41,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,39.0,63,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_4,0.0,,,25,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100004,0

Some authors analyse implementation of the results of the event plans and the feedback received after the event (Jago, Shaw 1998; Preuss, 2011), others focus on the economic, socio-cultural, technological and other benefits after the event (Barget, 2001; Barget et al, 2007; Balciunas et al, 2014; MacAdam, 2011) yet others focus on analysis programs of sporting events (Huang, 2011). However, although it is important to analyse the likely benefits of the event, most benefits are revealed only after the event, when it is possible to assess its legacy. In view of the studies alternatives of the research field, this paper is analysing the evaluation of the legacy of sporting events. The main problem encountered in the analysis of the legacy of sporting events, is a lack of scientifically-based evaluation methods. In view of this problem MacAdam (2011) created the evaluation methodology conception of the economic legacy of a sporting event MERLIN* (Multi sport event legacy return index), which enables the evaluation of the legacy of a sporting event, as a numerical value of the expression for the first time. It is important to note that for existing weaknesses MERLIN* is not popular methodology of evaluation of the legacy of a sporting event but it is recognissed as an appropriate methodology concept, which can be developed through additional studies. In view of that, this article explores the MERLIN * methodology concept and analyses its strengths and weaknesses. On the basis of expert interviews, the legacy value of the European Men's Basketball Championship for 2007-2013 in different countries is evaluated and compare. Also based on the expert assessment results, the disadvantages of MERLIN* methodology are observed and suggestions are made on the improvement of its evaluation criteria.","[Gudaityte, Giedre] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept IT Technol & Distance Studies, Perkuno Ave 3a, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Jasinskas, Edmundas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Perkuno Ave 3a, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Balciunas, Mindaugas] Lithuanian Sport Univ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University; Vilnius University,"Gudaityte, G (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept IT Technol & Distance Studies, Perkuno Ave 3a, Kaunas, Lithuania.;Jasinskas, E (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Perkuno Ave 3a, Kaunas, Lithuania.;Balciunas, M (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sport Univ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.;Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",giedre.gudaityte@lsu.lt; edmundas.jasinskas@gmail.com; mindaugas.balciunas@lsu.lt; dalia.streimikiene@khf.vu.lt,"Jasinskas, Edmundas/JYO-6178-2024; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Jasinskas, Edmundas/0000-0003-3158-2974; Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,25,2,2,1,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We employ a panel data set containing observations of road mileage by type for all Minnesota counties over the period 1988 to 2007 to fit a model describing changes in road networks, population and employment. Results indicate that causality runs in both directions between population and local road networks, while no evidence of causality in either direction is found for networks and local employment.

We suggest a framework for predicting the annual numbers of cancer deaths by modeling individual survival times. A Weibull mixture model with individual covariates and unobserved heterogeneity is proposed for examining the effects of demographic variables on individual survival times and predicting the annual number of cancer deaths by adopting a bottom-up strategy. We apply the suggested framework to a survival analysis of lung and bronchus cancer patients in the United States and provide a comparison with the forecast results obtained from previous studies. A comparison of our results with those of various benchmarks shows that our proposed model performs better for predicting annual numbers of cancer deaths. Furthermore, by segmenting patients based on age, sex, and race, we are able to specify the differences between groups and assess the group-specific survival probabilities within a given period.

There is a need for an unambiguous rapid economic breakthrough for a further development of the country where the implemented state fiscal policy is an important instrument. At present the economic development in the world and Europe, geopolitical situation, the migration of the population as well as the domestic problems of the development of Latvia pose new challenges to the government's fiscal policy, they create new fiscal risks and problems that require strong fiscal discipline and an efficient fiscal policy. Unfortunatelly, during the past years the fiscal policy in the country is not sustainable, each year it is adjusted and the government steps away from the previous decisions which cause the discontent of the society and as a whole it slows down the economic development. The aim of the research is: to evaluate the fiscal policy in Latvia in accordance with the theoretical and practical conclusions of the scientific investigations in the world, to determine the main fiscal risks and to find the fiscal policy gaps in the formation of the revenues of the state budget as well as in the use of funds and to define the recommendations for making a sustainable fiscal policy in the country. During the investigation the most essential factors which influenced the fiscal policy were determined: administrative, political, ideological, economic, international and the fiscal risks were summarized: quantified and not quantified as well as the recommendations have been worked out in order to minimaze the risks and to reduce their negative influence. In the paper the development trends of the state expenditure structure have been critically analyzed and the drawbacks of the fiscal policy have been investigated. At the end of the research the authors have defined the necessary measurements for making a sustainable fiscal policy of a rapid economic development of the country and the decrease of social inequality.

Regardless of emerging and overturned concepts, contemporary research studies confirm that 2/3 of companies regularly use CPM tools and perceive CPM as the best way to build value. Unfortunately, despite years of scientific attention, recent studies also indicate that the CPM application is hampered by the lack of appropriate metrics and instruments. Managers express their dissatisfaction with the results they obtain using CPM in comparison to the effort they make.

Nevertheless, not so many studies have explored mortality, life expectancy and health in relation to ethnicity. Emerging literature in many countries on ethnicity and health contains a number of highly debated topics, with researchers disagreeing on terminology, focus, and approach. This paper is in line with this. During the Soviet period, only in the time of Gorbachev's reforms, there appeared evidence of existing ethnic inequalities in mortality in the former USSR. Studies on ethnic inequalities in mortality and life expectancy advanced in Latvia, after the country regained independence. The scope for analysis was enlarged after population censuses were organised in 2000 and 2011. Data of censuses were used for specifying data on population numbers and studies in socio-demographic differentials among subgroups of the population. The aim of this study is to analyse differences in mortality, life expectancy and health between the two largest ethnic groups in Latvia - Latvians and Russians - at the beginning of 21st century. Age-specific and age-cause-specific death rates, life tables and standardized death rates for Latvians and Russians by sex and urban-rural residence were calculated in the time period of four years around population censuses. Ethnic differentiation in self-assessed health is analysed based on FINBALT survey data and other health studies. Ethnic differentiation in health, mortality and life expectancy is determined by health behaviour and gaps between sub-groups of the population concerning beginning and entering different phases of epidemiologic transition. More detailed analysis by use of linkage of vital events with individual population census data could clarify obtained results from cross-sectional analysis.","[Krumins, Juris; Ponomarjova, Denize] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Ponomarjova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",denize.ponomarjova@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,429.0,441,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200037,0

A number of empirical investigations have been carried out to examine its nature, variance, and outcome. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between personal factors and work-life conflict among employees of a Malaysian statutory body using a sample of 120 personally-distributed questionnaires. The variables for personal factors consist of career commitment, household responsibilities, and financial needs. The findings indicated that two out of three variables of personal factors (i.e. household responsibilities and financial needs) are positively and significantly related to work-life conflict. The finding also reveals that career commitment is not significantly related to work-life conflict. Therefore, this study adds to the body of knowledge of work-life conflict that validated the positive relationship between employees' personal factors of household responsibilities and financial needs with work-life conflict. On the other hand, this study also proved that an employee's career commitment does not relate to work-life conflict, thus showing that a committed employee would not be feeling any conflict in fulfilling the demands of both of his or her work and non-work lives. Nevertheless, an employee who has higher household responsibilities and financial needs would face a higher conflict in fulfilling the demands of both of his or her work and non-work live.

It is very popular in finance. In this study a Pareto optimised custom moving average is suggested, as it is the most suitable for financial time series smoothing. Suitability criteria are defined by smoothness and accuracy, the criteria often used by practitioners. Previous research has mostly concentrated on only one of the two criteria in isolation. We define this as the multi criteria Pareto optimisation problem. The essence of the proposed method is weight optimisation, so that for every level of smoothness we obtain the best accuracy. We compare the proposed method to the five most popular moving average methods on 1000 synthetic and 2000 real world stock data on smoothness levels equivalent to the smoothness of simple moving average of 5, 10, 21, and 63 days. The comparison was performed using out-of-sample, unseen data. Weights optimised on one stock are very similar to weights optimised for any other stock and can be used interchangeably. The new method outperforms other methods in the majority of cases. It allows better time series smoothing with the same level of accuracy as traditional methods, or better accuracy with the same smoothness. Traders can use the new method to detect trends earlier and to avoid unnecessary trading and increase the profitability of their strategies. The concept is also applicable to sensors, weather forecasting, and traffic prediction where both the smoothness and accuracy of the filtered signal are important.","[Raudys, Aistis] Vilnius Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Naugarduko St 24, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Pabarskaite, Zidrina] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Studentu St 48, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Raudys, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Naugarduko St 24, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",aistis@raudys.com,,,European Structural and Investment Funds project Postdoctoral Fellowship Implementation in Lithuania within the framework of the Measure for Enhancing Mobility of Scholars and Other Researchers; Promotion of Student Research of the Program of Human Resources Development Action Plan [VPI-3.1-SMM-01-V-02-004],European Structural and Investment Funds project Postdoctoral Fellowship Implementation in Lithuania within the framework of the Measure for Enhancing Mobility of Scholars and Other Researchers; Promotion of Student Research of the Program of Human Resources Development Action Plan,This work was funded by European Structural and Investment Funds project Postdoctoral Fellowship Implementation in Lithuania within the framework of the Measure for Enhancing Mobility of Scholars and Other Researchers and the Promotion of Student Research (VPI-3.1-SMM-01-V-02-004) of the Program of Human Resources Development Action Plan.,,24,1,1,0,8,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

An important empirical finding of this study is the cyclical nature of unemployment. Unemployment in Croatia exhibits quite remarkably precise recurring business cycles of 5-6 years. This cyclical behaviour of unemployment is important both from theoretical and practical point of view. If empirical results of this paper are validated by other studies, a partial hysteresis' hypothesis should be recognised in terms of unemployment since both the hysteresis hypothesis and the natural rate of unemployment hypothesis hold in Croatia. Both hysteresis and natural rate of unemployment govern unemployment dynamics in Croatia causing cyclical behaviour and the observed cycles of 56 years. Therefore, the empirical evidence of this study calls for researching the so-called 'partial hysteresis, with unemployment having not only some properties of random walk (non-stationarity) but also of stationary series (mean reversion).

Its genesis could be associated with the Manhattan Project (construction of the atomic bomb), and thus the time of World War II. In the 1960s PM was spreading in business ventures, especially in the developed countries of Western Europe and the USA. In today's world, the following approaches are popular-linear: IPMA, PMI and PRINCE2 and light, based on the AGILE manifesto (e.g., Scrum). The aim of this paper is, to present chosen methodological assumptions of the implementation of project orientation in institutions of public administration. It focuses on the model of the project life cycle, confronting the assumptions of the method (mainly the requirements for the techniques of initiation, planning and controlling) with the conditions of the implementation, in terms of the Polish public administration. In the article a case study method of research was employed, referring to certain aspects of the implementation of the pilot project orientation, in one of the localities in southern Poland. Acceptance of the project orientation of public administration institutions should be treated as an innovation process, which is a response to the current challenges of the environment.

The new science encourages scientific disciplines to seek dialogue, connections and integration with each other. Therefore, it is very important to be open, connected and integrated. It is believed that interdisciplinary becomes more and more important concept in science. Scientists should change, and they are changing. The changing processes are not fast and usually contain mistakes. Thus, it should be remembered to be critical and learn from mistakes. The question arises whether there is an integrated science, and in fact, there is. For example, neuroscience has become interdisciplinary with many connections to other sciences. These new associations cause great debate not only in the research domain of science technology, but as well in social science, arts and humanities research. In this paper, the author wishes to review the dialogue of social sciences with neuroscience. Social sciences are encouraged both internally and externally to be open to other sciences. Examples of this are neuroeconomics, neurolaw, neuropsychology, neuromanagement and neuroeducation. Specialists in economics, law, psychology, management and education science talk to those from neurosciencein search for clearer understanding and closeness to the truth than they had before by using the achievements of neuroscience. Thus, the question is raised whether the dialogue between neuroscience and social sciences is inevitable.","[Valanciene, Dovile] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sports Educ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Valanciene, Dovile] Vilnius Univ, Fac Law, Dept Publ Law, Inst Legal Hist, Sauletekio Ave 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University; Vilnius University,"Valanciene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sports Educ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.;Valanciene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Law, Dept Publ Law, Inst Legal Hist, Sauletekio Ave 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",dovile.valanciene@lsu.lt,,,,,,,77,2,2,1,22,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Both systems were estimated with the use of the quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS) model incorporating demographic variables and using actual price and expenditure data. Subsequent to estimations, expenditure, own and cross-price elasticities of demand were calculated for both demand systems.

The findings documented in this paper could be a consequence of the fact that examining differenced data under certain conditions will lead to a loss of information and that the inclusion of the error correction term from the cointegration model can help to cope with this problem.

However, there is disagreement as to whether opening light rail lines attracts new ridership or merely draws ridership from existing transit users. We study a new light rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, which is part of a complete street redevelopment. We utilize a pre-test post-test control group quasi-experimental design to test two different measures of ridership change. The first measure is calculated from stops along the light rail route; the second assumes that nearby bus stops might be displaced by the rail and calculates ridership change with those stops included as baseline. Both the simple measure (transit use changes on the complete street light rail corridor) and the displacement measure (transit use changes in the one-quarter mile catchment areas around new light rail stops) showed significant (p < .01) and substantial (677%) increases in transit passengers compared to pre-light rail bus users. In particular, the displacement analysis discredits a common challenge that when a new light rail line opens, most passengers are simply former bus riders whose routes were canceled in favor of light rail. The study suggests that light rail services can attract additional ridership to public transit systems. In addition, although pre-post control-group designs require time and effort, this project underscores the benefits of such quasi-experimental designs in terms of the strength of the inferences that can be drawn about the impacts of new transit infrastructure and services.

The study is made from the point of view of government port institutions: individual Port Authorities and State Ports Authority (Central Government). For accomplishing this purpose, the results of a survey performed over personnel of the Spanish port management institutions are analyzed, first using a descriptive approach, and later by Exploratory Factor Analysis. The conclusions confirm that there are important differences with respect to what should be the operational procedure of the central government's port coordination entity (State Ports Authority) and each individual Port Authority. Additionally there are significant differences in the way that Northern and South-eastern ports both function and are managed. In light of this features, it will be possible to indicate potential priorities for logistical and commercial policies, in order to make commercial ports more efficient. Until now, researchers have studied port choice factors based on requests and demands of external agents (maritime companies, freight forwarders, charterers and users in general), but not of the service providers (port authorities at their different levels). Port choice models are currently emerging as an alternative in order to cover this gap, and this paper uses this methodology in order to clear definitions for the port governance institutions' policy targets.","[Gonzalez-Laxe, Fernando; Jesus Freire-Seoane, Maria; Pais Montes, Carlos] Univ A Coruna, Inst Maritime Studies, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Montes, CP (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Inst Maritime Studies, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna, Spain.",laxe@udc.es; maje@udc.es; carlos.pais.montes@udc.es,,"Gonzalez-Laxe, Fernando/0000-0001-5399-3446",,,,,50,3,3,2,16,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

We estimate a market equilibrium model with differentiated multiproduct oligopoly using market-level sales data in China together with information from household surveys. Our counterfactual simulations show that (quality-adjusted) vehicle prices have dropped by 33% from 2004 to 2009. The decrease in markup from intensified competition accounts for about one third of this change and the rest comes from cost reductions through learning by doing and other channels. In addition, our simulations show that the price decline would have been larger had it not been for the growth of household income during this period.","[Li, Shanjun] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Xiao, Junji] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Decis Sci & Managerial Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yimin] Ford Motor Co, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA",Cornell University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Ford Motor Company,"Li, SJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",SL2448@cornell.edu; junjixiao@baf.cuhk.edu.hk; yliu59@ford.com,"Liu, Yi/HTN-4916-2023; Liu, Kun/JAX-5396-2023; liu, chen/ISV-2093-2023; Yan, Jun/IXD-7801-2023; Liu, Kai/IST-6808-2023","Li, shanjun/0000-0002-6141-8940",,,,,23,23,30,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The vetogates model focuses on the many points in the legislative process where proposed legislation can be stopped (vetoed). A political system where statutes must pass through a variety of filters, each motivated by somewhat different incentives and interests, is one where (1) statutes are hard to enact; (2) statutes that are enacted will tend to have compromises, logrolls, and delegations; and, (3) once enacted, statutes are hard to repeal. These consequences represent a significant cost of the vetogates model to our system of governance, but they also carry some potential benefits. I explore the ramifications of the vetogates model for legal doctrine. For example, the vetogates model supports judicial consultation of legislative history in statutory cases and suggests the virtue of deliberation-rewarding canons for judicial review of agency statutory interpretations.","[Eskridge, William N., Jr.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Eskridge, WN (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,69,7,8,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The core aim of the present study was to investigate the relative role of environmental norms, transport priorities and resistance to change for acceptance of transport push measures in an urban Norwegian public with car access. A questionnaire survey was carried out in a randomly selected representative sample of the Norwegian population in six urban regions obtained from the Norwegian population registry (n=881). Regression analysis showed that transport priorities and resistance to change added to the explained variance in acceptance of transport push measures, while adjusting for environmental norms in the Norm Activation Model (NAM) and demographic characteristics. Awareness of consequences and personal norms were associated with more acceptance, whereas priorities of flexibility and priorities of safety and security were associated with a low acceptance of transport push measures. Emotional reactions to change were also related to a low acceptance of these measures. SEM supported the assumptions in the NAM theory, but a direct relation between awareness of car use consequences and acceptance of transport push measures was found to improve model fit. A short-term focus on change was also related to a low ascription of responsibility in the NAM. High education was the sole demographic characteristic associated with more acceptance of transport push measures. Campaigns aimed to promote acceptance of transport push measures need to consider additional factors to environmental norms. The findings suggest that people who prioritize travel flexibility and safety and security need to be focused in order to increase acceptance of transport push measures in the urban public. Furthermore, efforts to promote environmentally significant behaviour may benefit by taking the resistance to change trait into account. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper makes endogenous the stance auditors take: with a more conservative stance, auditors are less likely to certify an inflated report, but are more likely to refuse to certify an accurate one. The auditor's tradeoff between these two error types, and the resulting interplay with the level of performance-based pay for managers, play a critical role in determining the level of managerial misreporting, investor welfare, and a number of other key variables. The paper finds that (1) strengthening the link between pay and reported performance can result in a weaker link between pay and actual performance and, consequently, lower managerial effort; (2) conservatism among auditors improves performance measurement; and (3) raising penalties on managers for overstating earnings can reduce audit quality and harm investors, while raising penalties on auditors for certifying overstated results does not harm investors.","[Singh, Ravi] Higher Moment Capital LLC, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Larkin, Ian] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Singh, R (通讯作者)，Higher Moment Capital LLC, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rsingh@highermoment.com; ian.larkin@anderson.ucla.edu,,,,,,,30,3,3,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this game, the theoretical prediction is that costly voluntary disclosures will not occur. This hinges on the prediction that the person making the offer will extract all the joint surplus of settlement from the player making the costly disclosure. If fairness considerations prevent this from occurring, then we may observe costly disclosures when none are predicted to occur. Our chief finding is that plaintiffs with a strong case reveal their private information 42% of the time, when the theoretical prediction is that they should do so 0% of the time. Fairness considerations appear to be important in explaining the deviation from theory. For a plaintiff with a strong case, the return to revealing private information is approximately zero, while theory predicts that this return should be negative. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

When developing or improving infrastructure in ways that impact habitats and species, transportation agencies are required to avoid, minimize, and mitigate natural resource impacts through compensatory mitigation. Whereas agencies traditionally plan and implement compensatory mitigation project-by-project, late in project development, advance mitigation addresses the impacts of one or many transportation projects before or during project planning. This new practice may reduce infrastructure development costs, yet evidence of its associated cost savings has been piecemeal and often anecdotal. We explore the early acquisition of land for compensatory mitigation as one advance mitigation strategy that may reduce costs. With case-based analysis of California's Beach Lake Mitigation Bank, we provide post hoc empirical estimates of savings realized from advance purchase. Additionally, hypothetical scenarios illustrate how the timing of mitigation land purchases can impact cost. Overall, we provide new evidence that advance mitigation, specifically early acquisition of land for compensatory mitigation, could promise agency cost savings, particularly when land is purchased during a market trough instead of at market peak. Still, inevitable project planning and land market uncertainties necessitate cautious optimism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a review of all EU decisions and openings between 2009 and mid-2013, we find that procompetitive justifications still play an unsatisfactory role in the EU Commission's evaluations, except in IT-related abuse cases. This stands in contrast to the policy goals expressed during the reform phase (from 2005 to 2009), the Guidance Paper, and the increasing relevance of efficiency considerations in merger proceedings. We argue that this development is due to a malfunctioning of the balancing test-that is, the weighting of pro- and anticompetitive effects, as pro- and anticompetitive effects are often non-separable and non-monotone in Article 102 TFEU cases. Policy options are discussed, and it is argued that a fully integrated analysis is the only policy option fully addressing the problem.","[Friederiszick, Hans W.] European Sch Management & Technol, Berlin, Germany",European School of Management & Technology,,friederiszick@e-ca.com; gratz@e-ca.com,,,,,,,32,7,7,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

However, exogenously set variables, tourism and policy related, the inherent features of urban economies, such as the specialization of industry, and their inter-linkages with their peri-rural municipalities, act as stabilizers that ease the crisis effects and may support recovery.

Electric propulsion is energy efficient, and does not cause local pollution. In 2013 the new vehicle market share of electric vehicles (EVs) was 5.8%. and 80% were owned by private consumers. This paper explores some possible explanations to the Norwegian development by describing the electromobility story, the incentives given and the attitudes among users. A long lasting interaction between private enterprises, public authorities and non-government organizations combined with a taxation system that gives the authorities opportunity to influence vehicle purchase, and to compensate for marketing challenges related to price, have supported the Norwegian diffusion of electromobility. In addition a high share of multi-vehicle households and a publicly supported expansion of charging stations have made range challenges manageable. The Norwegian market is expected to continue to grow as more models are coming into the market and given the governmental decision to extend the economic incentives until the end of 2017. Rapid development of the technology and policies makes firm conclusions for other countries challenging to make.

The control group, it is thought, will use its position to consume excessive amounts of the firm's returns, and this injures minority shareholders in two ways: there is less money and the controllers are not maximizing firm value. To the contrary, we argue here that there is an optimal share of the firm that induces the control group to maximize shareholder value while inducing investors to fund the firm's projects. The concern that controlled companies raise is that the controlling group cannot easily commit not to consume more than the optimal share. A firm's cost of capital is increasing in the controllers' inability to solve this credibility problem because potential investors will charge the firm for later consuming private benefits. Today, accurate judicial review of controlled transactions under mandatory fiduciary rules helps controllers to commit not to take more than the optimal share. Private contracting and judicial review are strong complements, however. Therefore, our principal normative recommendation is to open up the contracting space by reducing the fiduciary rules to defaults. This reform would be less helpful in developing countries that lack effective legal systems. The public corporations in such countries, however, also have controlling shareholders. We explore various non-legal methods by which these shareholders credibly commit to cap private benefits, although we also show that these methods are less efficient in a mature legal system than contracting would be.

However, the topic remains understudied in current literature. This paper examines school travel mode choice behaviour of 11-year-old children and 14-15 year old youth in Toronto, Canada. Morning period school trip data was analysed using multinomial logit models. Distance to school was the most important barrier to walking for both age groups; neighbourhood built environment characteristics (i.e., major street intersections, retail density and block density) had a stronger association with a child's odds of walking; and access to transit was correlated with only a youth's travel mode outcome. In addition, a male youth was more likely to walk than a female youth; gender of a child was not associated with school travel mode. As school travel related programmes are beginning to be adapted to the high-school context, our results indicate that a current North American model that is largely designed around capital improvement of transport infrastructure may not be very successful. Rather, programmes and initiatives should emphasize education, and perhaps attempt to understand and reshape the culture of youth mobility, in order to encourage healthy and sustainable travel practices.

A methodology is proposed for tendering transport contracts which is applied in the Spanish region of Castilla and Leon. Based on a previous demand model, new incentives are proposed to encourage the operating companies to make improvements in the quality of service they provide on their metropolitan bus routes. The main contribution made by this research with respect to other similar methodologies is found in the incorporation of the subjective value of time and willingness to pay in exchange for improvements in service quality. This information is used to determine the optimal formula for public subsidies. The results show that, without any increase in costs for the administration, the amount of the subsidy due for underuse of the service could be reduced by increasing demand through providing a more attractive public transport service. It has also been shown that improvements in quality could be profitable, not only for society at large but also for the operating companies themselves. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a deeper look into how this factor is effectively estimated shows the regulator enjoys a great deal of discretion, especially when selecting the methodologies used to estimate its components. As shown in this paper, discretion increases the likelihood of controversies between the regulator and the regulated firm. This paper describes how the X-factor is estimated for Peruvian transport infrastructures and analyzes the most important controversies that arose when the X-factor for Lima's airport was estimated. Conclusions are the following: i) when the X-factor is estimated retrospectively careful planning is necessary since this option requires data that has to be collected at the time the infrastructure is concessioned; ii) cost of capital estimation is one of the main sources of controversy due to the subjective criteria used in its calculation and its impact in the final result; and, iii) transparent procedures improve the legitimacy of regulatory decisions, especially in contexts of limited public resources and weak institutions, typical of developing countries.

However, the factors behind this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. Our study develops a general framework that conceptualizes the phenomenon of round-trip investment. In particular, we argue that secrecy arbitrage, defined as interplay of onshore corruption and offshore secrecy, largely explains round-trip investment between onshore jurisdictions and OFCs. First, we argue that part of the round-trip FDI consists of proceeds from corruption, which is laundered in OFCs and reinvested back to the location of origin. Second, we maintain that the secrecy dimension of the OFC also motivates the round-tripping of licit capital, as businesses use the secrecy provided by OFCs to hide their true identities from corrupt authorities in the home location. To test the validity of our argument about onshore corruption as a driver for round-trip investment, we empirically analyze firm-level data on the distribution of offshore FDI (which, we argue, is largely round-trip) across Russian regions. Our empirical findings confirm that FDI from OFCs is positively associated with host region corruption, and this relationship is stronger for OFCs with a higher secrecy score. Hence, we conclude that round-trip FDI is strongly motivated by the interplay between onshore corruption and offshore secrecy.","[Ledyaeva, Svetlana] Aalto Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, FI-00076 Helsinki, Finland; [Ledyaeva, Svetlana] Ctr Markets Transit, FI-00076 Helsinki, Finland; [Karhunen, Paivi; Kosonen, Riitta] Aalto Univ, Ctr Markets Transit, Sch Business, FI-00076 Helsinki, Finland; [Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Aalto University; Aalto University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Ledyaeva, S (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business, POB 21240, FI-00076 Helsinki, Finland.",Svetlana.Ledyaeva@aalto.fi; Paivi.Karhunen@aalto.fi; Riitta.Kosonen@aalto.fi; jwhalley@uwo.ca,"Ledyaeva, Svetlana/JCO-1368-2023","Karhunen, Paivi/0000-0002-2492-510X; Ledyaeva, Svetlana/0000-0002-6680-4648",,,,,72,36,40,1,64,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Such human activities, in particular travel and freight transportation, generate massive emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2). Hence, the aim of this study was to predict the amount of CO2 emissions from energy use in Thailand's transportation sector as well as related factors, thus providing a substantial benefit to determine policies for reducing GHG emissions and its impacts. In this study, 5 independent variables, namely the size of the population, gross domestic product (GDP), and the number of small, medium and large-sized registered vehicles, were considered in the forecasting of the CO2 amount released from transportation energy consumption using 4 techniques: log-linear regression, path analysis, time series, and curve estimation. According to the findings, the time series exemplified the minimum mean absolute percent error (MAPE=5.388), followed by the log-linear regression model (MAPE=6.379). The results, based on a path analysis model, indicated the significant effects of the large-sized registered vehicle numbers, GDP, and population on the amount of CO2 emissions. With the CO2 emission forecast, the maximum predicted value was 22533 million tons by 2030 using curve estimation (cubic), and the minimum predicted value was 91.68 million tons using log-linear regression.

Third, opening one side of a proprietary platform may lower incentives to invest in platform quality. Fourth, the structure of access prices of the proprietary platform depends on (i) how changes in the number of developers affect the incentives to invest in the open platform, and (ii) how investment in the open platform affects the revenues of the proprietary platform.

Generally they have the greatest impact on the result of cost-benefit analysis. It is common practice to adopt the consumer surplus measure for calculating transport user benefits. Normally the well-known Rule of a Half', as a practical approximation for the integral of the demand curve, is used to determine the change of consumer surplus. Changes in travel demand and consumer surplus are influenced by all modeled changing variables, which primarily comprise the generalized costs. However, travel demand models with multiple constraints additionally contain variable shadow prices, added to the generalized costs. Such models are often used for travel demand modeling of large-scale areas. The most discussed and well-known model in the field of transport modeling is the doubly constrained gravity model. Beside this model with inelastic constraints, there are also more flexible models with elastic constraints. In this paper we enter into the question of whether applying the Rule of a Half with regard only to the generalized costs and neglecting the shadow prices is valid in the case of travel demand models with multiple constraints. For this purpose, a theoretical analysis in this paper provides a mathematical proof. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, we identify significant patterns of firm's behavior by means of novel statistical classification techniques and we analyze which aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility are less developed. The methodology is applied to a sample of Spanish firms.

That was how Cobden used it in the debates over the Corn Laws in the 1840s, and how Ruskin, Gesell, Chesterton, and other critics conceived of economic liberation. In debates over free trade in recent decades, that term has come to mean a defense of power and privilege, the exact opposite of the intent of 19(th)-century liberals.

It makes three points. First, the usual antitrust analysis can be seriously misleading as a guide to consumer or society welfare because it assumes that pricing is linear and uniform. But the type of pricing endogenously depends on transaction costs, including information costs. Second, two key issues in any antitrust analysis are whether transaction costs change as a result of the action under scrutiny and, regardless of whether they change, how the existence of nonlinear pricing alters the usual antitrust analysis. We develop a merger simulation model with nonlinear pricing to illustrate how misleading the standard analysis can be.

Using a common behavioral framework, we derive two methods for estimating the relationship between parental transfers and schooling investments: the log-linear and multiplicative household fixed-effects regression models. Using data from a unique household-level survey, we strongly reject the log-linear specification. Results from the multiplicative model suggest that when a son receives 1 yuan less in schooling investment than his brother, he obtains 0.47 yuan more in transfers as partial compensation. Since our measure of transfers represents a substantial fraction of total parental transfers, sons with more schooling likely enjoy higher lifetime consumption. Redistribution within the household may be limited by either the parents' desire for consumption equality or bargaining constraints imposed by their children. Controlling for unobserved household heterogeneity and a fuller accounting of lifetime transfers are quantitatively important.","[Brandt, Loren; Siow, Aloysius] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Wang, Hui] Peking Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of Toronto; Peking University,"Wang, H (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",brandt@chass.utoronto.ca; siow@chass.utoronto.ca; jackie.wang@gsm.pku.edu.cn,"Chen, Nuo/JZD-0344-2024",,,,,,31,5,7,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Moreover, forecasting with nonlinear models can be quite programming-intensive, as multi-step-ahead forecasts need to be simulated. We propose a simple pretest to help determine whether it is worthwhile to forecast a series using a STAR model. In particular, we extend Terasvirta's in-sample test for LSTAR and ESTAR behavior to multi-step-ahead out-of-sample forecasts. We apply our pretest to the real exchange rates of various OECD countries. When the test strongly rejects the null of linearity, a nonlinear model clearly outperforms a linear one in terms of multi-step-ahead forecasting accuracies (i.e., lower mean absolute percentage errors). However, when it fails to reject the null or does so only mildly, a direct approach based on an autoregressive model yields forecasts that are slightly superior to those generated from a logistic model. We also find that, when the proposed test strongly rejects the null of linearity, the direct method of forecasting and the bootstrap predictor yield similar performances, with the latter outperforming in terms of lower mean absolute percentage errors.

To assess the economic significance of this predictability, we construct an upper bound on the explanatory power of predictive regressions of currency returns. The bound is motivated by no good-deal restrictions that, in efficient markets, rule out unduly attractive investment opportunities. We find that currency predictability exceeds this bound during recurring albeit short-lived episodes. Excess-predictability is highest in the 1970s and tends to decrease over time, but is still present in the final part of the sample period. Moreover, periods of high and low predictability tend to alternate. These stylized facts pose a challenge to Fama's (1970) Efficient Market Hypothesis but are consistent with Lo's (2004) Adaptive Market Hypothesis, coupled with a slow convergence towards efficient markets.

The empirical analysis draws upon the REGIO panel database over the period 1999-2003. By estimating a Spatial Durbin Model, we find significant spatial effects in explaining regional specialisation in BS. Our findings show that, besides urbanisation economies, the spatial structure of intermediate sectoral linkages and innovation, in particular Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), are important determinants of specialisation in BS. The article contributes to the debate on the global versus local determinants of regional specialisation in BS by restating the importance of the regional sectoral structure besides that of urbanisation.

The tradeoffs between moral and financial preferences are particularly salient in much legal decision-making, especially in the private law context. This paper presents the methods and results of two new behavioral studies designed to elicit evidence for how people factor both monetary and non-monetary incentives in breach of contract. Participants in Study 1 played a Trust game modified to capture key features of a breach decision. Subjects were offered increasing payouts to break the deal they had made with an anonymous partner. 18.6% participants indicated willingness to break a deal for any amount of profit, and over a quarter (27.9%) were unwilling to breach even when offered $24, almost triple the initial payout, with the remaining subjects identifying a break-point somewhere in between. Study 2 used hypothetical scenarios asking subjects to take the perspectives of buyers or sellers and to indicate how much profit or savings an alternate deal would have to offer in order for the subject to breach the original contract, and found a similar curve. The paper concludes with a discussion of how these methods and preliminary findings may be deployed for more fine-grained inquiries into when individuals do and do not choose a financially attractive breach about which they have moral reservations.","Univ Penn, Sch Law, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Wilkinson-Ryan, T (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Sch Law, 3501 Sansom St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",twilkins@law.upenn.edu,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The cluster grew significantly in terms of the number of firms and employment, due to the attraction of trade activities towards the cluster. The productivity of clustered producers fell somewhat, although they maintain an advantage over dispersed firms. This is due to static advantages falling into a producer's lap once located in the area and developing at the level of transacting inputs and output. Clustered producers do not use profits to upgrade businesses but rather invest in real estate. On the whole, they are struggling.

Although one camp argues that emerging economy multinationals are different from their developed country counterparts owing to the underdeveloped institutions in their home countries, another camp counters that they are the same and the existing international business theories can fully explain their strategies. A third camp suggests a more nuanced perspective by finding value in both approaches. In this introductory chapter, we review this debate and offer new perspectives on how to extend existing theories by accounting for four specific aspects of the home country institutional environments of emerging economies: breadth, depth, timing, and duration of exposure to institutional development.

While preservation and restoration have similar end ecological objectives, differences in these conservation types may create systematic variation in willingness to pay (WTP) for their benefits. There has also been conflicting evidence of whether or not the amount, or scope, of conservation influences the demand for environmental improvements in manners consistent with neoclassical economics (greater value for more conservation). To investigate the sensitivity of conservation values to type and scope, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We synthesized 127 data points from 22 primary studies that provided WTP estimates for preservation, forest restoration, and freshwater restoration conducted primarily on public lands. Estimates were derived from choice experiments, contingent rankings, and dichotomous choice contingent valuation studies for conservation programs in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. from 1987 to 2013. We found strong evidence for systematic variation of WTP depending on conservation type and scope. Values for preservation were greater than both forest and freshwater restoration; and freshwater restoration was valued greater than forest restoration. Meta-estimates were found to be sensitive to scope effects, as value increased with conservation intensity but at diminishing marginal rates. We provide quantitative policy analysis in the form of within-sample predictions of mean WTP for each conservation type and scope and conclude with recommendations.

The usage of different terminologies motivates the researchers to look closely at the definitions of these terms. The literature shows that the terms procurement system and procurement contract are commonly interchanged in the construction industry especially in Western countries, whereas the term procurement system is the one widely used by industry players in Malaysia. Despite the various terms used for procurement contract, in most countries, fixed price (FP) procurement contract has been more extensively used in the construction industry compared to cost reimbursement (CR).

This article begins with an examination of the tensions between religion in general and the secular framing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). From a historical perspective, it then delves into the history of the relationship between Muslim political and religious leaders and the UDHR. With that background in mind, the author analyzes the positions of three influential Muslim scholars on human rights: Khaled Abou El Fadl's emphasis on ethics and law; Abdulaziz Sachedina's recent book Islam and the Challenge of Human Rights (2009), in which he urges the traditionalists to develop a public theology; and finally, Abdullahi An-Na'im's focus on shari'a and the secular state. He concludes that the majority of Muslims worldwide remain more conservative than these authors, and yet they overwhelmingly support the notion of human rights. This bodes well for the growing influence of such reformist thinking and, as a result, for the retooling of traditional Islamic jurisprudence in addressing human rights.",,,,,,,,,,,32,5,5,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This research considers the effect of happiness on impulse buying and brand loyalty and examines how brand loyalty affects impulse buying. The regression analysis was used to assess the assumed effects. The assumption of the existence of the relationship between happiness, impulsive buying and brand loyalty was not supported, revealing that this phenomenon still requires further scientific attention. Contrary to the predictions the brand loyalty was positively related to the affective aspect of impulsive buying tendency. This study contributes to the understanding of the reasons for the brand loyalty and impulse buying, where the latter is associated with negative outcomes with respect to the individual.

Unlike a majority of works that have dealt with the subject of trade in the Balkans or the SEEs, not only geographical, economic or political factors are taken into account, but also factors constituting cultural, communicational and historical types of the so-called distance between countries. In order to assess their influence on trade values, an augmented version of the gravity model is employed. It was estimated threefold: as pooled data by OLS, as a random effects model and as a fixed effects model with an additional estimation of time-invariant variables following the method of Cheng and Wall (2005). The results of the research are surprising, as the strongest influence on trade values were exhibited by variables representing ease of a direct communication and similarity of religious structures. In addition, war and one-year-post-war effect showed a strong and statistically important influence. Thus, the main conclusion is that non-economic factors in the region of the Western Balkans play the most important role in determining trade values between countries.","[Trivic, Jelena] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Econ, Banja Luka 78000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Klimczak, Lukasz] Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Krakow, Poland",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL),"Trivic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Banja Luka, Fac Econ, Majke Jugovica 4, Banja Luka 78000, Bosnia & Herceg.",jelena.trivic@efbl.org; lukasz.klimczak@interia.pl,"Trivic, Jelena/JRZ-0822-2023",,National Science Centre of Poland [DEC-2013/11/N/HS4/03642],"National Science Centre of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research project was financed by means of the National Science Centre of Poland (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) granted upon decision number DEC-2013/11/N/HS4/03642.

At the same time the government is pressing ahead with ambitious changes to the rules on sustainability that will affect everyone, particularly in the area of reducing 992 emissions. For many people, the reality of a recession will be a complex inter-relationship between falling property prices, rising costs and the burden of personal debt. In particular, the housing market often acts as an early indicator of the underlying health of the economy it is usually the first area to experience the chill winds of recession and in consequence the green shoots of recovery. The global financial crisis and the resulting economic slowdown may be assumed to have at least the benefit of also reducing environmental degradation in the individual countries. The construction industry must prepare itself now to address the new economic reality and the sustainability imperative. The recovery process maybe slow but the aftermath of the recession is creating many new opportunities driven by a sustainability and green building agenda. Although the amount of green building construction is growing rapidly, the overall volume is still rather small in the context of all residential and non-residential construction.

It is confirmed that culture and economic institutions, especially economic freedom, play a role in economic behaving and development. Since the time of Adam Smith economists have pointed out that the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others and secure property rights are elementary factors for economic progress. Economic theory indicates that economic freedom affects incentives, productive effort, and the effectiveness of resource use. As we can see, economic freedom positively affects economic development, but what about the individual entities within the economy (i.e. sectors of economy). Thus, the main aim of this paper is to find out whether economic freedom promotes corporations' output. Two hypotheses are established for this purpose: (1) economic freedom causes corporations' output; (II) economic freedom positively affects corporations' output The paper mentioned three ways to measure and capture economic freedom: indices economic freedom by the Heritage Foundation, the Fraser Institute and ease of doing business by the World Bank Group, The Fraser Institute's index was employed as a proxy variable of economic freedom; the ratio of gross value added of non-financial corporations to gross value added of total economy was applied as corporations' output. Annual data 2002-2012 within EU-27 countries were used. Panel data analysis and Granger causality test were performed to examine effect of economic freedom and causality. The positive relationship between economic freedom and output of corporations as well as the causality from economic freedom to corporations were confirmed.","[Verner, Tomas; Chudarkova, Silvie] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ & Publ Adm, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Verner, T (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ & Publ Adm, Univ 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",verner@opf.slu.cz; chudarkova@opf.slu.cz,"Verner, Tomas/GRJ-3425-2022",,,,,,15,0,0,1,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,447.0,455,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000046,0

Consumers, then, use for their purchasing decisions noisy information about these attributes obtained from potentially contradictory channels (media, advertisement, NGOs). In this paper we model such informational framework and show the positive relationship between the accuracy of the information transmitted to consumers and corporate social responsibility. We also show that a firm may be tempted to add noise to the information channel (through lobbying of the media), which might reduce the supply of the SR attributes and even harm the firm itself (with lower profits). It might then be profitable to the firm to commit ex ante to not manipulate the information regarding the firm's business practices (e.g., with a partnership with an NGO). Finally, we extend our model to a competition framework endogenizing the number of firms active in the SR segment. We show both that in more transparent markets a larger number of firms will be SR, and that in a market with more intense competition, a higher degree of transparency is required in order to sustain a given number of SR firms.","[Calveras, Aleix] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Cra Valldemossa Km 7, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Ganuza, Juan-Jose] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Pompeu Fabra University,"Calveras, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Cra Valldemossa Km 7, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",aleix.calveras@uib.es; juanjo.ganuza@upf.edu,"Calveras, Aleix/K-9313-2017","Calveras, Aleix/0000-0003-2338-5356","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48496-C4-1-R]; Barcelona GSE Research; government of Catalonia; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO 2011-28965, ECO2014-59225-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE Research; government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government),"We are grateful for comments by the co-editor, two anonymous referees, seminar participants at FEDEA and Universidad de Salamanca, and the conference attendees at the JEI (Madrid) and the EARIE conference (Istambul).

Twelve years of data for 721 issuances of 451 Korean listed firms are analyzed using a panel regression model. We find that at the issuance of bonds with detachable warrants, the change in firm value is strongly correlated with large shareholder ownership concentration and issuance form, and the effect of growth on firm value is strongly correlated with the cash flow condition of the issuing firm. The results indicate that the ownership structure and the cash flow condition of the issuing firm and the form of issuance are important determinants of the relationship between the issuance of bonds with detachable warrants and firm value; these results are applicable to an analysis of the mixed market reactions of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants issues across different countries. They also offer the policy implication that the Korean government's decision to entirely prohibit firms from issuing bonds with detachable warrants may have been excessive.","[Oh, Sekyung] Konkuk Univ, Dept Business Adm, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Kim, Woo Sung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Econ & Business, Global Campus,81 Oedae Ro, Yongin 17035, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Konkuk University; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kim, WS (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Econ & Business, Global Campus,81 Oedae Ro, Yongin 17035, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",skoh@konkuk.ac.kr; ab1212@konkuk.ac.kr,,,Konkuk University,Konkuk University,This paper was supported by Konkuk University in 2013.,,27,1,1,0,8,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The inefficiencies of the economic system led to deteriorating living conditions in the 1980s. During the 6th party congress in December 1986, the communist party decided to reform the economic system, called Doi Moi (renovation). The political elite opted for a gradual change of the economy, without changing the political system. The economic development induced by the reforms was remarkable. The living conditions of the Vietnamese have improved drastically as a consequence of high growth rates. Despite economic and social success since the introduction of reforms, Vietnam has reached now a distinctive moment. The country has to tackle five challenges in order to enhance the future welfare of its citizens. Firstly, macroeconomic stability and especially a functioning financial market is a precondition for future economic growth. Secondly, the successful catch-up model based on cheap labour as well as mineral and agricultural resources is reaching its limitations. Thirdly, a stronger spatial perspective has to be taken into account as the economic development is unevenly distributed and leaving the rural areas behind. Fourthly, environmental issues need to be considered more seriously, especially pollution from intensified agricultural production, mining, and industrialization. Fifthly, due to increasing income disparities, more attention has to be paid to social justice and participation.","[Diez, Javier Revilla] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Diez, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",j.revilladiez@uni-koeln.de,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380",,,,,48,27,27,2,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

I model competition between firms as a Cournot duopoly game where they produce an illegal good and sabotage each other to gain a larger share of the market. I show that socially optimal law enforcement can result in any of the following corner solutions: letting firms produce freely, partially intervene punishing one firm more than the other, or fully intervene to eliminate them both. Which solution is optimal depends on the size of consumption and violence externalities; the direct costs of law enforcement and sabotage; the weight of profits in the welfare function of the authority; and how cautious is the authority avoiding violence externalities while enforcing the law.

Previous studies have concentrated on one aspect of search, shopping at multiple stores. We expand this by examining several strategies used to find low prices, including buying on sale and concentrating purchases at a store with low average prices. Using scanner data from 38 markets, we find that the effect of factors motivating search vary by the type of search strategy considered. We also find evidence that financial savings is not the only motivation for search.

This article fills the current void by presenting evidence on the 1997 New York City Police Department work slowdown, to my knowledge the longest documented police slowdown in U.S. history. Drawing on several, originally collected data sources from the NYPD and other city agencies, the article assesses the impact of the slowdown on ticket enforcement, arrest enforcement, and crime. The findings indicate that, at least in the context of contract-motivated slowdowns where the union may be motivated to garner public support for pay increases, the effects on public safety may be limited. Specifically, in the case of the 1997 slowdown, ticket-writing for all categories of tickets fell dramatically but arrest enforcement for all types of serious crime stayed the same or increased. Accordingly, the crime effects were mostly concentrated in the area of minor criminal disorder (misdemeanors and violations). Only two categories of serious crime (larcenies and assaults) were affected and those crime increases were minimal.","[Chandrasekher, Andrea Cann] UC Davis Sch Law, King Hall,400 Mrak Hall Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Chandrasekher, AC (通讯作者)，UC Davis Sch Law, King Hall,400 Mrak Hall Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",achandrasekher@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,19,6,9,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Plaintiffs and defendants can choose when and to what extent they sink litigation costs through the use of retainers and detailed pleading. I demonstrate sharp asymmetries in the ability of plaintiffs and defendants to use sunk costs strategically to obtain or deter nuisance-value settlements. The model accounts for the roles of the merits, litigation costs, and bargaining power; incorporates complaints and answers for which parties' investments in pleading detail are endogenously determined; permits strategic default by the defendant; and nests several existing models of negative-expected-value litigation as special cases. It generates testable, counterintuitive, empirical predictions, and facilitates normative analysis. For example, the model predicts that plausibility pleading standards will have modest effects in deterring low-merit suits but may be harmful to plaintiffs and defendants settling stronger cases.","[Hubbard, William H.

Such models disconnect transportation from the more comprehensive social goal of enhancing well-being and fail to account for the full stress and time costs that low-income populations may face. To examine the actual, lived experiences of low-income adults, we conducted 52 interviews in two medium-sized metropolitan areas. Results show that low-income travelers have time costs beyond what is modeled, that low-income populations face stressors, like uncertain and unstable transportation, and that the dynamics of ride giving may strain social relations. In conclusion, we argue that placing transportation within the life experiences of low-income adults is critical for understanding how transportation could support or undermine health and well-being.

Results so far stressed contrasting aspects within a common vision for the development of a new generation of buses: although stakeholders are willing to innovate bus fleets by introducing more sustainable propulsion systems, conventional modes are still favoured and the environmental concern is not a driver to export the tested measures.

Several types of fines can be levied on firms that are caught colluding but one common trait is that fines are usually distortive. In this article we focus on the economic effects of distortive fines. To this end, we compare a fine based on the cartel profit as opposed to one based on the cartel damage. We study the effects of the two fines and show that a potential trade-off between ex ante deterrence and ex post consumer surplus may occur. We show that such a trade-off is of particular relevance when antitrust authorities face exogenous fine caps, as it is often the case in practice. The results are robust to a number of extensions, including the relevant case of fines designed to punish managerial firms involved in cartel activities.","[Dargaud, Emilie] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Dargaud, Emilie] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Mantovani, Andrea] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Mantovani, Andrea] IEB, C-JM Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Reggiani, Carlo] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of Bologna; University of Manchester,"Dargaud, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.;Dargaud, E (通讯作者)，GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France.",dargaud@gate.cnrs.fr; a.mantovani@unibo.it; carlo.reggiani@manchester.ac.uk,,"Reggiani, Carlo/0000-0002-5069-3592",,,,,38,5,6,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In addition, it enables the identification of the proximate sources of growth as well as the performance of economic analysis from a comparative perspective of countries at different stages of development. The scientific merit of the paper - the entire group of intangible capital rather than only software will correspond to knowledge based capital.

This paper focuses on the most ambitious regulation directed at the practice: the algorithm-tagging rule in the German High-Frequency Trading Act. Fifteen interviews with stakeholders in the Act's implementation serve to reconstruct how regulators defined an algorithm and help pose the question of to what extent regulatory definitions and data need accurately to represent financial practices to be useful. Although tentative in its findings, the research suggests that the algorithm-tagging rule may be providing valuable signals in the noise to trade surveillance officers and having virtuous effects on the cultures of trading firms. The conclusion argues that sociologists of finance should adopt a more balanced approach when evaluating regulatory technologies and heed MacKenzie's 2005 call to open up their black boxes.","[Coombs, Nathan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LZ, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Coombs, N (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",nathan.coombs@ed.ac.uk,"Coombs, Nathan/JFS-9473-2023","Coombs, Nathan/0000-0002-7319-1181",Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2014-304],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"This research has benefited from presentations and discussions at the workshop series 'Investigating High-Frequency Trading', the first of which was held at Copenhagen Business School, Denmark, in November 2014 and the second at the University of Konstanz, Germany, in June 2015.

A technique for identifying transportation-dis-advantaged populations, intended for use by local practitioners and designed with their skills and professional routines in mind, was piloted in five rural counties in North Carolina. Maps showing areas of elevated theoretical risk of transportation disadvantage were constructed by overlaying layers of readily available, Census-based geospatial data, to generate composite maps where increasing intensity of shading denotes populations with multiple risk factors. The maps were used in key informant interviews with local transportation-relevant professionals to access their expert knowledge, and in focus groups with non-expert residents to probe their travel routines and need to access essential goods, services and activities. These multiple data sources supported an iterative process of initial mapping, stakeholder outreach, revised mapping, and continued discussion. Our findings both corroborated some a priori expectations, and yielded unexpected insights into which residents may experience transportation disadvantage and how they respond. The work demonstrates how local knowledge can be used to identify unique or non-spatial components of transportation disadvantage, and underscores the importance of locally specific knowledge to support planning efforts to identify and ultimately to address transportation disadvantage.

The case study considers a recent Italian law (Section 36 of Law Decree n. 201/2011) which prohibits ID for credit, insurance and financial companies. The ID networks of the top-100 Italian listed companies and of the financial companies in this same list are considered and compared with the analogous networks in the US. The US networks represent a benchmark given that in the US companies act under Section 8 of the Clayton Act that has banned ID since 1914. The effects on the ID networks of the new Italian law are simulated under two different interpretations of the law. If the law will be applied according to a narrow interpretation, the Italian ID network will rest substantially unaltered. However, if the law will be applied according to a broad interpretation, the ID network for financial firms will be completely modified with a network configuration very similar to the American benchmark.","[Baccini, Alberto] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Baccini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",alberto.baccini@unisi.it,"Baccini, Alberto/B-3578-2010","Baccini, Alberto/0000-0003-0293-482X",,,,,47,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Almost a half-century after Hulbert and Beers (1966), the National Transportation Safety Board and others continue to research WWD countermeasures. The recent increase in WWD re-kindled a national discussion in the United States of America, and is bringing about a significant change in the approach to addressing this crash type. The main purpose of this work is to present a policy-oriented framework toward addressing WWDs in a systematic manner and to suggest a systemic discipline for transforming policy objectives to actionable outcomes. To accomplish this goal, the leadership of the Florida Department of Transportation played a pivotal role in converting strategy to reality by promoting organizational linkages and active collaboration. The method included: (a) implementing pilot projects; (b) conducting a statewide study with crash evaluation and field reviews, identifying interchange types, and developing countermeasures; (c) evaluating and deploying experimental devices specifically approved by the Federal Highway Administration; (d) conceptualizing a human factors study; (e) transforming recommendations to design guidance; (t) discussing with planners on interchange types susceptible to WWDs; (g) retrofitting exit ramps with the recommended countermeasures; and (h) leveraging the media to promote awareness and to educate the public about the dangers of driving under the influence. The result of this policy push is that, from an engineering view point, design changes were made; from an education perspective, WWD awareness was prioritized; and from an enforcement angle, the Florida Highway Patrol proactively detects and addresses WWD crashes.

A game theoretic model applies such that firms choose their production technology between two alternatives: flexible versus inflexible production process. Then they decide on the amount of capacity investment: flexible firm makes decision about general and specific components and inflexible firm just about unified component. One stage forward both enter the primary market in which demand is uncertain and play a la Cournot and finally, flexible firm will be able to sell its unsold general components in the secondary market with a deterministic price. Numerical study was employed to observe equilibrium behavior of firms. Findings demonstrate that with symmetric parameterization there is a unique Nash equilibrium in which both firms choose inflexible technology while applying asymmetric parameters has the potential to form two types of equilibrium when both firms choose inflexible technology or only one firm chooses flexible technology. Moreover, it is shown that there is a cost threshold that could shift the equilibria.","[Kashefi, Mohammad Ali] Bielefeld Grad Sch Econ & Management BiGSEM, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",,"Kashefi, MA (通讯作者)，Bielefeld Grad Sch Econ & Management BiGSEM, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",alikashefii@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,4,4,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In the latest years, the trend of completed M&As has risen significantly and is considered to be an important instrument of growth and power of the financial markets. The authors of this article found robust evidence that there is a negative impact of M&As on profitability. The M&As are drivers for credit risk reduction, as they negatively impact the lending growth. The credit risk taking is augmented in the post-merger period if the banks are state owned, have a weak mechanism of internal governance and are a part of banking system that faces supervision quality problems. The post-M&A performance is not affected by the ownership or governance, but is enhanced by a lax supervision framework.","[Asandului, Mircea; Cazan, Sabina Andreea; Capraru, Bogdan] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Ihnatov, Iulian] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B Dul Carol 1 22, Iasi 70050, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Asandului, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania.",mircea.asandului@uaic.ro; sabinacazan@yahoo.com; csb@uaic.ro; iulian.ihnatov@uaic.ro,"Asandului, Mircea/A-2845-2017; Capraru, Bogdan/H-6235-2015","Capraru, Bogdan/0000-0003-4261-5268","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0291]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0291.

In the theoretical part, literature review and various legal forms of enterprise are presented. The secondary data from the Czech Social Enterprise website are used. The sample consists of 219 companies registered in the website's database by 22nd March 2016. We used quantitative approach with descriptive statistics, which describes social enterprises according to their distribution in Czech regions, date of establishment, legal form, activity of social enterprise, and frequency of offering indemnification. Main findings are that perception of social entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic is often narrowed down to issues of employment of handicapped or otherwise disadvantaged people. Most of social enterprises are registered in the capital city of Prague, South Moravia, Olomouc, and Moravia-Silesian region. Distribution of social enterprises in the Czech Republic is uneven and for instance in the Karlovy Vary region, social enterprises represented very poorly. Most social enterprises were founded between the years 2007 and 2013, focusing on business areas like gardening and cleaning services, food production, sales, and provision of accommodation and food services.

By considering a large set of countries over periods starting from 1800, 1820, 1850, 1870, and 1900 and ending in 2010, the robustness of results was addressed. Both tests reveal the scarcity of international evidence of deepness asymmetry, but point to evidence of negative steepness for several countries. In fact, this negative steepness asymmetry supports the view that phases of expansions last longer than the phases of contraction in the business cycle, and this assumption is true for long time spans. Disregarding asymmetric features of economic growth could result in misconstrued economic policies, resulting from crucial failures to predict turning points in the business cycle.","[Fuinhas, Jose Alberto; Marques, Antonio Cardoso; Almeida, Pedro; Nogueira, David; Branco, Tania] Univ Beira Interior, Management & Econ Dept, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Fuinhas, Jose Alberto; Marques, Antonio Cardoso; Almeida, Pedro; Nogueira, David; Branco, Tania] NECE UBI, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Fuinhas, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Management & Econ Dept, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.;Fuinhas, JA (通讯作者)，NECE UBI, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.",fuinhas@ubi.pt; amarques@ubi.pt; pedrocameiralmeida@gmail.com; david90nog@gmail.com; tania.branco80@gmail.com,"Marques, António Cardoso/D-2235-2011; Fuinhas, José Alberto/P-1603-2017","Marques, António Cardoso/0000-0002-9906-3874; Fuinhas, José Alberto/0000-0002-6937-5420","NECE-UBI - Research Unit in Business Science and Economics; FCT - Portuguese Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and Science [UlD/GES/04630/2013]","NECE-UBI - Research Unit in Business Science and Economics; FCT - Portuguese Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and Science","The financial support of the NECE-UBI - Research Unit in Business Science and Economics, sponsored by the FCT - Portuguese Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and Science, project UlD/GES/04630/2013, is acknowledged.",,44,8,8,0,8,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In particular, analyst stock recommendation, country level risk, corporate value and environmental performance are surveyed as determinants of the environmental dissemination level. The survey was based on a sample of 92 multinational firms for the period 2009-2013, longer than that used in most past works. The methodology employed on our data is the panel data analysis with fixed effects. As proxies, for the dissemination level of environmental information, two different environmental disclosure indexes are used the Environmental Disclosure Score and Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. According to our findings, the environmental performance in terms of Emission Reduction Initiatives and the country's risk premium affects in a positive way the dissemination of environmental disclosures while the results regarding the stock analyst recommendation are controversial. Another important finding is that the firm's value is validated as an insignificant factor for the dissemination level of environmental information. The aforementioned results provide the corporate managers with a tool to attract environmental friendly investors. The novelty on the present manuscript stands on the use of proxies for the environmental performance; namely the first one is based on outcome - objective while the second one refers to the corporate intention, elements that enrich the existing literature in the field of environmental behavior and dissemination of the environmental information of a firm.","[Giannarakis, Grigoris] Technol Educ Inst West Macedonia, Dept Business Adm, Grevena 51100, Greece; [Zafeiriou, Eleni] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Agr Dev, 193 Pantazidou Str, Orestiada, Greece; [Sariannidis, Nikolaos; Efthalitsidou, Kyriaki] Technol Educ Inst West Macedonia, Dept Financial Applicat, Kila 50100, Kozani, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Zafeiriou, E (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Agr Dev, 193 Pantazidou Str, Orestiada, Greece.",ggianaris@gmail.com; ezafeir@agro.duth.gr; sarn@hol.gr; efthalitsidou.kiki@hotmail.gr,"ARIAS, ANA/L-9659-2019; Sariannidis, Nikolaos/AAL-1423-2021","Giannarakis, Grigoris/0000-0002-5283-1071; EFTHALITSIDOU, KYRIAKI/0000-0002-7180-6752; Sariannidis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-6950-8801",,,,,55,14,14,4,32,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The chapter focuses on the influence of this concept on its methodology and methods of the economics. This impact is presented here on the example of humanistic economics, which is here understood widely, including approaches developed within particular world religions as: Buddhism, Islam and Christian. The method applied to this research is a content analysis of the most important texts created within the humanistic economics and directions of economics motivated by world religions. To reach this goal, the following steps will be conducted: firstly, the concepts of human nature will be defined and categorized; secondly, the main levels and dimensions of the concept of human nature in the humanistic tradition will be presented, and thirdly the influence of such understanding of the human being on the methodology, methods and main theories within those denominations of economics will be discussed.

The characteristics show that the congestion sources are combined with congestion points and regionalized; the congested points locate in connections between clusters, and transportation supply is insufficient; traffic congestion occurs intensively during the morning and evening peak hours and is in the stage of duration extension. The characteristics indicate that the traffic congestion in the inner-ring urban areas of Chongqing is getting worse with more congested regions and last longer than peak-hour duration. Finally, the ideology on congestion management is proposed briefly in the aspects of urban spatial structure, public transit, traffic-demand management, and travel civilization.","[Huang, Chengfeng] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Western China Transportat Econ Soc Dev Study Ctr, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yin] Dalian Auto Vocat & Tech Coll, Dalian 116031, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuanyuan] ShangHai WSP Consulting LTD, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China; [Shen, Zheng] Jiangsu Transportat Inst, Nanjing 210017, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Chongqing Jiaotong University,"Huang, CF (通讯作者)，Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Western China Transportat Econ Soc Dev Study Ctr, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China.",zhenwushanxia@126.com; 3804941589@163.com; 281388738@qq.com; 673111937@qq.com,"Zhang, Yuanyuan/IVH-3007-2023","Zhang, Yuanyuan/0009-0008-4199-3906",,,,,12,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-981-287-655-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,423.0,438,,10.1007/978-981-287-655-3_54,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE9ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377352200054,0

Unlike previous research, this article analyses the beta and the sigma convergence as well as convergence clubs of two indicators of financial development, i.e. bank credit to GDP ratio, which shows the development of the banking sector, and the ratio of bank credit to stock market capitalization, which indicates the structure of financing. Our model covers all 19 European post-communist countries and 21 well-developed countries over the period of 1995-2014. The authors find evidence for strong beta and sigma convergence. It is also confirmed that the global financial crisis helped reduce the gap. Although the post-communist countries do not constitute one convergence club, some of them feature similarities. This underlines the different speeds of transition of financial systems in these countries.","[Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Malgorzata; Smaga, Pawel] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Witkowski, Bartosz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Iwanicz-Drozdowska, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",miwani@sgh.waw.pl; psmaga@sgh.waw.pl; bwitko@sgh.waw.pl,"Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Malgorzata/AAI-6707-2020; Smaga, Paweł/C-2444-2018","Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-8490-5178; Smaga, Paweł/0000-0003-3913-0833; Witkowski, Bartosz/0000-0003-0940-0265","College of Management and Finance, Warsaw School of Economics [KZIF/S/12/15]","College of Management and Finance, Warsaw School of Economics","This study was funded by College of Management and Finance, Warsaw School of Economics (funding no.

Upgrades in Hyundai's technological capabilities, and in the sophistication of its production system during this period, are described and analysed in relation to a change in corporate governance, monopolised domestic market structure followed by industrial restructuring in the late 1990s, hostile industrial relations and the working of the internal labour market for production engineers. This study concludes that production engineers' skill-formation process is closely related to Hyundai's production system, which is distinct from those of foreign automakers. Its excessive automation utilises flexible production technology, which saves on skills on the shop floor; this is the key factor in Hyundai's considerable growth since the 2000s, given the systematisation and codification of project-based problem-solving capabilities as an engineering skill, and the implementation of a more systematic, performance-based personnel management strategy. The analysis suggests that Hyundai as a litmus test of the post-catch-up question appears to be a mixture of discontinuity and continuity, which is reminiscent of the concepts of 'POST-catch-up' versus 'post-CATCH-UP'.","[Jo, H.

In fact, the implementation of effective risk management processes always involves numerous individual responsibilities and employees, all of whom must make their own contribution within the organization. The respective organization structures play a key role in supporting the risk management processes. Socio-psychological aspects must also be taken into account during the evaluation and assessment of risk portfolios. Indeed, every single hierarchy level, extending from non-managerial employees, through department managers and top management, to supervisory boards, must play a part in order to ensure that risk management within the company succeeds. The risk manager plays a special role in this, whether this is his sole or partial responsibility. Categorized by responsibilities and roles, the letter highlights the extent to which their activities are to be reflected in risk management, the interaction with other roles within the risk management process and how risk management is implemented in the company's organizational structures and strategies. Individual and group-based decision-making processes are accorded just as much attention for the decision making as the influences from the social roles of the members of the process. Particular attention is paid to the leadership qualities of each person in charge. The incentive for all employees to develop their risk awareness, display sensitivity with respect to risks, and relay information relevant to risks can be essentially found in the leadership roles and in the leadership qualities of all managerial positions - from supervisors to top management. To measure the aspects described above, a research design on the empirical study on influences of organizational and group processes on risk management was established. The research design is based upon the comparison of expert and daily practitioner opinions. Ten well-known experts completed the survey Expert Interviews with Structured Survey on the Latent Exogenous Variables and 131 professionals completed Case Study with Structured Survey on the Cause Effect of the Endogenous Variables. The results of these two surveys were analysed. Initial analysis shows, none of the dependent or independent variables may be clearly removed from the model, although there seems to be a substantial discrepancy between the expert opinions and the daily routine of the professionals. Additional statistical analysis will provide further insights into this divergence.","[Mayr, Richard] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Mayr, R (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",mail@richardmayr.de,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,459.0,471,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200039,0

A few national constitutions include so-called debt-brakes that limit deficits and borrowing. Every state has laws that regulate the preparation and presentation of the budget and its review; some of these also seek to control deficits or borrowing. Ordinary laws are, however, susceptible to change by simple amendment or suspension if economic or political objectives seem to require disregard of a previously established standard. Recent experience has shown an increasing use of supranational limits on national deficit and debt, with implementation by the IMF or the EU institutions. It also shows an increase in the use of objective measures (e.g., debt or deficit limits expressed in percentage of GNP) rather than the subjective standard previously used.","[Morrison, Fred L.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Morrison, FL (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",morrison@umn.edu,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2214-6881,,978-3-319-41205-4; 978-3-319-41203-0,IUS COMP,,,2016,20,,,,,,3.0,20,,10.1007/978-3-319-41205-4_1,0.0,,,18,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BI1RQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406787000001,0

In fact, researchers need to consider many factors before choosing an appropriate methodology with the topic or subject to be researched while making the specific research questions as the main drivers. As suggested in the previous literature, there are several areas to be considered in deciding research method, which includes the context of the study or phenomenon, the research goals, the level and nature of research questions, practical reflection and resource availability. On the other hand, in general, many recognize that the researcher's personal philosophy and beliefs have some influences on the adoption of certain research methods. The traditional perspective of research methodology states that there are two general approaches - the quantitative and qualitative research. Conversely, how a researcher conducts research activities may be influenced by the researcher's philosophical stance. The research philosophy provides 'foundations' for the research done in particular scientific specialisms. Previous literature suggests that understanding philosophy helps to refine and specify which research methods to be used to clarify the type of evidence gathered and its source as to answer the research questions; to evaluate different methodologies and methods that could avoid inappropriate use of methods and to be creative and innovative in either selection or adaptation of methods. This article discusses the rationale of choosing an appropriate research approach by discussing the paradigm of interpretivism and positivism, which normally associated with the qualitative and quantitative research approach.","[Noordin, Siti Arpah; Masrek, Mohamad Noorman] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Informat Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Noordin, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Informat Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",siti@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Masrek, Mohamad Noorman/H-3644-2011","Masrek, Mohamad Noorman/0000-0002-2730-5555; noordin, siti arpah/0000-0002-1188-2868","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme; University Technology MARA, Shah Alam","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme; University Technology MARA, Shah Alam","This paper is based on a research which is financially supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme.

A value that seems to be particularly relevant for China is patience: endurance when presented with obstacles, and allowing the project enough time as results in China take time to appear. In terms of the market, it means adapting the product to local habits. Regarding the strategy from headquarters, two factors are most relevant. In the first place, planning the implementation strategy and the kick-off and getting the best assessment one can find to study the market. Secondly, it is very important to consider the Chinese venture as something strategically aligned with the headquarters and the core objectives of the business. China is a complex and competitive market. It is also a vast territory, and it requires a physical presence. To do regular business in China, frequent travelling is not enough: it is necessary to locate to China. All this is certainly difficult to achieve. However, opportunities are still arising and China is today perhaps the most attractive market in the world.","[Perea, Eva] Abat Oliba CEU Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Abat Oliba CEU,"Perea, E (通讯作者)，Abat Oliba CEU Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain.",epeream@uao.es,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,363.0,373,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_28,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900028,0

Audit of public expenditures necessitates an ongoing creation and modification of an effective control system. Such a system is made up by subsystems of a formal (accounting and documentation) and economic control, responsible for monitoring the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of managing public expenditures. Significance of such interconnection rests in the fact that the formal control may signal possible improper management of public expenditures. This may become a stimulus for the economic control subsystem to verify the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of outlaid expenditures. For identification purposes related to potential accounting and record-keeping incorrectnesses in the management of public expenditures is proposed adoption of Benford's Law (Benford's test). Benford's test is applied on municipal expenditure data for the year 2012. Data represent sums of public expenditures in the structure of the statement of budgetary execution and control specified by the Regulation of the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic No. 323/2002 Coll. For the data analysis there were used statistical methods, hypothesis testing, linear regressions and comparisons. Although the empirical analysis points at a limited use of Benford's test in the conditions of municipal expenditures in the Czech Republic (mainly due to the instability of results and unavailability of suitable data), the analysis showed that Benford's test can be adopted as a supporting tool, suitable for building into the control system of public expenditures. It is one of the ways to increase the effectiveness of a complex control of public expenditures.","[Pucek, Milan; Placek, Michal; Ochrana, Frantisek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Social & Econ Strategies, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Pucek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Social & Econ Strategies, Prague, Czech Republic.",milan.pucek@seznam.cz; ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz,"Pucek, Milan Jan/F-3478-2012; Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018",,"Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague [P-17]","Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague","The research is a result of the project P-17 Science of a society, politics and media within challenges of the time by Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague.",,33,3,3,1,7,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We explore who uses ridesourcing and for what reasons, how the ridesourcing market compares to that of traditional taxis, and how ridesourcing impacts the use of public transit and overall vehicle travel. In spring 2014, 380 completed intercept surveys were collected from three ridesourcing hot spots in San Francisco. We compare survey results with matched-pair taxi trip data and results of a previous taxi user survey. We also compare travel times for ridesourcing and taxis with those for public transit The findings indicate that, despite many similarities, taxis and ridesourcing differ in user characteristics, wait times, and trips served. While ridesourcing replaces taxi trips, at least half of ridesourcing trips replaced modes other than taxi, including public transit and driving. Impacts on overall vehicle travel are unclear.

This topic is being discussed and the European Commission, which in 2010 prepared a document entitled Green Paper - Unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries. This document gave impulse to the implementation of many research activities aimed at mapping and promoting the development of cultural and creative industries. Even for universities the theme is very topical, since these are the creators of new ideas, approaches and innovations in the areas of technology, design, as well as creative approaches in dealing with various projects, ie. creative projects. Currently the labor market, characterized by its constant metamorphosis, is becoming a place of conflict of preferred requirements and also claims the employment sphere (ie. commercial and non-commercial entities). One of the tasks of universities is to prepare students for the realities of the labor market with maximum capability to successfully and creatively engage in business cooperation. One of the many forms of student training is participation in the implementation of real projects. The aim of this study is to identify problematic factors in the implementation of the so-called creative projects at the Faculty of Arts in the Czech Republic. To identify problem areas of creative projects a qualitative research method was used in a form of individual interviews with people who work in projects as head of project teams. The results of the study can help identify the most common problem areas and also to draft preventive measures in dealing with creative projects.","[Soukalova, Radomila] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Soukalova, R (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic.",soukalova@fmk.utb.cz,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,4034.0,4042,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700405,0

Based on the analysis of in-depth interviews with 40 chefs-de-cuisine, we identify tensions at two distinct levels of analysis. The first tension, situated at the individual level, occurs between the artistic identity of the chefs-de-cuisine and their work identity; the second one, at the organizational level, arises because creativity and implementation are equally important for the organizational success, thus making it impossible to disentangle chefs' contribution from that of the kitchen brigade. Case evidence shows that effective tactics for managing these tensions simultaneously emphasize distinctions and create synergies between the contradictory elements of each tension. Moreover, our cross-national sample allows us to show how differences at the national institutional level affect the management of tensions and thus shed light on the mechanisms through which institutional environments affect innovation. These insights contribute to existing research in creativity and innovation.","[Lane, Christel] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Lup, Daniela] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Cambridge; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lup, D (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Management, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.lup@lse.ac.uk,"Lup, Daniela/IAP-6312-2023; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012",,,,,,61,12,14,1,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Our model assuming the linearity between two mortality sequences with a time lag each other does not need to formulate the time trends of mortality rates across ages for mortality prediction. Moreover, the parameters of our model for a given age depend on the mortality rates for that age only. Therefore, whether the span of the study ages with the age included is widened or shortened will not affect the results of mortality fitting and forecasting for that age. In the empirical testing, the regression results using the mortality data for the UK, USA and Japan show a satisfactory goodness of fit, which convinces us of the appropriateness of the linear assumption. Empirical illustrations further show that our model's performances of fitting and forecasting mortality rates are quite satisfactory compared with the existing well-known mortality models.

The purpose of this paper is to enhance the insights into pricing mechanism for subway and parking and corresponding mode choice behavior on the corridor with elastic demand. A nested logit-based stochastic user equilibrium model is proposed to characterize the commuters' modal choice. Dispersion parameters in the nested logit model reflect the risk or uncertainty of mode choice. It is found by sensitivity analysis that the impacts of subway fare and parking fee on the commute pattern are not always monotonous. Optimal strategies of subway fare and parking fee are discussed, respectively, under four market schemes by assuming that the subway and the parking lot at workplace are operated by either the government or a private owner. A numerical example is presented to illustrate how the pricing policies affect demand implementation, mode choice behavior and benefits of private owners and the whole transportation system.

There is a large amount of literature on which policies could reduce car use and improve the environmental and social sustainability of commuting to college. However, most studies focus, to the best of our knowledge, only on the effectiveness of such policies, disregarding their social efficiency, measured as the difference between the social costs and benefits. This paper presents an estimate of the effectiveness and the efficiency of nine hypothetical transport policies regarding the University of Trieste, Italy, on the basis of a transport demand model estimated via revealed and stated choice data. All policies but one are effective in reducing car use, but only six of them appear to be efficient. We find that fully subsidizing bus fares would be the most effective and efficient policy. However, it is doubtful whether fully subsidizing bus fares is financially sustainable. The second best policy would be a mix of bus subsidies and parking restrictions. In case of the University of Trieste, our model suggests the adoption of a policy mix based on a relatively low hourly parking tariff ((sic)0.3 per hour) and the use of the parking revenues to subsidize the bus users. The methodology and the results presented in this paper can be used by the college Mobility Managers to design better transport policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After charting the rise of behavioural economics and discussing the key conceptual building blocks of the emerging behavioural mainstream in economics, the paper turns to the marketization of anti-poverty policy in the global South. Based on an analysis of policy documents, project reports and academic interventions, it is argued that the behavioural approach to poverty shifts the focus from the market to the market subject and engages in often thinly veiled attempts at behavioural engineering.

Indicators of economic activity, including the employment rate and CO2 emissions per capita as well as population density, are positively associated with improvements in traffic safety.","[Nghiem, Son] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Connelly, Luke B.] Univ Queensland, Fac Hlth & Behav Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Queensland,"Nghiem, S (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",son.nghiem@qut.edu.au; l.connelly@uq.edu.au,"Connelly, Luke B/F-6578-2010",,,,,,42,3,3,0,6,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

The impact of this neglect is huge: about half of the annual carbon credits from the projects registered by 2010 are from the on-grid electricity displacement projects, and the majority of them had concentrated in several countries where electricity shortage remains severe and lasting. In the context of widespread energy shortage, the extra electricity produced by the CDM projects is more likely to be used to provide extra electricity supply rather than substitute the Business-as-usual (BAU) electricity supply. Hence, the neglect of the wide-spread energy shortage in the CDM methods puts the integrity of a critical amount of the CDM carbon credit in question.","[Zhu, Jinshan] IEL, Int Programme Inst Econ & Law, I-10024 Turin, Italy; [Zhu, Jinshan] Ithaca Coll, Sch Law, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Tang, Yingkai] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Tang, YK (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, SKJC 201007,Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",jz395@cornell.edu; tang@scu.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The study is unique in its focus on understanding opportunity recognition behaviours and motivators of employees and how these perceptions may influence corporate entrepreneurial activity. The study is conducted in an under-researched emerging market context, where 187 respondents were surveyed in the financial sector industry. The empirical findings indicate that employees perceive themselves as having high levels of opportunity recognition behaviours and motivators which are positively associated with willingness to engage in corporate entrepreneurial initiatives. The results further show that there is a significant positive relationship between opportunity recognition behaviours and the frequency of opportunities recognised. Implications highlight the importance of fostering opportunity recognition behaviours within an organisation and motivating employees to act innovatively.","[Urban, Boris; Wood, Eric] Univ Witwatersrand, Grad Sch Business, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Grad Sch Business, 2 Davids St Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa.",boris.urban@wits.ac.za; ericwood@wits.ac.za,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,61,18,21,2,74,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The model shows that the probability of retirement depends on a set of personal, contextual, and political variables. It provides a rigorous theory for the effect of extant variables, and identifies variables that have not previously been fully appreciated. In particular, it shows the impact of the ideologies of the non-retiring justices and whether the ideology of the retiring justice is moderate or extreme.

Unlike other studies in the same sense, which evaluate original series for each stock, we evaluate synthetic series created on the basis of linear models of stocks. Following the approach of Burgess (Computational Finance, 1999; 99, 297-312), we use the stepwise regression' model for the formation of models of each stock. We then use the variance ratio profile together with a Monte Carlo simulation for the selection of models with potential predictability using data from 1 April 1999 to 30 December 2003. Unlike the approach of Burgess, we carry out White's Reality Check (Econometrica, 2000; 68, 1097-1126) in order to verify the existence of positive returns for the period outside the sample from 2 January 2004 to 28 August 2007. We use the strategies proposed by Sullivan, Timmermann and White (Journal of Finance, 1999; 54, 1647-1691) and Hsu and Kuan (Journal of Financial Econometrics, 2005; 3, 606-628) amounting to 26,410 simulated strategies.

In England such items are widely promoted in safety campaigns and in broader cycling publicity, particularly for children. However, the impact of this approach on cycling safety and cycling uptake is unclear and contested. This article uses a combined analysis of three sets of qualitative interview data to explore talk about cycle helmets and high-visibility clothing. A thematic analysis involved coding all references to such safety clothing, and within that coding meanings, experiences, interactions, and links to other safety equipment. Reported use of safety clothing was strongly associated with perceived threat from motor vehicles, but accompanied by scepticism about effectiveness. Many interviewees felt and/or exerted social pressure to wear a helmet, and, to a lesser extent, high-visibility clothing. Analysis identified a widespread dislike of safety clothing, sometimes linked to talk about cycling less because of the perceived need to wear such clothing. We found evidence of resistance to social pressure, expressed by complaining about inconvenience, discomfort (helmets), and personal appearance. More interdisciplinary research is needed to explore the complex relationships between cycling safety, the promotion of safety clothing, and cycling uptake. However, our findings suggest that policy-makers and practitioners should carefully consider how promoting safety clothing might impact cycling uptake and experiences. Policy goals of increasing cycling and making it more 'normal' and subjectively safer might imply reducing or even avoiding the use of such accessories in everyday utility cycling contexts, and relying on alternative strategies to improve cycling safety.

Due to societal change, climate change and the ageing of assets, the conditions influencing the effective functioning of these systems seem to be changing. These changing conditions require measures to renew, adapt or renovate these waterway systems. However, measures with the sole aim of improving navigation conditions have encountered resistance, as the general public, and stakeholders in particular, value these waters in many more ways than navigation alone. Therefore, a more inclusive, integrated approach is required, rather than a sectoral one. Addressing these contemporary challenges requires a shift in the traditional waterway authorities' regimes. The aim of this study is to identify elements in the institutional setting where obstacles and opportunities for a more inclusive approach can be found. Two major waterway systems, the American and the Dutch, have been analyzed using the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to reveal those obstacles and opportunities. The results show that horizontal coordination and a low pay-off for an inclusive approach is particularly problematic. The American case also reveals a promising aspect - mandatory local co-funding for federal navigation projects acts as a stimulus for broad stakeholder involvement. Improving horizontal coordination and seizing opportunities for multifunctional development can open pathways to optimize the value of waterway systems for society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering their significance to growing inequality and financial instability, renewed media and public attention is well justified, and new research on these topics urgent. At the same time, however, there is confusion in the very use of the term offshore finance. Some apply it interchangeably with tax havens; others go as far as to use it as a synonym of international finance. We argue that offshore finance needs a precise definition and careful positioning in a broader economic geographical framework. We suggest a definition based on the legal and accounting, in addition to financial, aspects of offshore finance, and we propose the concept of global financial networks to situate offshore jurisdictions and offshore finance in the firm-territory nexus and in relation to global production networks. This sets the stage for the three research articles presented in this issue, which map offshore financial networks at global and regional scales, and investigate their causes and mechanisms.","[Clark, Gordon L.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Lai, Karen P.

Unsurprisingly then, there is little agreement about which jurisdictions ought to be considered as tax havensor which policy measures would result in their not being so considered. In this article we explore and make operational an alternative concept, that of a secrecy jurisdiction and present the findings of the resulting Financial Secrecy Index (FSI). The FSI ranks countries and jurisdictions according to their contribution to opacity in global financial flows, revealing a quite different geography of financial secrecy from the image of small island tax havens that may still dominate popular perceptions and some of the literature on offshore finance. Some major (secrecy-supplying) economies now come into focus. Instead of a binary division between tax havens and others, the results show a secrecy spectrum, on which all jurisdictions can be situated, and that adjustment for the scale of business is necessary in order to compare impact propensity. This approach has the potential to support more precise and granular research findings and policy recommendations.","[Cobham, Alex; Meinzer, Markus] Tax Justice Network, Chesham HP5 2JG, Bucks, England; [Jansky, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Cobham, A (通讯作者)，Tax Justice Network, 38 Stanley Ave, Chesham HP5 2JG, Bucks, England.",alex@taxjustice.net; jansky.peta@gmail.com; markus@taxjustice.net,"Meinzer, Markus/AAP-6560-2020; Cobham, Alex/AAN-8201-2020; Jansky, Petr/H-4782-2014","Meinzer, Markus/0000-0003-4255-213X; Cobham, Alex/0000-0002-7242-4115; Jansky, Petr/0000-0001-6499-9923",,,,,106,63,67,1,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

To date, there has been limited systematic research on the global structure of these networks. Here we address this gap by employing principal component analysis to decompose the global bilateral FDI anomaly matrix into its primary constituent subnetworks. We find that the global offshore FDI network is highly globalized, with a centralized core of jurisdictions in Northwest Europe and the Caribbean exercising a largely homogenous worldwide influence. To the extent that the network is internally differentiated, this appears to primarily reflect a historic layering of social and political relationships. We identify four primary offshore FDI subnetworks, bearing the imprint of four key processes and events: European, particularly UK colonialism, the post-WWII hegemonic alliance between the United States and Western Europe, the fall of Soviet communism, and the rise of Chinese capitalism. We also find evidence of qualitative, but not quantitative, variation in offshore FDI based on national rule of law and communist history.","[Haberly, Daniel] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, St Peters Coll, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Haberly, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",d.haberly@sussex.ac.uk; dariusz.wojcik@spc.ox.ac.uk,,"Wojcik, Dariusz/0000-0003-2158-284X",Leverhulme Trust [RGS-359]; Hong Kong Research Grant Council [T31-717/12/R],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Hong Kong Research Grant Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"An earlier version of this article was presented by the authors at the 2013 Deconstructing Offshore Finance Seminar at Oxford.

Place branding has become one of the central concepts for promoting local competitiveness and for capturing significant mind and market share. It is a promotional strategy that includes all activities that increase the attractiveness of an area as a place for working, living and spending free time. Place branding involves the development of a place brand, which entails selecting place-specific attributes and values to represent the place. A vast number of different actors contribute to the creation of the regional brand and the way it will be developed and communicated. This paper focuses on place branding at the regional level and investigates the selections that are made by the regional actors involved in two regional branding projects in Flanders.

As a result of regulation and firms' efforts to innovate, the maritime sector has introduced new technologies and practices such as slow steaming which have contributed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. The impact of technological and operational developments on global GHG emissions is difficult to assess, however, without empirical evidence. So far such evidence has been only partially available and most of the data sources used in the literature have been compiled for different purposes or are based on single firm case studies. This paper reports the results of an analysis of a fuel consumption database compiled by the BSR Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) with the specific purpose of benchmarking and collecting emission data and comprising 2,300 container ship voyages (reporting year 2013, data for 2012). This analysis has examined the effect of technical and operational parameters on these vessels' fuel consumption and emissions and is the first to be performed on the dataset and in general on self-reported data across multiple companies. In 2012, carriers in the CCWG accounted for approximately 65% of total world deep-sea container traffic. The paper outlines an econometric model that regresses carbon emissions from container shipping on particular trade routes against a range of independent variables, such as vessel age, size and average speed. The paper results indicate that significant differences exist among carriers both in terms of energy efficiency and carbon intensity. The analysis also suggests that while the emission profiles of some trade routes have remained relatively stable in recent years, others have witnessed an increase in emissions mainly as a result of a concentration of container flows. By improving our understanding of the determinants of carbon emissions from container shipping, this research should help shipping lines develop carbon-reduction plans and governments to devise appropriate policies to incentivise the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.","[Acciaro, Michele] KLU, Dept Logist, D-201457 Hamburg, Germany; [McKinnon, Alan C.] KLU, Dept Logist, D-201457 Hamburg, Germany",Kuhne Logistics University; Kuhne Logistics University,"Acciaro, M (通讯作者)，KLU, Dept Logist, Grosser Grasbrook 17, D-201457 Hamburg, Germany.",Michele.Acciaro@the-klu.org; Alan.McKinnon@the-klu.org,"McKinnon, Alan/R-6846-2019; Acciaro, Michele/J-7669-2018","Acciaro, Michele/0000-0003-0144-3033; McKinnon, Alan/0000-0002-6480-7984",,,,,42,5,5,6,61,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Our simulation was based on regression estimates of the effects of hospital ownership of physicians on hospital and physician prices and spending on hospital, physician, and all health services (including prescription drugs and outpatient diagnostic tests). Although the simulation does not evaluate a transaction that actually occurred in the real world, it illustrates whether and under what circumstances a stylized merger would have important effects on markets for health care. We found that such mergers can lead to statistically significant and economically meaningful increases in prices and spending. We also show that these mergers can affect patients differently depending on their local hospital market conditions.

Finally, a second-stage nonparametric analysis is applied identifying the effect of seaports' size on their productivity levels. The results reveal that the number of terminals is a crucial determinant of seaports' productivity levels.

We first survey the economic history of professional sport leagues in North America and develop stylized facts about rival league formation. We then develop a game-theoretical model to explain some of these interesting stylized facts, showing that if the bargaining power of the incumbent league is sufficiently small-i.e., less than a certain cutoff-the incumbent should choose expansion to deter the rival league formation; otherwise, it is optimal for the incumbent league to allow a rival league formation and then merge with it, conditional on rival league success. We further show that the incumbent league may pay players relatively high salaries as an alternative way to deter formation by a rival league.","[Che, XiaoGang] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Humphreys, Brad R.] W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",Durham University; West Virginia University,"Humphreys, BR (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",xiaogang.che@durham.ac.uk; brad.humphreys@mail.wvu.edu,"Humphreys, Brad R/P-3340-2019","Humphreys, Brad R/0000-0003-0099-7237; Che, Xiaogang/0000-0002-8236-8313",,,,,19,7,7,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

If an employer and worker cannot contract on the output and profits of the worker's prospective new firm, at the beginning of their relationship the employer induces the worker to sign a contract that prohibits him from competing or soliciting the current client in the event of termination of employment. The socially optimal level of entrepreneurship will nevertheless be achieved if clients, employers, and workers can renegotiate these restrictive employment contracts and make compensating transfers. If workers cannot finance transfers to employers, however, employers and workers will sign contracts that are too restrictive and produce too little entrepreneurship, and governments can increase welfare by limiting enforcement of these contracts.

The initial investment combined with the business partner's threat to terminate the contract before it expires can generate a bonding mechanism that precludes the producer from behaving opportunistically. I test this view using franchise contract data and a natural experiment. In practice, the franchisor (business partner) determines how much a franchisee (producer) needs to invest up-front. I show that franchisors affected by the passing of a law that restricts their ability to terminate misbehaving franchisees ask their franchisees for higher up-front investments. This result is particularly large for small franchise systems, as franchisees' investments are less redeployable in case of contract termination. The data suggest that contractual up-front investments can be used to sustain business relations","Univ Los Andes, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de los Andes - Chile,"Sertsios, G (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Sch Business & Econ, Monsenor Alvaro del Portillo 12-455, Santiago, Chile.",gsertsios@uandes.cl,,"Sertsios, Giorgo/0000-0002-3143-1538",,,,,23,7,8,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

ICT based education and socioeconomic development programs provide innovative solutions to defeat poverty. Poverty is the worst dilemma of modern society, which is hard to be described and can only be felt well by the sufferer. Poverty accompanied with the illiteracy is a big challenge for the world peace and stability and possibly one of the major contributors in nurturing terrorism and instability. However, education is the primary driver in alleviating poverty and is linked directly with stability, growth and development of the country. Educated people get better jobs and vision to transform their lives, and they are as well more capable to positively contribute to the society. This research investigates the role of ICT in promoting education and eradicating poverty in the form of socio-economic development programs. The authors of this article focus on issues in forming ICT based educational and socio development initiatives, which can maximize the inclusion of the poor in the mainstream system and make them capable to change their destiny.","[Aftab, Muhammad; Ismail, Izlin] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Aftab, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",maftab@siswa.um.edu.my; izlin@um.edu.my,"Ismail, Izlin/B-8678-2010; KHAN, MUHAMMAD ZIA AFTAB/AAD-2172-2019; Aftab, Muhammad/ACZ-3714-2022","Ismail, Izlin/0000-0003-4805-4502; KHAN, MUHAMMAD ZIA AFTAB/0000-0003-2926-3229; Aftab, Muhammad/0000-0003-1013-4849; Aftab, Muhammad/0000-0003-4164-4147",,,,,48,4,4,4,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

To achieve this, relevant agencies were identified, visited and interviews were conducted. It was found that individual properties are handles by several agencies namely Land Office, PNB, Lembaga Tabung Haji, Financial Institutions, EPF and others. Each agency has their own system which can be accessed only by them alone using their network. To inquire about property related information, interested party has to visit each of the aforementioned agencies with the supporting document, as required by the agencies. This takes longer time and cost money. It was also found that the procedures for requesting the said information are not standard, data is not updated, confidential, and cannot be shared. Several applications are needed and various system key IDs are used. The property information was scattered; there is no centralize database implemented to store all the property information and there exists no special dedicated system that access all relevant information from various agencies simultaneously.

The regulation previously only permitted a 20 per cent allocation. Establishing the optimal foreign allocation for South African portfolio managers given the 25 per cent upper bound is an important consideration for strategic portfolio planning. In this paper we consider two methodological approaches to establish a strategic foreign allocation weight. Our first approach considers the strategic role of foreign investment in South African global balanced portfolios by using a mean-variance efficient frontier framework over a long-term period. We also implement a second assessment methodology that utilises a non-parametric procedure. Both the mean-variance and the non-parametric methodology yield compelling evidence for the foreign allocation to be set at the maximum allowable bound of 25 per cent.,"[Bradfield, David John] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Munro, Brian] Cadiz Asset Management, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Bradfield, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",,,,University of Cape Town's Research Committee (URC),University of Cape Town's Research Committee (URC),This publication is based on research that has been supported in part by the University of Cape Town's Research Committee (URC).,,41,1,1,1,6,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Finding this link has become central to all executive remuneration issues. The results of the studies linking CEO remuneration to company performance are varied and inconclusive, particularly in South Africa. The reason for this is that previous studies have not looked at whether the company performance measures chosen have definite relationships with CEO remuneration in each industry. This study investigated eleven financial indicators of company performance to determine which of them have significant and positive relationships to CEO remuneration in different industries in South Africa. 254 South African listed companies, spread over 5 industries, were analysed for the period 2008 to 2012 using panel data analysis and statistical tests. The results were conclusive, finding performance metrics that had a positive and significant relationship to CEO remuneration in 4 of the 5 industries investigated, as well as over the aggregate of all the industries.","[Bussin, Mark] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Ind Psychol & People Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Blair, Chris] Univ Cumbria, Sch Business Adm, Cumbria, SC, Brazil",University of Johannesburg,"Bussin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Ind Psychol & People Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Bussin, Mark/ISV-0895-2023","Bussin, Mark/0000-0002-2010-2173",,,,,57,11,14,0,7,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Sanandaj city, in the west of Iran, with a population of about 400 thousand people, with a rapid population growth during the last 3 decades, is chosen as a study case. The increase in population, that was due to the rural migration, has led to a shortage of residential units and most of the answers to the lack of housing have been found in informal settlements and nonformal land. In this study, the satisfaction level in both informal and planned attitude areas is analysed from the perspective of the residents.

According to international experience, there are mainly 4 models for banking-insurance cooperation, including distribution agreements, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and financial group. While distribution agreements are widely used between most banks and insurers, the joint venture model and financial group model symbolize a more mature relationship between the two types of financial institutions. Bank-related insurance company in China is still in its infancy. On November 26, 2009, the CBRC issued a regulation allowing commercial banks to make equity investment on insurance companies, which was previously banned. Since then, the Chinese insurance industry has witnessed a significant growth in bank participation. According to corporate finance theory, equity investment will affect a firm's performance through several channels. Specifically, the bank-related insurance companies are expected to have better performance due to the enhanced solvency, reduced agency costs, and improved corporate governance. Our paper aims to provide empirical evidence to the theory. We first analyze the factors affecting the performance of the bank-related insurance companies. Then, using a panel date of Chinese banks and life insurers from 2005-2013, we examine the impact of bank participation on insurer's performance by both univariate and multivariate analysis. Finally, we identify several critical issues in the ongoing development of bancassurance based on our data analysis and provide some valuable suggestions for the bank-related companies and regulators.","[Feng Zhijian; Dong Bo] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Feng, ZJ (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Room 315,Bldg 11,220 Handan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhijianfeng@fudan.edu.cn; 11307100061@fudan.edu.cn,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,49.0,65,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700002,0

While the repeatedly found regularity between service employment and economic growth seems in favour of the model, this paper demonstrates its conceptual and empirical limits. Theoretically, it deploys the approach of the production system to replace an understanding of separate and independent sectors by a perspective of interdependent roles of divided labor. Methodologically, we borrow the distinction of four functional roles production, circulation, distribution and regulation and improve existing methodologies to assign these roles to regional economies. We use both models to capture the regional economic change over a period of fifteen years in Southern Germany. Although the evidence seems to confirm the three-sector model, the comparative approach conveys its falsity in understanding economic growth: Regional value creation is not a function of services per se but of the interplay between manufacturing and business services (circulation). The observations that regions with lopsided service growth in distribution fall behind regional growth, and that even rural regions pertaining to strong specializations in manufacturing run ahead of economic growth, are clearly incongruous with the three-sector model. We conclude that the production system concept is a theoretically richer and empirically more valid approach to understand regional development as duality of production and circulation rather than dualism of manufacturing and services.","[Glueckler, Johannes; Schmidt, Anna Mateja; Wuttke, Christian] Heidelberg Univ, Geog Inst, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Glückler, J (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Geog Inst, Berliner St 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",he6@ad.uni-heidelberg.de; amschmidt@uni-hd.de; c5d@ad.uni-heidelberg.de,"Glückler, Johannes/K-3807-2018","Gluckler, Johannes/0000-0002-2507-1556",,,,,54,0,0,1,13,BUCHENVERLAG,BAD SODEN,"POSTFACH 1128, BAD SODEN, 65796, GERMANY",0044-3751,,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Transparency means providing the public with information about their government's activities, Participation emphasizes citizens voices in public affairs, recognizing that public officials stand to benefit from the perspective of expert and non-expert knowledge that resides outside of government. Collaboration further erodes the us-versus-them divide between citizens and government by taking participation to another level Where government is collaborative, citizens become true partners with government, in both the identification and pursuit of public goals. Governments are increasingly making their data available online in standard formats and under licenses that permit the free re-use of data. The justifications advanced for this include claims regarding the potential for open government data to promote transparency and accountability of government, the role of open government data in supporting the reform and reshaping of public services and the economic potential of open government data. This article demonstrated that mainly targeted government policies and the strong and powerful role of government in the process of opening up public data are critical for real progress to be made.","[Laboutkova, Sarka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Laboutková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",sarka.laboutkova@tul.cz,"Laboutkova, Sarka/AAI-1256-2019","Laboutkova, Sarka/0000-0001-7108-2144",,,,,18,1,1,0,21,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,78.0,88,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000008,0

The task of integrating and reconciling these impacts poses challenges, because they are incommensurable, and they affect different groups differentially. Further, impacts such as those related to social equity are hard to define and measure. In this paper we address two inter-related questions: How is social equity conceptualized, operationalized, and prioritized relative to environmental and other objectives; and how might social equity be more effectively integrated in urban transportation plans in North America? We critically analyze how social equity is incorporated into transportation plans in 18 large North American metropolitan areas, in terms of the quality of the related objectives, how meaningfully their achievement is assessed through the choice of performance measures or indicators, and their prioritization relative to other objectives. We observe that social equity goals and objectives are in many cases not translated into clearly specified objectives, and appropriate measures for assessing their achievement in a meaningful, disaggregated manner are often lacking. At the same time, there are good examples of social equity objectives and measures in several plans.

In case of workers, authors use data of the PIAAC (Programme for International Assessment of Adult, first round, 2008 - 2013) to show effects of overeducation, with focus on the Czech Republic. Methodological approach of the paper is based on regression using a classic ORU model including variables of education, earnings, age, gender, economic sector of the company and job satisfaction. In the case of workers we analyse their earnings and returns to their education, with aim to find economic losses caused by overeducation and undereducation for employees. Results of our research show that returns to years of overeducation are lower than returns to required education; it means that overeducated workers get higher wages than their co-workers but lower wages than workers with the same education working in jobs requiring this level of education Similarly, workers with lower than required education (undereducated) have lower wages than their colleagues with required education but receive more than workers with the same level of education who work in jobs that require that level of education Moreover, satisfaction of employees with their job is negatively influenced by their overeducation and we can conclude that overeducated workers have negative impact on firm productivity. Therefore on the firm level we include a factor of satisfaction into the ORU model to analyse its indirect impact on productivity of a firm. In the paper there is indicated satisfaction of overeducated workers from PIAAC data in the Czech Republic and thus showed some effects on the productivity of the firm.","[Marsikova, Katerina; Urbanek, Vaclav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Marsíková, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",katerina.marsikova@tul.cz; vaclav.urbanek@tul.cz,"Urbánek, Václav/M-9836-2017",,,,,,15,0,0,0,11,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,315.0,322,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000032,0

A hypothesis is tested that access to good markets motivates collectors to harvest and market gum arabic. Analyses of the choice of participation in group marketing, sale price, quantity of gum collected and the final choice of market outlet are done. Decision outcomes include fixed transaction costs at the collection stage and proportional costs at the marketing stage. Original data from 348 gum collectors in the Sylvopastoral zone and Eastern region of Senegal were used. Results confirm the stated hypothesis; indeed the marketing context and outcome play a big role in collection systems of gum arabic in Senegal. The costs incurred in finding the good market can be regarded as an investment, whereby the collector may continue to transact with the same trading partner (and hence in the same market). The need for infrastructural development, strengthening groups and market expansion are emphasised as key policy interventions. (C) 2015 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden.

The latter of these further depend on the accuracy of forecasts for the expected travel demand in both the do-something and do-nothing alternatives, in order to assess the impact of implementing new projects compared to doing nothing or postponing the decision. Previous research on the accuracy of travel demand forecasts has focused exclusively on the do-something alternatives, where inaccuracies have been revealed in the form of large imprecision as well as systematic biases. However, little or no attention has been given to the accuracy of demand forecasts for the do-nothing alternatives, which are equally important for impact appraisals. This paper presents the first ex-post evaluation of demand forecast accuracy for do-nothing alternatives, based on an empirical study of 35 road projects in Denmark and England. The results show a tendency for systematic overestimation of travel demand in the do-nothing alternatives, which is in contrast to the systematic underestimation of travel demand observed in previous studies of do-something alternatives. The main implication for planning practice is that the severity of future congestion problems is systematically overestimated. As a consequence, impact appraisals of road construction as a means of congestion relief appear overly beneficial. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Life expectancy is rising almost in all European countries, mortality rates are falling in many countries. It is clear that the group of older people in these countries is under focus of politicians with the aim to prepare active and healthy ageing for seniors. The Active Ageing Index (AAI) evidence is an inspiration for policy makers and public to understand the need for a change and its benefits for all. It can influence implementation of senior friendly policies, increase the quality of life and moreover also financial and social sustainability of European welfare systems. Scientific aim: The aim of this paper is to analyse the Active Ageing Index and the position of the Czech Republic among EU countries. Moreover, the National Action Plan for Positive Ageing for the Period 2013-2017 is introduced and compared with AAI to show the common areas of interest. Methodology/methods: To fulfil the aim of the study a detail analysis of the position of the Czech Republic among European countries in four distinct domains of AAI which are Employment; Participation in Society; Independent, Healthy and Secure Living; Capacity and Enabling Environment for Active Ageing was provided. Then the comparison of domains of AAI and National Action Plan for Positive Ageing for the Period 2013-2017 was applied. Findings: Based on the findings of our research, it is apparent that there are four areas in National Action Plan for Positive Ageing for the Period 2013-2017 in addition to the AAI: 1. Ensure implementation of the measures of the policy for the preparation for ageing. 2. To create sufficient offer of preventive programmes in community and society with the stress on holistic approach, 3. Make available international experience and international projects cooperation for seniors. 4. Well informed public about pension reform and possibility to combine work and pension support. Conclusions (limits, implications etc.): Based on the findings of our research, the authors of the paper are strongly supporting a broadly setting of indicators with respect to the specific situation in the Czech Republic as well as to the indicators defined in AAI which would enable to adjust the evaluation of positive ageing in the Czech Republic according the EU standards.","[Rasticova, Martina; Birciakova, Nad'a; Pavlikova, Eva Abramuszkinova; Antosova, Veronika; Kubickova, Lea] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Management, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Rasticová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Management, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",martina.rasticova@mendelu.cz; nada.birciakova@mendelu.cz; eva.pavlikova@mendelu.cz; veronika.antosova@mendelu.cz,"Abramuszkinová, Eva/A-2840-2011; Hazuchova, Nada/V-6354-2018; Rašticová, Martina/AAB-9977-2022; Abramuszkinová, Eva/AAM-7636-2020; Antošová, Veronika/HOF-4306-2023; Rasticova, Martina/L-9230-2015; Kubickova, Lea/U-3322-2017","Abramuszkinová, Eva/0000-0003-3267-2752; Rašticová, Martina/0000-0001-9322-0763; Abramuszkinová, Eva/0000-0003-3267-2752; Antosova, Veronika/0009-0000-0109-828X; Kubickova, Lea/0000-0002-4154-1802",,,,,8,1,1,0,22,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,4192.0,4202,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700429,0

We will also examine the reverse relation, i.e. how the rate of use of external finance sources affects the return on equity. The research is performed at two levels. In the first level, the data are mutually compared on the basis of average values of ratio indicators in individual countries. From the methodological view, there are mainly two commonly-used ratio indicators used. The use of return on equity as well as debt/equity ratio comes from studies which are listed below in the text. The other level of research is focused on data of concrete companies, which is the basis for panel data regression processing. The attention is paid to the area of building. From this business branch, there were gained data for individual companies in categories: very large, large, and middle-sized companies from the Amadeus database. From the view of the studied topic, the text will be focused on the dynamic theory of the capital structure - the pecking order theory. The reason for using just this theory is the fact that measurability of tax savings from the debt in context with financial distress costs, which is the core of static trade off theories, is problematic in conditions of the Czech Republic.","Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Rucková, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",ruckova@opf.slu.cz,"Ruckova, Petra/AAA-6030-2021","Ruckova, Petra/0000-0001-8558-6212",,,,,23,6,6,1,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

There has been an increasing trend of shortening product life cycles, the emergence of new technologies, including IT, boosting the dynamics of introduction of new products to the market, etc. In order to find their place and survive on the dynamic and global market, today's enterprises must change their management style from conservative to innovative one. However, introduction of innovations brings many dangers because the characteristic of the innovative processes is a high degree of risk, which is influenced by a.o.: substantial costs and a high failure rate in their implementation. All of this contributes to the fact that only a few processes of creating innovations end with the introduction of a new product to the market that creates a certain economic value. Lack of planning may affect the nature and scope of new innovations. The main aim of the article is the identification of changes in the planning and implementation of innovations by small businesses operating in the southern region of Poland. The inference was based on the results of two studies concerning the innovativeness and competitiveness of small businesses, carried out in 2006, 2007 and 2013. In the first part, the specification of innovative strategies of small businesses was shown. The second part presents the results of research on the issues discussed. The analysis of data indicates, among other things, that when it comes to creation and implementation of innovations, owners of small businesses of the southern region of Poland still rely mainly on their own intuition and they do not plan them.

The basis of rating is the assessed values of property holdings from which property tax can be charged. The traditional single valuation method contributes to the inconsistency of assessed value because location factors are not considered objectively. The traditional method is also unable to produce equity and uniformity of the assessment values consistently. The main objective of this research was to develop a mass appraisal model incorporating spatial analysis and geographic information system (GIS). In order to achieve the objective, Majlis Perbandaran Kulai was chosen as a study area consist of 1,500 transaction data between 2004 and 2006 representing 86 housing areas. The variable components for location factors, namely accessibility, neighborhood and environment were generated using GIS spatial analysis which included buffer, overlay and network analysis. The outputs from the analyses consisted of variable components which were derived objectively and they can assist in the process of forming mass appraisal model. Four mass appraisal models were used as alternatives to the traditional single valuation method. They were ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial hedonic model (SHM), geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Kriging. The outcomes of the models showed that the assessed values were statistically significant. The performance of mass appraisal models from equity and uniformity perspectives was measured using ratio study technique. The four models were compared on the basis of their accuracy in terms of equity and uniformity. From this research, it was discovered that the spatial hedonic model (SHM) was the best followed by least square model (OLS) the second best choice.","[Sipan, Ibrahim; Ali, Hishamuddin Mohd; Ismail, Suriatini; Abdullah, Shahabudin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, FGRE, Skudai 81300, Johor Darul Tak, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sipan, I (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, FGRE, Skudai 81300, Johor Darul Tak, Malaysia.",ibrahimsipan@utm.my,"Abdullah, Shahabudin/K-5669-2012","Abdullah, Shahabudin/0000-0002-6224-5754",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3376.0,3388,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700355,0

The article presents management culture diagnostic principles and specifies why this process is important for companies that are preparing to implement corporate social responsibility strategy. This research aims to expand the development of the knowledge on corporate social responsibility including more than usually aspects found in literature and related to management culture, which are particularly important for the business of the country of transition economics. In order to achieve the purpose, the research based on theoretical analysis method was chosen; it helped to construct the research tool and interview 1717 employees of two production companies functioning in the Eastern European market and determine their reactions to organization management culture. The study analyses Assessments provided by the production staff; middle and top management personnel groups are analysed in the research. The research provides empirical insights what aspects of the management culture can be a barrier to the implementation of corporate social responsibility, and in what direction managerial staff of the companies has to act. It has been found that the success of the implementation of social responsibility strategy requires four directions: personal managerial staff culture, management processes' organization culture, working conditions culture and documentation system culture. The work covers findings which provide the method for the organization how to prepare the implementation of the corporate social responsibility by systematically balancing management system, strengthening the ethical foundations and involving the support of employees as one of the interested party.

These clauses are a fundamental aspect of the business models of some of the world's leading companies such as Apple, Amazon, Expedia, and the like. The competition law implications of these clauses have been one of the key concerns of more than a dozen competition authorities around the world in recent years. The competition authorities involved have adopted different approaches and reached different substantive and procedural outcomes, sometimes in proceedings that concern the application of the same legal rule to the same practice of the same company. This is best demonstrated by the line of investigations against certain online travel agents in Europe. This article posits that such diverging approaches lead to legal and business uncertainty, as well as to procedurally unfair and substantively incorrect assessments.

However, implementations of road pricing schemes are rather limited and mainly focus on large cities (i.e., cordon charges). Recently, the three regional governments of Belgium a highly urbanised and polycentric country have commissioned a pilot project of an area-wide, time-and location-differentiated road pricing scheme, hence differentiating charges according to the time of the day and the type of road used. Results of this project indicate that kilometres travelled by car mainly reduce in urban areas, while car use on motorways only reduces to a limited degree. Furthermore, results indicate that urban residents adapt their travel behaviour more than suburban and rural residents, probably because urban dwellers have more alternatives to travel than driving personal cars only, especially on the short run. In this paper, we will analyse the preliminary outcomes of the conducted pilot project, look into the limitations of this project and suggest an alternative road pricing scheme.

This deregulation finally took effect January 1st, 2013. Our analysis led us to expect that substantial economic benefits were likely to accrue to the travelling public and society as a whole. In particular, we assumed that (potential) passengers especially those from lower income brackets would stand to gain massively from lower prices and a larger variety of travel options due to overlapping competing networks, at least on trunk routes (of which substantially more exist in Germany than in the UK, the USA or Sweden, given the country's polycentric economic geography, its high population density and very even spatial distribution of the population). Further, we expected that these economic benefits would not be limited to intercity bus travellers, as we also held that the imminent liberalization should force Deutsche Bahn AG to lower prices for their rail services and to improve the quality of its competing offerings. Last but not least, we stressed the crucial role of competition policy for these economic benefits to fully materialize. Our main concern then was that incumbent Deutsche Bahn AG might attempt to abuse the massive pre-liberalization dominance it had held on the regulated intercity bus market, in combination with its nearly intact de facto monopoly on long-distance railroad services, to stifle the genesis of this new market in its early stages with the aim to undermine the rise of potent intra- and intermodal competitors. In this paper for THREDBO 14, we contrast our 2011 projections with the observable intra- and intermodal effects in the two years since the German intercity bus market has been liberalized. In addition, we provide an overview of the corporate strategies of the new intercity bus operators and the strategic adjustments implemented by Deutsche Bahn AG. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are multiple means and opportunities to drive change, including a new regulatory framework, a transition to an integrated network, or more funding and service types. A conceptual framework illustrates how the relationships between users, government authorities, and operators should guide decision-making at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. Any type of stakeholder can be a change agent. While change is needed, examples from multiple cities illustrate that there is significant risk in the change process. Changes need to be managed with realistic planning and adequate levels of funding. A key component is accounting for all costs, including internalizing any externalities and paying for social and environmental goals.

Emerging evidence also suggests that accessibility measures may effectively distill complex technical analyses into representations more easily understood and discussed by stakeholders with a range of expertise. A consolidated class of accessibility measures could thus potentially be the foundation for co-creative planning in which diverse stakeholders and experts work actively with transport planners to evaluate impacts of transport alternatives, especially wider impacts beyond individual travel time savings. This paper describes the development and initial testing of CoAXs (short for Collaborative Accessibility-based Stakeholder Engagement System), an open-source stakeholder engagement tool that seeks to support co-creative transport planning. Preliminary development and focus group testing using example bus rapid transit corridors in Boston, Massachusetts, suggest that interactive mapping tools can operationalize accessibility measures as a basis for engaging stakeholders in discussing the regional value and wider impacts of transport investment.

Most of the concessions are competitively tendered, since the introduction of a legal obligation to tender in 2001. Dutch public transport authorities have since chosen a variety of concession setups and forms of contract remuneration. This variety has remained large in terms of ways of tendering, but in addition, the three major cities were allowed in 2012 to choose not to tender out their concessions. This paper again explores that variety and describes recent changes at the national and regional levels from 2013 onwards and looks at the developments that were first coming up in 2012. The paper describes key trends and lessons from the Dutch experience based on a nine-year project drawing lessons on competitive tendering with authorities, operators and consultants, and based on interviews with representative of 13 of the 14 public transport authorities. Key trends are a national focus on rail transport, dealing with austerity measures, implementing the earlier push for defragmentation by the national government, tweaking of the governance and preparing for bigger changes that might have major impacts on the markets for public transport. Finally, the article presents a four phase model of implementation of governance changes after in the introduction of competitive tendering in 2001. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, the extrema symmetry expansion EEMD, which can effectively restrain the mode mixing and end effects, is used to decompose the energy price into simple modes. Secondly, by using the fine-to-coarse reconstruction algorithm, the high-frequency, low-frequency and trend components are identified. Furthermore, autoregressive integrated moving average is applicable to predicting the high-frequency components. LSSVM is suitable for forecasting the low-frequency and trend components. At the same time, a universal kernel function prototype is introduced for making up the drawbacks of single kernel function, which can adaptively select the optimal kernel function type and model parameters according to the specific data using the PSO algorithm. Finally, the prediction results of all the components are aggregated into the forecasting values of energy price time series. The empirical results show that, compared with the popular prediction methods, the proposed method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of energy prices, with high accuracy both in the level and directional predictions.

Victims need an attorney to sue; defense attorneys reduce the probability that the plaintiff prevails. Plaintiffs' attorneys offer contingent fees providing incentives to proceed with strong and drop weak cases. By contrast, defense attorneys work for fixed fees under which they accept all cases. Since the defense commits to fight all cases, few victims sue in the first place. We thus provide an explanation for the fact that in the US virtually all plaintiffs use contingency while defendants tend to rely exclusively on fixed fees. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It rejects the view that Magna Carta is largely a special interest deal between the King and the Barons, and defends the proposition that by and large it works as a public-regarding document that did much to cure the defects of the feudal and judicial systems that had evolved under King John. A clause-by-clause analysis of the document, dealing with such matters as tenurial succession, marriage, courts and judicial procedures, debtor and creditor arrangements, and property rights and liberties shows that Magna Carta exhibited a high degree of technical excellence. By constantly referring back to ancient customs, Magna Carta introduced sensible reforms, some of which were peculiar to the feudal system, but others of which carry over to similar problems today. The durability of the Magna Carta is justified by its political and legal achievements.

The implicit rationale behind such a stringent standard for admissibility is the trier of fact's vulnerability to adversarial bias, which many legal scholars and practitioners assume to be rampant. Employing a standard litigation model in the literature, I demonstrate that client-expert relationships may not always exhibit adversarial bias and that a litigant may voluntarily present neutral expert testimony under certain situations. I also show that a litigant is more likely to deploy hired guns if the litigation environment is more favorable to his cause. In particular, the burden of proof assignment and the court's prior belief are shown to influence adversarial bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The presence of counterfeit goods gives rise to two various effects on branded firms' profit: on the one hand, it undermines the sale of branded goods (substitution effect); on the other hand, it alleviates the intensity of price competition between branded firms (price increasing effect). We argue that, under certain circumstances, the price increasing effect may dominate the substitution effect, thereby boosting the branded firms' profits. We also discuss the impact of the strength of intellectual property right (IPR) enforcement on the price and profit of the branded firms. The discussion may shed light on a long-standing debate on criminalizing the purchase of counterfeit goods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The contribution of our work is to provide the first comprehensive study on spatial differentiation in industrial dynamics for all firm sizes and all sectors, including services. We find that location patterns are largely consistent with the spatial product lifecycle model: traditional Fordist sectors are over-represented in the periphery, while sectors associated with the ICT paradigm are over-represented in the core, with the notable exception of science-based manufacturing. Second, where the industrial dynamics in manufacturing sectors follow the predicted patterns, the industrial dynamics in service sectors largely contradict product lifecycle theory. We conclude that the spatial product lifecycle theory applies well to traditional manufacturing, while more specific theories are required to understand the location and industrial dynamics of science-based industries and service industries.","[Capasso, Marco] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Econ & Quantitat Methods, Bergamo, Italy; [Frenken, Koen] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Frenken, Koen] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Maastricht University; University of Bergamo; Utrecht University; Lund University,"Frenken, K (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Frenken, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",marco.capasso@gmail.com; elena.cefis@gmail.com; k.frenken@uu.nl,"Cefis, Elena/AAJ-3162-2020; Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Cefis, Elena/0000-0001-9960-4354; Capasso, Marco/0000-0003-2057-299X; Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201","Utrecht University [High Potential Grant (HIPO)]; University of Bergamo [Department of Management, Economics and Quantitative Methods] [60CEFI13]","Utrecht University [High Potential Grant (HIPO)]; University of Bergamo [Department of Management, Economics and Quantitative Methods]","This work was supported by Utrecht University [High Potential Grant (HIPO) to E.

The researchers used qualitative methods to understand the motivations of motorcycle users that might contribute to this growth in six cities: Barranquilla, Bogota (Colombia), Sao Paulo, Recife (Brazil), Caracas (Venezuela), and Buenos Aires (Argentina). Researchers used semi-structured interviews and focus groups to gather data from six categories of motorcycle users: motorcycle taxi drivers, motorcycle taxi users, motorcyclists for delivery, motorcyclists for private use, owners in the process of selling their motorcycles, and potential motorcyclists (those seeking to buy motorcycles). Common themes emerged across the six cities, including the time advantage that motorcycles offered versus deficient public transportation and congested auto traffic, the low cost of motorcycles versus other transport modes, the vulnerability of motorcyclists to traffic injury and death, and cultural aspects of motorcycle use. Policy implications include the need to make motorcycle travel safer and improve public transportation in Latin American cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By means of multivariate regression analysis, this paper explores the role of governmental information provision in residents' responses towards highway project proposals, measured by the expected change in residential satisfaction i.e, the match between housing needs and conditions, as a consequence of those projects. We also pay specific attention to permeability of and satisfaction with information provided. The analyses are based on questionnaire data collected among 484 residents living close to two announced plans for highway adjustment in the Netherlands. We found indications that residents who received information from a governmental project team are more satisfied with information compared to residents who only received information from other sources. In its turn, a higher level of information satisfaction was associated with more positive expectations with regard to changes in their residential satisfaction, although other contextual variables were also explanatory. Receiving information from the project team was mainly associated with a closer residential proximity to the highway where project team distribution efforts were also more intensive. However, we observed clear personal and project-specific differences in the number of information sources received and the likelihood to attend information meetings. The latter was also associated with more negative expectations towards residential satisfaction change. This indicates a clear difference in characteristics between the more actively involved group and the silent majority. An important implication of this study is that information provided by project teams seems to increase acceptance of plans, via its contribution to residents' information satisfaction. Nevertheless, only a minority of residents appeared satisfied with the information they received. Therefore, it seems worthwhile for planning agencies to pay more attention to people who currently appear less satisfied with the information provided. These include older residents, residents with fewer social contacts and families with children. In addition, the results indicate clear differences in expected satisfaction change between more actively and more passively involved residents. This may be a reason for governments to not only focus on opinions grasped from information meetings, but to specifically take into account the opinions of the more passive 'silent' majority.

This study is intended to investigate the connection between traffic environment and safety, more specifically, vehicle emissions and crash potential occurring in freeway traffic. Individual vehicle trajectory data collected from the US-101 freeway are used to investigate the relationship. Vehicle emission and crash potential indices are derived to characterize traffic environment and safety conditions, respectively, and relate those indices using correlation and regression. The resultant findings reveal that vehicle emissions are positively correlated with crash potentials in a statistically significant relationship. The methodological process for vehicle emissions and crash potential estimation developed in this study is expected to be used to monitor vehicle emissions from traffic conflict potential. Correspondingly, the methodological process is also to evaluate traffic control technology and policy implementation for improvement of transportation system efficiency with the goal of transportation emissions reduction.

Prior research has examined how food-related cues can create consumer misperceptions; however, consumer perceptions related to corporate communications (e.g., the use of cause cues) has received little research attention. This research explores consumer reactions to cause cues and finds that adding a health cause to a food package significantly increases product health perceptions, and, usually, product attitude, and purchase intentions (i.e., the cause cue effect) in both a student sample (Studies 1 and 2) and an adult sample on Amazon's mTurk (Study 3). Implications for cueing and inference-making literature, and for consumer health, and policymakers are discussed.","[Minton, Elizabeth A.] Univ Wyoming, Mkt, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Cornwell, T.

We consider production technology that can only be adjusted in discrete intervals and/or is costly to adjust. We show that, because of production constraints, a firm may not be willing to adjust its level of production in response to small changes in cost. Because price is determined by demand and the quantity produced, production constraints may result in a firm not changing price in response to a change in cost. This result has important implications for antitrust litigation-for example, the extent to which overcharges resulting from anticompetitive conduct upstream in the supply chain are passed through to purchasers downstream in the supply chain.","[Rothman, Dov; Tillmann, Philipp; Toniatti, David] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA",Analysis Group Inc.,"Rothman, D (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",dov.rothman@analysisgroup.com; philipp.tillmann@analysisgroup.com; david.toniatti@analysisgroup.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Outside observers recognize that error in the legal process (as well as hidden information) means they may misclassify defendants and thereby impose sanctions erroneously. We show that: (1) changes in the level of the formal sanction affect the level of informal sanctions imposed and (2) increases in the informal sanction rates imposed on prosecutors result in changes in the level of informal sanctions imposed on defendants. We also extend the model to allow for a three-outcome verdict (not guilty, not proven, and guilty), sometimes referred to as the Scottish verdict.

Using the underexploited, sizeable and long Lifetime Labour Market Database between 1981 and 2006, we investigate the evolution of the immigrant-native earnings gap-a measure of immigrants' assimilation-across the entire earnings distribution, across cohorts and across nationalities. We are able to control for observable and unobservable individual-specific characteristics as well as for specific characteristics of both time periods and recipient labour markets, defined as small geographical areas, and crucially, for the interaction of the two, in a robust empirical model specification anchored in the human capital theory. We also control for cohort-specific effects and nationality-specific effects. Our results show little evidence of large or persistent earnings disparities across the earnings distribution, across cohorts or across nationalities. These findings are supportive evidence of successful assimilation of immigrants into the UK, suggesting that recipient labour markets primarily reward individuals' characteristics other than, and regardless of, their immigration status. Nevertheless, some distinctive features emerge. When investigating the evolution of the immigrant-native earnings gap over time, our results illustrate how immigrants from different continents and cohorts have very different assimilation trajectories.","[Gagliardi, Luisa] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Gagliardi, Luisa] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Reg Econ Transports & Tourism CERTeT, I-20100 Milan, Italy; [Lemos, Sara] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Bocconi University; University of Leicester,"Lemos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",sl129@le.ac.uk,,,Department for Work and Pensions,Department for Work and Pensions,"The authors thank Mike Coombes, Alessandra Faggian, Gianni De Fraja, Steve Gibbons, Steve Hall, Jonathan Portes, Jerzy Szroeter, three anonymous referees and the editor Neil Coe for invaluable discussions, comments and suggestions.

With the option to download creative works legally, however, come the possibility of doing so illegally and the issue of how to protect copyrighted works effectively. Public (legislative) and formal (legal) efforts to prevent copyright infringements have been controversial or inefficient. The book industry showcases an alternative approach in which private companies use relatively inexpensive network surveillance to protect individual titles. I estimate the effectiveness of such protection on legal sales of books that become protected using a difference-in-differences approach. I find a protection-related increase in sales of electronic booksthe closest substitute for online piracyof more than 14 percent, with effectiveness depending on popularity, genre, and search frequency. Most of the increase is due to prevention of casual infringements rather than professional piracy.","[Reimers, Imke] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Reimers, I (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,"Reimers, Imke/JVD-5330-2023",,,,,,25,28,28,2,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We investigate the interrelationship between the phases of cyclical fluctuations in yield curve components and the phases of the business cycle. The results indicate a strong interrelationship between the yield curve and the economy. The proposed model has substantial incremental predictive value relative to alternative specifications.

First, it seeks to describe the logics of fracture and cohesion governing current geopolitical dynamics in the Mediterranean. Second, in the face of these contradictory tendencies, it proposes the notion of archipelago-frontier as a concept for deepening our understanding of an ever more dispersed and ubiquitous geography defining the Southern border of the EU. In this light we draw on the contemporary resonances of the destabilising cartographic imagination of Al-Idrissi (1100-1165). And we argue that, read today, it helps us rethink the current symbolic, terminological (and hence geopolitical) abduction of the Mediterranean by the European Union, which the very term Euromediterranean' encapsulates. Finally, the paper underlines the necessity of forging new vistas on the Mediterranean engendering perspectives that are more dialogical, plurivocal and sensitive to permanent transformation, as evoked by a long-term spatial as well as political horizon of struggle.","[Ferrer-Gallardo, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Kramsch, Olivier Thomas] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Ferrer-Gallardo, X (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Geog, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.;Kramsch, OT (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",Xavier.ferrer.gallardo@uab.cat; O.Kramsch@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,80,5,5,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The own empirical investigation is based on primary research using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni. The investigation is focused on facts whether statistically significant differences in the amount of subsidies from national, regional, local and European levels between clusters in European countries influence their level of innovation performance. The finding shows that there are no statistically significant differences in the exploitation of resources from the Structural Funds and community programmes of the EU in the examined clusters in the countries with different levels of innovation performance. However, the clusters in the countries with higher levels of innovation performance receive funds in the form of central government and regional self-government subsidies more frequently than the clusters in the countries with lower levels of innovation performance.","[Urbancikova, Natasa; Burger, Peter] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Urbancíková, N (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",natasa.urbancikova@tuke.sk; peter.burger@tuke.sk,"Burger, Peter/AAH-4330-2019; Urbancikova, Natasa/AAD-3113-2020","Burger, Peter/0000-0002-7512-4660; Urbancikova, Natasa/0000-0002-2158-5517",,,,,27,1,1,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We use a dataset constructed from over 12,000 search terms and 2million users to identify drivers of the organic clicks that the top 759 retailers received from search engines in August 2012. Our results are potentially important for search engine optimization (SEO). We find that a retailer's investments in factors such as the quality and brand awareness of its site increases organic clicks through both a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect stems purely from consumer behavior: The higher the quality of an online retailer, the greater the number of consumers who click its link rather than a competitor in the list of organic results. The indirect effect stems from our finding that search engines tend to place higher quality sites in better positions, which results in additional clicks because consumers tend to click links in more favorable positions. We also find that consumers who are older, wealthier, conduct searches from work, use fewer words, or include a brand name product in their search are more likely to click a retailer's organic link following a product search. Finally, the quality of a retailer's site appears to be especially important in attracting organic traffic from individuals with higher incomes. The beneficial direct and indirect effects of an online retailer's brand equity on organic clicks, coupled with the spillover effects on traffic through other online and traditional channels, leads us to conclude that investments in the quality and brand awareness of a site should be included as part of an SEO strategy.","[Baye, Michael R.; Wildenbeest, Matthijs R.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [De los Santos, Babur] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; Clemson University,"Baye, MR; Wildenbeest, MR (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;De los Santos, B (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",mbaye@indiana.edu; babur@clemson.edu; mwildenb@indiana.edu,,,Google,Google(Google Incorporated),"We thank the editor and two referees for helpful comments, and Susan Kayser, Joowon Kim, Yoo Jin Lee, and Sarah Zeng for research assistance.

The second holds that pure cardinality metrics are insufficient for neutrality, because opportunities cannot be individuated into countable entities without presupposing some relevantly partisan evaluative perspective. In each case, a clear understanding of the liberal basis for valuing liberty yields a satisfying response.","[Garnett, Michael] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Philosophy, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Garnett, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Philosophy, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",m.garnett@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,49,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Main findings: Although there is strong evidence of the presence of a nonlinear structure, a chaotic and, therefore, deterministic behavior cannot be assumed in the underlying process of air transportation. Rather, the findings indicate that ARCH-type processes generally explain the nonlinearities in the data. Originality/value: This is the first study that considers such important issues as chaos and nonlinear dynamics in the demand for air transport services in Spain Overall, this work sheds additional light on the underlying dynamics of these important variables.","[Inglada-Perez, Lucia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Inglada-Perez, Lucia] Tutor Open Univ Spain, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Inglada-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain.;Inglada-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Tutor Open Univ Spain, Madrid, Spain.",lucia.inglada@madrid.uned.es,"Inglada-Perez, Lucia/Z-3020-2019",,,,,,65,3,3,0,5,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This research studied attitude toward consumption at both the personal (micro) level and societal (macro) level and subjective well-being in terms of cognitive well-being and affective well-being. Results indicated that micro attitudes, whether positive or negative, were positively related to a consumer's subjective well-being. In contrast, macro attitudes were negatively related to subjective well-being. We posit that these findings could be due to micro attitudes enhancing the person's feeling of autonomy and control. In contrast, macro attitudes may create concerns beyond the person's control. For those who wish to impact societal-level consumption, these findings provide empirical support for the idea that focusing on the personal benefits of anticonsumption may be more effective than emphasizing larger societal concerns. We explore the potential implications of these findings for mandated vs. voluntary approaches to reducing consumption.","[Iyer, Rajesh] Bradley Univ, Mkt, Peoria, IL 61625 USA; [Muncy, James A.] Valdosta State Univ, Mkt, Valdosta, GA USA",Bradley University; University System of Georgia; Valdosta State University,"Iyer, R (通讯作者)，Bradley Univ, Mkt, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.;Muncy, JA (通讯作者)，Valdosta State Univ, Mkt, Valdosta, GA USA.",riyer@bradley.edu; muncyj@valdosta.edu,,,,,,,61,58,62,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The findings indicate that, in general, VIX levels around noon are most informative for predicting realized volatility. We posit that the VIX performs better during this time period because trading motivation around noon is less complex, and therefore trades contain more information on the market expectation of future volatility.

Limited studies in assessing health provider communication in Malaysian primary care setting make it difficult to determine whether this country evolving towards patient centered communication. This study was aimed at identifying the association between PCC and patient's enablement (PE). A cross sectional investigation involving a total of 69 outpatients was conducted in an outpatient clinic at the Pulau Pinang Hospital. Respondents were recruited using convenience sampling in February 2016 and the data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. PCC was measured by three domains; exchanging information (EI), socioemotional behavior (SB) and communication skill (COS). Patients scored highest on SB domain with mean (SD) was 4.06(0.51), followed by EI, 3.84(0.45) and COS, 2.75(0.70). Only SB showed a statistically significant association with patient enablement, p<0.05. The findings of this study provide useful information towards improving health provider communication skill to enhance patient's understanding and self-care management.

However, pressure within an alliance is substantial. This study used competitor mapping and awareness-motivation-capability competitive dynamics to analyze airline alliances. The results revealed that alliances compete to recruit airline companies, and the power differences in the alliances are considerable; only a few of the airline companies within the alliance possess power. In addition, we interviewed 2 senior managers to confirm the results of the analysis. A detailed content analysis was performed to test each hypothesis. The findings revealed that companies with low market commonality and high resource similarity can cooperate through resource allocation. We also discovered that the main competitive action was derived from disallowing local airline companies to join an alliance. Leading companies in the alliance generally negotiated for the entire alliance indirectly. This research suggests that companies cooperate not only to control cost but also to increase service quality.","[Chang, Wei-Lun; Chiu, Chia-Ling] Tamkang Univ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Chang, WL (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",wlc.allen@gmail.com; itslynn412@gmail.com,,"Chang, Wei-Lun/0000-0001-7985-3580",,,,,41,12,13,3,45,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In South Africa alone, the number of Internet users grew from 8,5 million to 24,9 million in only three years (2011-2014). Currently, 90 per cent of these users access this facility from their mobile devices. Statistics illustrate that South Africans are moving towards a continuously connected lifestyle, a situation in which information and communication technology (ICT) seems to have become ubiquitous. Given the rapid growth of ITC technology and its absorption into people's lives (both personally and professionally), the general aim of the present research was to investigate the use of ICT among employees and how it affects their work-life interaction (WLI). The researcher employed a qualitative research approach in accordance with which a sample of 25 employees was interviewed. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and processed by means of thematic analyses. Three themes with corresponding sub-themes were extracted: use of ICT (i.e. in both work and family domains); challenges that ICT use presents; and the way in which employees manage their WLI by means of ICT. The participants experienced WLI as mostly negative. However, they also mentioned two different approaches that helped them manage interaction between their work and family domains. These approaches entail 1) applying limits to their use of ICT, and 2) using ICT to create flexibility. This article advises that organisations should consider adopting ICT to assist their employees in the management of these two domains. This could be done in two ways. First, organisations could implement a code of conduct or provide guidelines for eliminating the intrusive and excessive use of ICT, especially after working hours. Secondly, organisations could pilot or implement flexible working hours and possible telecommuting initiatives.","[de Wet, Wihan] North West Univ, Sch Human Resource Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Koekemoer, Eileen] Univ Pretoria, Dept Human Resource Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Pretoria,"de Wet, W (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Human Resource Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",,,"Koekemoer, Eileen/0000-0002-3234-4532",,,,,64,8,13,1,56,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Based on German R&D survey data, we combine propensity score matching with a difference-in-difference estimator in order to measure the causal influence of public direct R&D project funding on firm behaviour. Our results indicate that (i) repeated participation in R&D projects on average leads to a higher increase in R&D expenditures than once-off funding; (ii) the aggregate effect of R&D funding on R&D expenditures of business firms is somewhat higher for business-business collaboration projects than for science-business collaboration projects; (iii) R&D expenditures of business firms that cooperate with science show a higher share of external R&D spending. Results of one particular cluster programme indicate that at least the short-term development of R&D does not so much depend on which programme direct R&D project funding is applied to.","[Engel, Dirk] Univ Appl Sci Stralsund, Dept Econ & Int Business, Stralsund, Germany; [Rothgang, Michael] Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Essen, Dept Environm & Resources, Essen, Germany; [Eckl, Verena] Wissensch Stat GmbH Stifterverbandes, Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Rothgang, M (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch Essen, Dept Environm & Resources, Essen, Germany.",michael.rothgang@rwi-essen.de,"Engel, Dirk/ABD-8170-2021; Eckl, Verena/JZS-8548-2024; Rothgang, Michael/ABE-4704-2020","Engel, Dirk/0000-0002-8203-7530;",,,,,29,20,20,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Like many other countries in Eastern Europe, Romania continues to be attractive on the IT outsourcing market, a vital role being played by higher education institutions providing computing undergraduate and graduate programmes. Using data collected through a survey between 2010 and 2016 addressing the graduates of Business Information Systems master programme at the Alexandra Loan Cuza University of Iasi, this paper investigates the specificities of the national market as an IT offshoring destination. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified the latent factors underlying course utility for the early career graduates. Resulted models were further tested and refined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis.

For the U.S. GNP quarterly growth rate, we compare the forecasting performances of an autoregressive model with those of several mixed-frequency models, including the MIDAS approach. Using the additional dimension provided by different vintages, we compute several forecasts for a given calendar date with each model, then approximate the corresponding distribution of forecasts by a continuous density. Next, we combine these model-specific densities using scoring rules and analyze both the composition and the evolution of the implied weights over time. In so doing, not only do we investigate the sensitivity of model selection to the choice of which data release to consider, we also illustrate how revision process information can be incorporated into real time studies.

The authors try to identify potential advantages of vendor managed inventory (VMI) approach implementation for consolidated deliveries. The main goals of the paper are identification and evaluation of potential savings due to replacement of classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) with the inventory routing problem (IRP) approach. We compare the distribution plans based on classical VRP algorithms to IRP-approach-based plans for different length of planning horizon. Our purpose is to create a solution methodology that could be applied for real-life instances that are critical for company's resource planning and fleet utilization. In order to solve the test instances, two complementary approaches are taken into consideration. The first one is an extension of exact model for solving routing problems given by Miller et al. (1960). Due to the complexity issues (only test instances up to 6 locations could be solved to optimality) heuristics are also introduced. Our heuristics proposal allows obtaining close to optimal solutions using mixed integer programming (MIP) and is applied to find a solution for larger instances. Computational results of experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach, are reported.","[Hanczar, Pawel] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Logist, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-52345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Kaleta, Jacek] Cracow Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, 24 Warszawska St, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Cracow University of Technology,"Hanczar, P (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Logist, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-52345 Wroclaw, Poland.",pawel.hanczar@ue.wroc.pl; jacekkaleta@poczta.onet.pl,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,18,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A systematic approach to the implementation of such projects involves consideration of any organizational change in the context of enterprise architecture: it is necessary to take into account the interconnection and interdependence of business processes, organizational structure, information systems, IT infrastructure and other components of the enterprise architecture. In practice, the reorganization projects are often implemented in isolation without taking into account the existing relationship of a particular component of the enterprise architecture with other ones, which leads to unsatisfactory results of projects.

Its aim is to characterize the behaviour of tertiary trend based on volatility of share prices, which can be appropriately used to generate buy and sell signals and thus to beat the passive strategy of Buy and Hold. The research has monitored several characteristics of volatility of tertiary trend which characterize the trend and indicate that after several days of growth or decline in share prices the trend will change. The main characteristic is the length of the trend; as another characteristic is used accumulated change, i.e. profit or loss and their adjustment - standardized overall or moving standard deviation. In addition to these characteristics, we also marginally examine the impact of monthly anomalies on the movement of share prices. The results of analysis will be used to make decisions on buy and sell signals. Applicability of these characteristics was verified on the shares of 5 companies traded on the stock exchange, namely CEZ, O2, KB, Pegas, and Philip Morris. Data on their daily closing prices from 2006 (with the exception of Pegas whose trading on the stock exchange began in 2008) to 2015 were used for the analysis. They show that the best length of trend for generating buy and sell signals is from 2 to 5 days. For the characteristic of accumulated change, the change between 2% and 6% can be regarded as the best. If we use the standardized accumulated change, buy and sell signals may be generated up to 3 or 4 times (for the moving standard deviation) of standard deviation. We expect that trading based on these signals surpasses the passive strategy of Buy and Hold.","[Rihova, Pavla; Svoboda, Milan] Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Ríhová, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",divisova@kem.zcu.cz; svobodm@kem.zcu.cz,"Svoboda, Milan/AAU-4541-2020",,"Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen [SGS-2015-026]","Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen","The article was elaborated as one of the results of the research project entitled The Research of Factors Affecting Share Price Movement, Prediction of Share Price Movement and Design of Algorithms for Self-acting Trading SGS-2015-026 of the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen.",,10,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,2869.0,2877,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700294,0

The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used to determine and weight the investment decision criteria. Then these criteria were inserted to the sand cone model in order to see their relative importance. Furthermore, the knowledge and technology rankings were used to calculate the variability coefficients i.e. the uncertainty which questions the decision making and could be seen also as so called collapses in the sand cone. The source of the collapses in the case company was determined to be the uncertainty over future technologies. From this a conclusion can be drawn that the company relies a lot on basic technology in securing its operations and that the knowledge and technology is essential in the investment decision making.

The change in organizational culture and management system is caused by the global environment. Companies' management is changing from ethnocentric and polycentric to management without borders. To achieve greater efficiency in competing in the global market is the reason for this change. The management system is complex, because it is based on international cooperation and consists of international managerial teams. The level of intercultural socialization and our cultural awareness are predicted by the comparison and confrontation of differences in organizational culture and human resources development. The paper is focused on diagnosing of organizational culture in organizations operating in Slovakia. The survey was conducted in 236 medium and large enterprises in Slovakia. Personnel or senior managers responsible for the level of organizational culture and human resources development in enterprises were the respondents. The assumptions about possibility of diagnosing the types of organizational culture in selected Slovak enterprises with and without foreign participation were confirmed. Pros and cons of different organizational culture types in the development of human resources were identified. We observed that hierarchical and clan cultures are the most common ones in Slovak enterprises. While hierarchical culture occurs in enterprises with no foreign participation, clan and market-oriented culture is strongly represented in enterprises with international participation. The results of organizational culture examination were confronted with the opinions of experts using the Delphi method leading to increasing the validity and reliability of the primary findings. Such opinions suggest links between the management of Slovak enterprises and national history and culture. Focus on flexibility, mutual communication, profitability and competitiveness is set in enterprises with international participation with influences of different cultures.","[Vetrakova, Milota] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Smerek, Lukas] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Vetráková, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.;Smerek, L (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",milota.vetrakova@umb.sk; lukas.smerek@umb.sk,"Smerek, Lukas/AAP-6333-2020","Smerek, Lukas/0000-0003-0008-282X; Vetrakova, Milota/0000-0001-7837-5118",,,,,46,11,13,2,50,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The method of clustering based on the self-organizing Kohonen maps allows to get university ranking with a minimum level of subjectivity. The results of clustering allow to identify five groups of universities with similar characteristics and thus with similar goals and opportunities for development. When the clusters were determined it is possible to define for each cluster the threshold values of indicators, which certain university should reach for entering into the cluster. For example, to get into the leading cluster according to created rules for Moscow state University it is required to increase indicators Papers int co-author / Papers and Acad staff int / Acad staff at only 0.01 points. It is also fruitfully to analyze tendencies of development for each individual cluster. Below is presented a possible interpretation of the most significant results obtained from the evaluation of trends of universities development: Dynamic of development of all universities included in the study sample over the period 2004-2012 indicates a steady increase in the number of publications according to Web of Science; There is a common trend of reducing the ratio of academic staff to the number of students that, according to the author, due to the increase in the number of students studying in leading universities.","[Zaboev, Mikhail; Meleshkin, Mikhail; Khalin, Vladimir] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Zaboev, M (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",m.zaboev@spbu.ru,"Khalin, Vladimir G/J-4320-2013; Zaboev, Mikhail/ABA-9280-2021","Khalin, Vladimir G/0000-0003-1459-3137;",,,,,6,1,1,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,928.0,936,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200079,0

They affect the private costs and benefits of migration (assimilation channel) and lower legal entry barriers through family reunification programs (policy channel). This paper presents a micro-founded identification strategy allowing to disentangle the relative importance of these two channels. Our empirical analysis exploits US immigration data by metropolitan area and country of origin. We first find that the elasticity of migration flows to network size is around one. More interestingly, we show that the policy channel accounted at most for a quarter of this elasticity in the 1990s, and the magnitudes of the total network effect and the policy channel are greater for low-skilled migrants. Our results are strongly robust to sample selection, identification assumptions, and treatment for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity. Furthermore, the policy channel was stronger in the 1990s than in the 1980s, possibly reflecting the changes in the US family reunification policies. We conclude that the government capacity to curb the migration multiplier exists, but is limited.","[Beine, Michel] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Beine, Michel] CES Ifo, Munich, Germany; [Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, Louvain, Belgium; [Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium; [Ozden, Caglar] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",University of Luxembourg; Ifo Institut; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; The World Bank,"Beine, M (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",,,"Beine, Michel/0000-0002-5080-2226; Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141",,,,,42,30,30,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

We construct a panel data set using published decisions from all state supreme courts from 1947 to 1994. We estimate the effects of changes in judges' employment conditions on a number of measures of judicial performance. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that judges are intrinsically motivated to provide high-quality decisions and that at the margin they prefer quality over quantity. When judges face less time pressure-whether from the introduction of an intermediate appellate court, the weakening of electoral demands, or an increased salary-they write more well-researched opinions that are cited more often by other judges. These effects are strongest when judges have more discretion to select their portfolios of cases.","[Ash, Elliott; MacLeod, W.

They consist of order selection criteria involving the sample analog of the asymptotic approximation of the h-step-ahead forecast mean squared error matrix, where h is the forecast horizon. These criteria are minimized over a truncation order n(T) under the assumption that an infinite-order vector autoregression can be approximated, under suitable conditions, with a sequence of truncated models, where n(T) is increasing with sample size. Using finite-order vector autoregressive models with various persistent levels and realistic sample sizes, Monte Carlo simulations show that, overall, our criteria outperform conventional competitors. Specifically, they tend to yield better small-sample distribution of the lag-order estimates around the true value, while estimating it with relatively satisfactory probabilities. They also produce more efficient multistep (and even stepwise) forecasts since they yield the lowest h-step-ahead forecast mean squared errors for the individual components of the holding pseudo-data to forecast. Thus estimating the actual autoregressive order as well as the best forecasting model can be achieved with the same selection procedure. Such results stand in sharp contrast to the belief that parsimony is a virtue in itself, and state that the relative accuracy of strongly consistent criteria such as the Schwarz information criterion, as claimed in the literature, is overstated. Our criteria are new tools extending those previously existing in the literature and hence can suitably be used for various practical situations when necessary.

The evidence shows that forecast combinations of MIDAS regression models provide forecast gains over traditional models, which suggests the use of mixed frequency data consisting of fiscal series and macroeconomic indicators for forecasting the annual federal budget. It is also shown that, although this was not statistically significant, MIDAS regressions with quarterly leads that are employed to include real-time forecast updates of the current year federal expenditures and receipts are found to have improved forecast performances compared to MIDAS regressions without leads.

What type of model is consistent with this finding? We explore this question using two models of fertility, the one by Barro and Becker (1989), and the one inspired by Caldwell and developed by Boldrin and Jones (2002). In the Barro and Becker model parents have children because they perceive their children's lives as a continuation of their own. In the Boldrin and Jones' framework parents procreate because the children care about their old parents' utility, and thus provide them with old age transfers. The effect of increases in government provided pensions on fertility in the Barro and Becker model is very small, and inconsistent with the empirical findings. The effect on fertility in the Boldrin and Jones model is sizeable and accounts for between 55 and 65% of the observed Europe-US fertility differences both across countries and across time and over 80% of the observed variation seen in a broad cross section of countries. Another key factor affecting fertility the Boldrin and Jones model is the access to capital markets, which can account for the other half of the observed change in fertility in developed countries over the last 70 years.","[Boldrin, Michele] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA; [Boldrin, Michele] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [De Nardi, Mariacristina] UCL, London, England; [De Nardi, Mariacristina] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; [De Nardi, Mariacristina] IFS, London, England; [De Nardi, Mariacristina] CfM, London, England; [De Nardi, Mariacristina; Jones, Larry E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jones, Larry E.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Jones, Larry E.] Fed Reserve Bank Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of London; University College London; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Jones, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-101 Hanson Hall,1925 4th St S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",lej@umn.edu,,,National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank Robert Barro for his comments on an earlier draft, seminar participants at CERGE (Prague), Columbia University, the Minneapolis Fed, New York University Stern School of Business, Northwestern University, and Stanford University, for many helpful discussions, Alice Schoonbroodt for excellent research assistantship and the National Science Foundation for financial support.",,41,46,53,2,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Three selected theoretical perspectives are discussed: according to rational choice theory (RCT), multiple localisations represent just one of a number of choices, selected on the basis of individual preferences and given restrictions. Sociology of everyday life (SEL) addresses the reproduction of social life by focusing on practices of actors within the various social frameworks of multi-local everyday life. Actor-network theory (ANT) provides a toolkit' to de-scribe' the hybrid enactment of multi-local households. Materiality, processes, and multiplicity are emphasised. Each perspective reflects partial realities of the multiplicity of multi-local living. It is argued that the modelling of residential multi-locality pursued by the three approaches is highly productive if their results are compared with one another and interpreted as versions of reality differently shaped, which are partly congruent, partly incongruent due to incommensurable ontological and theoretical positions.","[Weiske, Christine] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Inst Sociol, D-09126 Chemnitz, Germany; [Petzold, Knut] Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Dept Sociol, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany; [Schad, Helmut] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Lucerne Sch Business, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Weiske, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Chemnitz, Inst Sociol, Thuringer Weg 9, D-09126 Chemnitz, Germany.",christine.weiske@soziologie.tu-chemnitz.de; knut.petzold@ku.de; helmut.schad@hslu.ch,"Petzold, Knut/AAD-2043-2021","Petzold, Knut/0000-0003-1092-7718",,,,,83,6,12,4,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Infrastructure development is increasingly considered in relation to environmental degradation, climatic impacts and societal trends. Reinforced by the notion of sustainable development, infrastructure planning is increasingly focused on the realization of integrated planning goals. In planning practice, however, the transport infrastructure policy silo is strongly sectoral in nature, which can result in efforts fragmented along sectoral lines to realize integrated goals. As a result, a gap can be found between the formulation and implementation of these goals. Meanwhile, historical shifts in infrastructure policy and planning reveal that earlier planning approaches have been adopted in response to these issues. A project-oriented planning approach seems to have developed in response to the implementation gap, while an integrated planning approach is focused on solving fragmentation. In this article we aim to explore and conceptualize these policy shifts in transport policy and planning and investigate what lessons can be drawn from these approaches to dealing with these issues in today's road infrastructure planning. We find that the current programme-oriented planning approach is focused on combining the strengths of both historical approaches. It aims at putting the focus on an integrated planning approach, while contextualizing projects in a project-oriented planning approach. As such, the emerging programmatic planning approach provides an interesting avenue for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It asks at what stage founders agree to commit to each other, how they structure optimal founder contracts, and how this affects team formation, ownership, incentives, and performance. The article derives a trade-off between upfront contracting, which can result in teams with ineffective founders, versus delayed contracting, which can enable some founders to appropriate ideas and start their own firms. Delayed contracting becomes more attractive when there are significant doubts about the skills of founders. We show that contingent contracts with vesting of shares may be used to mitigate inefficiencies in the team formation process. We also show that laws that provide protection to implied partnerships may have the unintended effect of encouraging more formal contracting.","[Hellmann, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Thiele, Veikko] Queens Univ, Queens Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Oxford; Queens University - Canada,"Hellmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",thomas.hellmann@sbs.ox.ac.uk; vthiele@business.queensu.ca,,"Thiele, Veikko/0000-0002-1316-3322",,,,,33,10,12,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Airports are price capped in several countries belonging to the European Union, as well as elsewhere, notably India. However, most of the price caps are not a pure price cap in which the X-factor is set independently of the cost of the regulated airport. Typically, hybrid price caps are used and combined with sometimes complex mechanisms like sliding scales, quality incentives and investment obligations, such that the incentive structures may become distorted. We provide an overview of the changes in the governance structure of airports as a result of privatization, analyze how far the regulatory institutions obey the principles of 'good' regulation, such as fairness and transparency, and investigate the performance of the new regulation in terms of allocative efficiency by reviewing benchmarking studies. Finally, we assess the impact of incentive regulation on productive efficiency using data envelopment analysis and second stage regression, which suggests that incentive regulation is superior to cost plus.

Using vector autoregressive models, the standard approach based on raw data is compared with the compositional approach based on transformed data. The results from the compositional approach are consistent with the relative nature of the observations, while the analysis of the raw data leads to several inconsistencies and artifacts. The compositional approach is extended to the case when also the total of the compositional parts is of interest.

Convergence or divergence in knowledge sourcing,ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,latecomers; catch up; cycle time of technology; knowledge; patents,CATCH-UP; PATENT CITATIONS,"This study deals with the convergence and divergence issue in terms of the possible difference in the knowledge-sourcing behaviour of latecomer and incumbent firms. Consequently, empirical analysis using the patent citation data shows that no significant difference exists in the knowledge-sourcing behaviour of the incumbents and latecomers in long-cycle time-based sectors, particularly in terms of whether each type of firm relies more or less on recent' and scientific' knowledge. By contrast, a significant difference is observed in the short-cycle technology-based sectors, such that the latecomer firms tend to rely more on recent' and scientific' knowledge than the incumbents. Thus, the findings suggest that the answer to the question of whether convergence or divergence exists in knowledge sourcing is that it depends on the knowledge regime of the sectors, specifically on the cycle time of the technologies of sectors. This finding is consistent with the reasoning that the latecomer firms can afford to rely only on recent technologies in short-cycle sectors in which technologies tend to change quickly or become obsolete; latecomer firms are also keen on their knowledge sourcing to broadly search not only into technological knowledge (patents) but also into scientific knowledge (articles) in short-cycle sectors with rapid change of technologies.","[Park, Jinhyuck; Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Park, Jinhyuck (Joseph)/JXX-7209-2024; Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Park, Jinhyuck (Joseph)/0000-0002-7433-2281; Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",Korean government through the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013S1A3A2053312],Korean government through the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),The corresponding author acknowledges the support provided by the Korean government through the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013S1A3A2053312].,,15,5,6,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The arguments for concluding that RAND commitments should limit injunctive patent relief or trigger antitrust liability turn on whether the commitment reasonably induces lock-in that generates hold-up effects or market power when that commitment is breached. But RAND commitments can induce such lock-in effects when they are made outside of standard-setting organizations and do not always induce them when they are made to standard-setting organizations. Thus, any special legal rules for RAND commitments should turn on whether the commitments induced such lock-in, rather than on the institutional context. The arguments against using special legal rules for RAND commitments turn on the extent to which lock-in might fail to generate holdup problems, denying patent injunctions might generate reverse-holdup problems, and contract or promissory estoppel remedies might obviate the need for antirust liability. But those arguments likewise apply equally inside and outside of standard-setting organizations. Thus, however one resolves the arguments for and against applying special legal rules to RAND commitments, the resulting legal standards should be the same whether or not the commitment is made to a standard-setting organization.","[Elhauge, Einer] Legal Econ LLC, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Elhauge, Einer] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Elhauge, E (通讯作者)，Legal Econ LLC, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"Google, Inc.","Google, Inc.","President, Legal Economics LLC; Petrie Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.

Our model takes this feature into account and explains how relative lobbying power of unions and employer associations in the legislature and judicial realm, and characteristics of labor court systems shape labor court activity and affect payoffs. Our model predicts that (a) as employer associations become stronger, court activity increases, and firms' costs and workers' payoffs decrease; (b) higher court costs tend to reduce the extent of labor court disputes and may, therefore, actually reduce the cost of judicial involvement; (c) court systems that can be lobbied more effectively make reliance on courts less attractive for the trade union if it is the stronger party.

Hayek's subsequent reports suggested the reorganization of the state-regulated Gibraltar housing market in line with free market principles designed to relocate the colony's working-class population into neighbouring Spain. However, rather than freeing Gibraltarians from the evils of state planning, as identified in The road to serfdom (also 1944), this proposal would have delivered them into the dictatorship of General Franco. Not only was Franco's regime brutal, but it also practised autarkic economic policies virtually identical to those which Hayek maligned in The road to serfdom. In sum, Hayek's proposals would have benefited Gibraltar's landlords at the expense of the liberty of the majority of the civilian population.","Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Grocott, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",c.grocott@le.ac.uk,,"Grocott, Chris/0000-0002-0971-7409",Arts and Humanities Research Council; Department of History at De Montfort University,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Department of History at De Montfort University,I am also grateful to the Arts and Humanities Research Council and to the Department of History at De Montfort University which funded various aspects of this research.,,28,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

I analyze the relative effectiveness of teachers who enter the profession through different pathways by estimating value-added models of student achievement. In general, alternatively certified teachers have stronger preservice qualifications than graduates of traditional university-based teacher preparation programs do, with the least restrictive alternative route attracting the most qualified prospective teachers. Teachers who enter through the path requiring no coursework have a substantially larger effect on student achievement. In contrast, the alternative pathway that requires substantial occupation-specific human capital investment yields teachers who are less effective than either traditional-route teachers or teachers who entered the profession through other alternative pathways. These results suggest that any benefits from preservice training are overwhelmed by the adverse selection into programs that require nontransferable human capital investments.","Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Sass, TR (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research [R305C120008],National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research,"Previous versions were circulated under the title Certification Requirements and Teacher Quality: A Comparison of Alternative Routes to Teaching.

In answering this question, unlike prior studies that treat search depth and search breadth as separate variables to measure firms' external knowledge search strategy, this study introduces a new concept, external search towards depth-dominance, to capture the trade-off between search depth and search breadth for SMEs in a resource-constrained context. Using data on 491 Chinese manufacturing SMEs, we find that SMEs search more deeply at high levels of technological and market turbulence. Moreover, the positive relationship between perceived technological turbulence (or perceived market turbulence) and external search towards depth-dominance is stronger when the differentiation propensity of a firm's competitive strategy is lower. The findings contribute to the understanding of innovation search in a resource-constrained context and the context specificity of innovation search.","[Guo, Bin; Wang, Yueqi; Xie, Xiao-Yun; Shou, Yongyi] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Bin] Zhejiang Univ City Coll, Sch Business, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Hangzhou City University,"Xie, XY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xiexy@zju.edu.cn,,"Shou, Yongyi/0000-0002-8152-8936",,,,,73,16,19,0,101,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This paper derives a New Institutional Economic theory of project management. It is suggested that project management encompasses both the discipline of operational management and that of economics. The operational management part deals with optimization of project processes. The basic postulation of the economic part is that human beings will maximize their benefits under constraints. Constraints are converted to either price or cost to facilitate the application of the law of demand. Three examples are used to demonstrate how refutable hypotheses can be derived when changes in constraints lead to changes in behaviours. The functions of project management are discussed in the contexts of this theoretical framework. A synthesis with existing theories is also given.,"Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",Curtin University,"Yung, P (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Kent Str, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",ping.yung@curtin.edu.au,,"Yung, Ping/0000-0001-9621-4828",,,,,46,5,14,2,51,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

A key phenomenon in this context derives from the fact that strong economic growth has accelerated the rapid accumulation of monetary wealth, now permitting extensive investment activities. These developments are shaped by cultural norms and values as well. Several scholars have identified a specific economic culture based on Confucian values as an explanatory approach for the historical specificity of China's economic development. Major research conducted recently on this subject highlights cultural influences on economic decision-making and financial behavior with a particular focus on the assessment of risk. In financial institutions, common practices to understand individual financial risk attitudes are techniques of risk scoring and risk profiling. However, to date, these practices do not consider cultural imprint. Main aim of this paper is the quantitative exploration of cultural influences on financial risk assessment in China. A non-parametric partial least squares approach evaluates the reliability and validity of the developed structural equation model. The underlying data derives from a set of surveys (n>200) with individual investors in Shanghai. This paper presents first results of the influence of Chinese cultural-values on individual financial risk attitude, behavioral investing, and asset class perception.","Lufthansa German Airlines, D-60546 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Berke, J (通讯作者)，Lufthansa German Airlines, D-60546 Frankfurt, Germany.",jens.berke@dlh.de,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,6,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,609.0,621,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700049,0

The countercyclical buffer boosts existing minimum capital requirements when systemic risk surges are detected. Bolstering capital in favourable economic conditions cushions losses in unfavourable conditions, thereby addressing capital requirement procyclicality. This paper contains an overview of the countercyclical capital buffer and a critical discussion of its implementation as proposed in Basel III. Consequences of the buffer's introduction for South African banks are explored, and in particular, potential systemic risk indicator variables are identified that may be used by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) as early warning indicators of imminent systemic financial distress. These indicators may be of value to the SARB, which could use them in taking decisions on the build-up and release of the countercyclical buffer for South African banks.","[Burra, Pravin; Wiid, Henco] Deloitte & Touche, New York, NY 10019 USA; [de Jongh, Pieter Juriaan] North West Univ, Ctr Business Math & Informat BMI, Kirkland, WA USA; [Raubenheimer, Helgard; Wiid, Henco] North West Univ, Ctr BMI, Kirkland, WA USA; [van Vuuren, Gary] North West Univ, Kirkland, WA USA",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Burra, P (通讯作者)，Deloitte & Touche, New York, NY 10019 USA.",,"Raubenheimer, Helgard/G-9960-2019; Raubenheimer, Helgard/M-6179-2019; van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","Raubenheimer, Helgard/0000-0002-4126-1739; Raubenheimer, Helgard/0000-0002-4126-1739; van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",National Research Foundation; Department of Science and Technology; Department of Trade and Industry,National Research Foundation; Department of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Department of Trade and Industry,"The last author carried out this research at Deloitte and Touche as part of his six-month Business Mathematics and Informatics (BMI) industry-directed research project in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in BMI.

The objective of the study was to identify the components of workplace treatment that indicate the perceived treatment of employees from designated groups. The study further investigated the influence of demographic factors on these perceptions. A quantitative approach was followed, and a questionnaire was developed to collect data pertaining to employees' biographical details and their perceptions of the treatment of employees from designated groups in the workplace. The population consisted of 29 688 employees at a leading South African bank and a sample of 1720 was used. A disproportionate, stratified sampling method was adopted and a sample of 349 employees participated. Factor analysis, correlations, T-tests and analysis of variance statistics were computed to achieve the objectives. The factor analysis identified four factors relating to the treatment of employees from designated groups: task autonomy, respect, responsibility and realistic expectations. The results of the T-tests revealed that race, years of service and staff category do influence employees' perceptions of the treatment of workers from designated groups in terms of task autonomy and respect. Black respondents, unlike white respondents, believe that employees from designated groups are not treated with respect, nor are they accorded task autonomy. This study represents a vital step towards a better understanding of the dimensionality of perceptions of fair and just treatment and should ultimately contribute to more effective treatment of all employees in the workplace.","Univ S Africa, Dept Human Resource Management, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Coetzee, M (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Human Resource Management, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Coetzee, Mariette/JEZ-9738-2023","Coetzee, Mariette/0000-0003-3671-4163",,,,,36,3,7,2,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The conclusions of this study, showing how systemic financial risk in contexts of organized irresponsibility contributes to differential 'risk-classes', suggest that risk is a key source of contemporary inequality and that reconstructing the theory of risk society can illuminate these changes.","[Curran, Dean] Univ Calgary, Dept Sociol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Curran, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Sociol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",dcurran@ucalgary.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [756-2013-0331],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada under Grant 756-2013-0331.,,74,23,24,6,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

There are many Czech manufacturing companies with a huge rate of wasting in manufacturing and logistic processes. Some of them are trying to take advantage of principles of Lean Company for reduce waste in manufacturing and logistic processes. If we want to transfer some company to the Lean Company status, we need to analyse types of wasting in some processes such as manufacturing and logistics and then manage and control process of transformation. The main research goal of this article is analysis of using lean manufacturing and lean logistics concepts in manufacturing companies in the Czech Republic. There will be also mention in which areas of manufacturing and logistics it is the biggest rate of wasting and which methods and tools of industrial engineering are usually used for elimination of wasting in manufacturing and logistics processes. Our data was obtained using a questionnaire survey. The survey took place during summer 2014 in manufacturing companies in the Czech Republic, A total 20 742 online questionnaires were distributed to randomly select Czech manufacturing companies via e-mails. We obtained data from 322 different companies which are analysed in next section of this article. We have analysed data from questionnaires using MS Excel for basic statistics and also IBM SPSS for finding dependencies among data. We have found that the implementation of lean manufacturing and lean logistics is dependent on the size of the company and also on the branch of industry.","[Dolak, Radim; Suchanek, Petr] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Informat & Math, Marvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Dolák, R (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Informat & Math, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Marvina 73340, Czech Republic.",dolak@opfslu.cz; suchanek@opf.slu.cz,"Dolak, Radim/S-5019-2017","Dolak, Radim/0000-0003-4836-3508",,,,,18,1,1,1,11,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,36.0,46,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000004,0

Results of analysis show that scientists choose different approaches to investigate the effect of CSR on corporate results. However, from the marketing perspective, intangible results, such as long-term relationships between company and consumer could be described as a major benefit for company which integrates CSR in corporate activity.

Thus, this paper explores the consideration of FM during the design stage and its influence on achieving sustainability of building facilities in post occupancy phase, and subsequently identifies a set of criteria to evaluate the potential of FM to achieve sustainability of building facilities. A critical review of the literature has been carried out for the purpose of identifying the said variables. Literature review reveals that there is a need to review FM potential of the design during the design phase; mainly due to increased life cycle cost, environmental impact, impact on health and safety and quality of the building facilities during the service life.

In many cases, large-block family owners of public corporations may have a great deal of input in strategic decision-making in large corporations. Previous literature investigates how ownership structure and diversification are connected, but conclusions are not homogeneous. Agency theory suggests that professional managers are fundamentally self-interested, and the public corporation diversifies because managers pursue their own interests, rather than the interest of shareholders. However in family firms, ownership and control use to coincide and family diversification decisions which causes a lower diversification. In this paper authors analyzes the impact of ownership concentration and the influence of ultimate owner's nature of business group (family or non-family) in diversification's decision: specialization, related diversification, unrelated diversification and mixed diversification (when a company uses both related and unrelated diversification) Based on a sample of ninety-nine Spanish listed companies during the years 2000-2005, and using the listed company an their subsidiaries (pyramidal group) as unit of analysis, this research finds: firstly, the highest ownership concentration increases the adoption of specialization strategies and reduce the mixed diversification; Secondly, attending to ultimate owner's nature, family firms adopt more strategies of specialization and related diversification, and less diversification strategies than non-family firms; Finally, results also show behaviour differences in family firms according to ownership concentration's degree: an increasing ownership concentration's degree in family firms rises the probability of diversification.","[Hernandez-Trasobares, Alejandro; Galve-Gorriz, Carmen] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Social & Work Sci, Dept Management, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Hernández-Trasobares, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Social & Work Sci, Dept Management, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",alex@unizar.es; cgalve@unizar.es,"Trasobares, Alejandro Hernández/AAD-4810-2019","Trasobares, Alejandro Hernández/0000-0002-4389-2622",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [Eco2009-13158]; CRE VALOR Group of Research; DGA-FSE,Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); CRE VALOR Group of Research; DGA-FSE,"This paper is part of the results obtained in the framework of the research project Eco2009-13158 financed by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion and the CRE VALOR Group of Research, acknowledged and financed by DGA-FSE.",,77,4,5,2,33,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This is related to highly growing e-commerce market segment, which is further influenced by progressing development in Internet technologies. The necessity of collecting and processing more and more data as well as the need for its analysis causes the advanced software techniques to be indispensable. The classical approach of IT industry to solving complex data processing problems relies on using powerful hardware resources vertical scalability. Such approach suffers limitations when data processing problems are complex enough. These limitations are related to infrastructure costs, system reliability and availability. Modern computer science addresses these limitations with different approach: to utilize multiple hardware resources units to solve complex problems. This led to applications which include Cloud Computing, Big Data and NoSQL. The foundations of such approach are briefly described and compared to the classical one. This paper analyses cases when classical, vertical-scalability based systems are good enough for the applications in e-commerce companies, as well as the cases when modern, horizontal-scalability based approach outperforms the former. Case study is presented and top-level architecture of IT system for an e-commerce enterprise is proposed and analyzed. It is found, that the main business factors that favor the cloud computing applications over the classical approach are: large scale of operations, large geographical coverage, including international and worldwide operations, strict requirements on delivery times, modern business models including consignment stores and delivery services outsourcing. The main benefits are improved scalability and system performance, total cost of ownership reduction and decreased entry barrier. The main challenge is to provide satisfactory guarantees of real-time data consistency in the distributed cloud environment, susceptible to network partitioning. It is expected, that in the long-term the e-commerce companies will increasingly migrate their IT infrastructure to Cloud Computing environments.","[Szajna, Aleksandra; Stryjski, Roman] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Comp Sci & Prod Management, Zielona Gora, Poland; [Szajna, Tomasz] FooAble Sp Zoo, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Szajna, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Comp Sci & Prod Management, Zielona Gora, Poland.",a.szajna@iizp.uz.zgora.pl; stryjski@post.pl; t.szajna@fooable.com,"Stryjski, Roman/AAI-4487-2021",,,,,,8,1,1,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2774.0,2784,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700287,0

We focus on the potential learning effects that bidders may experience over time but also (and particularly) across auctions as a result of their auction participation. Using detailed bid-level information, we find that, similarly to earlier literature, bidders suffer from a sunk cost fallacy, whereby their probability of dropping out of an auction is decreasing in the number of bids they have already placed in that auction. Although we do find that learning through repeated participation alleviates the sunk cost fallacy, participation in simultaneous penny auctions emerges as a much more effective learning mechanism, ultimately contributing toward bidders earning higher individual surpluses.","[Goncalves, Ricardo] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Goncalves, Ricardo] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Fonseca, Miguel A.] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; University of Exeter,"Gonçalves, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.;Gonçalves, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",rgoncalves@porto.ucp.pt; m.a.fonseca@exeter.ac.uk,"Goncalves, Ricardo/B-6098-2009","Goncalves, Ricardo/0000-0002-8457-4479",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank a telecommunications operator (which has requested its identity not to be disclosed) for providing us the bid-level database for the auctions analyzed in this paper.

This paper explains contractual efficiency in the absence of financially guaranteed investments in public private partnerships. The example of a number of African countries underlines how a series of national, normative law reforms can give rise to innovations in approaches to regulation. This new hybrid form of regulation, inspired by a French regulation approach combining commission regulation and franchise bidding, could be more effective than previous approaches to regulation, in the sense of being more stable and more closely aligned with stakeholder expectations. This approach to regulation would appear to be more efficient economically, while integrating the objectives of solidarity tariffs and social water access connections. Based on these analyses, our results show (1) the impact on the robustness of new lease contracts on financing constraints, and (2) the advantages of Asset Owner Companies that reconcile explicit commitments and special purposes. We demonstrate that this achieves optimum efficiency by encouraging parties to determine jointly the optimal level of costs and investment. In addition, the mechanism fosters discussion about the possibility of institutionalizing Asset Owner Companies by predetermining the distribution of risk in lease contracts.","[Nakhla, Michel] MINES ParisTech, UMR CNRS I3 9217, CGS, 60 Bd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Nakhla, M (通讯作者)，MINES ParisTech, UMR CNRS I3 9217, CGS, 60 Bd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France.",michel.nakhla@ensmp.fr,,,,,,,35,3,4,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We use employee representation rules in the otherwise quite similar Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) to elicit information on shareholder preferences for employee representation and board size. We find that shareholders tend to choose board structures that minimize the proportion of employee representatives. In Denmark and Norway employee representation depends on board size, and shareholders choose board sizes that minimize the number of employee representatives. However, many companies have more employee representatives than is mandatory. In Sweden, where the law mandates a fixed number of employee representatives (two or three depending on firm size), shareholders choose to have larger boards. In Finland, where employee representation is not mandatory, < 1 % of companies choose to have it.

The invention of a new integrated frame for the building of an effective supplier evaluation system is a multi-attribute task that consists of several factors as external and internal variables. This paper delivers a creative integrated model of supplier selection problem using SWARA, QFD and a new MCDM tool called WASPAS. This work considers customer attitudes in the process of supplier evaluation. To give more weight to customer requirements, a new SWARA method has been designed; additionally, QFD and the house of quality matrix have been used to transform customer requirements into the supplier evaluation index. Finally, WASPAS has been used to rate the performance of suppliers and present supplier ranking scores.

In the evolving scenario of the service sharing economy we see this with a number of new mobility schemes e.g. vehicle sharing and dynamic ride sharing schemes like Car2Go, DriveNow, BlaBlaCar, Uber, Lyft. We define a Flexible and Shared Use Mobility (FSUM) Agency; a single co-ordination centre of different flexible services and shared mobility schemes, which requires co-ordination and cooperation among different service providers, the integration of data and platforms, technical services and systems.

Firstly, we used the stochastic distance function to measure productive efficiency and productivity change while considering multiple outputs in the railway sector. This method is less used among the studies that compare the performance of railway. Secondly, we calculate the evolution and decomposition of the total factor productivity for European railway. The average rate of productivity showed a slight annual improvement of 27% and the core engine of this was a 25% increase in technical progress. Results by country identify those needing improvement, to be more attractive. Finally, we use a limited dependent variable model to test the impact of rail liberalization process on productive efficiency. Results show that competition tendering improves productive efficiency, whereas free entry delivers the opposite result. Our results also show that competition and the overall liberalization have no impact on productive efficiency. It seems that liberalization process in not the key success factor for the railway industry. Our suggestion is that, in Europe, instead of focusing on rail liberalization process, policy maker should give priority to productivity gains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different perspectives are distinguished: the consumer perspective and the citizen perspective. The consumer perspective is the traditional one in equity analyses, and includes changes in travel costs, travel times and so on. Using data from four European cities, I show that high income groups pay more than low-income groups, but low-income groups pay a larger share of their income. I argue that which of these distributional measures is most appropriate depends on the purpose (s) of the charging system. The citizen perspective is about individuals' views of social issues such as equity, procedural fairness and environmental issues. I argue that an individual can be viewed as a winner from a citizen perspective if a reform (such as congestion pricing) is aligned with her views of what is socially desirable. Using the same data set, I analyse to what extent different income groups win or lose from a citizen perspective - i.e., to what extent congestion pricing is aligned with the societal preferences of high- and low-income groups. It turns out that these differences are small, but overall, middle-income groups win the most in this sense. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Bus priority schemes and techniques on urban roads and highways have proven effective for increasing reliability, efficiency, and faster travel times. This study develops a multi-objective model for selecting an optimal PT priority lanes network that 1) maximizes total travel time savings; 2) maintains balanced origin and destination terminals; and 3) minimizes the construction budget. In contrast to commonly used single objective models, which must be executed numerous times in order to provide the decision-maker with feasible solutions, multi-objective models exhibit a complete set of feasible and optimal solutions with a single execution. Since the major disadvantage of a multi-objective model is the need to select a preferred solution from a set, a multi-criteria approach was developed for: 1) ranking each decision-maker's solutions; and 2) selecting a compromise solution acceptable to a group of decision-makers. This methodology is demonstrated with a case study of Petah Tikva, a medium-sized city in Israel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the main challenges in the water sector typically cut across borders, knowledge development is traditionally organised in national systems. These systems have a long tradition in collaborating across societal sectors. Despite the fact that about half of the collaborations in the Framework Programmes are not proximate at all, we show that all three proximity dimensions contribute to the propensity to collaborate. The three dimensions of proximity are weakly correlated, and there is a small substitution effect between organisational and geographical proximity.","[Heringa, Pieter W.] Minist Econ Affairs, Directorate Gen Enterprise & Innovat, The Hague, Netherlands; [Hessels, Laurens K.; van der Zouwen, Marielle] KWR Watercycle Res Inst, Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Heringa, Pieter W.; Hessels, Laurens K.] Rathenau Inst, The Hague, Netherlands",KWR Watercycle Research Institute; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Rathenau Institute (KNAW),"Heringa, PW (通讯作者)，Minist Econ Affairs, Directorate Gen Enterprise & Innovat, The Hague, Netherlands.;Heringa, PW (通讯作者)，Rathenau Inst, The Hague, Netherlands.",p.w.heringa@minez.nl,,"Hessels, Laurens/0000-0002-6399-7050",,,,,45,15,15,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The tested incentives are direct subsidies, free parking, a separate CO2 tax, an increase of fuel costs by tax elevation, and an increase of available charging infrastructure. By implementing the mobility patterns of the respondents, it was possible to, simulate estimations of ecological impact and modal shift with a random utility model (mixed logit). Based on 875 complete questionnaires, the simulation results show that giving incentives to these buyers ecological rebound effects are expected: Mostly people with a low CO2-emission rate regarding their daily transportation routines (cyclists and public transport users) will exploit these incentives. They show a significantly higher likelihood of choosing alternatively propelled cars than conventional car users. Consumers that usually use a passenger car for their daily mobility routines are mostly unwilling to change to ZEV even when incentives are given. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, this model is applied to a sample of intersections that are required to improve safety. Results have revealed that the proposed model is a suitable tool in selecting efficient projects when tolerances in accident reductions and project cost are incorporated. Comparative study between the proposed model and incremental benefit cost analysis and integer programming methods has also indicated that some changes in the list of selected projects considering the uncertainty impacts of data were observed. This analysis allows such safety projects to be identified. This also provides more complete information for safety analysts to allocate a limit budget to more efficient safety projects.

The availability of automatically collected vehicle movement and demand data enables detecting changes in running times and demand, which may present opportunities to improve service quality and fleet utilization. This research develops a framework to maximize service performance in a set of high-frequency bus routes, given their planned headways and a total fleet size constraint. Using automatically collected data and simulation modelling to evaluate the performance of each route with varying fleet sizes, a greedy algorithm adjusts allocation toward optimality. A simplified case study involving morning peak service on nine bus routes in Boston demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of the approach. A potential application is automated detection of routes operating with insufficient or excessive resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a concept of transaction costs with four dimensions, namely the awarding procedure, the institutional framework, provision of system services, and the impact of learning and innovation. We then identify drivers and amounts of transaction costs in both governance forms. In Germany's competitive model, public transport authorities (PTAs) must guarantee effective competition using different instruments, whereas transaction costs are lowered by clear definition and allocation of responsibilities. In Switzerland's cooperative model, costly competition surrogates serve to overcome information asymmetries. An informal and trusting culture of cooperation prevents high transaction costs. Factors such as complexity of different kinds or unforeseen behaviour of PTAs increase transaction costs in any model. Summing up, our results illustrate that transaction costs are no legitimate argument against competition if the high amounts of subsidies are taken into account. Introducing competition for the market in Switzerland's regional public rail transport, however, would be challenging and trigger high one-time reform costs since it would relate to a radical 'cultural change'.

We introduce Monte Carlo crogging which combines bootstrapping and cross-validation (CV) in a single approach through repeated random splitting of the original time series into mutually exclusive datasets for training. As the training/validation split is independent of the number of folds, the algorithm offers more flexibility in the size, and number of training samples compared to k-fold cross-validation. The study also provides for crogging and bagging: (1) the first systematic evaluation across time series length and combination size, (2) a bias and variance decomposition of the forecast errors to understand improvement gains, and (3) a comparison to established benchmarks of model averaging and selection. Crogging can easily be extended to other autoregressive models.

Along these lines, this paper focuses on the consequences of quality misperception on the market equilibrium, by raising the following question: when quality bias affects consumer choice, do firms have incentives to educate their competitor's customers in order to attract them? To tackle this issue, I incorporate consumer misperception in a Cournot-type duopoly model and consider the consequences on the market outcome. I focus on the two polar cases, when both firms either exploit consumer misperception, or educate completely their rival's customers. I show that the market exerts conflicting forces on the firms' incentives, such as a curse of debiasing might occur even in the presence of substitute goods. Consequently, the opportunity of a legal intervention to trigger consumer education is a key issue.","[Bienenstock, Sophie] Univ Paris 02, CRED, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Bienenstock, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, CRED, Paris, France.",sophie.bienenstock@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

However, in evaluating the marginal likelihoods involved, either inappropriate assumptions have been made, or pre-packaged multivariate adaptive quadrature methods have been employed, without an accuracy assessment. This paper develops variational Bayes methods for estimating lower bounds for these marginal likelihoods efficiently. This facilitates a more accurate version of one existing Bayesian test, and allows for the development of a new test based on the probit regression model. The size and power properties of the proposed methods are examined via a simulation study, illustrating favourable comparisons with existing testing methods. The accuracy and speed of the VB methods are also assessed. An empirical study illustrates the sensible performance and applicability of the proposed methods, relative to standard tests, for assessing the adequacy of a range of forecast models for the Value at Risk (VaR) in several financial market data series.

It was compounded by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, both of whom made the Malthusian struggle for existence the basis of natural selection in the evolutionary process. Malthus argued, without evidence, that human population growth will continue unchecked until regulated by external factors such as hunger and disease. Darwin and Wallace cemented that idea into evolutionary theory. Recent evolutionary biologists have focused on gene frequency as a way to compare the reproductive success of one individual against another within the same species. However, among humans, the true basis of reproductive success is grounded in control of the resources necessary for survival. Humans sometimes adapt to environmental stress by having more children, not fewer, which means that poverty can cause population growth, not the reverse. Recognizing this simple relationship would have helped Darwin resolve a dilemma at the heart of his theory: his expectation that the most successful members of our species would have the most children, an idea contradicted by his observation of large, poor families among the Irish. The evolutionary puzzle can be solved by observing that providing equal access to land enables humans to limit their own fertility. The problem of equal access can be addressed by implementing Henry George's idea of taxing the value of land, thereby preventing hoarding and gross inequality of wealth.",,,,,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

However, there are limited studies in urban areas of developing economies, which can hinder our capacity to formulate sustainable transport policies that are fit for the reality of those countries. In order to fill this gap, this study quantifies the influence of city features and socio-economic and socio-cultural variables on mobility patterns to identify evidence-based policy interventions for promoting more inclusive and sustainable transportation paths. The research estimates the amount of public and private transport (proxied by out-of-pocket travel expenditure) and modal choices, employing multivariate analyses, using a nationally representative household survey from the 98 largest Indian cities. Findings reveal that densification in Indian cities reduces the amount of transport as well as enhances the probability of using public transport. Small and medium sized cities predominantly use private transport, whereas large cities prefer public transport but lack non-motorized transportation. Moreover, income is the most important determinant of the amount of transport and the use of motorized and private transport. The top quintile is the only with positive income elasticity of transport demand. Results show that public and non-motorized transport infrastructures will provide sustainable and inclusive development, besides other co-benefits, such as energy security. Based on these findings, several policy recommendations are proposed to improve the sustainability and inclusivity of urban mobility in Indian cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given such a growth function, the Faustmann model could in theory have multiple optima and hence an interior local minimum solution. To ensure that the rotation age at which the first derivative of the land expectation value equals zero is a maximum, it is often assumed that the growth function is concave in stand age. Yet there is no convincing argument for excluding the possibility of conducting the final harvest before the growth function changes to concave. We argue that under normal circumstances the Faustmann model does not have any interior minimum. It is neither necessary nor proper to assume that the growth function is concave in the vicinity of the optimal rotation age. When the interest rate is high, the optimal rotation may lie in the interval on which the growth function is convex, i.e. before volume or value growth culminates.

Considering that different markets can have different heterogeneous structures and a market's heterogeneous structure can vary over time, we build an adaptive heterogeneous autoregressive model of realized volatility (AHAR-RV), whose lag structure is optimized with a genetic algorithm. Using nine common loss functions and the superior predictive ability test, we find that our AHAR-RV model and its extensions provide significantly better out-of-sample volatility forecasts for the CSI 300 index than the corresponding HAR models.

We also study to what extent such persistence is different from persistence in R&D, so that the former exists on top of the latter. Finally, we deal with the differentiated persistence pattern of collaboration agreements for different types of partners, as well as the possibility of finding persistence across them. We follow a dynamic approach in the analysis of cooperation persistence: We take into account the unobserved individual heterogeneity and address the initial conditions problem.

In this contribution, we intend to use the long-term development of two areas in north ern Scandinavia to explore how externally imposed policies and winter climate variability have influenced the reindeer herd size and pasture state. We do this by comparing the development in two areas that are rather similar ecologically: Tornetrask in northernmost Sweden and Kautokeino (Vest-Finnmark) in northernmost Norway. Climatic and ecological studies as well as commons theory have been use ful tools for understanding the inherent socio-ecological dynamics. Especially the time from 1850 to 1940 includes several short periods when historical sources document combinations of events such as (1) closure of national borders to cross-border herding migrations, (2) relocations of herder households, (3) overutilization of lichen pastures, (4) catastrophic winters, and (5) forced herd reductions. The high number of incidents and actions during this era makes it challenging to disentangle causes and effects. Our main findings are based on the documented effects of international events and consequent government policies and actions in Fennoscandia from 1852 to 1921 which had dramatic consequences, including excessive numbers of reindeer and people in northernmost Sweden, leading to more or less forced relocation southwards in Sweden with cascading effects in large parts of Sapmi. We have found clear indications that this contributed to overutilization of lichen pastures and beyond any reasonable doubt must also have reinforced the effects of several of the documented catastrophic climatic events, especially in areas like Tornetrask to where many families from Finnmark were relocated. From the first border closure in 1852 to the Second World War it thus seems as if the shocks from the political events were the main factor determining the development of reindeer herding in large parts of Sapmi. The political and administrative history is well documented. Our climate data are a unique compilation of climate events based on multiple sources during two centuries, which contribute to the validity of our findings. Our pasture state data from the late-1800s are also based on several sources which support each other. Two new factors influencing the general cyclical pattern have arisen more recently. Motorization has Increased the possibilities for intense pasture utilization and the amplitudes between minimum and maximum herd sizes, while supplementary feeding has the potential to limit the effects of winter climate variability and lichen overutilization.

J,"Yagi, M; Managi, S",,,,"Yagi, Michiyuki; Managi, Shunsuke",,,Demographic determinants of car ownership in Japan,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Car cohort; Demographic determinants; Car ownership in Japan; Car aggregated model,PRICE; MODEL,"This study empirically examines the demographic determinants of car ownership in Japan between 1980 and 2009. Unique car cohort data, composed of the car age and 11 car types, at the prefectural level, is analyzed. The primary reason for examining the demographic determinants of car ownership in Japan is because Japan is projected to face radical demographic changes in the next few decades. These projected changes include depopulation and an aging population with diminishing household size. This study will be the first empirical study of the car cohort model with large countrywide observations in the recent literature. This study classifies the demographic determinants into five categories: (I) longitudinal factors, (II) economic factors, (III) natural factors, (IV) social factors, and (V) other transports. Although some tendencies vary among car types, this study finds the following tendencies of ordinary car ownership (compact four-wheel drive trucks and regular and compact passenger cars). Regarding the longitudinal factors, the long-run effect is much higher than average in the recent literature, whereas the semi elasticity of car age is approximately 7%. Regarding the economic factors, the elasticities of income and fuel price on car ownership tend to be less intense than in earlier studies. Regarding the natural factors of population increase, the elasticities of population and average household size on car ownership tend to be negative. This indicates that a decrease in population and household size in Japan will accelerate car ownership. In addition, the ratio of elderly people has various effects depending on car types. Regarding the social factors of population increase, car ownership tends to be encouraged by the concentration of population within prefecture, and increased and decreased for relatively new (aged 2-11) and old (aged 12+) cars, respectively, by the concentration of population across prefectures. The former is probably due to a composite effect in urban and rural areas, whereas the latter may be a quick update cycle due to an effect of urbanization. Regarding other transports, the degrees of train and bus use tend to be negatively associated with ordinary car ownership. However, these effects are considerably small and often insignificant as in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A standard way of using survey results is plotting the answers to specific questions, or combined indicators thereof, against time. This paper presents the methodology and construction of a graphical representation, the Shipping Climate Tracer, helping to visualize the cyclical stance of the shipping industry. Such graphical representation visualizes and analyzes the state of the shipping market using confidence indicators derived from business surveys. The Shipping Climate Tracer is based on smoothed confidence indicators and plots their levels against their month-on-month changes, resulting in circular, counter-clockwise movements through the four quadrants of the graph. The latter directly corresponds to a turning-point oriented definition of the shipping cycle phases. The Shipping Climate Tracer seems to be a useful and efficient tool for the description and analysis of the shipping cycle as it offers a both reliable and differentiated representation of the current state of the shipping market and helps to detect major turning points in the shipping cycle. As proved in this study the Shipping Climate Tracer shows a very good correlation with the actual metadata regarding the turning points of the four stages of the shipping cycle.","[Gavalas, Dimitris; Syriopoulos, Theodore] Univ Aegean, Sch Business, Shipping Trade & Transport Dept, Chios, Greece",University of Aegean,"Gavalas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Sch Business, Shipping Trade & Transport Dept, Chios, Greece.",dgaval@aegean.gr,"SYRIOPOULOS, THEODORE/F-3434-2011; SYRIOPOULOS, Theodore/AAQ-6204-2021","SYRIOPOULOS, THEODORE/0000-0002-5643-310X; GAVALAS, DIMITRIS/0000-0002-1487-0133",,,,,26,2,2,0,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

In this paper, green TFP of 285 prefecture-level cities in China from 2005 to 2012 was estimated through Malmquist productivity index. Results showed that the annual growth of green TFP in main cities in China is 3.5% and the overall growth declines gradually. Viewed from decomposition of green TFP, technical progress is the main contributor of green TFP growth. Furthermore, the northern coastal region has achieved the highest annual growth of green TFP (4.5%) and the northwest region achieved the lowest growth of green TFP (1.24%), indicating the great regional differences of green TFP and economic growth quality in China. According to analysis on influencing factors of green TFP in main cities, it has been concluded that per-capita urban road area, number of Internet users, proportion of fiscal expenditures, environmental regulation level and technical input are significantly positively correlated with green TFP, while industrial structure and foreign direct investment (FDI) are significantly negatively correlated. Finally, policy suggestions to improve urban green TFP in China were proposed.","[Zhang Jiansheng] Chongqing Three Gorges Univ, Coll Finance & Econ, Chongqing 404120, Peoples R China; [Tan Wei] Chongqing Three Gorges Univ, Coll Publ Management, Chongqing 404120, Peoples R China",Chongqing Three Gorges University; Chongqing Three Gorges University,"Zhang, JS (通讯作者)，Chongqing Three Gorges Univ, Coll Finance & Econ, Chongqing 404120, Peoples R China.",asheng0124@126.com; tanwei0524@126.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [12XGL019],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work is supported by National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 12XGL019).,,22,25,25,10,121,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Transfers are a key component in the successful operation of an integrated system. The role of transfers is two-folds. First, transfers increase the accessibility of various destinations for users. Second, interchanges that facilitate transfers need to be provided in the network at strategic locations to reduce duplication of the PT routes; thus improving the reliability of the network. This work provides a comprehensive review of the studies focusing on mode switch to PT with emphasis on factors influencing commuters' willingness to make transfers. It is categorized into three perspectives: psychological, operational and policy. This qualitative systematic review reveals that the predominant focus of studies related to transfers has been on the operational aspect. The number of studies related to the psychological aspect and the effects of policies, on integrated systems, to encourage ridership of routes with transfers is limited. This is a major shortcoming in our current capability, as without a clear understanding of all three aspects, transfers are unlikely to be designed properly when developing an integrated multimodal system.

The Halliburton Loophole in the 2005 Energy Act exempted all oil and gas development activities, including fracking (hydraulic fracturing), from the Clean Water Act, Clean Drinking Water Act, and other federal statutes. Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings weakened the Clean Water Act's protections of headwaters, streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. In New York State, communities faced with the imminent prospect of fracking by energy companies organized. From 2008-2014, they prevented fracking in New York. Water protection played a major role in energizing community response, In 2015, a fragile, but resilient, ban was declared statewide. In Kentucky, 150 years of coal mining resulted in pollution of many waterways, with hundreds of stream miles buried beneath mountaintop removal debris. Kentuckians have been pushing back since the 1930s to protect communities, farms, and water quality. They remain hopeful in the face of great odds. Urban populations making daily use of cheap, clean water and fossil-fuel-powered energy sources have little knowledge of these struggles. In rural America, the fight to protect communities, lands, and waters from energy exploitation is lifelong.","[Lambert, Hilary A.

This research provides a systematic framework and simulation analysis for designing operations and infrastructure for modern customs and cross-border transport. A case study of the largest customs post of Thailand in terms of cargo traffic, is carried out to portray the procedural steps of the proposed approach. Literature review and in-depth interviews with associated control agencies were conducted to identify required infrastructure components, border clearance procedures and customs formality in light of the ASEAN Economic Community. Linear regression models were developed to predict the future annual volume of traveler and vehicle flow. Simulation models were constructed to justify various operations and designs of key border-crossing facilities, including immigration control booths, vehicle inspection station and truck clearance area. The principles of transport and trade facilitation were adopted to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of border crossing process. The results suggest that split configuration with joint inspections on both sides is the most practicable border control for the customs post where joint customs inspection is performed in the country of entry. To avoid unnecessary traffic interruption by different types of traffic, passenger and freight flow are separated in the design. For personal vehicles, a drive-through border crossing is proposed to allow a driver to obtain immigration and customs checks via the vehicle inspection booths without getting off the car. The analytical framework and simulation analysis proposed in this research is practical and useful for analyzing the design of other customs posts with similar traffic and cross-border patterns.

If the proportion of informed consumers is not too small, then there is an equilibrium at which all consumers trade, there is some pro-firm bias, and, as a result, there is excessive breach. The paper then compares the firm's incentive to include an arbitration clause with the social incentive. The firm's incentive does not mirror the socially optimal incentive: it could have either an excessive or insufficient incentive to include an arbitration clause, but under fairly broad conditions the firm will not choose an arbitration clause when court adjudication would be more efficient.","[Wickelgren, Abraham L.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Wickelgren, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,Searle Institute for Civil Justice at George Mason University,Searle Institute for Civil Justice at George Mason University,"I thank the Searle Institute for Civil Justice at George Mason University for funding.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of survey forecasts for augmenting such methods, in order to reduce the end-of-sample uncertainty that is observed in the resulting gap estimates. We focus on three filtering methods that are employed commonly in business cycle research: the Hodrick-Prescott filter, unobserved components models, and the band-pass filter. We find that the use of surveys achieves powerful improvements in the real-time reliability of the economic activity measures associated with these filters, and argue that this approach is preferable to model-based forecasts due to both its usually superior accuracy in predicting current and future states of the economy and its parsimony.

Market-clearing curbside pricing is rarely implemented and policy makers have tended to make off-street parking provision their main tool to address excessive curbside demand. Research devoted to garage parking is far less well developed, even though public authorities provide both curbside and garage parking that compete with privately operated facilities. In this paper the impact of garage fare and curbside regulation characteristics (fare and type of dedicated spaces) on garage parking demand are investigated. Aggregate occasional and subscribers parking demand is analyzed by means of two different econometric models estimated using a panel from Barcelona's public parking authority (BSM) that covers 34 garage facilities with yearly data for the period 2006-2012. We find that both demand segments show a negative elasticity to garage fare. Only occasional parkers show a clear substitution effect with a curbside premium ((sic)0.55/h). Our finding suggests that the actual pricing efficiency gap in Barcelona can range between (sic)0.45 and (sic)1.05 due to the mismatch between curbside and garage pricing regimes; for which we propose some policy alternatives. This stresses the need for a single integrated market approach to parking management, in order to overcome market distortions and achieve efficiency. Additionally, our results show that the characteristics of curbside parking spaces (allowance and time limits) play a role in garage demand determination, yet pricing is much more efficient trigger for behavioral change.

A first contribution, of more general interest, is to clarify the concept of legal uncertainty, relying on ideas in the literature on Law and Economics, but formalising it by associating legal uncertainty with the information structure of what firms know about the process by which potentially harmful actions are treated by competition authorities. What firms know is clearly distinct, though influenced, from the decision errors made by authorities. We use this framework to show that information structures with legal uncertainty need not imply lower welfare than information structures with legal certainty-a result echoing a similar finding obtained in a completely different context and under different assumptions in earlier Law and Economics literature (Kaplow and Shavell in J Law Econ Organ 8:306-320, 1995). Our second contribution is to revisit and significantly generalise the analysis in our previous paper, Katsoulacos and Ulph (J Ind Econ LVII(3), 2009), involving a welfare comparison of Per Se and Effects-Based legal standards. In that analysis we considered just a single information structure under an Effects-Based standard and also penalties were exogenously fixed. Here we allow (a) for different information structures under an Effects-Based standard and (b) for endogenous penalties. We obtain two main results. Under all information structures (including complete legal uncertainty) an Effects-Based standard dominates a Per Se standard. Moreover, optimal penalties may be higher when there is legal uncertainty than when there is no legal uncertainty. These conclusions run counter to a number of prescriptions by legal scholars in the recent literature.","[Katsoulacos, Yannis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece; [Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Ulph, David] SIRE, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of St Andrews,"Katsoulacos, Y (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece.",ysk@hol.gr; du1@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Katsoulacos, Yannis/AAA-1213-2021","Ulph, David/0000-0003-3171-1270",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-062-23-2211]; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: CoLEG; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H008322/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H008322/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: CoLEG; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for the comments of three referees.

In this paper, we use the observed behaviour of a subset of metro users in Singapore, who are willing to travel a longer time (into the opposite direction or backwards) to secure a seat for the actual trip in the direction towards their destination. We use smart card transactions to estimate the share of users who are willing to travel in the opposite direction during the first part of their trip and the average train occupancy per section to estimate differences in the valuation of travel time sitting and standing - translated into a standing multiplier or standing premium, which is analogous to the crowding multiplier that is usually found in the crowding valuation literature. We find that the standing multiplier is between 1.18 and 1.24 with the current crowding levels in the morning peak and can be as much as 1.55 with a density of 3 standing passengers per square metre. The results are compared to previous SC studies from other countries.

The originality of our approach is a comparative analysis of export intensity between firms in the computer software and manufacturing sectors, using a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation to test for the correct specification of the conditional mean model. Results indicate that larger, younger firms have greater export intensity in the computer software sector than in manufacturing. Research and development expenditure is equally important for export intensity in both sectors, but patent income is not significant. Sourcing managerial advice and expertise from the national development agency is important for firms in the manufacturing industry, but not for computer software firms. It is therefore important for export promotion organisations to publicise supports, as few small firms are aware of their availability.

The ICT enabled business models can be well used by corporates and governments of devel- oping economies in Asia and Africa for capability development of rural masses as these models provide new business opportunities for them. The field survey based framework showed how ICT based business opportunity development model of e-Choupal can affect the income, time and saving of farmers in developing economy.","[Madan, Pankaj] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Ctr Catolica, Lima 33, Peru; [Sharma, Vinay] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India; [Seth, Piyush] Feroz Gandhi Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Raebareli, India",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Madan, P (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Ctr Catolica, Lima 33, Peru.",pmadan@pucp.edu.pe; vinayfdm@iitr.ac.in; piyush21oct@rediffmail.com,", Mobin/D-1273-2014",", Mobin/0000-0003-1940-3822; Madan, Pankaj/0000-0002-4648-9863",,,,,21,5,5,0,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Motivated by recent empirical studies showing a positive relationship between population density and vehicle fuel-efficiency, the consumer is assumed to choose vehicle fuel-efficiency jointly with housing consumption and residential location. By incorporating the consumer's vehicle choice into the urban spatial model, we can represent the total amount of vehicle emissions released by the city residents. We first establish the well-known result that the congestion externality as a source of market failure is associated with excessive urban sprawl. We then show that vehicle emissions are an additional source of market failure, which also leads to excessive urban sprawl. The source of excessive sprawl arising from the emission externality is the use of larger and less-fuel efficient vehicles in more sprawled cities, which is different from that of the congestion externality. We also analyze the effect of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards on urban spatial structure and its efficacy as a second-best tool for correcting the emission externality.

Presidents Nestor and Cristina Kirchner were committed to a debt-reduction policy, yet Argentina faced a new, selective', default in 2014.

The theory should be applied to a wide range of institutions to compete with national and international universities. Diverse educational quality of higher education is now a serious issue in Turkey due to increasing numbers of graduates not being able to find a job despite the availability of many work opportunities. Challenges need to be minimized to create a harmony between quality and financial sustainability in Bingol University. For this study, 130 surveys were carried out at Bingol University out of 500 staffs in 2015. Statistical tools like one-way ANOVA were used to evaluate the degree of institutionalization. Being a new university, having low-qualified academicians, getting low-scoring students from national entrance exam to universities named as LYS, and self interests are major barriers preventing the institutionalization of Bingol University.

But, in order to maximize the benefits of using projects as means of organizing the activity, a special attention should be given to aspects that can influence project success. We consider project governance as being essential to project success and having a positive influence on the development of the organization. The increased frequency and importance of projects nowadays determined a significant focus on projects' governance and its relation with corporate governance.

Using a logistic smooth transition autoregressive model, we find that credit extension in South Africa increases during the trough phase of the business cycle, while this relationship becomes insignificant during the peak phase. The study also finds that credit extension decreases during the expansion phase of the business cycle, while it increases during the contraction phase. Thus, unlike previous studies for South Africa, we do not find any evidence that credit extension is procyclical and that the common reference guide for implementing countercyclical capital buffers should therefore be used with caution. The reason is that the BCBS's proposed measure of credit extension would suggest implementation of capital buffers during contractionary economic conditions and their withdrawal during expansionary economic conditions, which could have adverse consequences for macroeconomic stability.","[Bernstein, James] Genesis Analyt, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Raputsoane, Leroi] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Schaling, Eric] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schaling, Eric] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tshwane University of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Bernstein, J (通讯作者)，Genesis Analyt, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,5,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this chapter we gauge the extension of this reputation damage by looking at the market's reaction to rating actions. Through a standard event-study methodology, we measure the abnormal return of stock prices in the 3-day window centered on the announcement day during the decade 2003-2013. Our thesis is that the market reaction to rating actions should be lower-after the crisis-than it used to be, due to a lack of trust in the reliability of the rating agencies. The evidence strongly supports the thesis. In line with previous literature, we find that-as a consequence of the certification role that many regulations recognize to rating agencies-the abnormal return is stronger when the valuation is near to the border between investment and speculative grade. On the contrary the cumulative abnormal return is significantly lower after the crisis when there is no regulation-induced trading.

However a lower reaction to rating actions emerges also for minor rating agencies due to a general decrease in the trust over private creditworthiness assessment.","[De Vincentiis, Paola; Pia, Patrizia] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"De Vincentiis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy.",paola.devincentiis@unito.it; patrizia.pia@unito.it,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,597.0,610,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_38,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800038,0

In order to find correlation between those determinants, a survey has been conducted on 103 Croatian SMEs (older than 12 months). Their financial data have been derived from their annual reports. The results of this research indicate that there is no relationship between leverage of SMEs and number of competitors in their industry, but USP of their products or services affects their leverage. The results of this research are in the line with pecking order theory. Research results are important for accountants but also for entrepreneurs and those that actively participate in the process of politics and laws creation that are focused on development of small and medium sized companies. Further research focused on influence of financial market (especially underdeveloped financial market) on financial preferences can clarify decision making process on capital structure and sources of financial growth and development of SMEs.","[Delic, Anamarija] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Delic, A (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia.",adelic@efos.hr,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,456.0,463,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500049,0

Some of them have turned out to be statistically significant for the inflow of foreign direct investments into the Visegrad Group countries and, more broadly, to the so called new Member States of the European Union. This study is structured as follows. First, it explores the existing literature on FDI definition and main effects of its inflow into the host country. Subsequently, we discuss the investment attractiveness and its determinants in theory and based on empirical studies. Then we discuss investment attractiveness of New Member States of the European Union in selected international rankings, paying special attention to the positions occupied by the four analysed countries. The final part studies the correlation between selected variables characteristic of investment attractiveness and the inflow of foreign investment. The study is based on statistical methods (Spearman's rank correlation and Pearson correlation). Lastly, we present the key conclusions. They demonstrated that factors important for the inflow of FDI are: infrastructure, market size, availability of suppliers, subcontractors, business partners and State aid schemes, including resources from the European Union budget.","[Dorozynski, Tomasz; Kuna-Marszalek, Anetta] Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Dorozynski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",tdorozynski@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,8,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,180.0,188,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200015,0

To be able to adapt, organizations should, of course, be able to innovate, not just occasionally, but consistently and successfully. Mastering the process of innovation requires identifying the factors that support and hamper the achievement of innovations. However, the success of such process depends usually on the quality of the best opportunity identified, which is not enough. Otherwise, the divergence of study topics relating to the innovation concept highlights the need for a research and delivery framework that allows its systematic investigation, structuration, management and continuous improvement. Yet, what is not measurable cannot be neither managed nor improved. To achieve the sustainable success, organizations need to ensure a more systematic approach to innovation as it has the potential to complements market based competition by achieving interoperability and agreeing on requirements and measures for economic, social and environmental performance. Accordingly, this paper identifies three complementary components underlying a systematic innovation performance framework: (1) Innovation Actor that aims to organize the innovation competencies and the related roles and activities into meaningful, exhaustive, and mutually-exclusive clusters; (2) Innovation Knowledge Unit that aims to shed lights on the noteworthy achievements of the innovation actions using a broad spectrum of key characteristics; (3) Innovation Context that aims to emphasize the contextual factors that impact the innovation performance and enhance the organizational continuous renewal ability.","[El Bassiti, Lamyaa; Ajhoun, Rachida] Mohammed V Univ, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat,"El Bassiti, L (通讯作者)，Mohammed V Univ, Rabat, Morocco.",elbassitilamyaa@gmail.com; ajhoun@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,4248.0,4262,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700426,0

In this context, it was found that Web 2.0 platforms present a lot of benefits. In fact, it has been shown that they promote students' engagement in the learning process, foster communication, interaction and collaboration among students and between teachers and students, and they serve as a valuable digital library in which any user can have access to a wide range of teaching and learning materials. Nevertheless, there are many human, technical and technological stumbling blocks that seem to hinder the integration of Web 2.0 in education. Despite all these barriers, we strongly believe that the opportunities that these technologies offer outweigh all these obstacles. Accordingly, given that students are immersed in these online platforms, policymakers, education experts and teachers should all collaborate to ensure the successful incorporation of these social online platforms in education environments.","[Faizi, Rdouan; El Fkihi, Sanaa] Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat,"Faizi, R (通讯作者)，Mohammed V Univ Rabat, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco.",r.faizi@um5s.net.ma; s.elfkihi@um5s.net.ma,"EL FKIHI, Sanaa/KBQ-2521-2024; Faizi, Rdouan/GLV-1575-2022; Faizi, Rdouan/V-8655-2019",,,,,,27,8,8,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3242.0,+,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700330,0

The study questions whether there is an effect of perceived value, perceived usefulness and culture on the intention to patronise halal restaurants and whether religiosity moderates the relationship among these variables. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors that influence Muslim customers' intention to patronise halal restaurants. The study specifically investigates the relationships among perceived value, perceived usefulness, culture, religiosity and intention to patronise halal restaurants. The study is based on a sample of 323 halal restaurant consumers. The questionnaire measures the following variables: perceived value, perceived usefulness, vertical collectivism, horizontal collectivism, vertical individualism, horizontal individualism, religiosity and intention to patronise halal restaurants. The study shows that both perceived value and perceived usefulness have a direct influence on behavioural intention to patronise halal restaurants. In regards to the effect of collectivism and individualism, only horizontal collectivism and vertical individualism have a direct influence on purchase intention. The current study also finds that religiosity moderates the relationship among perceived value, perceived usefulness, horizontal collectivism and horizontal individualism with respect to behavioural intention. The study shows that the Muslim intention to patronise halal restaurants is influenced by the perceived value, perceived usefulness of halal restaurants and culture which is also moderated by the Muslim level of religiosity.

The evidence shows that Hoan's long tenure as mayor came in spite of, not because of, his socialism.

International migration, one of the most important frontiers of globalization, represents a major challenge globally, with significant economic consequences, especially for Europe, where large migrant flows have emerged in the context of European integration, and moreover recently due to increased waves of refugees and asylum seekers targeting Germany, Austria, Sweden or Turkey as main destination countries, through Eastern and Central Mediterranean or Western Balkans routes. The analysis is based on developing various double-log fixed and random effects models, as well as dynamic models, using a panel structure that covers five main EU destination countries (Germany, Austria, Sweden, Italy and Spain) and three New EU Member States since 2007 and 2013 (Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia) and a complex set of indicators (national accounts - GDP total, per capita, per person employed; labour market - employment, unemployment, wages, secondary and tertiary education; migration specific data - immigration flows and stocks, asylum seekers and refugees, emigrant stocks), compiled during 2000-2014. Moreover, we used a SEM model (Structural Equations Modelling) in order to better capture the labour market impacts of international migration for the selected EU countries. The models are processed through OLS, GLS and MLE methods, as well as by using panel corrected standard errors, and are completed by within and out-of-sample predictions. The results show that immigration flows have important economic consequences leading to significant changes in labour market performances (slight decrease in employment rates and wage levels), which largely vary from one country to another, so on the long-run, the negative effects of immigration tend to predominate. From the emigration perspective, the findings show positive effects of labour emigration on sending countries, by upgrading the living standards for those remaining, mainly through remittances.","[Georgiana, Noja Gratiela; Liana, Son] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Georgiana, NG (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania.",gratiela.noja@e-uvt.ro; liana.son@e-uvt.ro,"Noja, Gratiela/X-2471-2019","Noja, Gratiela/0000-0002-9201-3057",,,,,20,0,0,1,29,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,56.0,66,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500007,0

Moreover, the analysis considers business size as a key control variable to understand the moderating role of collaboration in innovation success. A survey administered to Spanish firms from industrial, building, agriculture, and trade-service sectors measured two levels of innovation, incremental and radical, and two dimensions of collaboration, channel and consulting advice. The findings show that the probability of success increases when firms use collaboration to support innovation efforts. In addition, small businesses take more advantage of channel collaboration, whereas large businesses rely more on consulting advice-based collaboration. These findings suggest that the convenience of different collaboration approaches depend on business size. Also small and large firms differ on the way they might get additional advantages from alternative ways of collaboration. Therefore, the main contribution is the understanding of how innovation success depends on the interaction between the collaboration approach and business size.","[Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar; Munoz-Gallego, Pablo A.; Garcia-Zamora, Evelyn] Univ Salamanca, IME Interdisciplinary Inst Enterprise, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"González-Benito, O (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, IME Interdisciplinary Inst Enterprise, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",oscargb@usal.es; pmunoz@usal.es; evelyngarciaz@yahoo.com,"Muñoz-Gallego, Pablo Antonio/L-4904-2014; Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar/K-4673-2014","Muñoz-Gallego, Pablo Antonio/0000-0003-4531-2051; Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar/0000-0002-0586-556X",,,,,49,21,35,4,48,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Consumer ethnocentrism has its roots in sociology and is about appropriateness, indeed morality, of purchasing foreign-made goods and services. Ethnocentric consumers are reluctant to make use of services provided by foreign companies, because of a sense of loyalty towards their home country and fear of harmful effects imports may have on their domestic economy situation. The study is intended to investigate the level of consumer ethnocentrism and relationship between consumer socio-demographic characteristics and ethnocentric tendencies in three Polish service markets (insurance, medical and airline). The key findings of the research revealed that consumer ethnocentric tendencies exist in analyzed service markets with varied level. With regard to socio-demographic factors, the results of the study confirmed in all three services markets the significant differences of education, place of living and assessment of the financial situation to consumer ethnocentric tendencies, contrary to gender an household size. In case of other socio-demographic factors different findings are reported in the three analyzed markets.","[Hat, Agnieszka] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Consumer Res, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Hat, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Consumer Res, Katowice, Poland.",a.hat@poczta.fm,,,,,,,47,1,1,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,427.0,447,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_33,0.0,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900033,0

The data was collected using the critical incident technique (CIT), with 20 semi-structured interviews carried out in four multidisciplinary universities of applied sciences in Finland. We show that there are problems related to self-interested behaviour, avoiding/neglecting responsibilities, hidden agendas, gaps between targets and resources, and relationship problems among staff members, as well as questionable behaviour on the part of trade union representatives. The paper suggests that ethical problems are common and need to be set against a long history of unresolved background issues in the institutions.

The sample consisted of 139 certified public accountants and 106 managers of companies where they work. The techniques and instruments used for data collection were a direct survey with 21 items using a Likert Scale.

The current process was then analyzed and the result shows the obstacles and constrains facing the supply chain of the SME. Originality/value- This research develops a model that suits SMEs in the Egyptian market. The use of a Case Study approach with an object oriented tool, namely UML, makes this a thorough investigation that helps decision makers in Egyptian SMEs make better informed decisions.

Tehran suffers severely from congestion and air pollution, which is caused primarily by private vehicles. To mitigate these problems, Transportation Demand Management (TDM) policies should be instituted across the city to reduce private car usage. However, the acceptability of these policies is a major concern for policy-makers. The goal of this research was to gauge individual opinions with regards to the increasing petrol price policy, followed by a comparison of these opinions with other TDM pricing policies, including cordon pricing or parking pricing. To do this, we conducted a survey of 366 car commuters in Tehran. Throughout the analysis of collected data, it was observed that increasing petrol price was the least acceptable of the above policies. In order to identify the effects of trip-related and socio-economic characteristics of car commuters on their acceptance of increasing petrol price, we developed an ordered logit model and identified the most significant factors affecting commuters. Next, we suggested policies that could lead to better acceptance of the increasing petrol price policy. This examination of the acceptability of TDM pricing policies helps policymakers to understand how pricing policies will have a greater chance of successful implantation and acceptance by the general public, thus allowing them to make informed policy implementation decisions.

The former wanted to continue the public-private partnerships that characterized much of 19th-century state building, while the latter maintained that this system inevitably led to corruption and exacerbated inequality, calling for a new system of publicly run programs. Mayor Samuel Jones of Toledo worked to expand municipally owned utilities and transportation. Jones argued that granting franchises for the provision of public services enabled private companies to accrue profits that belonged to the people. He actively promoted an alternative model based on his faith in the potential of government, through a program of public ownership, to exemplify a sense of community, brotherhood, and love. Yet obstruction by the city council and lack of mayoral power blocked his efforts. As a result, he attempted to secure a strong mayor charter that would enable him to enact his program. The voters, however, rejected the plan, fearing centralization of power and loss of popular accountability. This outcome highlights the importance of the relationship between electoral structures and functional expansion in American political development.","Harvard Univ, Writing Program, Boston, MA USA; [Liazos, Ariane] Harvard Univ, Social Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Liazos, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Social Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,57,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The use of new information technologies has a positive impact on improving communication, collaboration, ways of working that are smart and production streamlining with direct impact over labor productivity growth and reduced selling prices in favor of customers who are increasingly more satisfied.

The following activities are emphasized - setting of strategic goals, analysis, and prognostication, the choice of strategy and its implementation, as well as the feedback. The research deals individually with the issue of management participation in the strategic planning activities and raises the question of their documentation. The significance of strategic planning activities can be identified through the achieved strategic results, i.e. innovativeness and development. The article presents an empiric research with Kaunas city sport clubs as its participants. Though the analysis showed that strategic planning activities are itemized, the process of their analysis should include distinguishing the main activities that would cover other more detailed ones. Strategy results reflected in service innovativeness, network, client scope, and workplace development, could be signified as an individual strategic planning element showing the significance of planning activities. When researching the strategic planning and management aspects of sport organizations, it was discovered that the importance of strategic activities for the results of these organizations is statistically significant. Sport organizations are oriented towards all strategic management activities and are striving to create results directed to development. The following strategic activity aspects are appropriately evaluated - organizations give sufficient attention to the process of strategic management, its formalization and documentation and innovative results are achieved. The insufficient understanding of connection between goal setting and strategic planning and management activities carried out in an organization could be distinguished as a negative aspect.","[Petkovic, Jovica] Univ Montenegro, Fac Sport & Phys Educ, Niksic, Montenegro; [Jasinskas, Edmundas; Jeseviciute-Ufartiene, Laima] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sport Educ, Dept Sport Management Econ & Sociol, Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Montenegro; Lithuanian Sports University,"Petkovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Fac Sport & Phys Educ, Niksic, Montenegro.",Jovica.petkovic@gmail.com; edmundas.jasinskas@lsu.lt; laima1981@yahoo.com,"Jasinskas, Edmundas/JYO-6178-2024; Petkovic, Jovica/HPD-2505-2023; Jeseviciute-Ufartiene, Laima/A-1442-2018","Jasinskas, Edmundas/0000-0003-3158-2974; Petkovic, Jovica/0000-0001-5863-9008; Jeseviciute-Ufartiene, Laima/0000-0001-9054-368X",,,,,63,2,7,11,50,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The article uses the following methods: survey, modelling, statistical analysis and evaluation of corporate loan data. In the scientific literature, expert methods are usually applied in the analysis of the issues of credit risk model construction. However, the expert approach does not reflect the external environment, therefore, such methods cannot ensure high accuracy and can lead to significant losses for credit providers. For this reason, the authors have taken a different approach. Firstly, seeking to investigate business needs, expectations and risk tolerance of credit unions, a survey of these market players was conducted. The authors of this article surveyed 56 of existing 74 credit unions in Lithuania. Secondly, the Markov chain method for bad loan definition and ever delinquency curves, based on a cohort analysis for definition of optimal loan performance window were applied to a corporate loan data set from the credit union sector. The survey has shown that credit unions are inhomogeneous in terms of tolerance of credit risk; most credit unions specified 90 days past due as a major bad loan indicator. However, a quantitative analysis shows that loans that reached 30 or 60 days past due in the first year, are characterised by a high probability of migrating to a worse state. In order to meet business needs of credit unions, we set 60 days past due as a major bad loan definition criterion and 25 months as an optimal loan performance window. The research results will contribute to the development of a state-of-the-art credit risk assessment and pricing model, suitable for use by credit unions having regard to the challenging modern financial market.","[Spicas, Renatas; Vijunas, Mindaugas; Kanapickiene, Rasa] Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Spicas, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",renatas.spicas@gmail.com,"Kanapickiene, Rasa/C-5928-2015","Kanapickiene, Rasa/0000-0001-6083-2894",,,,,48,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,713.0,727,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200062,0

The factors which influence customer satisfaction are image, customer expectation, perceived quality, perceived value and complaints. The research was carried out on a sample of 99 enterprises from the food industry in the Czech Republic and a sample of their customers. Performance was assessed using the financial indicators ROA, ROE and asset turnover (ATO). Customer satisfaction was determined using a questionnaire. Within the research, companies were divided into performing and underperforming using the financial indicators, and statistically significant differences in customer satisfaction were subsequently determined using a questionnaire for both groups of enterprises. It was found that these differences exist both within direct customer satisfaction and within almost all of the indirectly monitored satisfaction factors. The research shows that performing companies achieved higher customer satisfaction, including higher (better) image, customer expectation, perceived quality and value, and complaints (for this factor, a better result was a lower level of complaints).","[Suchanek, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Kralova, Maria] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Suchánek, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",suchycz@yahoo.com; kralova@econ.muni.cz,"Králová, Maria/D-1801-2014; Suchanek, Petr/R-9626-2019","Králová, Maria/0000-0001-8515-8402; Suchanek, Petr/0000-0002-2606-4040",,,,,15,1,1,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8348-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,96.0,104,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG1ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387180500012,0

John Connor, however, noted that the Korean [Fair Trade Commission] has the best record of anti-cartel enforcement in Asia. 1 In this article, we examine several datasets to investigate whether antitrust enforcement in Korea, especially anti-cartel activity, has had a price-limiting impact over the past couple of decades. We compare the behavior of firms and industries that have been subject to antitrust investigation to those that have not. We examine the response of the firms and industries under antitrust investigation following the cases. The results presented here are consistent across two very different data sets of indicators for the Korean economy. The results suggest that long-term deterrence is unlikely to be observed from antitrust investigations, although the impact on short-term price and profit margin may be expected. However, the stronger effects observed suggest that firms in Korea have begun to pay more attention to the actions of the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) over the past decade since the more rigorous enforcement of antitrust.","[Feinberg, Robert M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Park, Minsoo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",American University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Feinberg, RM (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",feinber@american.edu; minsoopark@skku.edu,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant from the Korean government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964]; Center for Economic Research of Korea (CERK),National Research Foundation of Korea Grant from the Korean government(National Research Foundation of Korea); Center for Economic Research of Korea (CERK),"Earlier versions of this article were presented at a conference on Regulatory Reform, Innovation, and the Future of the Korean Economy at Sungkyunkwan University in May 2014 and at the Southern Economic Association meetings in Atlanta, Georgia, in November 2014.

J,"Hall, T; Joergensen, F",,,,"Hall, Thomas; Joergensen, Frederick",,,Legal variation and capital structure: comparing listed and non-listed companies,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Legal origin; Creditor rights; Leverage; Debt maturity,FINANCE; INSTITUTIONS; LAW,"We exploit the natural institutional variation in Western Europe to examine leverage (and debt maturity) for listed and non-listed companies (NLCs). We find that the legal efficiency measure (Djankov et al. 2008) is more closely related to the amount of leverage and debt maturity than is the creditor rights score of La Porta et al. (Law and Finance, NBER working paper 5661, 1996; J Financ 52:1131-1151, 1997). One component of the standard measure of creditor rights was consistently and positively associated with leverage: whether secured creditors are paid first in the event of distress. Firms located in French and German legal family countries have less leverage than companies in common law setting, but Scandinavian firms have more. Asset specificity has a negative impact on leverage, but a positive impact on debt maturity. Finally, using a matched sample of otherwise similar privately held companies, we find that listed firms have less debt, consistent with a corporate governance interpretation that presumably more dispersed publicly traded firms are more likely to avoid the disciplining device of leverage.

In particular, we analyse methods facilitating the recombination of traditional elements into new products. Accordingly, we conducted an inductive qualitative research, based on five case studies represented by Italian restaurants awarded with three Michelin stars. Findings reveal how traditional elements may be combined with elements coming from different and distant cultures. In addition, the elements of tradition may be the only source of innovation if atypical links are established among them. Our results mainly contribute to shed new light on the dynamics which allow to achieve the equilibrium between familiarity and novelty in cultural and creative industries where products suffer a rapid obsolescence. Finally, we advance the debate on tensions created by the inclusion of novelties in traditions by proposing method facilitating combinations.","[Petruzzelli, Antonio Messeni; Savino, Tommaso] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Petruzzelli, AM (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",antonio.messenipetruzzelli@poliba.it,"Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","Messeni Petruzzelli, Antonio/0000-0002-6852-5167",,,,,132,53,55,4,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

In large pharmaceutical mergers, cumulative abnormal returns on portfolios of rivals predict postmerger changes in the combined firm's research and development (R&D) intensity. More favorable impacts on rivals are associated with lower intensities, which is consistent with softening competition. Matching merging firms to similar nonmerging firms suggests that we can attribute the changes in R&D intensity to the mergers. We highlight the importance of deducting expenses associated with in-process R&D and provide guidance on how to define rivals, construct portfolios, and use event studies in merger evaluations.","[Filson, Darren; Olfati, Saman] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA USA; [Radoniqi, Fatos] Whittier Coll, Whittier, CA USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Filson, D (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA USA.",,,,Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Claremont McKenna College,Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Claremont McKenna College,"Filson thanks the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Claremont McKenna College for financial support, and we thank Sherry Shen and Ike Thomas for research assistance.

Does the national origin of migrants matter for long-term development? This article explores whether the distinct geographic settlement patterns of European migrants according to national origin affected economic development across U.S. counties. It uses microdata from the 1880 and 1910 censuses in order to identify where migrants from different nationalities settled and then regresses current levels of economic development on settlement patterns according to national origin, using both ordinary least squares and instrumental variable approaches. The analysis controls for a number of factors that would have determined the attractiveness of different U.S. counties at the time of migration as well as current levels of development. The results indicate that while there is a strong and positive impact associated with overall migration, differences in the quality of the institutions of the countries of origin of the migrant are not necessarily a good predictor for current levels of economic development of U.S. counties.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres; von Berlepsch, Viola] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk; viola.vberlepsch@googlemail.com,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",European Research Council under the European Union [269868]; European Research Council (ERC) [269868] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are indebted to David Rigby, the editor in charge, and to the four anonymous reviewers for their numerous and constructive comments to previous versions of the manuscript.

However, in the light of very limited empirical studies about port economics for Africa, this paper aims at identifying the major determinants of competitiveness of the African seaport systems. This was accomplished using Principle Component Analysis. Based on 7-year longitudinal data for 14 countries in North and West Africa, this study shows that handling costs, connectivity, capacity and the quality of port infrastructure are important in explaining port competitiveness. As expected, North African seaports were found to be more competitive than those in the West. This article provides an important literature review on port competitiveness. The empirical study can also contribute substantially to the knowledge of the African seaport systems and be useful for African port policy development and management.","[Abbes, Souhir] Fac Management & Econ Sfax, Dept Econ, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,"Abbes, S (通讯作者)，Fac Management & Econ Sfax, Dept Econ, Sfax, Tunisia.",souhir.abbes@idoud.com,"yuhao, luo/HGC-3140-2022","Abbes, Souhir/0000-0001-8716-8591",,,,,81,11,12,0,22,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The leadership of these foundations was part of the eastern foreign policy establishment that initially mobilized support for a globalist, anti-isolationist agenda and after World War II worked to construct a viable intellectual framework promoting American perspectives in world affairs. The development of foundation leadership in international relations took place in three phases with different emphases, aimed at softening the sharper edges of globalization and elite dominance to retain public legitimacy: 1) shifting American public opinion from the 1920s to the 1950s in favor of liberal internationalism and a strong national government, 2) creating an integrated global elite from the 1950s to the 1970s that could serve as conduits for American interests within the institutions of each nation, and 3) developing democratic reforms in response to neoliberalism after 1980 to gain legitimacy for the international order, in order to sustain the idea that the political and economic systems work for everyone. In this fashion, foundations were able publicly to espouse principles of self-determination and economic development for every nation, even though their actions paved the way for the continuation of neocolonialism.","City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England",City University London,"Parmar, I (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England.",,,,,,,,38,6,10,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate what kind of self-reinforcing mechanisms can be present in such industries and explain how multiple paths can coexist and interact in a context of self-reinforcement and, ultimately, path dependency. Building on the empirical example of the lighting industry, the paper shows that all previously recognized types of self-reinforcing mechanisms can be present in a multi-technology industry. However, in addition to the path-internal positive feedbacks and cross-path negative externalities identified in single-path settings, multi-technology industries also experience positive cross-path externalities that create a symbiotic relationship between alternatives and allow for the reproduction of the same development pattern across technologies. Due to the existence of such non-negative technology interactions, multi-technology industries can be path dependent while still retaining technological variety.","[Onufrey, Ksenia; Bergek, Anna] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Bergek, Anna] Linkoping Univ, KITE Res Program, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Onufrey, K (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",ksenia.onufrey@liu.se,"Bergek, Anna/A-3279-2009","Bergek, Anna/0000-0003-1952-902X",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond via the KITE research program [M2006-0231],Riksbankens Jubileumsfond via the KITE research program(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),The study on which this article is based was partially supported by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond via the KITE research program [grant number M2006-0231].,,83,24,27,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

However, due. to the recently observed plateau of total car travel in many high income countries, it has been argued that other factors, such as changes in preferences, attitudes and life-styles, have become more important drivers of car use. This paper shows that the two variables, GDP per capita and fuel price, explain most of the aggregate trends in car distances driven per adult in Sweden: as much as 80% over the years 2002 to 2012. The estimated elasticities are well in line with previous literature and can reasonably well reproduce the trend in car distances driven per adult back to 1980. We find, however, a substantial variation in elasticities between municipalities depending on public transport supply, population density, share of foreign-born inhabitants and the average income level.

Various arguments have been formulated in order to justify or criticize this compensation, but the possible incentive effects of this compensation on criminal behavior has not yet been considered. This paper analyzes these effects, focusing on the case where detention was lawfully and diligently carried out by State agents, and not having been caused by negligence on the part of the detainee. The paper shows that such compensation can either deter crime or encourage it, depending inter alia on the standard of evidence used to decide whether to compensate or not.

Forecasts from simple linear models and forecasts from Markov regime-switching models with constant and with time-varying transition probabilities are constructed in real time and compared on forecast accuracy.

While allowing preferences to be incoherent, he wants to maintain the anti-paternalist stance of orthodox welfare economics. His standard, though, presupposes that people respond to uncertainty about their own future preferences by dismissing any kind of self-constraint. We argue that the approach lacks psychological substance: Sugden's normative benchmark - the 'responsible person' - can hardly serve as a convincing role model in a contractarian setting.

The contribution of this paper is in addressing various selectivity problems while quantifying the impact of return migration on wages of returnees using non-experimental data. Using Egyptian household-level survey data, I estimate the wages of return migrants controlling for several selectivity biases arising from emigration choice, return migration choice, labor force participation choice, and occupational choice following return. The findings provide strong evidence that overseas temporary migration results in a wage premium upon return, even after controlling for the various potential selection biases. However, the estimates underscore the significance of controlling for both emigration and return migration selections. Ignoring the double selectivity in migration would overestimate the impact of return migration on the wage premium of returnees, as migrants are positively selected relative to non-migrants, but returnees are negatively selected among migrants.","Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Sch Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Wahba, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Sch Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",j.wahba@soton.ac.uk,,"Wahba, Jackline/0000-0002-0002-3443","Economic Research Forum (ERF); Economic and Social Research Council [RES-167-25-0678]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I033521/1, ES/K007394/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K007394/1, ES/I033521/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic Research Forum (ERF); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),I would like to thank the editor and three anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Our paper offers theoretical support for recent empirical results that point to an inverted-U shape relationship between competition and innovation. The model presents an optimal timing decision problem where a firm endowed with an idea trades the benefits of waiting for additional information on whether this idea can be converted into a successful project against the cost of delaying innovation: a given firm's profit following innovation is decreasing in the number of firms that invested at earlier dates. By recognizing that a firm can intensify its innovative activity on two dimensions, a risk dimension and a quantitative dimension, we show that firms solve this trade-off precisely so as to generate the inverted-U shape relationship. The dynamic setup of our model offers insights not just in the cross-section on the relationship between competition and innovation, but also intertemporally on the optimal timing of innovation at firm level.","Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Barbos, A (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 East Fowler Ave,CMC 206, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",andreibarbos@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,2,4,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Reacting to the global shock of the economic crisis that began in 2008, East Asian capitalism has remained a distinct state-led model that differs substantially from the liberal, neo-corporatist or welfare state varieties of capitalism in the West. More specifically, this paper studies the fiscal stimulus packages implemented by East Asian countries to address the global financial crisis from 2008 to 2010. We find that East Asian fiscal stimulus packages were comparatively large and supply-side-oriented. Unlike in the West, where a (short-lived) revival of demand-side-oriented Keynesian strategies stimulating consumption could be observed, East Asian countries reinforced industrial policies and supported investment and international competitiveness. We argue that the East Asian variety of crisis management can largely be explained by a path-dependent transformation of the East Asian developmental state into a neo-developmental competition state.","Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120750, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Kalinowski, T (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, 52 Ewhayeodae Gil, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",kalinowski.thomas@gmail.com,"Kalinowski, Thomas/ABI-4352-2020","Kalinowski, Thomas/0000-0002-8334-3337",,,,,76,26,27,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Recent literature also underlines its costs, opening the possibility of a non-biunivocal way in which the degree of political competition affects economic growth. The parallel between economic and political competition allows the use of the normalized Herfindahl index as a measure of competition among political parties. Within the Italian regional elections scenario from 1980 to 2008, our findings confirm an inverted-U relationship between the degree of political competition and the regional growth rate. An optimal level of political competition allows for a reduction in the trade-off between political accountability and government instability. Moreover, political competition can be used as a tool for the growth enhancement of political corruption. However, the question posed by the findings is how to drive political competition to its optimal value.","[Alfano, M.

Moreover, the profession has an incentive to maintain a good collective reputation as this increases the clients' willingness to pay for legal services and, therefore, the rent that accrues to lawyers as a whole.","[Chaserant, Camille] Univ Havre, EA 7263, EDEHN, F-76600 Le Havre, France; [Chaserant, Camille; Harnay, Sophie] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX, CNRS, UMR 7235, F-92001 Nanterre, France",Universite Le Havre Normandie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Paris Nanterre,"Harnay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX, CNRS, UMR 7235, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",camille.chaserant@univ-lehavre.fr; sophie.harnay@u-paris10.fr,"Harnay, Sophie/ABB-8027-2021","Harnay, Sophie/0000-0001-7546-1846; chaserant, camille/0000-0002-3543-439X","Mission de recherche Droit et Justice, French Ministry of Justice","Mission de recherche Droit et Justice, French Ministry of Justice","The authors gratefully acknowledge comments from the participants to the conferences of the European Association of Law and Economics (Paris, 2010), the Canadian Law and Economics Association (Toronto, 2010), the Journees de l'Association Francaise de Sciences Economiques (Besancon, 2011), the 23rd SASE Annual Conference (Madrid, 2011), the Conference of the International Society for New Institutional Economics (Firenze, 2013), and the workshop The professions between regulation and competition: interdisciplinary approaches held at the University Paris Ouest Nanterre La Defense (Paris, 2013).

We prove that the initial quality differential between the original and the pirated product is essential to explain the effects of an increase in the quality of pirated product on both the level of piracy and the optimal monitoring rate. Assuming a one-stage entry process and a sufficiently high quality differential, we show that the incumbent always prefers to move first and make a credible commitment to a price.

These individuals vote to accept or reject the monetary offer made to them by the proposer, who needs the agreement of a qualified majority. The voters rejecting the offer while the qualified majority is met are frozen out but they can claim compensation in exchange for their asset. This article analyses how compensation rules influence both the votes and the offer made by the proposer. The existence of a symmetric subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is ensured, and multiple equilibrium outcomes with the same offer can arise when compensation depends on the probability of acceptance by the voters. We show that increasing the offer does not always increase the probability of acceptance, in sharp contrast to many similar models. We identify the equilibrium offer when compensation does not depend on the proposal. Increasing compensation always reduces the expected social surplus and the proposer's expected profit, but does not always benefit the voters. Reinforcing the qualified majority always increases the proposer's expected profit, and can lower both the expected social surplus and the voters' expected utility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We also find significant changes in the size of firms' operations within markets over time. These changes in relative size are largely the result of expansion or contraction by incumbents rather than the result of firm entry or exit. In fact, entry and exit are quite rare, except by small firms. Moreover, only in small markets do new entrants gain substantial market share.","[Hanner, Daniel; Hosken, Daniel; Olson, Luke M.] US Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA; [Smith, Loren K.] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Hanner, D (通讯作者)，US Fed Trade Commiss, 600 Penn Ave,NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",dhanner@ftc.gov; dhosken@ftc.gov; lolson@ftc.gov; LSmith@CompassLexecon.com,,,,,,,28,17,19,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Unlike previous research in this area which relies on assumptions strong enough to obtain point identification, this paper imposes relatively weak nonparametric assumptions that provide tight bounds on treatment effects. Even in the absence of a parametric model, under certain specifications, a zero effect can be ruled out, though after a bias correction this result is lost. In general the results for the effect on yearly earnings align well with previous findings, though the estimated effect on weeks worked are smaller than in previous findings which focused on the effects of incarceration. The bounds here indicate the penalty from convictions, but not incarceration, lowers weeks worked by at most 1.55 weeks for white men and at most 4 weeks for black men. Interestingly, when those ever incarcerated are removed from the treatment group for black men, there does not appear to be any effect of convictions on earnings or wages but only on weeks worked.

This represents a myopic comprehension of the interaction of firms under capitalism. This article argues, in contrast, that lead firm chain governance and supplier firm upgrading attempts constitute strategies and practices that reproduce global poverty and inequality. Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction represents a starting point in undertaking this endeavour. However, his formulation of capitalist competition ignores class and global economic relations. A Marxian conception of creative destruction, in contrast, rests upon an understanding of globally constituted class relations, which provides a novel perspective in comprehending and investigating processes that re-produce global poverty and inequality. The article substantiates these claims by examining cases of buyer-driven global commodity chains, and lead firm strategies of increasing labour exploitation throughout these chains.","Univ Sussex, Ctr Global Polit Econ, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Selwyn, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Ctr Global Polit Econ, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",b.selwyn@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,109,46,50,0,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

However, at the same time, independent directors commonly engage in numerous outside activities potentially reducing their time and commitment with the particular firm. Using Tobin's Q as an approximation of market valuation and controlling for endogeneity, our empirical analysis reveals that neither is independence positively related to firm performance nor are outside activities negatively related to it. Nevertheless, we find that - non-independent - executive directors, former executives and family representatives have a positive relationship with Tobin's Q. Conversely, - independent - outside executives are negatively related with firm valuation. Moreover, the study indicates that the frequency and duration of meetings are negatively affected by the fraction of executive directors on the board. Insiders potentially reduce the need for meetings because of their specialist competence. The results therefore invalidate rules advocating independent directors and oppose the engagement of directors with significant outside activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Why do some firms address new market niches and others do not? The literature has rarely blended the concept of innovativeness of a product at the market level with the coherence of the product portfolio at the firm level. In this paper, we examine whether the introduction of products that are highly innovative occurs in firms that are very differentiated, both in terms of target niches and in terms of technological competencies, or rather in firms that focus on specific market segments and that have a limited technological capability. The results show that the introduction of products that are new to the market generally occurs in firms that introduce many products in few market segments and are characterized by a set of specialized technological and market competencies. At least in this industry, the myth of the small specialized niche player does not hold. Implications have a positive relevance to assess firms' behaviour in a given market.

This action brings the company not only positive but also negative impacts. Along with the development of industrial production, people have to face the risks posed their activity brings. The accidents, which occurred in the recent past, they still have a negative impact not only on humans but also on the environment and the economy In this paper, we address the issue of major accidents. Major accidents are meant only accidents caused induced by human activities. The paper presents the best known major accidents since the beginning of the 20th century. They have come in the European Union to modify the legislation that is valid for the all EU Member States. In the Czech Republic, these rules are enshrined in Act No. 59/2009 Coll., on the prevention of major accidents. For human society is a necessary protection against the effects arising from major accidents. One of the possibilities is the insurance of major accidents. Since in major accidents frequently occurs very high damage is therefore utilized modelling and simulation of extreme values. One of the options that can be used is modelling using the quantile function. The paper recalled model and process simulation of extreme values. It is possible to estimate the values of the damage amounts thanks to the help of the simulation of the quantile function, and it is also possible to estimate the maximum limit of the interval of damage. This knowledge can be used in deciding on the appropriate type of non-proportional reinsurance and also for the management of catastrophic risk insurance.","[Jindrova, Pavla; Jakubinsky, Radim] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Math & Quantitat Methods, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Jindrová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Math & Quantitat Methods, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Pavla.Jindrova@upce.cz; Jakubinsky.Radim@gmail.com,,,[SGS FES 2014 SGSFES_2014003],,"This paper was supported in terms of the project SGS FES 2014 SGSFES_2014003, entitled Vedecko-vyzkumne aktivity v Systemovem inzenyrstvi a informatice.",,16,3,3,1,6,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Toward this end, the conditions for realizing adjustments of the competitive strategy are formulated, and stepwise adjustment, conducted by the high-technology enterprise in the crisis period, are substantiated. The expediency of using a value-based mechanism of managing the competitive strategy of the high-technology enterprise via integrating different business units into a holding structure is demonstrated for the conditions of the high uncertainty and external environment instability. The creation of such innovative system of managing a high-technology enterprise facilitates a sustainable and efficient functioning of the newly-formed structure. This enables to secure saving or increasing the market value of the enterprise in the long term in the conditions of limited external financing resources.","[Karpova, Varvara] Moscow State Technol Univ STANKIN, Fac Informat Technol & Control Syst, Moscow 127994, Russia",Moscow State Technology University Stankin,"Karpova, V (通讯作者)，Moscow State Technol Univ STANKIN, Fac Informat Technol & Control Syst, Vadkovskiy Per 3-A, Moscow 127994, Russia.",karpova.varvara.inf@yandex.ru,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,297.0,304,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000030,0

With the continuous increase in the level of economic development and the increasingly fierce market competition, the pressure on preserving and increasing the value of insurance funds is enlarging. Base on the anticipation of huge development potential of Chinese industry providing social services for the aged in the future and the demand to its asset matching its liability, life insurance companies in China enthusiasm for investing in building retirement communities. On the contrary to the enthusiasm of life insurance companies, the sales and the occupancy of retirement communities which have been built in China is not optimistic. How about the demand for retirement community of Chinese consumers? Which factors affect their behavior on consuming the retirement communities? As rational investors, these are the two key problems which should be answered before life insurance companies making their decisions on investing in retirement communities. This paper selected urban residents of 35-65 years old in Wuhan as the investigating object, and research the factors affecting their willingness on consuming retirement communities by using the multiple regression method. Research results show that, the potential market demand of urban residents to the retirement communities is very large indeed, and their gender, income, family status, understanding degree on the retirement communities and whether there have been any relatives or friends who have lived in old-age care institutions impact on their choices in the future significantly. Thus, life insurance companies should position their market niche accurately when they make the decision on investing in retirement communities. And at the same time, improving the affordability of consumers and their cognition of the retirement community are two key factors to stimulate market demand of the retirement community.","[Kong Yuehong] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhao Wei] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Stat, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Economics; Hubei University of Economics,"Kong, YH (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Finance, Room 301,Qunxian Bldg,8 Yangqiao Lake Ave, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China.",48003500@qq.com; 411398250@qq.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,6,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,511.0,520,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700040,0

Due to cross section dependence across units the Pesaran's Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimator (CCEMG) was used in order to analyze the sign and elasticity of the examined relationships. On the all country level the null hypothesis of the GDP statistical insignificance can be rejected on the 5% level of significance for both cases: analyzing the relationship between the total number of publications and the GDP, and the number of citations per document and the GDP. The Pesaran's Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimator was also applied to each cluster separately.","[Kuchina, Elena] Univ Econ, Econometr De, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kuchina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Econometr De, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",xkuce10@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,803.0,810,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700079,0

The results showed that the global financial crisis, RMB rapid appreciation, and the weakening international market were the major international influencing factors. The increasing raw material cost and the insufficient domestic demand were the major domestic influencing factors. The excessively overburdened tax, the comparatively deteriorated competitive environment, the comparatively high commercial cost, and the overburdened industrial capacity were the major regional influencing factors. The lack of senior talents and the bottom locked-in value chain were the major internal influencing factors.

The literature focuses both on educational and job mismatches however the aim of this paper is to compare only the situation concerning educational mismatches. For the aim of this paper, two large sets of international data were chosen to show effects of educational mismatch. In the first part, selected results of PIAAC survey are presented. In the analytical part, data from European Social Survey ESS5 collected in the years 2010 and 2011 in selected EU countries were used. The first part of the paper provides a literature background presented so far (e.g. Dolton, Galasi, Hartog, Chevalier, Levels, and McGuinness etc.) as well as methods used to identify this mismatch both by employers and employees. The European Social Survey data were used for modified Mincer's earnings equation in the second part of the paper and regression estimates proved that overeducation is a very important issue in all developed countries. The results also introduce data on returns on investment in education based on the human capital theory which helps to explain overeducation and undereducation differences in earnings taking into account different circumstances as e.g. variation in informal human capital and skill of workers, their abilities acquired in on-the-job training and also other overeducation and undereducation considered as a temporary phenomenon. It is a great challenge to the relevance of more investment in education. Even though the current situation in educational policies supports an increasing number of university graduates, both the graduates and employers have to face a misbalance on the labour market and lower individual satisfaction. The results confirm the findings of some of previous studies and offer a plafform for further discussion of educational mismatch across Europe.","[Marsikova, Katerina; Urbanek, Vaclav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Marsíková, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic.",katerina.marsikova@tul.cz; vaclav.urbanek@tul.cz,"Urbánek, Václav/M-9836-2017",,,,,,32,7,7,4,39,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

To that end, a quantitative analysis is carried out through logistic regression models aimed at analyzing how different explanatory variables affect tourists' choice of a destination. A Revealed Preference survey was conducted in June 2013 in Madrid, where tourists were interviewed close to the most attractive tourist sites. Preliminary results show that the Spanish High Speed Rail system seems to have a significant effect on the tourists' choice to visit other cities close to Madrid, but the choice of Madrid as a tourist destination is not influenced by the presence of High Speed Rail.

Method of fundamental analysis are theoretically compiled in detail and well described in literature. According to Damodaran (2012, 2006) there are 3 or approaches to valuation. This paper focuses only on the first approach, discounted cash flow models, especially on dividend discount models. The present value of company is estimated using a simulation. The input parameters were set in a relatively moderate way in our simulation. 2 types of shareholders pessimists and optimists are taken into account. They want to invest in shares only for a short term, i.e. for 3 years, and then they want to sell the shares. Great differences in company's present value are obtained. Present values of company range from 51 to 69 units of money. Professional's analysts estimates of the company's value show, like our simulation, the different results. It is evident that the use of discounted models depends on setting input parameters. It is necessary to include other factor for assessing the company's value, e. g. macroeconomic factors. As Siegel (1998) or Damodaran (2003) pointed out, the company's value depends on interest rate or on tax law changes. The results of discounted models cannot be simply used to estimate the company's value within a longer-term investing period. The aim of this paper is to prove that the aforementioned methods, although they are very well theoretically processed, do usually not provide good results when predicting future share prices.","[Rihova, Pavia; Svoboda, Milan] Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Ríhová, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",divisova@kem.zcu.cz; svobodm@kem.zcu.cz,"Svoboda, Milan/AAU-4541-2020",,,,,,7,3,3,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1761.0,1768,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700179,0

This policy switched the focus of regulation from pricing to reserving, which means that CIRC follows the idea of deregulate front end, regulate back end. In traditional actuarial science theory and practice, the reserve valuation interest rate of statutory liabilities is unchanged in all the policy years. However, the long-term liabilities make the solvency of life insurance companies very sensitive to the fluctuation of interest rate. This paper selects term life insurance in personal insurance as study subject. In order to introduce interest rate risk to reserve valuation, we construct AR interest rate model and term structure of interest rates model to predict valuation interest rates, and then value the reserve using them. Finally, we evaluate the sufficiency of solvency risk disclosure and the operability of supervision practice, and give some constructive suggestions to CIRC on the current practice of solvency supervision. For constructing AR Interest Rate Model, we get the average interest rate by processing this time series data, and then apply related theory of linear time series to construct AR Interest Rate Model. Next, we use Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test to examine the validity of the model, and estimate parameters by least squares estimation, AIC and BIC rules. Because of the existence of stochastic term epsilon(t) similar to N (0, sigma(2)), we apply 5000 Monte Carlo simulations for the future interest rate series by Matlab software. Finally, the reserves in the end of every policy year can be got with each simulated interest rate. For constructing term structure of interest rates model, we take Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor) as samples, and analyze static methods including Nelson-Siegel Model, Diebold-Li Model. Based on the accuracy of interest rate prediction and the simplicity of parameter estimation, Diebold-Li Model is applied for constructing term structure of interest rates. According to the Diebold-Li Model, we get short rates and forward rates in the end of each policy year, and eventually calculate the term life insurance reserves with the forward interest rates.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Shi, G (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",cufeshiguang@163.com,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,80.0,99,,,,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700004,0

We collected data from a survey of 310 telecommunication employees in Turkey. Our results show that P-O fit fully mediates the relationship between supportive leadership and turnover intentions, while P-O fit partially mediates the relationship between supportive leadership and job satisfaction. Therefore, person-organization fit is an intermediary mechanism that explains the supportive leadership-outcome relationships. In other words, supportive leadership behavior influences job satisfaction and turnover intentions through the person-organization fit. Specifically, higher levels of supportive leadership behavior predicts greater P-O fit, which in turn is a significant predictor of higher levels of job satisfaction and lower levels of turnover intentions. We evaluated both Baron & Kenny's approach and Sobel test together in order to achieve more powerful strategy when testing mediation (P-O fit). Both approaches provide evidence for the mediation effect of person-organization fit in this study. Age, gender, and tenure were controlled in order to eliminate spurious relationships. Further, we also examined a series of confirmatory factor analyses, which includes our hypothesized four factor model and three alternative models in order to provide additional evidence for the discriminant validity. Results reveal that hypothesized four factor model fit the data better than any of the three alternative models. The findings of the study suggest important implications for management theory and practice. For instance, when managers provide support and create friendly and psychologically supportive work environments, this promotes employees' perceived value congruence with their organization and employees probably perceive that they will fit better to such organization, which in turn results with increased level of job satisfaction and decreased level of turnover intentions.","[Sokmen, Alptekin; Bitmis, M.

In this context, the aim of this paper is to make a theoretical and practical contribution to a deeper understanding of the business risks that Romanian companies are facing, especially at an entrepreneurial level, their need for improved change management, presenting the results of our previous analysis. The approach used in this study is focused on calculating a risk coefficient based on variation coefficients of key economic ratios reported during 2008-2013 by 37,593 Romanian companies, clustered in 182 sub-industries and 35 industries, aiming to determine the need for change management application in Romanian economic sectors. The paper also evaluates the correlation between the resulted risk coefficient and insolvency rate of each sector, proving that there is a direct, positive correlation between the two. Small enterprises having turnover between 100 - 500 k euros are the most affected by economic recession, having the highest business risk. Also, the paper categorizes Romanian industries by the economic risk they are facing. SMEs availability to change, in a structured manner, might be the only difference between their success and insolvency.

Strategy can be formally interpreted as an idealized path optimizing heterogeneous resource deployment to produce maximum financial gain. Using standard matrix methods to describe the firm Hamiltonian, it is possible to formalize useful notions of a business model, resources, and competitive advantage. The business model that underpins strategy may be seen as a set of constraints on resources that can be interpreted as controls in optimal control theory. Strategy then might be considered to be the control variable of firm path, suggesting in turn that the firm's business model is the codification of the application of investment resources used to control the strategic path of value realization.

Many other cities in the world have experienced the same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97% penetration rate. We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of specific uses of the information for public transport policy and planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we believe that this can change the way we do transport planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Improvements in perceived service quality increase the attractiveness of transit, and therefore lead to growing patronage. The present paper examines how transit users' perceptions of service quality and user satisfaction influence loyalty. Using information from five years of customer satisfaction questionnaires collected by two Canadian transit providers, this study attempts to better understand the complexities of several factors influencing passenger satisfaction and behavioral intentions. It uses a Structural Equation Modeling approach to develop a series of models that reflects the different groups using transit; captive riders (users who are dependent on transit), choice riders (car owners who choose to take transit), and captive-by-choice riders (users who are dependent on transit but could own a car) are accounted for. The findings from this study are used to define areas where transit agencies can develop specific strategies in order to benchmark user satisfaction with the aim of growing patronage among the different groups. Insight into the perceptions of passengers provides useful information that can help transit agencies understand what inspires customers' perceptions of satisfaction and loyalty in general.

This paper addresses this problem from the perspective of choice behaviour. Our research focuses on the parking charge cut-off point, which is the minimum or maximum acceptable value that a driver sets for an attribute. A multiple linear regression model reveals that older and inexperienced drivers are more likely to ignore the charge cut-off points they themselves have set. Discrete choice models incorporating charge cut-offs are further used to analyse charge implications for parking choice behaviour. Our results show that the precision of the conventional model is improved by including a cut-off. At the same time, parking charges, the time spent searching for a parking space, and walking time after finding the parking space, all have a significantly negative influence on parking choices. Finally, a pricing scheme is put forward to reduce the occupancy rates of curbside parking to 85%. This contention is based on parking pricing models with cut-offs. We find indications that not accounting for charge cut-off points, when they are in fact present, may lead to inaccurate willingness-to-pay and upwardly biased pricing schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We use volatility data for the U.S. and 17 foreign markets from the Oxford Man Institute's realized library, and augment our benchmark HAR model with U.S. equity market volatility information for each foreign equity market. We show that U.S. equity market volatility information improves the out-of-sample forecasts of realized volatility substantially in all 17 foreign equity markets that we consider. Not only are these forecast gains highly significant, they also produce out-of-sample R-2 values of between 4.56% and 14.48%, with 9 being greater than 10%. The improvements in out of-sample forecasts remain statistically significant for horizons up to one month ahead. A substantial part of these predictive gains is driven by forward-looking volatility, as captured by the VIX. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This article aims at testing the weak version of the Porter hypothesis in waste management, by analysing the dynamic relationship between the stringency of environmental regulation and innovation in a European cross-country setting. Results confirm that the stringency of regulation positively affects innovation, but the effect is non-linear, suggesting the existence of an optimal cap to the stringency of regulation.

We show that the in-sample fit and cross-validation prediction accuracy improve significantly when we account for spatial heterogeneity. In particular, for one-day ahead forecasts, the spatiotemporal autoregressive (STAR) model demonstrates its superiority over model specifications with alternating spatial and temporal heterogeneity and dependence structures. In addition, sub-market fixed effects, constructed on the basis of statistical TREE methods, improve the results of predefined local rental markets further.

In order to provide reliable wind power forecasts for periods beyond a couple of hours, forecasts of the wind speed are fundamental. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for wind speed that is based on stochastic differential equations. We show that stochastic differential equations allow us to capture the time dependence structure of wind speed prediction errors naturally (from 1 to 24 h ahead) and, most importantly, to derive point and quantile forecasts, predictive distributions, and time-path trajectories (also referred to as scenarios or ensemble forecasts), all using one single stochastic differential equation model that is characterized by a few parameters.

The forecasts are based on a seasonal Box-Jenkins model (SARIMA), which is adequate to forecast monthly air travel demand with distinct seasonal patterns at the largest German airport: Frankfurt am Main. Furthermore, forecasts with forecast horizons from 1 to 12 months ahead, which are based on different average estimation windows, expanding windows and single rolling windows, are compared with baseline forecasts based on an expanding window of the observations after a structural break. The forecast exercise shows that the average window forecasts mostly outperform the alternative single window forecasts.

A growing collection of literature investigates the determinants of the magnitude of this recession across regions. This paper aims to contribute to this literature by analysing variations in unemployment rate across European regions over the period 2004-11. In particular, we focus on two apparently neglected issues, namely labour market rigidity and the sensitivity of the local economy to the national or European business cycle. The rigidity of the labour market is increasingly viewed as a possible reason for differences among countries in terms of the performance of labour markets, although existing empirical evidence remains inconclusive. In this respect, our aim is to assess the relevance of national labour legislation, as measured by the OECD Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) Index for the performance of regional labour markets by taking advantage of the natural experiment provided by the crisis. Furthermore, for the first time in economic literature, we employ quarterly data on unemployment rate for all European regions over the period 2000-11 to construct an index of co-movement regarding regional cycles with national or European cycles, to be used as an important determinant of variation in the unemployment rate. After controlling for a number of covariates, as well as for spatial dependence in various forms, our results indicate that EPL did not affect unemployment growth over the entire period. However, we did find that regions with a low long-term unemployment rate in countries with high EPL performed better in the pre-crisis period (2004-07), whereas no effect was found during the crisis. We also found that synchronisation of the regional cycle with the national one was significant for explaining regional labour market performance. Taken together, these results denote the limited relevance of national policies and legislation for accommodating spatially differentiated shocks, whereas policies aimed at modifying local cycles may prove to be more effective.","[Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy.;Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy.",marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Consequently, mutual interaction with the host environment means that changes may also occur in the established institutional norms in a market. Most existing studies have focused on the implications of territorial embeddedness for internationalizing retailers. In this article we also consider the societal and network forms of embeddedness identified by Hess, and illustrate how retailers transfer, negotiate and adapt their business model as they embed themselves in different institutional environments.

Rural sociologists have tried to raise these issues, but even in the field of sociology, they have been sidelined for several generations. Progressives treat urban poverty with sympathy and rural poverty with contempt because the latter is stereotyped as a problem that afflicts only white families, who are then blamed for failings of the economy as a whole. In fact, persistent rural poverty is concentrated in pockets in Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and several other regions, many of which are inhabited by blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Nevertheless, it seems that making rural poverty as much a concern among progressive Democrats as urban poverty has been will require a different political orientation towards rural issues.

Panel estimation of the regional knowledge production function (1983-1996) revealed that university research had localised impacts on industrial innovations, measured by patents filed by the Japanese firms, with a five-year lag. University-industry joint research did not act as a conduit of university spillover, which suggests that informal channels, such as voluntary transfer of academic inventions in return to donation, worked in the pre-reform period. Intermediaries as a part of regional innovation policy, represented as local public technology centres, exerted a positive impact on industrial innovations in the region. Their immediate impacts suggest the contribution of technology diffusion, such as technical consultation, that help small local firms solve current problems while their far-reaching impacts suggest the importance of knowledge creation, such as own research.","[Fukugawa, Nobuya] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 6-6-11-804 Aramaki Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan",Tohoku University,"Fukugawa, N (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 6-6-11-804 Aramaki Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan.",nfukugawa@gmail.com,"Fukugawa, Nobuya/AAC-3090-2019","Fukugawa, Nobuya/0000-0001-9874-7417",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K03411]; Seimeikai; Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Kikawada Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03411] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Seimeikai; Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Kikawada Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K03411], Seimeikai, Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance, and Kikawada Foundation.",,95,20,23,3,114,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We examine the potential role of the forests in fulfilling this goal in Finland. We base our analysis on the six scenarios that supported the parliamentary process of preparing Energy and Climate Roadmap 2050 for Finland to which we contributed by providing the assessment of forest sector development. While the scenario paths show that a systemic change to achieve the 80% target is possible with the increasing use of wood for energy being an important tool to cut emissions, our projections here show that an increase in forest carbon sink alone could play at least as important a role in improving the carbon balance. As the Finnish forests are growing clearly more than the projected removals of wood biomass are, Finland's carbon balance in full carbon accounting might become negative already before 2040 thanks to the forest sink. The forest growth might come to offset all other emissions sources even without other measures and still allow an increase in the use of wood for materials and energy. Nevertheless also other emission saving measures are needed because there is currently a cap which limits the use of LULUCF sinks as an emission reduction tool, and because of the fact that at some future point of time the forest sink will saturate while being vulnerable to many risks at the meantime.

But to date this research has led to more temporal as opposed to spatial detail about those changes. This paper uses an online data set to assess the relative economic health (performance) of the US's more than 350 metropolitan labour markets during and after the Great Recession. These data address both the current level (e.g. unemployment rate) and the recent trend (e.g. 3-year job growth) in the economic health of those labour markets. Multivariate analysis generates one sub-index for level and a second sub-index for trend and then an overall performance index is calculated. But, after recognising that heterogeneity in these labour markets exists according to their different sizes, this paper re-examines those online data using four separate population size classes. New indices are then generated reflecting the relative sizes of the metropolitan labour markets and the new rankings that follow differ in important ways from the original rankings. The findings also indicate a disjuncture now exists between the economic health of Snowbelt versus Sunbelt cities. Coming immediately out of the Great Recession the average economic health of Northern cities is much better than that of Southern cities.","[Mulligan, Gordon F.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, 1103 2nd St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Reid, Neil; Moore, Michael S.] Univ Toledo, Dept Geog & Planning, MS140,2801 West Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA",University of Arizona; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Reid, N (通讯作者)，Univ Toledo, Dept Geog & Planning, MS140,2801 West Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",mulligan@email.arizona.edu; neil.reid@utoledo.edu,,"Mulligan, Gordon/0000-0003-0485-0144",,,,,86,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

It is used to analyze several critical aspects of behavior in local banking markets such as price and non-price competition, strategic interactions between small and large banks, de novo bank growth, and consumer switching. The results suggest that growing banks offer higher deposit interest rates than established banks. Established banks are more likely to engage in non-price competition, which can impede the effectiveness of de novo bank strategies and growth.

This competition emerged when the major railway connection between Prague and Ostrava, which was operated only by the incumbent, was entered by two private operators, RegioJet in September 2011 and LEO Express in January 2013. Theoretical studies and experience from other countries suggest that this competition should lead to a price war, intensive market dynamics and product differentiation. The findings from the market development on the Prague-Ostrava route are broadly consistent with these predictions. The open access competition has led to an intensive price war with 2nd class tariff declines reaching 46%. Innovative marketing and selling strategies have significantly increased the spread of prices, and price discrimination and yield management techniques are used extensively. All operators has been unprofitable on the line, leading to financial stress and accusations of predatory pricing on the part of the incumbent. The quality of service on the line has increased substantially with standardisation, new on-board services and higher frequency. The average number of seats per train has declined significantly, and new operators have been able to win 55% market share from the incumbent. Service frequency is higher but is strongly concentrated during rush hours. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternative revenue sources should be considered to address the insolvency of the current funding system. Mileage fees and value pricing have long been attractive options to researchers and decision-makers, but they often raise concerns of equity. This paper aims to design and evaluate equitable and progressive distance-based user fee policies, focusing specifically on income-based fee rate structures. In addition to equity, the policy design criteria must also include practicality, simplicity, revenue generation, and a consideration of the design's impact on surrounding jurisdictions. Three variable-rate vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) fee scenarios with respect to income are introduced: Ramsey pricing, fixed-interval incremental, and fixed percentage incremental structures. All policy scenarios are tested with a statewide transportation model in Maryland. Results show that income-based VMT fees can better protect lower-income households while generating additional revenue; however, a standard fee structure based on Ramsey pricing, or the inverse-elasticity rule, does not work as well as the fixed-interval incremental fee structure. The latter is progressive across all income groups while ensuring that equity and revenue goals are met. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey of small business finances provides information on whether a firm was in need of external financing. Firms without access to external financing-either because they were denied credit or because they did not apply for credit because they expected to be denied credit-are significantly smaller. To tighten the link between financing constraints and firm dynamics, I estimate the effect of financing constraints on subsequent employment growth and find that firms without access to external financing exhibit up to 3.5 % points lower annual employment growth than do their unconstrained counterparts. These findings suggest that financing constraints are a potentially important factor for understanding firm dynamics.","[Meisenzahl, Ralf R.] Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Meisenzahl, RR (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",ralf.r.meisenzahl@frb.gov,"Meisenzahl, Ralf/R-9713-2019",,,,,,32,6,8,6,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

However, low anticonsumption individuals were more likely to consume after death was made salient. Finally, anticonsumption lifestyles did not correlate with self-esteem, a known buffer of the effects of MS. Because MS did not change the consumption-related behaviors of high anticonsumption individuals, our findings suggest that consumption is not a relevant method for such individuals to recover their self-esteem.

The SRAC measurement approach is validated based on three empirical studies. Results of a representative German sample (Study 2) reveal that SRAC is predominantly negatively linked to consumer overconsumption dispositions. Exemplary, voluntary simplification and boycott intention may result in declining levels of indebtedness. Study 3 shows that psychosocial well-being is positively related to SRAC and overconsumption. However, a simplified lifestyle and a greater willingness to boycott are not necessarily associated with psychosocial well-being. This article provides insights for practitioners and policymakers to leverage existing SRAC values via new business models (sharing offers) or to influence the existing level of consciousness to effectively pave the way for solid progress in the sustainability movement.","[Seegebarth, Barbara] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany; [Peyer, Mathias; Balderjahn, Ingo] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; [Wiedmann, Klaus-Peter] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology; University of Potsdam; Leibniz University Hannover,"Seegebarth, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany.;Peyer, M; Balderjahn, I (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany.;Wiedmann, KP (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",b.seegebarth@tu-braunschweig.de; mpeyer@uni-potsdam.de; ingo.balderjahn@uni-potsdam.de; wiedmann@m2.uni-hannover.de,"Seegebarth, Barbara/IST-6757-2023; Seegebarth, Barbara/AAG-1485-2020","Seegebarth, Barbara/0000-0002-0648-5788; Seegebarth, Barbara/0000-0002-0648-5788; Balderjahn, Ingo/0000-0003-3873-1223",,,,,80,100,107,2,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Cities all tend to pursue large public transit projects when it comes to investment options. There seems to be an urgent need to study these options from the standpoint of planning objectives and travel requirements. This paper compares the payoff of alternative projects of the public transit system for Xiamen City. We formulate the transit project selection problem as a mathematical model. With the proposed PCA-DP technique which integrates the principal component analysis (PCA) into a dynamic programming (DP) model, the optimal solution can be obtained based on indicators that cover four aspects of transit system performance evaluation: the level of service, the predicted relevant income and cost, and the expected external influence. The bi-hierarchy PCA model, constructed with data from 15 cities of China, generates the payoff function used as input to the DP model for the multi-phase transit project selection process for the City of Xiamen. The empirical analysis shows that for most of the scenarios, upgrading the existing bus rapid transit (BRT) into light rail transit (LRT) system and constructing a mass rail transit (MRT) routes in the next 10 years appear to be the most cost-effective option. Combined with other findings from this study, the result of our work can be used by practitioners to facilitate transit system planning and transportation project prioritization. The solution technique discussed provides a methodological framework that can be potentially used for the selection of a future transit system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed integrated methodology can account for multiple supplier selection criteria and set boundaries on weight value for multiple objective data envelopment analysis inputs and outputs. To solve the data envelopment analysis model, a new algorithm based on multiple objective particle swarm optimization is introduced, which embeds with tabu list and group mechanisms, and then, it is found to be superior to the compared algorithms in solving performance on three test functions and the illustrative case. In addition, the proposed integrated method- ology was applied to a supplier selection problem of sphygmomanometer manufacturer in Taiwan to verify its applicability of decision-making process.

Our reflection has been spiced by the works of some authors, namely Viard (2000) who defend the thesis which stipulates that hospitality today is a major criterion of territorial attractivity.

The index was calculated for 11 - European Union member states for the year 2011. Results showed that, within the sample, the most specialized countries in terms of local recreation services provision are the Czech Republic and Netherlands, whereas the lowest degree of specialization is registered in Romania and France.

This paper is devoted to the analysis of the efficiency of transport subsystems in distribution centers. Transport is a logistics process with the highest energy consumption. In the transport systems two aspects of measuring efficiency are identified. The first aspect is the fleet efficiency which is related to the higher level of decision making. The second aspect of decision making is the vehicle efficiency as operational level of decision making. The main objective of this paper is to propose models for measuring transport efficiency, as well as to identify main factors that affect transport efficiency. The proposed models are based on Principal Component Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis approaches. According to the results fleet management system, catchment area, vehicle capacity, the age of vehicles and manufacturers are the basic factors that affect transport efficiency.

However none of these researches specifically studied transformational leadership and business performance from the perspectives of technology-based SMEs. This paper serves two purposes. First, the authors aim to identify the critical dimensions of transformational leadership and business performance. Second, this paper intends to determine the relationship between transformational leadership and business performance. This study used a quantitative method approach using survey questionnaire. 86 respondents who are the owners or top managers of technology-based SMEs in Malaysia took part in the study. The analyses conducted involved factor, reliability and correlation analysis. The results of factor analysis proposed three dimensions representing transformational leadership, i.e. enthusiastic optimism, idealized influence and individual consideration which is contrary to the four dimensions theorized by Bass and Avolio (2004). In addition, business performance generated a one-factor-dimension. The correlation analysis indicates there is a significant and positive correlation between transformational leadership and business performance.

In order to produce garments, cotton was first used in Egypt, Mexico, India and Pcru, and today is the most widely used natural fiber in the world used by half of the world textile industry. The first spinning mills were set up in Bombay, India, a country which is today the main source of raw material. Among the cotton properties we mention: it is non allergenic, biodegradable, absorbs moisture and can withstand high temperatures without affecting its qualities, explaining why the fabrics can be sterilized. (https://ro.wikipedia.org/wilci/Bumbac, 2016) Being among the most important crops in terms of land use, cultivated in over a hundred countries, cotton creates a significant number of jobs and provides income for more than 250 million people in the stages of production, processing, storage and transport of this technology chain. Millions of jobs are provided by allied industries ranging from agricultural production means and machinery to textile manufacturing. According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, founded in 1939, around 100 million households are directly involved in cotton production and about one hundred and fifty countries are involved in the trade of this product. Currently cotton industry has a great importance because of its many uses and because of the cost, more convenient compared to other raw materials.

Seed oil (20-27%) is poor drying and it is used in the industry. At the moment there is a tendency to wear clothes of natural fibers produced using environmentally friendly technologies for the cultivation of the plant supplying raw materials. Because of the higher cost for this type of clothing, it appeared the variant to mix fiber cotton with yarn and chemical fiber obtainingcotton type products of high quality, durable, having a pleasant aspect and acceptable production costs.

The results of multi-group structural equation modelling showed that the original four-factor structure of the job crafting scale was supported by the data, but that a three-factor structure was necessary due to a discriminant validity concern regarding two job crafting dimensions. Regression results revealed that increasing structural job resources with challenging job demands, and increasing social job resources were significant predictors of work engagement in both groups. Contrary to expectations decreasing hindering job demands was a negative predictor of job satisfaction in the mining group.

In calculating public transport affordability, we consider two different criteria based on the observed mobility and the potential mobility. Using household travel survey data, we estimate that on average, observed public transport affordability indexes are below 7% (6.2% in Cordoba and 3.8% in Montevideo). Nonetheless, for the lower quintile, this index reaches 11.7% in Cordoba and 6.4% in Montevideo. The observed affordability index is based on the expenditure on observed public transport trips, which does not consider those trips that, even when necessary, may not be performed due to financial restrictions. Because this measure underestimates financial constraints for the poorest groups, we propose to consider a new measure: potential affordability as an attempt into build a more realistic basket trip. It is computed considering motorized trip rates of the middle-class groups' as a benchmark. After analyzing potential affordability results, assessing its limitations and controlling by household composition we conclude that this is a very promising complementary measure since it helps to better understand the affordability gap for low-income groups.

Digitalization is currently the key driver for change in business and organizations. Affected is everything, from market structures to customer behaviour over supply chain and production itself. Internal processes have opportunities for a new design, production and logistics. Therefore digitalization will influence every work place and create new challenges for the entire organization. This massive game changing opportunity has to be steered by management and hence management decisions are a must while this transition phase; furthermore decisions will influence this transition but decisions itself are also affected. In the first part of the paper, typical decision models will be discussed; a rational model with first ideas of the neoclassical economists (e.g. Adam Smith or Max Weber) and scientific approaches of Pascal and de Fermat or Bernoulli, mainly focused on agents which maximize their utility. Further developed by von Neumann/Morgenstern economic decisions seem to be a strong rational and mathematical process to find utility maximization. This rational model is illustrated on the one hand to explain the traditional way and have a view on the model of homo oeconomicus. On the other hand, a new view on decision making was completely described by an emotional model from Kahneman/Tversky, which shows an emotional aspect of decisions, because humans don't follow strict rational rules. Especially in organizations a mixed view of both ideal models are still vital, as explained from March/Simon, continued in Simon's bounded reality. In the second part of the paper, digitalization as one part of globalization will be explained. Digitalization will change completely the business environment and the setup of organizations. New market structures, customer behaviour and processes will change the entire operations of business and organizations. Then the main discussion of the paper, the impacts of digitalization on decision making will show the trend toward the well known model of homo oeconomicus, which is a common model in economics; but known with a lot of limitations. Automatization of processes will affect the decision process in organization and consequently an adoption of business models seems obvious. This new decision making processes will be mainly automated in the future, hence an algorithm logic is required and enables the model of homo oeconomicus a revivial, driven by machines.","[Hossfeld, Steffen] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Hossfeld, S (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",shossfeld@web.de,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,23,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,279.0,288,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200024,0

Acheiving cooperation is difficult in the world politics and economy. There is no common government to enforce rules, and international institutions are weak Scientists have long attempted to understand the fundamental causes of conflict and cooperation, especially when participants are mutally distrastfull. The game theory enabled researchers to analyze this subject. The game theory models strategic confrontations where each player tries to get the maximum payoff, knowing that the other player will also try to do the same. The application of game theory to international relations is not new, but there has been an increase in the particularity of the approaches, associated with new applications of the game theory models to international political economy in addition to their standard role in militarypolitical strategic analysis. The concept of nation-states as independent goal-seeking actors lies in the heart of strategic game analysis. The classical Prisoners' Dilemma game is the most referred to in the field of game theory and international relations and it is often used to show how countries in conflict may lose out due to self interest, rather than cooperate with one another. Theoretical analysis of the iterated, two-player Prisoners' Dilemma show that a strategy based on reciprocity (such as tit-for-tat) can be effective in promoting cooperation. This suggests that states may have incentives to practice reciprocity in a variety of situations that are characterized by mixtures of conflicting and complementary interest and that a strategy based on reciprocity can yield relatively high payoffs against other strategies. Games such as Chicken and Stag Hunt are also significant for analysis of international relations. However, it seems that the classical game theory, its '' games'', and its way of playing'' the game, are not sufficiently adapted to the specificities of contemporary international relations. New approaches, based on the ''soft '' games, such as the theory of moves, meta games theory, hyper games theory, analysis of confrontation, analysis of options, offer new solutions, but they are not yet sufficiently theoretically elaborated and confirmed.","[Kapor, Predrag] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Kapor, P (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia.",pkapor@nezbit.edu.rs,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,13,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,242.0,250,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700027,0

The research is conducted to investigate the influence of culture attributes of risk-taking on the reporting of some variables related to risk, identifying whether or not geographies or accounting regimes are also determinants. We use two proxies for risk-taking, namely, Provisions for Loan Losses and Risk-Weighted Assets. Our research is designed using a twofold perspective. First, we examine if the distribution of our proxies for risk taking are different between independent groups. We compare the outcomes based on groups clustered by national culture dimensions, geographies and accounting regimes. Secondly, we examine if culture is a determinant of banks that present higher or lower amounts of incurred and unexpected losses. Our findings suggest that national culture is (is not) a determinant for the probability of reporting higher or lower level of loans loss provisions (risk weighed assets). These findings are consistent for banks in different geographies (Europe vs. Asia) and subject to different accounting regimes (IFRS vs. local standards).","[Lopes, Ana Isabel] ISCTE IUL, UNIDE BRU, Dept Accounting, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Lopes, AI (通讯作者)，ISCTE IUL, UNIDE BRU, Dept Accounting, Lisbon, Portugal.",Ana.isabel.lopes@iscte.pt,"Lopes, Ana Isabel/AAR-1542-2021; Lopes, Ana/D-6973-2014","Lopes, Ana/0000-0002-6202-6156",,,,,29,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,549.0,569,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_35,0.0,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800035,0

Market creation has characterized the kind of mission-oriented investments that led to putting a man on the moon and are currently galvanizing green innovation. Mission-oriented innovation has required public agencies to not only de-risk the private sector, but also to lead the direct creation of new technological opportunities and market landscapes. This paper considers four key issues that arise from a market-creating framework for policy: (1) decision-making on the direction of change; (2) the nature of (public and private) organizations that can welcome the underlying uncertainty and discovery process; (3) the evaluation of mission-oriented and market-creation policies; and (4) the ways in which both risks and rewards can be shared so that smart growth can also result in inclusive growth.","[Mazzucato, Mariana] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Mazzucato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",m.mazzucato@sussex.ac.uk,"Mazzucato, Mariana/H-4456-2011","Mazzucato, Mariana/0000-0001-9183-5000",European Community [649186],European Community,"The author acknowledges funding from a research grant funded by European Community's H2020-Euro-Society-2014 call on 'Overcoming the crisis: new ideas, strategies and governance structures for Europe'  (ISIG grant no. 649186).",,58,298,323,19,218,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Therefore, it should not be taken for granted that all public resources are allocated where they add value the most. This is due in part to historical reasons and the inertia within how governments respond to changes around them. This article investigates the performance management system of a national transportation safety agency with qualitative methods. First, it introduces the evolution history and the surrounding institutional architecture of the agency. Next, the goal-setting, steering and management control mechanisms are described, followed by a cross-check of mandated tasks and objectives and the associated performance indicators. The main finding is that significant gaps between stated policy objectives, operational annual performance targets and available indicators can be identified. Especially with regard to societal objectives, the steering framework turns out to provide less than comprehensive coverage. Performance indicators for some major objectives are missing and vice versa, some measurement metrics do not seem to link clearly to set objectives. Not all the set objectives need (or even could) necessarily be measured, but certain shortcomings in the performance control system may prove critical. The findings imply that there is a risk of sub-optimal use of public resources if the targets and indicators of agencies are not thoroughly considered so that they logically cover agencies' mandates. The implications of the discovered gaps are outlined, together with recommendations for a more balanced approach. The analysis concludes with some recommended steps in order to cover the blind spots. With the aid of these steps, performance management systems can be improved to better meet policy and societal objectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Applying advanced statistical methods from time series domain the long-term development tendencies have been described and modeled and future development forecasts set up. The solution connects to accessible EuroStat and Czech Statistical Office data sources. Data analyzed have further on been applied in statistical modeling of the balance of agricultural production and foodstuffs self-sufficiency. In context with new rules of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Czech agricultural producers have moved to a new framework of subsidies. Even in spite of good nature and climate conditions of Czech rural landscape they have not so far succeded to reverse or at least mitigate the decline of economically demanding commodities domestic production. Structural imbalance together with negative effects in the countryside have threatened the long-term competitiveness of Czech agriculture.

The server simulation optimizer reads and writes records (the settings of the simulation model input parameters and its objective function value) to internal and external databases. The data sent to the external database are encrypted. If the simulation optimizer wants to perform the simulation run with the concrete settings of the simulation model it searches for these concrete settings in the local database first. If this record is not found, the optimizer searches the external database. If the external database contains these settings of the simulation model and the objective function optimizer, it downloads these encrypted data and decrypts them. We implemented modified pseudo-gradient heuristic methods-Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, Local Search-to analyse their behaviour of searching for the global optimum in the defined Search Space. We tested different settings to reduce the impact of incorrect settings. We also replicated the optimization experiment at least five times to reduce the random nature of the selected optimization methods. We calculated the percentages of the relative frequencies of objective function values belonging to smaller calculated intervals on different discrete event simulation models.","[Raska, Pavel; Ulrych, Zdenek] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Raska, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Plzen, Czech Republic.",praska@kpv.zcu.cz; ulrychz@kpv.zcu.cz,"Raska, Pavel/I-8985-2016; Ulrych, Zdenek/P-3435-2016","Raska, Pavel/0000-0003-3991-5761; Ulrych, Zdenek/0000-0002-4194-2665",Internal Grant Agency of University of West Bohemia [SGS-2015-065],Internal Grant Agency of University of West Bohemia,This paper was created with the subsidy of the project SGS-2015-065 The development of parameters of the sustainable manufacturing system carried out with the support of the Internal Grant Agency of University of West Bohemia.,,5,1,1,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3104.0,3115,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700317,0

Gap analyses based on the SERVQUAL model were used to analyse the perception and expectation quality of service quality rendered by two universities of equal status in Lithuania and Malaysia. Stratified sampling was employed to ensure fair representation of the Turkish students. A questionnaire consisting of 35 items representing five dimensions of services quality, i.e. tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy was developed to measure the service quality gap of the respondents. The results of single mean t-tests for 40 hypotheses show that perception of services quality and satisfaction of the Turkish students varies across two universities. Both universities recorded negative service quality gaps, implying feelings of dissatisfaction among the Turkish students. However, the Malaysian university recorded a higher level of dissatisfaction than the Lithuanian university.

The research was carried out on a large sample of 733 Slovak managers. It focused on their perceptions of the studied phenomena. Results suggest that codes of ethics help to raise the ethical sensitivity of managers in regard to their superiors' unethical behavior. Codes increase also managers' attentiveness to the necessity to set clear behavioral standards in the company. Further, factors that restrain the clarity of ethical standards in the workplace are the bad organization of work, the unethical behavior of superiors, the unethical organizational culture, and when superiors and company owners pay attention only to results and profits and do not consider the means by which results were achieved.","[Remisova, Anna; Lasakova, Anna] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Remisová, A (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",anna.remisova@fm.uniba.sk; anna.lasakova@fm.uniba.sk,"Lasakova, Anna/AFK-8594-2022",,,,,,37,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,2542.0,2551,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700258,0

We assume that the stock price oscillates around its unknown intrinsic value. If it deviates from this value, it tends to be restored.

In place of the cross-equation restriction tests used in existing research, we adopted a structural vector autoregression framework and obtain three findings. First, evidences from 4 East Asian countries supported the intertemporal theoretical expectation that country-specific transitory shocks significantly affect current accounts, whereas the effects of global and country-specific permanent shocks are negligible. Second, country-specific transitory shocks that primarily affected current account variance dominate net output variation. Third, global permanent and transitory shocks mainly affecting variances in world interest rates and exchange rates secondarily explain current account variance. Therefore, three explanatory variables of PVMCA sufficiently explain current account variations. In practice, investors can use the PVMCA to forecast changes in current accounts; they further judge business risks stemming from the changes, and adjust their security portfolio.","[Kuo, Chen-Yin] Tung Fang Design Inst, Kaohsiung 82941, Taiwan",Tung Fang Design University,"Kuo, CY (通讯作者)，Tung Fang Design Inst, 110 Tungfang Rd, Kaohsiung 82941, Taiwan.",monkey5709@hotmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This study employs ARDL bound testing co-integration approach, rolling window analysis, Granger causality test, Toda and Yamamoto Modified Wald causality test and variance decomposition test. Results indicate the significant positive impact of FDI and workers' remittances on private savings in the long and short run. Causality analyses confirm the bidirectional causal relationship of FDI and workers' remittances with private savings. It is recommended that policy makers should form friendly policies to attract more FDI and workers' remittances in the country which leads to increase private savings in Pakistan. This leads to increase more fund for financial intermediaries to increase domestic investment opportunities in the country. This paper makes a unique contribution to the literature with reference to Pakistan, being a pioneering attempt to investigate the impact of FDI and workers' remittances on private savings of Pakistan by using the long annual time series data and applying more rigorous econometric techniques.","[Raza, Syed Ali] IQRA Univ, Karachi 75300, Pakistan",Iqra University,"Raza, SA (通讯作者)，IQRA Univ, Karachi 75300, Pakistan.",syed_aliraza@hotmail.com,"Raza, Syed Ali/AAE-3290-2021; Raza, Syed Ali/I-3879-2016","Raza, Syed Ali/0000-0002-2455-6922; Raza, Syed Ali/0000-0002-2455-6922",,,,,47,14,14,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We show that this effort, in such a short period of time, has been a valuable tool for the promotion of bicycle mobility in a city without a tradition for cycling. Apart from the obvious aim of achieving segregation from motorized traffic, the Seville network considered connectivity, continuity, visibility, uniformity, bi-directionality and comfort as criteria for the design of the infrastructure. All these criteria aim to make cycling not just safe, but also easy and comfortable for everybody. Our analysis also suggests that the fast building of this type of infrastructure provides solid grounds for the development of utilitarian cycling, with high cost effectiveness, even in a city without a previous tradition in this sense. However the strategy also has certain limitations, which are analysed in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Other than aiming to recover the cost of debt service and operations, cities appear to have few clear policy aims in managing these garages. In this paper, we outline how U.S. cities currently manage off-street parking structures under their control. We argue that this management largely ignores the logic of both economics and public benefits. We also make the conceptual case for how cities should manage their parking assets to maximize public benefits. Finally, we examine the most promising example of off-street parking public management, using data from 14 garages included in San Francisco's SFpark program. We find that SFpark increased the public use of garages by more than a third, reduced the average price for drivers, and maintained a stable revenue stream for the city. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The theory is an extension of Richard Jeffrey's decision theory to counterfactual prospect and is a form of Modal Consequentialism, according to which the value of actual outcomes often depends on what could have been. Unlike existing versions of modal consequentialism, the multidimensional decision theory allows us to explicitly model the desirabilistic dependencies between actual and counterfactual outcomes that, I contend, are at the heart of common intuitions about fair distribution of chances.","Collge Etudes Mondiales, Fdn Maison Sci Homme, F-75013 Paris, France",,"Stefánsson, HO (通讯作者)，Collge Etudes Mondiales, Fdn Maison Sci Homme, 190 Ave France, F-75013 Paris, France.",hlynur.orri@gmail.com,"Stefánsson, H.

Developed in non-scientific, practice-oriented how to' handbooks in 1920s and 1930s America, contrarian investment advice was aimed at so-called small investors rather than well-established market practitioners. Emerging out of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century debates about public participation in the stock market, the contrarians expanded on a widely held (amongst financial writers) scepticism about the investment and speculation skills (or lack thereof) of the masses and adopted ideas from the theoretical discipline of crowd psychology, whereby they positioned the mass (i.e. the crowd) in opposition to the successful investor. I argue that despite its idiosyncrasies, the contrarians' conception of the market based on crowd psychology points to a fundamental fragility of market participants, which still lingers on in recent debates about the wisdom of financial market crowds.","[Hansen, Kristian Bondo] Copenhagen Business Sch, Polit & Philosophy, Dept Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Hansen, KB (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Polit & Philosophy, Dept Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",kbh.mpp@cbs.dk,,,'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from Danish Council for Independent Research,'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from Danish Council for Independent Research,Research for this paper was supported by a 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research.,,86,14,14,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We model a suite of life cycle GHG emissions considerations to estimate the GHG abatement potential from switching from an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICE) to an EV in the continental U.S. The GHG intensity of EVs hinges on the electricity and ambient temperature when charged and operated. Both have high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, yet are typically modeled inadequately or overlooked entirely. We calculate marginal emissions, including renewables, for electricity by region and test forecasted grid composition to estimate future performance. Location and timing of charging are important GHG determinants, but temperature effects on EV performance can be equally important. On average, EVs slightly reduce GHGs relative to ICEs, but there are many regions where EVs provide a decisive benefit and others where EVs are significantly worse. The forecasted grid shifts from coal towards renewables, improving EV performance; the GHG benefit per EV in western states is roughly $425 today and $2400 in 2040. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that global factors, namely the US-sourced funding of European global banks and global risk, were influential in driving cross-border banking inflows to Ireland. Furthermore, the empirical analysis suggests these global factors contributed to changes in domestic private non-financial sector credit during the Irish credit boom.

Both the entry of firms and productivity have been low in the Spanish economy over the recent years. This paper analyzes the determinants of entry focusing on the role of the design and efficacy of enforcement institutions (the judicial system), a traditionally overlooked aspect. In order to do so, we examine disaggregated data at the local level in Spain. We find that higher judicial efficacy increases the entry rate of firms, while it has no effect on the exit rate. Crucially, that impact only occurs in the case of the entry rates of entrepreneurs, defined as self-employed, but not in the case of limited liability corporations. This finding may be explained by the fact that judicial (in)efficacy can be regarded as a fixed cost to be paid by agents that litigate. Hence, the economic activity of entrepreneurs -and specifically, their entry into the market- is expected to be more affected than that of larger firms.","[Garcia-Posada, Miguel; Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S.] Banco Espana Eurosyst, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Garcia-Posada, Miguel] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Mora-Sanguinetti, JS (通讯作者)，Banco Espana Eurosyst, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",miguel.garcia-posada@bde.es; juans.mora@bde.es,"Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./AAK-2001-2021","Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./0000-0003-0964-784X",,,,,53,20,20,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In Lebanon's capital, Beirut, levels of many transport-related pollutants are several times higher than world norms. In this paper, we elicit motorists' propensity to purchase hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) in Beirut by means of a choice experiment, and monetize attendant financial, welfare and environmental benefits. Simulations of aggregate switching behavior revealed that under a transitional scenario which assumes that HEVs are exempt from customs and excise duties (recently proposed, yet unimplemented, by the Ministry of Finance), car buyers would enjoy a 30.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption, 20.5 percent CO2 emission reduction and net benefits of $5684 per brand new car sale per year. Simulations of a more sustainable scenario in which customs and excise duties are reduced by around 38 percent reveal equally significant gains, with aggregate yearly fuel cost savings of $18.66 million and CO2 emissions reductions of 23,100 tons. Accordingly, endorsing the proposed tax amendments could be crucial to establishing a viable HEV market in Lebanon, later to be followed by a more sustainable tax incentive scheme consisting of partial tax discounts that would provide a win-win situation for both government and vehicle buyers.

The analysis shows that the probability of renegotiation breakdown plays a central role in determining the competitive effect of exclusive dealing. Exclusivity is likely to be anticompetitive for intermediate levels of renegotiation breakdown risk, while it is likely to be procompetitive for a very low breakdown risk under linear pricing (and for a very high breakdown risk under two-part tariffs). The result suggests that the competitive effect of exclusive dealing is decided by the interaction between investment promotion and foreclosure, which in turn depends on the probability of renegotiation breakdown and the pricing scheme that sellers can choose.","Bank Korea, Seoul 100794, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 100794, South Korea.",leedongr@gmail.com,"Lee, Dongyeol/N-3322-2016","Lee, Dongyeol/0000-0001-9359-8117",,,,,24,0,1,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In a principal-agent model in which the effort of a manager with mean-variance preferences affects the mean of a performance measure, we find that managerial compensation must be such that the variance of payments is decreasing in effort. From an ex-ante perspective, which is relevant for effort inducement, this maximizes the rewards associated to high effort, and the punishments associated to low effort. An important practical implication is that convex incentive contracts do not satisfy this necessary condition for optimality, which calls into question the practice of granting executive stock options. The paper therefore contributes to the debate on the efficiency of executive compensation.","HEC Montreal, Dept Finance, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Chaigneau, P (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Finance, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",pierre.chaigneau@hec.ca,"Chaigneau, Pierre/AAB-3492-2022","Chaigneau, Pierre/0000-0003-0939-7684",,,,,39,2,2,0,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Here, an alternative is proposed, where nonlinear serial and cross-sectional dependence is captured by a copula model. The copula defines a multivariate time series on the unit cube. A drawable vine copula is employed, along with a factorization which allows the marginal and transitional densities of the time series to be expressed analytically. The factorization also provides for simple conditions under which the series is stationary and/or Markov, as well as being parsimonious. A parallel algorithm for computing the likelihood is proposed, along with a Bayesian approach for computing inference based on model averages over parsimonious representations of the vine copula. The model average estimates are shown to be more accurate in a simulation study. Two Five-dimensional time series from the Australian electricity market are examined.

The ability to manage these assets efficiently can have an important impact on retirement well-being. Lower levels of cognitive ability in old age can reduce an investor's ability to control emotional responses to a loss. Greater sensitivity to loss may increase preferences for safety following a market decline, resulting in allocations away from stocks that are associated with long-term underperformance. We investigate whether cognitive ability is related to stock reallocations among retirees during the Great Recession. Using the Health and Retirement Study, we find that cognitive ability is negatively related to allocations away from stock. Compared to those with the lowest levels of cognitive ability, respondents with higher cognitive ability are 40% less likely to reduce their stock allocation by 50% or more. These results suggest that the quality of investment decisions in old age may be compromised by cognitive decline.","[Browning, Chris; Finke, Michael] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Browning, C (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",christopher.m.browning@ttu.edu; michael.finke@ttu.edu,,,,,,,39,15,21,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Our analysis identifies different phases of interaction in those markets in recent years. We find a substantial increase in spillover between euro area sovereign bond markets coinciding with the bailout of Bear Stearns in March 2008. The phase of the euro area crisis from the first Greece bailout in May 2010 until the end of 2011 saw a reversal of the longstanding pattern whereby events in core euro area member state sovereign bond markets exercised a positive net influence on the periphery. In particular, the first Greece bailout coincided with significant positive net spillover from peripheral member states to the core countries. More recently, improved market conditions have seen the pre-2008 pattern re-established with the core having a stronger net impact on peripheral euro area sovereign bond markets. The analysis points to Greece having become relatively detached from other bond markets since its second bailout in March 2012.

We estimate a market structure model to assess competition among VCs-some of which specialize in a particular industry and others of which are generalists-and find that the incremental effect of additional same-type competitors increases as the number of same-type competitors increases. Furthermore, we find that the effects of generalist VCs on specialists are substantial, and larger than the effect of same-type competitors. Estimates from other industries typically show the incremental effects falling as the number of same-type competitors increases and the effects of same-type competitors as always being larger than the effects of different-type competitors. Consistent with the presence of network effects that soften competition, these patterns are more pronounced in markets that exhibit dense organizational networks among incumbent VCs. Markets with sparser incumbent networks, by contrast, exhibit competitive patterns that resemble those of other, non-networked industries.","[Hochberg, Yael V.] Rice Univ, Jones Sch Business, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Mazzeo, Michael J.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [McDevitt, Ryan C.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Rice University; Northwestern University; Duke University,"Mazzeo, MJ (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Jones Sch Business, 6100 Main St,MS-531, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",Hochberg@rice.edu; mazzeo@kellogg.northwestern.edu; ryan.mcdevitt@duke.edu,,,,,,,25,17,20,4,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

To fill this gap, we propose that corporate entrepreneurship (CE) (i.e. innovation and corporate venturing) can be viewed as a dynamic capability. Then, we argue that CE integrates institutional capital derived from institutional network with other internal and external organisational resources to create new resources and capabilities that respond to changing opportunities and challenges in the environment, thereby promoting performance outcomes.

We consider the definition of a set of seven criteria and respective parameters, structured in four groups: logistics/transportation, economic/financial, social and environmental. Representatives of four different sectors, which contribute to the decision making on transportation in Brazil, were used to find their different points of view about the criteria. With the main aim of prioritization of the criteria, it was considered one of the national policies of Brazilian transportation goals, i.e., the modal split balance of interurban cargo transportation. Thus, each expert provided a pair comparisons of the criteria and pondered their relative importance, attributing weights based upon the scale used by AHP. These comparisons do not consider which projects should be prioritized, but only the importance of each criterion in relation to the others. As a main result, the criterion reduction of transportation costs was presented in several scenarios as the most relevant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus specifically on the FCE organization, and highlight the importance of critical transitions, relatively short periods of time when fundamental changes were made to its formal and informal governance rules, which redefined the event's identity and scope, and thus ensured it remained the dominant event for field participants. In terms of the organizational dynamics facilitating critical transitions, we emphasize the importance of conflict as a driver of change, as well as the particular role of local stakeholders in renewing FCEs that are organized recurrently in the same location.","[Leca, Bernard] Univ Paris 09, GFR Comptabil Controle, DRM MOST, F-75775 Paris, France; [Rueling, Charles-Clemens] Grenoble Ecole Management, Dept People Org & Soc, Grenoble, France; [Puthod, Dominique] Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, IUT Annecy, Dept GEA, Annecy Le Vieux, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Grenoble Ecole Management; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Leca, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris, France.",bernard.leca@dauphine.fr,"Ruling, Charles-Clemens/AAB-1166-2020","Ruling, Charles-Clemens/0000-0002-9955-5967",,,,,48,11,12,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Nine new drivers educated according to this curriculum were compared with nine experienced drivers with regards to their understanding and practise of eco-driving. The results show that a majority of the drivers had heard about 'eco-driving' but that their understanding of the concept differed considerably. Their interpretation can be categorised into three levels: operational, tactical, and strategic eco-driving. Differences were found between experienced and new drivers: new drivers' understanding concerned the operational level, eco-driving as a technique, and had clearly been shaped by the driving education. Experienced drivers' interpretation of eco-driving was broader and included strategic and tactical decisions, such as choice of car, route choice and maintenance. Their understanding was shaped by various sources including experience and media coverage. Each individual driver's interpretation of eco-driving mostly comprised one level in the hierarchy, resulting in lock-in effects reducing their perceived action space. This perceived limited action space clashed with the motivation they felt to act, creating problems. Hence, efforts should be made to enhance the perceived action space. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While this history of one sub-organization, the Bureau of Economics, is a description of the role of economists in antitrust and consumer protection, it also provides an example of an entity that serves an economic staff function for a larger organization run largely by attorneys. That arrangement is not uncommon in the federal government, since many government agencies utilize economists and only one, the Federal Reserve, is run by economists. Despite this organizational structure, economists at the FTC have had a significant role since its 1914 founding, and in the most recent 40 years, those economists have produced work that not only made the FTC a more efficient and effective regulator, but also enhanced the knowledge of economists generally in areas of FTC specialty.","[Pautler, Paul A.] Fed Trade Commiss, Wirtz, VA 24184 USA",,,p7bpautler@gmail.com,,,,,,,103,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In this study, we quantify and monetize four ecosystem services (carbon sequestration and storage, air pollution removal, runoff reduction, groundwater recharge) provided by the urban green space of Schlosspark Nymphenburg in Munich, Germany. We classify four different land cover types (tree, grass/herbaceous, water, impervious) to calculate different amounts of ecosystem services according to the land cover type.

Usually, models of the MIDAS-class use lag polynomials of a specific function which impose some structure on the weights of the regressors included in the model. This may lead to a deterioration in the predictive power of the model if the structure imposed differs from the data generating process. When the difference between the available data frequencies is small and there is no risk of parameter proliferation, using an unrestricted lag polynomial might not only simplify the model estimation, but also improve its forecasting performance. We allow the parameters of the MIDAS model with an unrestricted lag polynomial to change according to a Markov-switching scheme in order to account for the business cycle pattern observed in many macroeconomic variables. Thus, we combine the unrestricted MIDAS with a Markov-switching approach and propose a new Markov-switching MIDAS model with unrestricted lag polynomial (MS-U-MIDAS). We apply this model to a large dataset with the help of factor analysis. Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical forecasting comparison carried out for the U.S. GDP growth show that the models of the MS-U-MIDAS class exhibit nowcasting and forecasting performances which are similar to or better than those of their counterparts with restricted lag polynomials.

Universities are one of those types that are more and more dependent on IT having a technological infrastructure made of heterogeneous technologies that turns IT Governance into a real challenge. The teaching-learning and research processes, nuclear for universities, require effective and efficient IT governance so universities remain competitive. IT governance calls for the definition and implementation of formal practices at the highest level in the organization involving structures, processes and relational mechanisms for the creation of business value from IT investments. However, it is quite notorious the difficulty in defining and implementing those practices from frameworks such as COBIT, ITIL, ISO/IEC 38500, among others. The level of adoption of such frameworks at universities is quite low, superficial or limited in scope. To address these issues, we propose, using design science research, the development of an IT governance model for public universities. The model will be designed having the appropriate mechanisms identified through survey research and case studies involving Portuguese and Brazilian public universities. We expect to contribute with a model having structures, processes and relational mechanisms suitable for the public sector universities with the guidelines for effective and efficient IT governance. Moreover, contributions to the body of knowledge, regarding the adoption of frameworks such as COBIT and ITIL, taking in consideration contextual and contingency factors, are also expected in what particularly relates to Portuguese and Brazilian public universities.","[Bianchi, Isaias Scalabrin; de Sousa, Rui Dinis] Univ Minho, Dept Informat Syst, ALGORITMI R&D Ctr, Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Bianchi, IS (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Informat Syst, ALGORITMI R&D Ctr, Guimaraes, Portugal.",isaias.bianchi@gmail.com; rds@dsi.uminho.pt,"Bianchi, Isaias/JAN-8936-2023; Bianchi, Isaias/L-9990-2015; Sousa, Rui Dinis/M-6477-2013","Bianchi, Isaias/0000-0001-5480-0642; Sousa, Rui Dinis/0000-0001-7607-555X",,,,,51,1,1,0,12,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3038.0,3046,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700316,0

Heckscher-Ohlin theorem of comparative advantages can largely explain international trade in cases where the sample of countries is heterogeneous, in terms of the achieved level of development and the production factors abundance. In regards to aforementioned research hypothesis was tested using several regression models. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that the international merchandise trade between Croatia and other European Union (EU) members is in accordance with the assumed by Heckscher-Ohlin comparative advantages theory. The difference in production factors abundance between Croatia and other European Union members better explains differences in production factor unit prices than net merchandise trade. Empirical testing show that merchandise trade between Croatia and other European Union members is correlated with the capital abundance. We found no significant correlation between merchandise trade and relative education level of Croatian labor force in regards to other EU countries. Furthermore, based on the empirical testing, it can be concluded that Croatia in regards to EU27 average, is a labor abundant country and net exports of Croatian manufacturing is labor intensive. Estimated results point out the production factor importance as a base for further merchandise exports development and economic development as a whole. Finally, basic conclusion is that Croatia needs to put more effort on investment attraction and therefore capital to labor ratio increase.","[Bilas, Vlatka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Bosnjak, Mile] SKDD CCP Smart Clear Ltd, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Bilas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vbilas@efzg.hr; mile.bosnjak76@gmail.com,"Bošnjak, Mile/K-7237-2019; Bošnjak, Mile/T-3085-2018; Bilas, Vlatka/I-9372-2018","Bošnjak, Mile/0000-0002-7663-198X; Bošnjak, Mile/0000-0002-7663-198X; Bilas, Vlatka/0000-0002-9021-6651",,,,,18,7,7,0,12,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

In this model, higher maternal mortality predicts lower N, while higher child mortality predicts lower Q. Thus, the two effects together make likely negative associations between HIV and both Q and N. Based on longitudinal micro-data on mothers and their children in rural Malawi, our results suggest that higher mothers' reported HIV risk reduces both child quality, as reflected in children's schooling and health, and child quantity, when the perceived risk is already moderate or high.

To understand the sources of advice sought to start the business, factors affecting success of the business, specific UAE conditions that affected business operations, and the problems Emirati women entrepreneurs faced in being self-employed, a factor analysis using Principle Components method subject to varimax rotation was conducted. Findings revealed that Emirati women entrepreneurs consider 3 main factors that will affect the success of their businesses. The Management Skills and Customer Support factor seems to dominate. Therefore, factor inputs (personnel, capital, training, Government) and reputation factors are important but they are balanced with Management skills and customer support. The major problem that the Emirati women entrepreneurs faced in being self-employed are efforts to manage (i.e. too much work, responsibility, and no time for family).

Still, with changes in technologies, the functions of employees' regular learning and qualification improvement of human resources are necessary. Due to this reason, in the organisations of both public and private sectors, the qualification improvement process takes place. Despite this, the research reveals that many problems, the employees face are related with insufficient qualification of human resources; therefore, the determination of both features of human resource qualification improvement in public and private sector as well as the main actions of this process improvement had relevance. First of all, in this paper, the exploration level of the features of human resource qualification improvement in public and private sector was revealed. It is noticeable that usually research are limited to one sector (Sakalas, Vienazindiene, 2010; Miliukiene, Prakapiene, 2012; Svagzdiene et al., 2013) or are assessed generally without focusing on the features of these sectors (Fleischhauer, 2007; Meuse et al., 2012); therefore, this paper would fill this gap. The main features of human resource qualification improvement of public and private sectors' organisations are as follows: the training methods applied are different; private organisations are more innovative; therefore, they apply not only traditional methods of employees' qualification improvement and thus get better results. Despite of the features of public and private sector, the most important activities of qualification improvement process of human resources are related to the determination of lacking competences and their improvement; due to this, future scientific researches are suggested to be related with this issue.","[Jasinskas, Edmundas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Emeljanovas, Arunas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sport Educ, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bilan, Yuriy] Szczecin Univ Jana Pawla, Dept Microecon, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland",Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Jasinskas, E (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Perkuno Ave 3a, Kaunas, Lithuania.",edmundas.jasinskas@gmail.com; arunas.emeljanovas@lsm.it; yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk,"Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Jasinskas, Edmundas/JYO-6178-2024","Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Jasinskas, Edmundas/0000-0003-3158-2974",,,,,36,4,4,2,17,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

At present, many countries consider cultural industry as their core industry, consider cultural trade as a national strategy. Among them, Korea attaches great importance to the development of culture industry since the Asian financial crisis, sees it as a pillar industry. The management and development pattern of Korean culture industry is initiated by the Government, and developed by the private entrepreneurs. Practice has proved that this pattern is a huge success, has created a significant economic value for Korea, and won an international reputation. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of the development of Korean culture industry mechanisms and use that for innovation and development of Chinese culture industry is of great practical significance. With the accelerating process of economic globalization, human economic life has launched a comprehensive global communication and exchanges, extending from economic field into the field of culture. Culture has evolved into a new kind of soft power. It is because of the special influence of culture, countries all over the world took culture as an economic form at the end of 20th century, turning it into culture industry to enhance their international competitiveness.

A review of literature on location theories related to both examined sectors is carried out in the first part of the paper. In the scope of this review, a brief description of location factors can be found. It is followed by a diagram of chosen location factors. 26 factors were divided into four groups local, business, workforce and infrastructural factors. This classification is used for a better and clearer understanding of the chosen factors. The following part of the paper contains a description of the research methodology, including the appropriate choice of investigative method and a detailed characteristics of chosen respondents. As well as the primary sector, large enterprises were eliminated, as focusing described research to very small, small and medium-sized enterprises is much easier and, in case of SME, it is also possible to presume a stronger emphasis placed on the location factors under examination. The aim of the paper is to verify by means of regression analysis whether the assessment of both sectors can be considered identical. This hypothesis was confirmed in all examined groups and therefore it is not possible to presume a different perception of location factors in the case of industrial enterprises in comparison to enterprises providing services.","Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Jirásková, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Liberec, Czech Republic.",eliska.jiraskova@tul.cz,"Valentová, Eliška/HNQ-0897-2023",,,,,,45,5,5,2,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The hierarchical structures of the relationships between government bond markets in the EU countries are assessed in several stages. The correlation between EU government bond market indices is evaluated in the first stage of the research. In the second stage, the calculated correlation coefficients are converted into metric distances with the smallest distances between the markets used for plotting the minimum spanning tree. The results of the research revealed that the common currency and geographic proximity influence the metric distances between the government bond markets of the EU countries. In addition, there could be excluded several central government bond markets that most closely connect with other markets and form the base of the tree, i.e., Austria and Germany. The authors suggest adding government bond markets of Finland, Netherlands, and France to this group. On the contrary, government bond markets of new EU countries, as it was expected, tend to form separate clusters and move differently from the old ones.","[Levisauskaite, Kristina; Alekneviciene, Egle] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Alekneviciene, Vilija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Dist, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Levisauskaite, K (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, S Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",k.levisauskaite@evf.vdu.lt; vilija.alekneviciene@asu.lt; egle.alekneviciute@gmail.com,,"Alekneviciene, Vilija/0000-0002-6501-8792",,,,,26,2,2,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In spite of that, there is limited knowledge about its pervasiveness in economic and management sciences in South Africa. Based on a content analysis of 332 articles published in The South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences from 2003 to 2011, the main purpose of this quantitative study is to explore the prevalence of MMR in SAJEMS. Although methodological advances have been made in the field of economic and management sciences as reflected in the articles in SAJEMS, the findings reveal that scholars employ quantitative and qualitative methodologies than MMR. Given the paucity of MMR in the field, this study underscores the potential benefits of embracing methodological pluralism as it offers methodological and theoretical benefits. First, the use of MMR provides the possibility for researchers to obtain a comprehensive picture of a phenomenon under investigation and achieve their research purpose effectively. Secondly, its utilisation may also contribute to theory development and the maturity of the field as reflected in SAJEMS.","[Ngulube, Patrick] Univ S Africa, Sch Interdisciplinary Res & Postgrad Studies, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Ngulube, Beatrice] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Educ Studies, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; Tshwane University of Technology,"Ngulube, P (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Sch Interdisciplinary Res & Postgrad Studies, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",ngulup@unisa.ac.za,,"Ngulube, Patrick/0000-0002-7676-3931; Ngulube, Beatrice/0000-0001-5631-9094",National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF),National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"We wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their time and very helpful comments on earlier versions of this article, and the independent coder who helped in resolving the coding difference between the researchers.

That is why performance needs to be evaluated from both the qualitative and quantitative points of view. The classical financial approach to measuring a company's performance based on past results is no longer sufficient; it needs to be complemented with a non-financial measurement method. This paper focuses on financial analysis, which is one of the tools used for assessing the performance and financial status of companies. The current individual financial analysis indicators must be processed taking into account the influences that potentially affect and distort the results, as well as with their comparability over time and within a single accounting unit or among individual companies. As far as financial analysis is concerned, attention has to be paid to the method used for evaluating assets and liabilities, as this issue greatly affects the informative utility of financial statements and the final data relevant to income from operations, which are the input data for processing individual financial indicators. After that the paper deals with the research that was focused on companies located in the Czech Republic. The aim of the research was to analyse the methods of measurement of financial performance use the Czech companies. Another important task is to plot the approach used by companies to conduct financial analysis in the Czech Republic. It should illustrate whether companies process such analysis independently and regularly using their in-house information systems and identify the most commonly- assessed indicators. It is important that companies process their financial statements so that they can subsequently be assessed and compared over time while maintaining adherence to the same accounting procedures.","[Pur, David; Jacova, Helena; Horak, Josef] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Pur, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic.",david.pur@tul.cz; helena.jacova@tul.cz; josef.horak1@tul.cz,"Horak, Josef/AAF-5477-2021; Jacova, Helena/G-1561-2019","Horak, Josef/0000-0002-6672-850X; Jacova, Helena/0000-0001-8622-1899","Technical University of Liberec, The Faculty of Economics","Technical University of Liberec, The Faculty of Economics","This paper was created in accordance with the research project entitled The analysis of current approach of companies to evaluation of productivity and financial situation using company information systems undertaken by The Technical University of Liberec, The Faculty of Economics.",,24,6,6,10,57,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Buildings, which account for approximately half of all annual energy and greenhouse gas emissions, are an important target area for any strategy addressing climate change. Over the years, GHG emissions have been increasing in Malaysia. A significant share of these emissions can be avoided cost effectively through improved energy efficiency in retrofitting the commercial sector, while providing the same or higher level of energy savings. Non-domestic buildings account for 20% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This paper briefly provides an overview of the potential reduction in energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Malaysia as a means of retrofitting commercial building sector. Malaysia's total demand of energy increased from 1,244 Petajoules (PJ) to 2,217.9 PJ in 2010. Commercial buildings, alone, account for about 32% of total energy consumption. In this regard, integrating concepts in terms of greater use of energy efficient technologies or options and behavioral changes can substantially reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the commercial sector.","[Shika, Suleiman Aliyu; Sapri, Maimunah; Abdullah, Shahabudin; Jibril, Jibril D.; Shahril, A.

The opponents of fair value accounting insist on that financial reporting based on fair value measurement has accelerated the financial crisis and significantly worsened the impact on affected companies. The paper aim is to contribute to the actual debate whether fair value accounting played the role of a messenger or a mover in the recent financial crunch and subsequent economic recession and to analyse the characteristics of fair value accounting from the economic point of view, also to examine and depict the advantages and disadvantages connected to fair value, providing the reader with objective information and thorough insight into the problems and benefits of fair value.

The analysis itself was based upon annually published top 100 databases, where one hundred largest enterprises in the Czech Republic - in terms of their turnover - can be found. Basic sample for qualitative part of this research was composed of 190 enterprises. This was brought on by their repetitive presence in top 100 databases as well as by bankruptcy of some of them. On the whole, 53 valid questionnaires returned to the researchers, which means rate of return was roughly 28%. The main objective of our article is to show the differentiation of large enterprise headquarters in the Czech Republic just according to their location preferences. Apart from traditional factors, such as geographical location or agglomeration economies, several other factors, such as infrastructure, proximity of customers, proximity of suppliers, availability or quantity of local work force or quality of entrepreneurial milieu turned out to be important The above differentiation will be accomplished by means of cluster analysis, which proved its usefulness for our purposes.

This has resulted in the institutionalization of categories such as an information economy (1997), intangible assets (2001) and, most recently, a knowledge-adjusted GDP (2013) in these calculating technologies. By harnessing knowledge as a manageable and valuable object, these shifts are responding but also contributing to the concept of a knowledge economy. This paper investigates the conditions necessary to anchor these new categories of value.

One of the fundamental issues that accompany their practical application is setting of the correct rates of the fees in relation to the time frame and targets to be achieved by the tool application. When setting the rate of an environmental fee for a short term, the price can be adjusted flexibly based on the current situation. For some longer-term environmental policy goals, fees are employed that are collected in the form of advance payments years or even decades before the actual meeting of the goals (typically, recycling fees when purchasing electrical appliances, for example, so-called acquisition fees), which entails numerous risks and ncertainties that have to be taken into account when setting the optimum rate of the fee. Moreover, the chance to modify the fee substantially during the period is lost in this case. The paper deals with readjusting the current rate of the recycling fee for PV modules (currently CZK 8.50/kg), which will be utilised in a time frame of 15-30 years after the collection. Its setting is influenced by the complexity and uncertainty of predicting future price trends and technological advancements. Using micro models and applying the precautionary principle, we propose an adjustment to CZK 5.2-7.8/kg based on the technological changes and the market situation.","[Zemkova, Lenka; Machac, Jan; Louda, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Machac, Jan; Louda, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vojacek, Ondrej] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Mech Engn, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Zemková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",zemkova@e-academia.eu; machac@e-academia.eu; louda@ieep.cz; ondrej.vojacek@gmail.com,"Zemkova, Lenka/R-5228-2016; Macháč, Jan/AEQ-1532-2022; Louda, Jiri/L-9756-2017","Louda, Jiri/0000-0001-7194-3178",,,,,10,0,0,0,5,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,256.0,260,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800042,0

The early attempt to category sources of innovation in the industry depicted it as a supplier driven industry using large data sets from secondary sources. Given the lack of profound firm-level research in the industry, this paper uses four case studies of national firms in Malaysia to examine innovation in the industry. The evidence shows that major innovations in these firms evolve as a crystallization of project demand that drives firms to seek external sources of knowledge that is adapted to meet the construction demand of clients. In doing so two firms demonstrated radical innovations as its diffusion has transformed construction in Malaysia. The remaining two firms are engaged in incremental engineering activities. Also, innovations in two firms were led by their own managements, while the remaining two were supplier-led. In addition, while innovations in all four firms are characterised by re-conceptualisation of foreign sources of knowledge, innovation in one firm involved architectural designing and another modularisation. A blend of institutions constituted by government policy, in-house command, trust and collaborative practices, markets, and industry standards have shaped these innovations.","[Chang, Yean Fang; Chan, Wai Meng] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Business Strategy & Policy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Rasiah, Rajah] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rajah@um.edu.my,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011",,,,,66,5,7,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

There is evidence that CP supports advanced economic development in lagging and peripheral regions, hence contributing to the 'convergence objective'. The effectiveness of CP, however, depends on the manner in which funds are managed by single regions: the likelihood of progressing in the income distribution is associated, in fact, to the balance between investments in infrastructure and the productive environment, favouring the former. Evidence presented in this paper also relates regional economic performance to the educational level and innovation in regions, providing useful insights for the current debate about reshaping EU cohesion policy toward a more place-based approach.","[Fabrizi, Enrico; Timpano, Francesco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Guastella, Gianni] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Math & Phys, Via Musei 41, I-25121 Brescia, Italy; [Marta, Stefano] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Fabrizi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",enrico.fabrizi@unicatt.it; giovanni.guastella@unicatt.it; Stefano.Marta@fao.org; francesco.timpano@unicatt.it,"Guastella, Gianni/Q-6653-2016","Guastella, Gianni/0000-0002-1333-4718",,,,,52,1,1,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Thus, a free press may improve citizens' accessibility to this information, which in turn will make it more difficult for politicians and public servants to cover up or get away with corrupt behaviour, so the quality of the government could be affected by the media freedom. Accordingly, the main aim of this paper is to determine the effect of the freedom of the press on government effectiveness, considering additionally environmental, institutional, and political characteristics as factors that could determine the level of government effectiveness. To achieve this aim, we examined 202 central governments and compared them across countries using the World Bank data set of Governance Indicators for 2002-2008. The results show that the media, the organizational environment, and political characteristics may be determinants of the level of government effectiveness, taking countries' economic development into account.","[Garcia-Sanchez, Isabel-Maria; Cuadrado-Ballesteros, Beatriz] Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Miguel Unamuno FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Frias-Aceituno, Jose-Valeriano] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Campus La Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Salamanca; University of Granada,"Cuadrado-Ballesteros, B (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Miguel Unamuno FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",lajefa@usal.es; u77171@usal.es; jfrias@ugr.es,"Frías-Aceituno, José-Valeriano/ABE-5705-2021; García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/F-4271-2016; Cuadrado-Ballesteros, Beatriz/B-1434-2017","García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/0000-0003-4711-8631; Cuadrado-Ballesteros, Beatriz/0000-0003-3606-2302; Frias Aceituno, Jose Valeriano/0000-0001-8560-7167",,,,,73,11,11,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper investigates actual external marginal costs of transport in Sweden for all modes of passenger transport in urban and rural areas and compare it to the level of positive system-and scale effects in local and regional public transport. The study is based on marginal costs of traffic in Sweden as reported in Transport Analysis yearly report to the government and on research on optimal public transport pricing. The numerical examples exemplify the situation in Sweden for a rural area (Jamtland County) and a larger urban area (Stockholm County). It is highlighted that taxes and fees in level with marginal costs can cover the existing financial deficit for public transport and an optimal subsidy in both the urban county and the rural county. However, among other things it is necessary to handle the legal aspects of such a funding of public transport before it could be used in the reality. Public transport are financed at county level, while the taxes and charges from traffic are an income on a national level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, there is sparse evidence on whether adolescent health may influence educational attainment. Using a large registry dataset of twins, including comprehensive information on health status at the age of 18 and later educational attainment, we investigate whether health predicts final education within monozygotic (identical) twin pairs. We find no evidence of this and conclude that health in adolescence may not have an influence on the level of schooling. Instead, raw correlations between adolescent health and schooling appear to be driven by genes and twin-pair-specific environmental factors.","[Lundborg, Petter] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter; Rooth, Dan-Olof] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Nilsson, Anton] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, POB 7083, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Anton] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7083, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Anton] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Rooth, Dan-Olof] Stockholm Univ, SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Rooth, Dan-Olof] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Labour Market & Discriminat Studies, Vaxjo, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Lund University; Lund University; Aarhus University; Stockholm University; Linnaeus University,"Nilsson, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, POB 7083, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Nilsson, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7083, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Nilsson, A (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark.",anton.nilsson@nek.lu.se,"Nilsson, Anton/A-8961-2015","Rooth, Dan-Olof/0000-0001-8887-5677",Centre for Economic Demography; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Centre for Economic Demography; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,This study was funded by the Centre for Economic Demography and the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation.,,44,3,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

A multilevel model is employed to identify the housing price uplift after the opening of the BRT system. Catchment and control areas are selected from the property sales data to control for the potential external shocks to house prices. The modelling takes account of the property, neighbourhood and accessibility attributes which are expected to affect the property transaction price to quantify the land value uplift from the BRT system and the point in time when it occurs. This research found that the sales price of residential properties within 400 m of BRT stops are marginally higher than those outside of the BRT service area after the opening of the BRT system in 2003 and 2004. The research outcomes provide evidence to government sectors for planning future BRT systems and for quantifying the potential to raise financial funding for public transport improvement through the gain of land value uplift.

A heterogeneous autoregressive process (HAR) is combined with a genetic algorithm-support vector regression (GASVR) model in two hybrid algorithms. The algorithms' statistical performances are benchmarked against the best forecasters on the VIX, VXN and VXD volatility indices. The trading performances of the forecasts are evaluated through a trading simulation based on VIX and VXN futures contracts, as well as on the VXZ exchange traded note based on the S&P 500 VIX mid-term futures index. Our findings indicate the existence of strong nonlinearities in all indices examined, while the GASVR algorithm improves the statistical significance of the HAR processes. The trading performances of the hybrid models reveal the possibility of economically significant profits. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The fundamental principle is that track fees should be set as close as possible to optimal congestion tolls on a track segment. Since this procedure gives an incentive to keep capacity inefficiently low in order to increase congestion tolls, the second principle is that track fees be devoted to paying for track maintenance, the opportunity cost of land, and the amortization of plant and equipment installed on the track. The third principle is that track fees should be set by traffic and cost conditions on a line and should not vary with the identity of the user whose freight is hauled on the line; this third principle is designed to encourage efficient location and mode choice. The combination of these three principles has the promise of increased willingness to use rail logistics systems, the installation of an appropriate level of capacity on each line, and optimal routing and traffic levels throughout the rail system.","[Boyer, Kenneth D.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Boyer, KD (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",boyerkd@msu.edu,,"Boyer, Kenneth/0000-0001-9726-7518",,,,,27,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In contrast, countries like China, Russia, and Japan treat the briber more mildly. Asymmetric punishment has been shown to help deter harassment bribery. However, we conjecture that asymmetry is ineffective when applied to collusive bribes. Instead of deterring bribes, asymmetry might enable the briber to enforce the corrupt deal. To test this hypothesis, we design and run a lab experiment in Bonn (Germany) and Shanghai (China) with exactly the same design. The results show that, in both countries, with symmetric punishment bribers are less likely to report to the authorities. Officials are less likely to grant the favor. In Shanghai, corrupt offers are then also less likely. If we frame the experiment as collusive corruption, effects are less pronounced, but we can replicate all of them.","[Engel, Christoph] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Goerg, Sebastian J.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Yu, Gaoneng] Northwest Univ, Kirkland, WA USA",Max Planck Society; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Goerg, SJ (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, 113 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",sgoerg@fsu.edu,"Goerg, Sebastian J./AAL-4475-2020","Goerg, Sebastian J./0000-0002-1740-6870",Max-Planck Gesellschaft,Max-Planck Gesellschaft(Max Planck Society),"We would like to thank the teams of the BonnEconLab, University of Bonn, and of the Vernon-Smith Experimental Economics Research Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University for supporting the conduction of the experiments.

Findings are presented from a household postal survey from three case study areas built between 2001 and 2008. The case study areas are typical 'middle class' suburbs, and were constructed at a time when Ireland was experiencing unprecedented economic growth. The subsequent recession left many of these areas in significant negative equity, and householders with very limited housing mobility. Results from the survey point to considerable problems that are impacting on population groups typically vulnerable to transport disadvantage, such as low income earners and car-less households. The study also highlights the burdens on middle and high income households, and those who are experiencing 'forced car ownership'.

It builds upon recent evidence that the mode of governance could vary profoundly among firms engaged in the same GVC/GPN. Therefore, the relevance of particular types of upgrading that were originally derived from the ideal types of GVC/GPN governance will be reconsidered. It is argued that the existing dissonance in the literature over possibilities for functional upgrading can be attributed to the different modes of governance that can exist within a particular GVC/GPN and to the diverse nature of functional upgrading. Consequently, a typology of functional upgrading is outlined, and it is argued that these different types vary significantly according to their probability and potential risk-benefit ratios. The article also introduces passive, adaptive and strategic downgrading and outlines their potential negative and positive effects on firms.","[Blazek, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Albertov 6, Prague 12843, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Blazek, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Albertov 6, Prague 12843, Czech Republic.",blazek@natur.cuni.cz,"Blazek, Jiri/M-4430-2017","Blazek, Jiri/0000-0002-6987-3833",FP7 project Smart Specialisation For Regional Innovation [320131],FP7 project Smart Specialisation For Regional Innovation,Financial support of FP7 project Smart Specialisation For Regional Innovation (no. 320131) is greatly acknowledged.,,73,92,102,2,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Because these dimensions have trade-off relationships among them, we developed a multi-objective optimization model for planning optimal road capacity improvement. Three indicators, each measuring one dimension of sustainability, were used as the objectives in the proposed model. The total travel cost, which combines the monetized value of travel, time and operating costs, was adopted as the economic indicator. The total emissions cost and the GINI coefficient based on zonal accessibility were adopted as the environmental and equity indicators, respectively. We performed an experimental test with three model scenarios to compare the single- and multi-objective approaches and different objective functions. We obtained Pareto optimal solutions using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The results show that the proposed model, which is based on the multi-objective approach and considers all three dimensions of sustainability, is more suitable than other options for designing a sustainable road network. In addition, we suggest that the frequency rate of a link within Pareto solutions can be used to prioritize capacity improvement for maximum road network sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, research has shown that implementation of transport policies, whatever their focus may be, does not always result in them being employed in the daily transport planning. In Sweden, accessibility policy has a long tradition but gained increased interest in 1999 with an action plan which aimed at ensuring participation of all people with all kinds of disabilities. The overall aim of this study was to investigate how accessibility policy for older people and people with disabilities in the outdoor environment has been implemented in the daily transport planning and how it has progressed/regressed over time. The results in this paper are based on longitudinal data from questionnaire sent out to all municipalities in Sweden in 2004 and 2014. The results indicate that it has become more established to consider accessibility in transportation planning. However, the results also show that there are still some considerable differences between the municipalities regarding their level of implemented accessibility policy. Also, the municipal transport planners seem to be less aware of the legislative directives and recommendations in 2014 than in 2004. Overall, there is need for improved knowledge and awareness of accessibility issues among all actors involved in municipal planning and a need for a more effective and systematic approach when planning and designing outdoor environments for all.

Over the past 100 plus years, both research efforts and industry practices in this area have focused primarily on point load forecasting. In the most recent decade, though, the increased market competition, aging infrastructure and renewable integration requirements mean that probabilistic load forecasting has become more and more important to energy systems planning and operations. This paper offers a tutorial review of probabilistic electric load forecasting, including notable techniques, methodologies and evaluation methods, and common misunderstandings. We also underline the need to invest in additional research, such as reproducible case studies, probabilistic load forecast evaluation and valuation, and a consideration of emerging technologies and energy policies in the probabilistic load forecasting process.

To this end, the strategies saving, negotiating, selling, and earning are taken into account in designing a questionnaire. Two measures of saving behaviors are used: general tendency to save and saving by adjusting expenditure when faced with an income constraint. The sample consists of 470 British school students from age 11 to 18. Results show that up to age 15, the strategies saving and negotiating are equally important and more important than selling or earning. When 15 or older, adolescents prefer saving above negotiating. Regression analyses reveal that adolescents who favor saving when confronted with a short-term income constraint report a general tendency to save. Findings demonstrate the importance of developing positive financial habits early in life.","[Otto, Annette] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Webley, Paul] SOAS Univ London, Econ Psychol, London, England",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Otto, A (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany.",ottoa@uni-mainz.de; pw2@soas.ac.uk,"Webley, Paul A/A-3717-2008",,"School of Psychology, University of Exeter, UK","School of Psychology, University of Exeter, UK","This research was supported by the School of Psychology, University of Exeter, UK.

More specifically we outline the effect of the local government reforms, and, in particular, the redesign of intergovernmental fiscal relations (namely, territorial rescaling, expenditure and revenue re-assignment, changes in central government transfers) on the local public finances. Using data from the Local Authority Budgets we examine changes to the main service divisions, income sources and cross-council variations in expenditures and income, pre and post the 2014 reforms. Our results show that local government fiscal changes and recovery lag central government patterns, a general shift from central grants to local own-source revenues, and cross-council differences with respect to dependency and self-reliance persist. The establishment of Irish Water and the Local Property Tax have, at least initially, made the local government fiscal accounts, and in particular the Local Government Fund, less transparent and more complex, making an objective and accurate assessment of local authority budgets more difficult than before the reforms. Earlier publication of the consolidated Annual Financial Statements of the local authorities is called for so as to ensure continued scrutiny of the local public finances.","[Turley, Gerard; McNena, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Turley, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",gerard.turley@nuigalway.ie,,"McNena, Stephen/0000-0001-7181-1175",,,,,30,6,6,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

J,"Crabtree, J",,,,"Crabtree, John",,,A Different Path for Rural America,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A dominant narrative in the United States posits that rural out-migration and social decline of rural areas and small towns is inevitable. Although there is evidence of that view, there are also positive signs that point to the vitality of rural America. Although rural areas are losing population, that is partly a statistical artifact, since any rural area that succeeds in growing may be reclassified as an urban area, thus incorrectly seeming to indicate rural decline. This article explores three policy changes that could help to restore the vibrancy of rural and small-town America: increased support for programs targeted toward rural economic development, setting limits on the ability of large farms to accrue a large share of the insurance subsidies available to farmers, and limiting the ability of vertically integrated hog farms to dissuade new farmers from investing in this traditional method of becoming a farmer.","[Crabtree, John] Ctr Rural Affairs, Lyons, NE 68038 USA",,"Crabtree, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Rural Affairs, Lyons, NE 68038 USA.",,"Crabtree, Henry John/HJY-9166-2023",,,,,,10,8,15,2,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In this study, we seek to derive some prescriptive results of the relationship between urban population density and the financial sustainability of rail transit service. We consider an idealized metropolitan region with a central business district (CBD) at its center, whose population is distributed according to a certain density gradient pattern. Trips generated from the region to the CBD are either served by the rail service supplemented with feeder buses, or by autos. We study the effect of urban development density on the financial sustain ability of the rail service by examining the supply and demand patterns. The analysis result sheds light on the threshold urban density required to ensure financially sustainable rail transit service. The result also provides guidelines to policy makers for planning urban developments with financially sustainable rail services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Wang, David Z.

The inter-play of visions colliding around the Oyapock bridge, it is argued, illuminates the paradoxes and contradictions of European territorial governance in the globalised time-space of its postcolonial frontiers. In spite of the high geopolitical rhetoric seeking to unite both continents, the peculiar blindness of Europe's metropolitan gaze vis-a-vis indigenous difference sets the stage for perverse effects of exclusion and disempowerment in and around the site of the bridge itself, extending far into its regional hinterlands. Framed against the backdrop of a long, utopian' modernity of European imperial expansion and territorial conquest, the ghostly spatial dynamics surrounding the Oyapock River bridge project serve to illuminate wider challenges to the projection of EU influence in the world'. A close examination of similar dynamics elsewhere may help bring into focus the lineaments of a more fully confident and mature postcolonial European border studies.","[Kramsch, Olivier Thomas] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Kramsch, OT (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",O.Kramsch@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Implementing a large number of controls, as well as different estimation techniques and robustness tests, we show that Jacobian externalities have a positive effect on spin-offs. Moreover, using an entropy measure to disentangle unrelated and related variety (RV), we conclude that the effect is confined to RV. These findings are likely to be associated with strong welfare effects: a standard deviation increase (decrease) in related (unrelated) variety increases spin-off propensity by approximately 25%. Other variables are shown to have economic effects of a similar magnitude but may have a different effect across sectors. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the impact of other determinants proposed in the literature (e.g., Marshallian externalities and scale effects) is too small to be detected.","[Baltzopoulos, Apostolos] Swedish Competit Author, Torsgatan 11, S-10385 Stockholm, Sweden; [Baltzopoulos, Apostolos; Braunerhjelm, Pontus] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Braunerhjelm, Pontus] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Grevgatan 34, SE-11453 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tikoudis, Ioannis] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tikoudis, Ioannis] Tinbergen Inst, Gustav Mahlerplein 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Braunerhjelm, P (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",pontus.braunerhjelm@indek.kth.se,,"braunerhjelm, pontus/0000-0003-0218-7924; Tikoudis, Ioannis/0000-0001-7524-3398",Marcus and Marianne Wallenberg's Foundation,Marcus and Marianne Wallenberg's Foundation,Financial support is gratefully acknowledge from the Marcus and Marianne Wallenberg's Foundation.,,67,16,16,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

These interval data models use easy-to-compute daily return intervals during the modeling, estimation and forecasting stage. They have to stand up to comparable point-data models of the well-known capital asset pricing model typewhich employ single daily returns based on successive closing prices and might allow for GARCH effectsin a comprehensive out-of-sample forecasting competition. The latter comprises roughly 1000 daily observations on all 30 stocks that constitute the DAX, Germany's main stock index, for a period covering both the calm market phase before and the more turbulent times during the recent financial crisis. The interval data models clearly outperform simple random walk benchmarks as well as the point-data competitors in the great majority of cases. This result does not only hold when one-day-ahead forecasts of the conditional variance are considered, but is even more evident when the focus is on forecasting the width or the exact location of the next day's return interval. Regression models based on interval arithmetic thus prove to be a promising alternative to established point-data volatility forecasting tools.

Density forecasts thus account for the uncertainty in all model parameters and possible future regime changes. It is shown that considering nonlinearity can improve the probabilistic assessment of the economic outlook.

This study hypothesizes that disaggregated CSR dimensions may have varying effects on airline organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach - The information was mainly drawn from COMPUSTAT and the CRSP Stock/Portfolio using the standard industry classification code (SIC) 4512. KLD was also a source of CSR information. The study period was 2000-2012. Main findings - The study found that the employee dimension plays a significant role in enhancing profitability and airline quality rating and in mitigating systematic risk. Additionally, this study demonstrated that the product dimension positively affects airline value. Originality/value - The research contributes to the body of CSR and airline literature. The study results will also help practitioners allocate corporate resources to appropriate CSR activities.","[Moon, Joonho] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Tourism Adm, Chunchon, South Korea; [Lee, Won Seok] Kyunggi Univ, Dept Tourism & Recreat, Chunchon, South Korea; [Kim, Insin] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Tourism & Convent, Pusan, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Pusan National University,"Lee, WS (通讯作者)，Kyunggi Univ, Dept Tourism & Recreat, Chunchon, South Korea.",joonhomoon0412@gmail.com; lws79877@gmail.com; insinkim@pusan.ac.kr,"Moon, Joonho/AAE-6212-2022",,,,,,83,4,4,0,36,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Global cross-country regressions of crime and incarceration on background characteristics explain much of the variation between other countries. But the estimated models predict only one-fourth of U.S. incarceration and not all of U.S. crime. The coincidence of the non-negative U.S. crime residuals with the very large positive U.S. incarceration residual constitutes a puzzle. The two pieces fit together only if the residual U.S. incarceration does not contribute to a reduction in crime, except to the extent an omitted criminogenic factor pushes up U.S. crime. The paper quantifies this relationship. Drawing on additional evidence from comparative and U.S.-specific data, it argues that the puzzle's most plausible solution combines low effectiveness of mass incarceration with omitted criminogenic factors such as U.S. neighborhood segregation.","[Spamann, Holger] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Spamann, H (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hspamann@law.harvard.edu,,,"Terence M.

In this article, we explore which factors influence the duration of merger reviews by applying multivariate duration analysis to a dataset of 130 merger decisions made by the New Zealand Commerce Commission between 2001 and 2010. Our results suggest that a range of factors influence duration, including (1) the nature of the decision, and especially whether the application is declined, (2) the size of the application, (3) the potential impact on competition, measured by market concentration and barrier to entry height, (4) the complexity of the economic analysis, and (5) the Commission's merger workload. We use a competing-risks model that reflects the three alternative decisions available to the Commission (clear at stage 1, clear at stage 2, and decline). We find that the influence of some of these factors varies greatly between decision types and that declined decisions take much longer on average, probably because declines can lead to an appeal to the High Court by disappointed applicants.","[Yang, Qing Gong] Independent Econ Consulting Ltd, Kingston, ACT, Australia; [Pickford, Michael] New Zealand Commerce Commiss, Wellington, New Zealand",,"Yang, QG (通讯作者)，Independent Econ Consulting Ltd, Kingston, ACT, Australia.;Pickford, M (通讯作者)，New Zealand Commerce Commiss, Wellington, New Zealand.",qinggong.yang@gmail.com; mikepickford@vodafone.co.nz,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Recent experience suggests that bailouts also induce litigation from shareholders and managers complaining about expropriation and wrongful termination by the government. Our model shows how governments can design tax-financed corporate bailouts to reduce these distortions and points to the causes of inefficiencies in real-world implementations such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Bailouts with minimal distortion depend critically on the government's ability to expropriate shareholders and terminate managers.","[Bernardo, Antonio E.; Welch, Ivo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Talley, Eric L.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Columbia University,"Bernardo, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,"welch, ivo/AAS-2341-2021","welch, ivo/0000-0002-4347-7250",,,,,26,4,4,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Recently, scholars from developing countries have suggested that mobile phones have the potential to empower the deprived and disadvantaged. However, in the Bangladeshi context the topic is still under researched. This research fills a gap by presenting an initial mobile phone based empowerment framework for RMG workers. The framework examines possible Mobile phone based empowerment tools that could provide workers with access to information, market and government. The framework suggests that outcomes include an increased sense of control, self-efficacy, knowledge and competency. In future, the empowerment framework presented in this research will be applied to the development of a mobile based information system for RMG workers. This research is significant as it adopts an empowerment focus rather than an individual consumer focused development outcomes. The outcomes arid results of this research will be of potential value to the government, development agencies and mobile telecommunications in accelerating the development of mobile based services in Bangladesh and in other developing countries.","[Ahad, Taimur; Busch, Peter] Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Comp, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Blount, Yvette] Macquarie Univ, Dept Accounting & Corp Governance, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Vatanasakdakul, Savanid (Nui)] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University; Macquarie University; Macquarie University,"Ahad, T (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Comp, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",md-taimur.ahad@students.mq.edu.au; peter.busch@mq.edu.au; yvette.blount@mq.edu.au; savanid.vatanasakdakul@mq.edu.au,"ahad, Md Taimur/ABB-9277-2021; Ahad, Md Taimur/JMQ-0941-2023; Busch, Peter/B-3839-2019","Ahad, Md Taimur/0000-0001-7657-2185; Busch, Peter/0000-0002-0710-772X",,,,,75,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,78.0,84,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700009,0

The objective of the paper is to critically examine the managerial prerogative, to see what it means. Managerial prerogatives are described broadly as the manager's right to manage. Management appears to ignore how the law circumscribes its decisions. This represents a serious disconnect. The research question asks whether a private manager can exercise what he or she calls a prerogative. The paper tries to show that prerogative is derived ultimately from the Crown, and as such, is non-delegable to private managers. Argument commences by providing a briefing on the managerial prerogatives. The next section discusses prerogatives as non-statutory powers, followed by a short section on Lord Bacon's views on whether or not prerogative is delegable. The research will suggest that, by law, no private manager could claim to be a lawfully appointed delegate to exercise any royal prerogative.","[Ahmad, Nehaluddin] Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic Univ UNISSA, Sch Law, Darussalam, Brunei; [Lilienthal, Gary Ian] Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Law Sch, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic University; Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis Law School (SLS) Pune,"Ahmad, N (通讯作者)，Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic Univ UNISSA, Sch Law, Darussalam, Brunei.",ahmadnehal@yahoo.com; glilienthal@me.com,"Ahmad, Nehaluddin/GWZ-2326-2022; Lilienthal, Gary/AAL-5275-2020; Lilienthal, Gary/ABH-8056-2020","Ahmad, Nehaluddin/0000-0003-1193-2092; Lilienthal, Gary/0000-0002-1875-0294",,,,,28,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,423.0,432,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700042,0

However, there are no world-wide studies on relationships between the health food market and the economic or social situations. This is because the definitions and regulations about health food differ from one country to another, so that it is difficult to compare various countries at once. We focused on Asia, since several Asian countries have established the rules and regulations of health food to date, and this area contains various countries in terms of economic situations. We executed multiple regression analysis, in which the per-capita health food expenditure and other six variables were respectively set as the objective variable and the explanatory variable candidates. As a result, it turned out that we can estimate the per-capita health food expenditure with considerable accuracy by using only two explanatory variables: the per-capita GDP and the population aging rate. The regression function obtained in this research enables us to quantitatively predict the health food market size.

Application of solutions ranges from transportation and logistics to health care, environment and rescue and safety. Including the devices in a single network allows achieving increased operational optimization, improved accuracy and efficiency; therefore, ensuring a business potential in virtually any market or industry. Although the topicality and prevalence of internet of things (IoT) are increasingly growing, as smart devices are seamlessly included in the day-to-day operations of the business environment, the benefits arising from the new digital technologies and online connectivity still remain largely underexplored in Latvia. Hence, the aim of the paper is to identify the main development drivers and the business potential of internet of things in Latvia by exploring the current experience and future readiness to optimize the cost base, develop new technologies and business models, enter new markets or industries, as well as to strengthen cooperation with the current and potential business partners by capitalizing on 24/7 connectivity of a range of devices. To achieve the above-stated aim, in January 2016 a web-based questionnaire is sent out to business organizations' representatives in Latvia asking respondents to evaluate their current experience and future potential of application of internet of things solutions in their organization to achieve an increased efficiency or develop new technologies or business models. Research results indicate that even though the general awareness of the benefits that internet of things has to offer can be considered as relatively high, the practical application of the respective solutions show that the technology adoption in this field is still fairly low; therefore, indicating unrealized potential of internet of things usage in day-to-day operations. Practical implications of research results are mainly based on the opportunity to identify gaps that prevent business customers from wider application of internet of things solutions and, consequently, benefiting from opportunities in technological and efficiency advancement.","[Binde, Juris; Zvirbule, Vita; Demjanova, Zane; Saulite, Ilze] Latvijas Mobilais Telefons Ltd, Riga, Latvia",,"Binde, J (通讯作者)，Latvijas Mobilais Telefons Ltd, Riga, Latvia.",Juris.Binde@lmt.lv,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,99.0,112,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200008,0

The presented study aims at evaluating Lithuanians' green consumption attitudes and behaviour. The study also intended to evaluate subjective wellbeing of respondents expressing different green consumption attitudes and behaviour in Lithuania (n=1002).

The main objective of this paper is to highlight that for quality decisions making at HEI's it is necessary to have relevant information about costs. Using different methods for managing costs, information about costs are significantly different. Based on that, the process of decision making and decision made on costs could vary. To examine the level of cost accounting used in HEI's, the research based on the questionnaire was conducted in the year 2006 and 2014. The questionnaire was sent to all HEI's in Republic of Croatia, more precisely to the Deans of HEI's and to the Head of Accounting of HEI's. The authors have set the main hypothesis that cost accounting tools are still not enough used in Croatian HEI's. The results of conducted research have shown that cost accounting in Croatian HEI's is still undeveloped and still not sufficiently used in the process of decision making and funding of HEI's. Moreover, authors have highlighted that some cost accounting instruments, e.g., cost allocation, are used less in 2014 than in 2006. The authors have also pointed out several potential obstacles for implementation of cost accounting in the accounting systems of HEI's.

Then, the methodology of Pereira and Martins (2002) was used to assess the risks associated with human capital, i.e. the risk for an individual to be in the lower part of the income distribution. The results indicate that human capital is not perfectly transferable and show that the relationship between risk and return is similar to that relating to financial assets: it is negative for assets that represent insurance for their owners and positive for the others. In addition, the accumulation of work experience in Canada and similar countries is accompanied by an increase in risk and a decrease in returns.

Regrettably, the rules of non-financial reporting are almost not regulated. CSR reports are drafted using a variety of principles and guidelines, which limits comparisons across enterprises, transparency and assessment of progress. The reasons for reporting non-financial information cited in the specialist literature, and by enterprises preparing CSR reports are examined, and the benefits of standardising reports of non-financial information are determined. The literature review and empirical research into the motivations for CSR reporting and the trends in reporting of non-financial information helped to verify the initial hypotheses: 1. Communication with stakeholders is the fundamental reason for reporting non-financial information. This is confirmed by the literature review, with most authors believing this is the prime reason for preparing CSR reports. Authors indicating other motivations still treat it as the fundamental cause which exists jointly with other motivations. 2. The need to standardise CSR reporting to ensure its transparency and clarity is noted by reporting organisations. This is proven by surveys of organisations drafting CSR reports approximately 80% of all reports follow the GRI guidelines. This means the reporting enterprises wish their reports to be clear, transparent and comparable and for their stakeholders to be able to fully satisfy their information requirements. This is also evidence of the care for good relations with stakeholders, who receive standardised data although this is not binding on enterprises. A growing tendency for CSR reporting to follow guidelines other than the GRI can be noted in the entire period under analysis. This will not necessarily be a single compulsory standard, yet a model report would need to be followed to assure transparency and comparability. The Regulations of the Directive 2014/95/EU are a step forward since they will help to standardise rules of reporting non-financial information and will improve its transparency and utility.","[Kristofik, Peter; Musa, Hussam] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Lament, Marzanna] Univ Technol & Humanities, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Insurance, Radom, Poland",Matej Bel University; Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Kristofík, P (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",peter.kristofik@umb.sk; m.lament@uthrad.pl; hussam.musa@umb.sk,"Krištofík, Peter/Y-6968-2019; Lament, Marzanna Barbara/ADE-1179-2022; Musa, Hussam/C-9944-2019","Krištofík, Peter/0000-0002-7612-0418; Lament, Marzanna Barbara/0000-0003-3450-5122; Musa, Hussam/0000-0002-4492-8770",,,,,63,25,25,2,42,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It establishes a conceptual framework of a Tripartite Collaborative Model (TCM) with Social Exchange Theory, Inter-organizational Collaboration Theories and Stakeholder Theory with Value Creation to depict the logic of cross-sector collaboration among the predefined partners, namely, a work integration social enterprise (WISE), a created shared value (CSV) enterprise, and a sustainable NGO for value creation. Under the framework of the TCM, iEnterprise, a privately owned WISE, established a call center in Hong Kong to create employment opportunities for people with disabilities and those from underprivileged communities while maintaining financial sustainability. The tripartite partnership of iEnterprise was developed with a value added outsourcing contract from a CSV corporate and a win-win servicing agreement with a sustainable NGO. The successful value-creation experience of iEnterprise was analyzed and evaluated as a case study for the TCM. The set of performance indicators of iEnterprise was compared with other examples of WISEs from the government subsidy model and the cross-border franchising model in order to contrast the advantages and disadvantages of a TCM. The findings confirmed the possibility of building a form of tripartite social enterprise under the collaborative framework of a TCM characterized by a low capital requirement and resulting in mission fulfillment together with financial sustainability, strategic operational efficiency and effective workfare creation on capital employed.","[Lam, Ilex K.

Furthermore, the paper analyses the impact of shifts in cropping pattern on water and land use in China's grain production. An index decomposition analysis framework is employed to calculate the corresponding contributions. The research relies on grain production data at both national and provincial levels during 2003-2012. The results show that besides the effects of area sown and pure yield changes, cropping pattern adjustment has also played an important role in promoting China's grain production, with a contribution of over 15 per cent during 2003-2012. Moreover, such changes enabled to save about 6.8 million hectares of sown areas and 31.06 billion m(3) of water in grain production (if compared to the case without cropping pattern adjustments). However, these effects vary across regions: Southeast China experienced land-saving and water-using changes, while other regions underwent land and water-saving changes. In general, China's grain output growth has increased the total amount of land and water needed, implying more severe resource constraints in the future, especially in the northern part.","[Li, Tian-xiang; Zhu, Jing; Cao, Li-juan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Weigang St 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jing; Cao, Li-juan] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Weigang St 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Kudirkos 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Yu, Wu-sheng] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Hong, Wei] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Longpan Rd 159, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; University of Copenhagen; Nanjing Forestry University,"Li, TX (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Weigang St 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",garylee0428@gmail.com; crystalzhu@njau.edu.cn; tomas@laei.lt; caolijuan_81@126.com; wusheng@ifro.ku.dk; 576048952@qq.com,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015; Yu, Wusheng/E-4626-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711; Yu, Wusheng/0000-0002-2311-3759","PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Jiangsu Centre for Food Security Studies; China Social Science Found [14ZDA038]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71203096, 71303096, 71303112]; Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20120097120042, 20123204120017]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYRC201407]; China Institute for Rural Studies, Tsinghua University","PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Jiangsu Centre for Food Security Studies; China Social Science Found; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Institute for Rural Studies, Tsinghua University","Support by PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Jiangsu Centre for Food Security Studies, China Social Science Found (14ZDA038), Natural Science Foundation of China (71203096, 71303096 and 71303112), Doctoral Program of Higher Education (20120097120042 and 20123204120017) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (KYRC201407) is acknowledged.

The analysis within this paper represents a description, i. e. perceiving facts about current situation without dwelling on trends and predictions of future development. Since the area of export poses one of the main foreign trade forms it is important to carry out a relevant analysis of small and medium enterprises' impact on it. Small and medium enterprises are considered the bearers of economic expansion and the bearers of the private property idea and this is the reason from which the need for a research arises.

It has been found in various studies that around the world, students and families are increasingly worried as they question whether the four years of extremely expensive education they undertook was sufficient preparation for employment (Gault et al., 2010). Current study, however, will attempt to get insight into possible role and future of career centres in Azerbaijan from the secondary school students' perspective. It will be argued that in order to increase employability skills of students, transition from education to work life should start from secondary schools with the active role of career centres. The study will use the survey research strategy with a quantitative data. In order to get greater understanding of the role of career centers, students participating in a survey (207 from 7 public and private schools) were asked to score on a 5-point Likert-type scale to identify their approach towards discovering their talents, developing their employability and to investigate the importance of School Career Centres may have in developing communication channels between enterprises and formal education.","[Mammadov, Toghrul; Huseynova, Khumar] Cent Bank Azerbaijan, Baku, Azerbaijan",,"Mammadov, T (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Azerbaijan, Baku, Azerbaijan.",Toghrul_Mammadov@cbar.az; Xumar_Huseynova@cbar.az,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,112.0,120,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500013,0

In various European markets, such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, mobile marketing campaigns have registered response rates of up to 47% among their target audience. The main aim of this paper is to validate a cognitive-affective model of acceptance of mobile phone advertising that integrates the utilitarian perspective through the technology acceptance model, the affective dimension through emotions, and the moderating role of the normative reference group (NRG). This model was tested with structural equation modelling in a sample of 612 individuals (R-2 of 82.4%). To analyse the moderating effect of the NRG, a sequential cluster analysis was applied, generating two groups of users: independent and influenced. A multi-sample analysis was then performed. The results showed the advisability of considering attitudes towards mobile advertising to be a variable shaped by conceptually complementary cognitive (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) and affective dimensions (positive emotions and negative emotions). Positive emotions had the strongest effect on the formation of this attitude. Negative emotions and cognitive dimensions had a few effect for the acceptance of mobile advertising. With regard to the moderating role of the NRG, among independent users, positive emotions affected the attitude more intensely and a stronger positive relationship was found between this attitude and the intention to receive advertising. No differences were found between independent users and users influenced by their NRGs with regard to the formation of attitudes due to ease of use, perceived usefulness or negative emotions. The paper thus provides a comprehensive analysis of the acceptance of mobile advertising that integrates both cognitive-affective views and the moderating role of the NRG with implications for management.","[Olarte-Pascual, Cristina; Pelegrin-Borondo, Jorge] Univ La Rioja, Fac Ciencias Empresariales, Dept Business Adm, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain; [Reinares-Lara, Eva] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Dept Business Adm, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Olarte-Pascual, C (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Fac Ciencias Empresariales, Dept Business Adm, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain.",cristina.olarte@unirioja.es; jorge.pelegrin@unirioja.es; eva.reinares@urjc.es,"Olarte-Pascual, Cristina/L-5766-2014; Olarte-Pascual, Cristina/AAT-4680-2021; Borondo, Jorge Pelegrín/AAL-7111-2021; Reinares-Lara, Eva/H-3793-2013","Olarte-Pascual, Cristina/0000-0002-9853-0266; Olarte-Pascual, Cristina/0000-0002-9853-0266; Borondo, Jorge Pelegrín/0000-0003-2720-1788; Reinares-Lara, Eva/0000-0002-5320-9268",,,,,55,9,10,3,32,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We have built in STELLA-Modeling and Simulation Software a dynamic feedback model for the demand-supply equilibrium. The stock-flow dynamic model allows empirical analysis of the system's states offering insight on its endogenous characteristics and behavior over time. The model also permits sensitivity analysis to exogenous stimuli. The data used for initialing the state variables of the model and parameters were taken from the official stats of Romania between 2007 and 2011, just before the economic crisis and the years of economic recovery. The results of the model simulations on extreme conditions, such as in which the scales of production do not change significantly in relation to profitability, have revealed that the model outlines a predictive reaction of the system, entering in decline-the national output having a descending trend. The structure of the model and its simulations sustain the rationality and validity of the purpose and we can conclude that it may become a useful instrument in macroeconomic governance.","[Popescu, Bianca Ioana; Scarlat, Emil] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, BI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania.",bianca.popescu@gmail.com; emil_scarlat@csie.ase.ro,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,333.0,344,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_23,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800023,0

As a very important step in determining the content and method of teaching we consider an evaluation of the knowledge base of students who enter the first year at the Faculty of Economics Technical University of Kosice. In the first seminar in subject called Informatics I students fill in questionnaires which are focused on their general knowledge of informatics/computer science and basic terms of IS. In the paper we present evaluation of our questionnaire survey in the period 2003-2014. Conclusions formulated in the paper are directly relevant for teaching realized on the Faculty of Economics, Technical University Kosice. In the process of questionnaire creation we drew from generally valid documents for secondary schools in Slovakia. In the sample of respondents there were mostly graduates from Eastern Slovakia Region therefore this allows us to assume that knowledge base and ICT competences on the other faculties especially in our region with non informatics focus would copy the described trends. We also present our innovative manner of informatics education based on modeling, simulation and on a well known opinion that no kind of teaching can replace the personal experience. As a dominant form we use problem-oriented project teaching. Students find themselves in a position of a manager of a virtual company, at project of specifying users' requirements The paper deals with the experience in teaching, we present recommended structure of the user requirements project and we also discuss the body of knowledge and methods which have been implemented into the subject Informatics II. In the proposed innovative way of teaching we are trying to transform solving problem process into an active process of cognition.","[Reveszova, Libusa] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Business Informat, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Révészová, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Business Informat, Kosice, Slovakia.",libusa.reveszova@tuke.sk,"Reveszova, Libusa/AAA-4786-2020",,,,,,41,10,10,0,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.
