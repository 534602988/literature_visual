We rely on identifying heterogeneous effects of different types of violent events on state capacity, taking advantage of variability across municipalities in the prevalence of specific manifestations of conflict and their intensity. Our findings suggest that events making civilians feel targeted affect the state's capacity to collect taxes, while those reflecting a stronger military capacity of illegal armies, in particular their large-scale attacks, affect the state's capacity to provide public goods.","[Cardenas, Mauricio] Brookings Inst, Latin Amer Initiat, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Eslava, Marcela; Ramirez, Santiago] Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Cra 1 18A-70 Bloque W, Bogota, Colombia; [Cardenas, Mauricio] Minist Hacienda & Credito Publ, Bogota, Colombia; [Ramirez, Santiago] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",Brookings Institution; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Inter-American Development Bank,"Eslava, M (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Cra 1 18A-70 Bloque W, Bogota, Colombia.",meslava@uniandes.edu.co,,"Eslava, Marcela/0000-0002-6828-4076",,,,,11,8,12,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The former is the change in average efficiency as a result of the selection of industries that survive international competition. The latter is the rise in the weight of exporting industries in production, owing to the reallocation of workers from non-exporting industries. This decomposition, which is hard to calculate in the general case, simplifies dramatically with Frechet-distributed efficiencies, providing easy-to-quantify model-based measures of these two effects.

In this article, we investigate the future trajectory of AFOLU GHG emissions in Latin America, with and without efforts to mitigate, using a multi model comparison approach. We find significant uncertainty in future emissions with and without climate policy. This uncertainty is due to differences in a variety of assumptions including (1) the role of bioenergy, (2) where and how bioenergy is produced, (3) the availability of afforestation options in climate mitigation policy, and (4) N2O and CH4 emission intensity. With climate policy, these differences in assumptions can lead to significant variance in mitigation potential, with three models indicating reductions in AFOLU GHG emissions and one model indicating modest increases in AFOLU GHG emissions.

On the one hand, admissibility requires that a player consider every strategy of their opponents possible. On the other hand, reasoning that the opponents are rational requires ruling out certain strategies. Brandenburger, Friedenberg, Keisler's (BFK, Econometrica, 2008) foundations for iterated admissibility address this challenge with two ingredients: lexicographic beliefs and the concept of assumption. However, BFK restrict attention to lexicographic beliefs whose supports are essentially disjoint. This restriction does not have a compelling behavioral rationale, or a clear intuitive interpretation. At the same time, it plays a crucial role in BFK's foundations for iterated admissibility-specifically, in their analysis of assumption. We provide an alternate characterization of assumption, which applies to all lexicographic beliefs. We also characterize two variants of assumption, based on two extensions of 'weak dominance' to infinite state spaces. These notions of assumption coincide with BFK's notion when the state space is finite and lexicographic beliefs have disjoint support; but they are different in more general settings. Leveraging these characterization results, we show that disjoint supports do not play a role in the foundations for iterated admissibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J. Savage's framework of purely subjective uncertainty. Every Bayesian game is ordinally equivalent to a Savage game. However, Savage games are free of priors, probabilities, and payoffs. Players' information and subjective attitudes toward uncertainty are encoded in the state-dependent preferences over state contingent action profiles. In the class of games we consider, player preferences satisfy versions of Savage's sure-thing principle and small event continuity postulate. Savage games provide a tractable framework for studying attitudes toward uncertainty in a strategic setting. The work eschews any notion of objective randomization, convexity, monotonicity, or independence of beliefs. We provide a number of examples illustrating the usefulness of the framework, including novel results for a purely ordinal matching game that satisfies all of our assumptions and for games for which the preferences of the players admit representations from a wide class of decision-theoretic models.","[Grant, Simon; Meneghel, Idione; Tourky, Rabee] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Grant, Simon] Univ Queensland, Dept Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Australian National University; University of Queensland,"Grant, S; Meneghel, I; Tourky, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.;Grant, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Dept Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",simon.grant@anu.edu.au; idione.meneghel@anu.edu.au; rabee.tourky@anu.edu.au,,"Meneghel, Idione/0000-0003-3169-1468",,,,,63,11,11,1,7,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We employ two-stage least squares to account for reverse causality, that is, the possibility that a country which takes steps to protect the environment might also be more likely to constitutionalize environmental rights. Our first stage theory combines constitution norms, opposition costs, and generation effects. Our controls include country income, which means that our study is also related to the Environmental Kuznets Curve literature. We find that constitutions do indeed matter for positive environmental outcomes, which suggests that we should not only pay attention to the incentives confronting polluters and resource users, but also to the incentives and constraints confronting those policymakers who initiate, monitor, and enforce environmental policies.","[Jeffords, Chris] Indiana Univ Penn, 441 North Walk 213B McElhaney Hall, Indiana, PA USA; [Minkler, Lanse] Univ Connecticut, 328 Oak Hall, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Indiana University of Pennsylvania; University of Connecticut,"Jeffords, C (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Penn, 441 North Walk 213B McElhaney Hall, Indiana, PA USA.;Minkler, L (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, 328 Oak Hall, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jeffords@iup.edu; alanson.minkler@uconn.edu,,"Jeffords, Chris/0000-0003-1399-7666",,,,,42,32,32,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2016,69,2,,,,,294,335,,10.1111/kykl.12112,0.0,,,42,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK1VI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374702600005,0

As a consequence, they lack host-country specific labor market knowledge and other country-specific and not directly productive valuable assets affecting their relative bargaining position with employers. We introduce this simple observation into a search and matching model of the labor market and show that immigrants increase the employment prospects of competing natives. To test the predictions of our model, we exploit yearly variations between 1998 and 2004 in the share of immigrants within occupations in 13 European countries. We identify the impact of immigrants on natives' employment rate using an instrumental variable strategy based on historical settlement patterns across host countries and occupations by origin country. We find that natives' employment rate increases in occupations and sectors receiving more immigrants. Moreover, we show that this effect varies depending on immigrants' characteristics and on host country labor market institutions which affect relative reservation wages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aggregation weights which are used to produce the aggregates are often considered as combination weights. This paper investigates whether using different combination weights instead of the usual aggregation weights can help to provide more accurate forecasts. In this context, we examine the performance of equal weights, the least squares estimators of the weights, the combination method recently proposed by Hyndman et al. (Comput Stat Data Anal 55(9):2579-2589, 2011) and the weights suggested by shrinkage methods. We find that some variables like real GDP and the GDP deflator can be forecasted more precisely by using flexible combination weights. Furthermore, combining only forecasts of the three largest European countries helps to improve the forecasting performance. The persistence of the individual series seems to play an important role for the relative performance of the combination.","[Zeng, Jing] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 129, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Zeng, J (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 129, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",jing.zeng@uni-konstanz.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2941/1-2],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank the participants of the Doctoral Seminar on Econometrics at the University of Konstanz, the Konstanz-Lancaster Workshop on Finance and Econometrics, the Annual Meeting of the Austrian Economic Association 2015 and the Jahrestagung der Statistischen Woche 2015 for helpful comments and suggestions.

Unlike the existing empirical literature, its instrumental variables method allows for distinguishing a direct influence of past repayment problems on current spreads (a punishment effect in prices) from an indirect effect through higher expected future default probabilities (loss of reputation). Such a punishment provides positive surplus to lenders after a default and decreases the borrower's present discounted value of the net benefits of future borrowing, which create dynamic incentives. Using data on bank loans to developing countries for 1973-1981 and constructing continuous variables for credit history, we find evidence that most of the influence of past repayment problems is through the direct, punishment channel.","[Benczur, Peter] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Paris, France; [Benczur, Peter] Cent European Univ, Paris, France; [Ilut, Cosmin L.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Ilut, Cosmin L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Benczúr, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Paris, France.;Benczúr, P (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Paris, France.;Ilut, CL (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Ilut, CL (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",peter.benczur@jrc.ec.europa.eu; cosmin.ilut@duke.edu,,,,,,,52,5,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

However, previous literature does not identify a causal impact of incarceration on food insecurity. From a policy perspective, identification of a causal link may aid in understanding why some affected families experience food insecurity, while similarly situated families do not. In this article, we utilize microlevel data from the Fragile Families and Child Well Being Study to provide evidence of a causal impact of incarceration on food insecurity. This is an important dynamic to understand because the prevalence of incarceration in the United States is relatively high, especially among groups where food insecurity is more prevalent (e.g., Blacks), and the associated externalities can have substantial impacts on families that may reach well beyond traditional costs associated with incarceration. The complex relationship between food insecurity and incarceration is estimated within a causal inference approach. We find evidence that incarceration leads to roughly a 4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of food insecurity among households with children that have experienced a parental incarceration.","[Cox, Robynn] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wallace, Sally] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University of Southern California; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Cox, R (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",robynnco@usc.edu,"Cox, Robynn/AAD-2876-2019",,"University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research through U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service [AG-3198-B-10-0028]","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research through U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service","This project was supported with a grant from the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research through funding by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, contract number AG-3198-B-10-0028.

Since players' utilities are now a function of their network centralities, this permits endogenizing their locational incentives in a network. Second, we show that the mode of transmission of externalities can be crucial in dictating the topology of equilibrium networks. We consider two alternative modes for channeling externalities. Both have the same primary source (direct links) but a different secondary source (global effects vs. indirect links). We characterize equilibrium networks for different positive-negative combinations of primary-secondary externalities for both modes.

The ageing trend could cause a reduction in the GDP by 0.92% on average, but the damage could be compensated for through an additional increase in educational investments in the 20-29 age cohort by 4% for at least 10 consecutive years. However, the investment policy has a negative impact on the regional income distribution due to different elasticity values of education by age cohort with respect to human capital productivity.

In our model the bank's assets consist of illiquid loans and liquid reserves and are financed by a combination of repos, long-term debt, deposits and equity. Repos are a cheap source of funding, but they are subject to an exogenous rollover risk. We show that the use of repos inflicts two types of indirect (shadow) costs on the bank's shareholders: first, it induces the bank to maintain higher liquid reserves in order to alleviate the additional default risk; second, it adds to the cost of long-term debt financing. These shadow costs limit the bank's appetite for cheap but unstable repo funding. This effect is, however, weakened under poor returns on risky assets, access to deposit funding and the depositor preference rule. We also analyze the impact of a liquidity coverage ratio, payout restrictions and a leverage ratio on the bank's financing choices and show that all these tools are able to curb the bank's reliance on repos.

As the market for consumer information expands rapidly, businesses are armed with unprecedented means to target any group of consumers they desire. This has important and far-reaching impacts on consumer welfare. In this paper we analyze the welfare impacts of price discrimination facilitated by increasing qualities of consumer information. We employ a two-dimensional spatial differentiation model where consumer information is available on one dimension, and better information leads to more refined price discrimination. We find that as information quality improves, equilibrium prices and profits monotonically increase while consumer surplus and social surplus monotonically decrease. Price discrimination has a reduced demand elasticity effect which becomes stronger when consumer information becomes more precise. Our results suggest that regulators need to pay more attention to the potential damage to consumer welfare by the increasing collection and utilization of consumer information.

The method is best suited for a practical implementation with a time series and delivers a consistent date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations demonstrate that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. Overall, the results indicate that the speculative housing price bubbles in China are not bursting, and they indicate that the stationarity of the housing price level varies across the different city sizes. Between the cities, approximately one-fourth of the bubbles have burst up to December 2013, while the first-tier city bubble may not burst due to the urbanization process.","[Liu, Tie-Ying] Beijing Jiatong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Jiang, Xu-Zhao] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China,"Liu, TY (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiatong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Su, CW (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Chang, HL (通讯作者)，Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan.;Jiang, XZ (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",liutieying@bjtu.edu.cn; hsulingchang@yahoo.com.tw; cwsu7137@gmail.com; jiangxuzhao@ouc.edu.cn,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,Beijing Social Science Fund project [15JDJGC081]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University [2015RC062]; Beijing Joint Construction project,Beijing Social Science Fund project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University; Beijing Joint Construction project,This paper has been supported by the Beijing Social Science Fund project (15JDJGC081) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University (2015RC062).

On the other hand, importantly, when the model predicts a unique equilibrium in the same environment, I find that the announcement has no effect on behavior.

With its focus on China, this study contributes to the discussion by exploring the effects of development zones on the economic development of host regions, using both macro-level (all national-level development zones) and meso-level (county-and district-level development zones in Guangdong Province) analyses. Our data analyses of the macro-level reveal that development zones, even though positive in developed regions, do not contribute to economic growth in proportion to their share of land in host cities on the whole. The result is confirmed by the meso-level data analysis that indicates that county-and district-level development zones in Guangdong Province, a developed region in southern China, imposed positive effects on local economies. Therefore we suggest that the Chinese central government should not expand development zones without limits, but carefully consider their location and size in relation to the host regions before approving them.

The previous studies focus on the role of a country's regime in correcting its current account imbalances. However, assessing the overall impact of an exchange rate regime requires consideration of the effects of both the home country's regime and its trading partners' regimes. Thus, this paper estimates the effect of trading partners' regimes on the speed of the home country's current account adjustment, using a mean-reversion current account model and data of 80 countries from 1980 to 2010. The results show that when a country trades more with countries under non-free-floating regimes, its current account adjustment as a whole becomes slower than under free-floating. The adjustment speed, however, does not increase monotonically with the flexibility of the partners' regimes. There is also an asymmetry in the adjustment, that is, less flexible regimes decelerate the adjustment of a partner in deficit of the current account. These findings are robust even when using other exchange rate regime classifications or employing different samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In normal times, the limited amount of excess liquidity makes the dynamics of the money market insensitive to it. In contrast, the introduction of the fixed-rate full-allotment procedure as one prominent unconventional measure of the ECB has made the dynamics of the money market growingly dependent on the time-varying level of excess liquidity in the euro area.

We find that an increase in the bargaining power of a wage-oriented union leads to a decrease in employment in the domestic economy. This result has two important implications on innovation. First, it reduces the rates of innovation and economic growth. Second, it causes innovation to be directed to the foreign economy, which in turn causes a negative effect on domestic wages relative to foreign wages in the long run. We also derive welfare implications and calibrate our model to data in the US and the UK to quantify the effects of labor unions on social welfare and wage inequality across countries. Our calibrated model is able to explain about half of the decrease in relative wage between the US and the UK from 1980 to 2007. Furthermore, the decrease in unions' bargaining power leads to quantitatively significant welfare gains in the two countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach combines NEMS output with detailed household expenditure data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, improving on static methods that assess policy impacts by assuming household energy demand remains unchanged under emissions pricing scenarios. To illustrate our method, we evaluate a recent carbon fee-and-dividend proposal introduced in the U.S. Senate, the Climate Protection Act of 2013 (S. 332). Our analysis indicates this bill, if enacted, would have cut CO2 emissions from energy by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 at a gross cost of less than 0.5% of GDP, while offering rebates sufficient to offset increased direct energy expenditures for typical households making less than $120,000 per year and average households in all regions of the United States.

It is even enshrined in Article 22.4 of the WTO's dispute settlement process within multilateral trade integration. As such, it is a well-recognized means for promoting cooperation and for enforcing compliance with a common set of rules or institutions. However, there is equally widespread concern that a strategy of TFT degenerates into a prisoner's dilemma, in particular because of special interests ill-using it as a springboard for advancing protectionist measures and beggar-thy-neighbor policies. This paper provides a novel evolutionary perspective on TFT in trade policy regimes in that it tracks the role of special interests by parameterizing their leverage on strategies. Doing so, it provides new insights on the political economy of TFT in international institutions. Accordingly, the set of parameters for which a prisoner's dilemma emerges shrinks rather than widens, even with powerful domestic interest groups sharing a stake in protection.","[Dluhosch, Barbara] Univ Fed Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Dluhosch, B (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Armed Forces Hamburg, Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",dluhosch@hsu-hh.de,,"Dluhosch, Barbara/0000-0003-3419-0415",,,,,57,5,5,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The model encompasses a two-stage game. For given input prices, two downstream firms compete a la Bertrand in differentiated products. Each firm faces a firm-specific input supplier. The two input suppliers set publicly observable and linear input prices non-cooperatively in the first stage. All technologies have constant returns to scale. The effects of a one-sided increase in the non-controlling profit participation share of one firm in the other rival firm (i.e. cross-ownership) on social welfare are analysed. The main result is that under Bertrand, in contrast with the common wisdom (which, for instance, holds under Cournot), an increase in cross-ownership can increase total surplus. The reason is that despite the cross-ownership share makes the downstream quantity choice more collusive, hence more socially inefficient, it also reduces input prices, and when the competition is in strategic complements and products are not too differentiated the input price effect outweighs the collusive effect in determining the social welfare outcome. This result suggests that antitrust policy in a vertical industry should also consider the mode of competition in the final product market in the case in which more collusion is achieved in the downstream sector through an increase in the one-sided non-controlling profit participation share.

This study examines farmers' willingness to grow switchgrass under contract using a stated choice approach. Data were collected using an enumerated survey of Kansas farmers and analyzed using latent class logistic regression models. Farmers whose primary enterprise is livestock are less inclined to grow switchgrass. Shorter contracts, greater harvest flexibility, crop insurance, and cost-share assistance increase the likelihood that farmers will grow switchgrass for bioenergy production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The regulator is required to monitor the firm's costs and to reveal its information to a political principal (Congress). In this setting, we explore the scope for collusion between the regulator and the firm, which results in the manipulation of the regulator's report on the firm's costs to Congress. The firm's benefit of collusion arises from the higher price the efficient firm is allowed to charge when the regulator reports that it is inefficient. However, a higher price reduces the gains from trade the parties can share in the bargaining process. As a result of this trade-off, the efficient firm has a stake in collusion only if the regulator's bargaining power in the regulatory relationship is relatively high. Then, we derive the optimal institutional response to collusion and characterize the conditions under which allowing collusion is desirable.","[Fiocco, Raffaele] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Gilli, Mario] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Mannheim; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Fiocco, R (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",raffaele.fiocco@uni-mannheim.de; mario.gilli@unimib.it,"Fiocco, Raffaele/AAE-1027-2020","Fiocco, Raffaele/0000-0002-8078-3222",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 649],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are particularly grateful to two anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions.

The economic literature has focused on two definitions of net neutrality. The most basic definition of net neutrality is to prohibit payments from content providers to internet service providers; this situation we refer to as a one-sided pricing model, in contrast with a two-sided pricing model in which such payments are permitted. Net neutrality may also be defined as prohibiting prioritization of traffic, with or without compensation. The research program then is to explore how a net neutrality rule would alter the distribution of rents and the efficiency of outcomes. After describing the features of the modern internet and introducing the key players, (internet service providers, content providers, and customers), we summarize insights from some models of the treatment of internet traffic, framing issues in terms of the positive economic factors at work. Our survey provides little support for the bold and simplistic claims of the most vociferous supporters and detractors of net neutrality. The economic consequences of such policies depend crucially on the precise policy choice and how it is implemented. The consequences further depend on how long-run economic trade-offs play out; for some of them, there is relevant experience in other industries to draw upon, but for others there is no experience and no consensus forecast.","[Greenstein, Shane] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Peitz, Martin] Univ Mannheim, Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Peitz, Martin] Mannheim Ctr Competit & Innovat MaCCI, Mannheim, Germany; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, Econ, London, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Econ, Rome, Italy; [Valletti, Tommaso] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England",Harvard University; University of Mannheim; Imperial College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Greenstein, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sgreenstein@hbs.edu; martin.peitz@googlemail.com; t.valletti@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,69,76,0,17,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Capital goods are heterogeneous in their vintage and productivity, and due to capacity constraints, only productive capital goods are activated in the equilibrium. Through this selection, the distribution of capital goods determines industry-level productivity: industry-level productivity is higher in an industry with relatively larger variation in capital goods. Hence in a perfectly competitive two-country, two-good, two-factor equilibrium, the industry has Ricardian comparative advantage. An extension of the model, which includes fixed trade cost, describes a sorting situation in which the most productive production units (which are generally newer vintage) export, the moderately productive units serve the domestic market, and the least productive units (older) do not operate.

A transaction using cash incurs a buyer its carrying cost, while an electronic transaction incurs data-processing cost to the payment platform which then raises the resource cost from buyers or sellers using the electronic payment system. An equilibrium allocation of the resource cost implies the seller-take-all-burden scheme by which the payment platform can maximize the volume of electronic transactions by raising the resource cost only from sellers. However, the socially optimal allocation of the resource cost implies the buyer-take-all-burden scheme by which the resource cost should be raised only from buyers in order to maximize welfare.

A two-step fixed effects approach is contrasted to the random effects specification. The techniques are employed to analyse prices for over 260 Australian premium wine producers. The fixed effects specification is preferred given significant correlation between wine attributes and random producer effects. The estimation of fixed producer price effects identifies statistically significant price premiums and discounts, which average 15%. Fixed producer price effects are estimated to depend on the quality reputation of the producer, its level of experience, producer size and the use of multibrands by conglomerates. In part, results indicate that price discounts are associated with producers who have low-quality reputations, are small and recently established.","[Oczkowski, Edward] Charles Sturt Univ, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Oczkowski, E (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Natl Wine & Grape Ind Ctr, POB 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.;Oczkowski, E (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, POB 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.",eoczkowski@csu.edu.au,"Oczkowski, Eddie/AAY-3706-2020","Oczkowski, Eddie/0000-0003-2071-7116",,,,,66,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Despite a mostly positive attitude towards the expansion of wind power, local public concerns often stem from the belief that the proximity to large-scale wind farms may lead to a decrease in property prices. In particular, the change in landscape caused by the construction of a wind farm may have an adverse impact on the view from some properties, and thus may negatively affect their price. To investigate the potential devaluation of properties in Germany due to wind farms, we use a quasi-experimental technique and apply a spatial difference-in-differences approach to various wind farm sites in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. We adopt a quantitative visual impact assessment approach to account for the adverse environmental effects caused by the wind turbines. To properly account for spatial dependence and unobserved variables biases, we apply augmented spatial econometric models. The estimates indicate that the asking price for properties whose view was strongly affected by the construction of wind turbines decreased by about 9-14%. In contrast, properties with a minor or marginal view on the wind turbines experienced no devaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, I investigate whether overconfident or underconfident subjects are considered as more likeable, and who of the two is expected to win in a tournament, thereby controlling for performance. Underconfidence beats overconfidence in both respects. Underconfident subjects are rewarded significantly more often than overconfident subjects, and are significantly more often expected to win. Subjects being less convinced of their performance are taken as more congenial and are expected to be more ambitious to improve, whereas overconfident subjects are rather expected to rest on their high beliefs. While subjects do not anticipate the stronger performance signal of underconfidence, they anticipate its higher sympathy value. The comparison to a non-strategic setting shows that men strategically deflate their self-assessment to be rewarded by others. Women, in contrast, either do not deflate their self-assessment or do so even in non-strategic situations, a behavior that might be driven by non-monetary image concerns of women.","[Thoma, Carmen] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Thoma, C (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",carmen.thoma@gmail.com,,,[Sonderforschungsbereich (SFB)/Transregio (TR) 15],,"I would like to thank Martin Kocher, Sandra Ludwig, Ernesto Reuben, Klaus Schmidt, Marta Serra-Garcia, Sebastian Strasser, Ferdinand Vieider, participants of the MELESSA Brown Bag Seminar at the University of Munich for helpful comments and discussions.

J,"Wren-Lewis, S",,,,"Wren-Lewis, Simon",,,Unravelling the New Classical Counter Revolution,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,New Classical Counter Revolution; microfoundations,,"To understand the position of Keynes's The General Theory today, and why so many policy-makers felt they had to go back to it to understand the Great Recession, we need to understand the New Classical Counter Revolution (NCCR), and why it was so successful. This revolution can be seen as having two strands. The first, which attempted to replace Keynesian policy, failed. The second, which was to change the way academic macroeconomics was done, was successful. Before the NCCR, macroeconomics was an intensely empirical discipline: something made possible by the developments in statistics and econometrics inspired by The General Theory. After the NCCR and its emphasis on microfoundations, it became much more deductive. As a result, most academic macroeconomists today would see the foundation of their discipline as not coming from The General Theory, but as coming from basic microeconomic theory arguably the 'classical theory' that Keynes was so keen to cast aside. Students are also taught that pre-NCCR methods of analysing the economy are fatally flawed, and that simulating DSGE models is the only proper way of doing policy analysis. This is simply wrong. The problem with the NCCR was not the emergence of microfoundations modelling, which is a progressive research programme, but that it discouraged the methods of analysis that had flourished after The General Theory. I argue that, had there been more academic interest in these alternative forms of analysis, the discipline would have been better prepared ahead of the financial crisis.","[Wren-Lewis, Simon] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Wren-Lewis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,25,12,13,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In the early 1960s, Amartya Sen analysed the same issue in a simple, one-sector macroeconomic model of a closed economy. He showed that fixing investment in the model, built strictly on neo-classical assumptions, would make the system overdetermined, and thus one should loosen some neo-classical conditions of competitive equilibrium. He analysed three not neo-classical closure options, which could make the model well-determined in the case of fixed investment. His list was later extended by others and it was shown that the closure dilemma arises in the more complex computable general equilibrium (CGE) models as well, as does the choice of adjustment mechanism assumed to bring about equilibrium at the macro level. It was also illustrated through several numerical models that the adopted closure rule can significantly affect the results of policy simulations based on a CGE model. Despite these warnings, the issue of macro closure is often neglected in policy simulations. It is, therefore, worth revisiting the issue and demonstrating by further examples its importance, as well as pointing out that the closure problem in the CGE models extends well beyond the problem of how to incorporate autonomous investments into a CGE model. Several closure rules are discussed in this paper and their diverse outcomes are illustrated by numerical models calibrated on statistical data. First, the analyses are done in a one-sector model, similar to Sen's, but extended into a model of an open economy. Next, the same analyses are repeated using a fully-fledged multi-sectoral CGE model, calibrated on the same statistical data. Comparing the results obtained by the two models it is shown that although they generate quite similar results in terms of the direction and - to a some-what lesser extent - of the magnitude of change in the main macro variables using the same closure option, the predictions of the multi-sectoral CGE model are clearly more realistic and balanced.","[Zalai, Erno; Revesz, Tamas] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Econ, Dept Math Econ & Econ Anal, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Zalai, E (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Econ, Dept Math Econ & Econ Anal, Budapest, Hungary.",erno.zalai@uni-corvinus.hu; tamas.revesz@uni-corvinus.hu,"Revesz, Tamas/AAA-2820-2020",,European Commission (AROP projects); Centre for Public Affairs Studies at Corvinus University of Budapest,European Commission (AROP projects); Centre for Public Affairs Studies at Corvinus University of Budapest,"The research underlying this paper was made possible by the support of the European Commission (AROP projects), personally of Juan Carlos Ciscar (EC's JRC-IPTS) and of the Centre for Public Affairs Studies at Corvinus University of Budapest, for which we express our gratitude.",,25,2,2,0,10,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

To escape from an energy inefficient state a broad policy overhaul is needed. Trade liberalization and related growth policies together with the removal of fuel subsidies are useful, but insufficient policy measures; the results suggest that they should be combined with structural policies, aiming at institutional structure and investment in infrastructure.

Then using a linear regression model, we find that population increases positively affects the efficient scores (via scale economies).

The model is calibrated to mimic the US economy's behaviour in the long-run. We find that a 50% increase in the gender wage gap leads to a 35% decrease in income per capita in the steady state. Using independent estimates of the female to male earnings ratio for a wide cross-section of countries, we construct an economy with parameters similar to those calibrated for the US economy, except for the degree of gender barriers. For several countries, a large fraction of the difference between the country's output and the US output can be ascribed to differences in gender discrimination.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; FGV, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Univ Nova Lisboa, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; CEPR, London, England",University of Cambridge; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Cavalcanti, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",tvdvc2@cam.ac.uk,,"Tavares, Jose/0000-0002-8159-9646",Egide; Nova Forum at Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT); POCTI through FEDER; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil); ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Egide; Nova Forum at Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); POCTI through FEDER; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper has benefited from the financial support from Egide and Nova Forum at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, from the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) and POCTI through FEDER, and from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil).

Test results provide evidence for regime shifts and lend support to the use of short-term interest rate as the main policy instrument.

With the added assumption that the distribution of firms' productivity is Pareto, and with a support that is unbounded above, we argue that only the third source of gains from trade, due to the self-selection of firms, operates. This result helps to explain the simple formula for the gains from trade found by Arkolakis etal. (2012). If the Pareto distribution is bounded above, however, then all three sources of gains from trade operate once again.","[Feenstra, Robert C.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA; [Feenstra, Robert C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Feenstra, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA.;Feenstra, RC (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rcfeenstra@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,14,6,9,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

We also demonstrate that the same problem occurs for moment conditions proposed by Hayakawa (2012) and Robertson and Sarafidis (2015), since their moment conditions become identical to those of Ahn et al.

Both aspects seem important due to an increasing number of bilateral FTAs which drive up tariff divergence across countries and tend to apply TRQs, at least temporarily. We demonstrate that the proposed aggregation technique can handle both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by combining a number of tariff indexes in a modified trade balance condition in a welfare-consistent manner. Additionally, different rent-allocation shares for TRQs can be easily introduced in our methodological extension. We also address the implications of some rather strict behavioral assumptions with regard to demand that welfare consistent aggregation requires. An empirical analysis of the Korean dairy market in the EU-South Korea FTA using the proposed method shows that simulated welfare gains are largely affected by the tariff aggregation technique over regions and trade policy instruments. Based on this finding we recommend the more widespread application of welfare consistent tariff aggregation in applied modeling and further research on that topic. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The market basket represents the spending patterns of average household. However, households differ in their spending patterns and there are differences in the price changes of various goods and services. Therefore, different households experience different inflation rates. This paper finds that these differences have been significant in the Czech Republic during the period 1995-2010. Only around 60% of households actually experienced an inflation rate that was similar to the. national average. Furthermore, the higher the average inflation rate over time, the lower the percentage of households whose inflation rate was similar to that average.The main determiners of inflation were expenditures for housing and energy, food and non-alcoholic drinks. In most years, pensioners and low-income households faced significantly higher inflation rates than the average rate for the whole population.","[Jansky, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Jansky, Petr; Hait, Pavel] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hait, Pavel] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Zlin, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Jansky, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.;Jansky, P; Hait, P (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.;Hait, P (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Zlin, Czech Republic.",jansky.peta@gmail.com; pavelhait@gmail.com,"Hait, Pavel/J-1736-2014; Jansky, Petr/H-4782-2014","Jansky, Petr/0000-0001-6499-9923",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TACR) [TD020188],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TACR),"We would like to thank Michal Bauer, Richard Blundell, Alec Chrystal, Libor Dugek, Kamil GaluMak, Petr Mazouch, Daniel Munich, Filip Pertold, Ondrej Schneider and participants at a Charles University seminar for valuable comments.

This paper studies a key feature of data aggregation by deriving the representation of the discrete Fourier transform (dft) of the aggregated series considering the aliasing effect. Analyses are not limited to the spectrum of the stationary series under aggregation, but extended to the periodogram of the non-stationary series. We further apply our results of the dft to a particular example of fractional processes under aggregation. We show that the estimates of the long-memory parameter are the same for the temporally aggregated series and the original one if the same bandwidths are used, regardless of the stationarity of the series. The theoretical findings are empirically verified by the analysis of S&P 500 volatility from 1928 to 2011. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a newly constructed database on macroprudential instruments and capital flow measures in 13 Asian economies and 33 economies in other regions for the period 2000-2013, the paper formulates various macroprudential policy indices, aggregating sub-indices on key instruments. Asian economies appear to have made greater use of macroprudential tools, especially housing-related measures, than their counterparts in other regions. The effects of macroprudential policy are assessed through an event study, cross-country macro panel regressions, and bank-level micro panel regressions. The analysis suggests that housing-related macroprudential instruments-particularly loan-to-value ratio caps and housing tax measures-have helped curb housing price growth, credit growth, and bank leverage in Asia.

The logic for doing so is in principle compelling: rule-based fiscal policies allow automatic stabilizers to work freely during the cycle and help accumulate fiscal surpluses in good times. However, the estimation of structural balances is subject to a number of methodological challenges, including the degree of estimation uncertainty. This paper presents a range of estimates of the structural budget balance and uses them to analyze the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Based on an original dataset comprising detailed fiscal information from 20 countries across the region between 1990 and 2014, the paper finds that the range of estimates can be large for some countries, especially those that derive substantial fiscal revenue from commodity-related activities. In addition, the evidence shows that on average, the region has followed a procyclical policy pattern: a 1 percent increase in the output gap is associated with up to a 0.55 percentage point deterioration in the structural primary balance. This pattern hides substantial regional heterogeneity: procyclicality is more marked in countries that face large terms of trade shocks, but it can be counteracted by higher institutional quality.","[Corbacho, Ana] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Inst Dev Dept, Washington, DC USA",Inter-American Development Bank,,,,,Public Capacity Building Korea Fund for Economic Development (KPC),Public Capacity Building Korea Fund for Economic Development (KPC),"This paper was prepared when Ana Corbacho was Sector Economic Advisor in the Institutions for Development Department at the Inter-American Development Bank.

Based on a unique dataset that includes detailed information for both a firm's innovation activities and a broad set of HRM practices, we find that primarily new workplace organization practices seem to enhance a firm's innovation activities. Flexible practices of working time management and incentive payment schemes show only small effects on both innovation propensity and innovation success. Further training does only affect innovation success, but not innovation propensity. Overall, we find a stronger linkage between HRM practices and innovation propensity than with innovation success.

They are aimed at increasing access to lending, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, because the absence of adequate collateral is often high barrier for viable project to get funded. However, little has been known about the effectiveness of these schemes. Hence, the question whether public guarantees are justified for the purpose of SME's facilitated access to finance is the topic of many economic discussions. A challenging task for many companies is exactly the access to finance. However, these financing constraints tend to be more difficult for SMEs to overcome than for larger firms (OECD, 2012). SMEs face less access to debt capital they need, especially in the start-up phase, to further operation and growth (Riding and Haines, 2001). Credit guarantee schemes can be seen as filling this gap, since they are aimed at the SME sector, by simultaneously cushioning their risks and enhancing the credit approval from business banks (Levitsky, 1997). In fact, the restrictions posed by business banks in evaluation of SMEs are primarily a high risk exposure, insufficient entrepreneurial capitalization and inadequate collaterals, which all represent a weight in the SMEs' start-up and growth phase. The main purpose of this article is to investigate whether state-funded guarantee schemes impact the firm performance in terms of job creation and sales by facilitating the access to finance. The analysis has a regional approach, focusing on developments in eastern Croatia. Results show that companies that received guarantees perform better than the Croatian average in terms of employment and sales growth. However, more analysis is needed, especially analysis focused on the activated guarantees. Data on activation could change our results significantly.","[Becker, Goran] Croatian Agcy SMEs Innovat & Investments, Zagreb, Croatia; [Broz, Tanja] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Ridzak, Tomislav] Croatian Natl Bank, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Becker, G (通讯作者)，Croatian Agcy SMEs Innovat & Investments, Zagreb, Croatia.",Goran.Becker@hamagbicro.hr; tbroz@eizg.hr; Tomislav.Ridzak@hnb.hr,"Broz, Tanja/R-6554-2019",,,,,,31,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,101,112,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600009,0

Consequently, schools' disciplinary decisions can significantly limit students' access to education by removing students from familiar learning environments. We investigate schools' disciplinary decisions for serious misconducts and show that punishments are more severe in schools that do not report misconducts to local law enforcement agencies. Moreover, we show that schools that report fewer misconducts to law enforcement impose more severe punishments when the student body is characterized as having a higher proportion of minority students, lower socioeconomic status students and a higher proportion of students who are below the 15th percentile of standardized test scores. These results suggest that between-school punishment differentials are associated with student body traits.","[Bekkerman, Anton; Gilpin, Gregory] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Gilpin, G (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",gregory.gilpin@montana.edu,,,,,,,32,2,11,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we provide such evidence by exploiting the quasi-random assignment of linguistically similar areas to different South Indian states that subsequently varied in tenancy regulation policies. Given imperfect credit markets, the impact of tenancy reform should vary by household wealth status, allowing us to exploit historic caste-based variation in landownership. Thirty years after the reforms, land inequality is lower in areas that saw greater intensity of tenancy reform, but the impact differs across caste groups. Tenancy reforms increase own cultivation among middle-caste households, but render low-caste households more likely to work as daily agricultural laborers. At the same time, agricultural wages increase. These results are consistent with tenancy regulations increasing land sales to relatively richer and more productive middle-caste tenants, but reducing land access for poorer low-caste tenants.

We find positive growth effects for credit flows to nonfinancial business but not for mortgage and other asset market credit flows. By accounting for the composition of credit stocks and for the effect of credit flows, we explain the insignificant or negative growth effects of financial development in recent times. What was true in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s when the field of empirical credit-growth studies blossomed, is no longer true in the 1990s and 2000s.

Its financing is one of the main factors that determines the standard of living for every pensioner and their financial and social security. Therefore, the level of rights that can be achieved in the pension insurance system directly depends on the capabilities of its funding. Maintaining the stability of the pension system is one of the fundamental problems, both for Croatia and for other EU member states. In the world, the pension systems consist of several subsystems defined with respect to the categories of beneficiaries, method of financing, distribution of pensions etc. Therefore, pension systems can be public or private and mandatory or voluntary. The fundamental division of pension systems is on the public pension system of intergenerational solidarity, which are funded by contributions paid employees and capitalized pension systems that are funded by contributions to the capitalized pension funds. Because each of the models of financing pension insurance has its advantages and disadvantages, today the most used mixed funding models in which instead of one there is a system with multiple pension pillars. Mixed system of financing pensions on the three pillars of insurance was established in Croatia after the pension reform of 2002. But despite the reforms, today's pension insurance system in Croatia has significant problems that complicate the effective functioning. The aim of this paper is to analyse the efficiency and sustainability of the existing pension system in Croatia and the identification of key parameters which determine its further development. The authors with comparative analysis of the pension system in Croatia with the pension system in Slovenia and Switzerland are investigating certain variables important for the sustainability of this insurance in Croatia, and proposals for the upgrade of the existing system and the development of a new financing model to current and future pensioners have better financial and social security. They use a series of scientific research methods (methods of analysis, comparison, induction, deduction, description, classification etc.) as well as certain statistical and mathematical methods used for the analysis and ranking of certain parameters.","[Cobovic, Maja Vretenar; Cobovic, Mirko] Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Cobovic, MV (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",Maja.VretenarCobovic@vusb.hr; Mirko.Cobovic@vusb.hr,"Cobović, Maja Vretenar/AAB-6210-2020","Cobović, Maja Vretenar/0000-0002-7225-147X",,,,,3,5,5,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,840,848,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600084,0

The chapter is in the context of experimental economy. The research project was conducted by natural experiment through Allegro.pl, the leading online auctions platform in Poland. The online transactions were conducted in compliance with all statutory requirements of Allegro by a professional company focused on online business. The basic transaction was the sale of mobile phone pouch during buy-it-now online auction. Observations were carried out for 30 days. The whole project covers 370 transactions in total. There are two main groups of recommendations from the project. The first relates to the impact of online auction design parameters on the number of entries/hits per page and the sales volume of the product. The other group of recommendations allows forecasting the future of online auction market in Poland as more and more online auction buyers gain experience and passes from inexperienced to experienced group.","[Cypryjanski, Jacek] Univ Szczecin, Inst IT Management, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Computat Methods Expt Econ, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Grzesiuk, Aleksandra] West Pomeranian Business Sch, Ul Zolnierska 53, PL-71210 Szczecin, Poland; [Rudawska, Edyta] Univ Szczecin, Inst Management & Mkt, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin; University of Szczecin,"Cypryjanski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Inst IT Management, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Computat Methods Expt Econ, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",cypra@wneiz.pl; agrzesiuk@zpsb.pl; edyta@rudawska.pl,"Grzesiuk, Aleksandra/AAG-7401-2021","Grzesiuk, Aleksandra/0000-0003-2519-6516",,,,,19,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-28419-4; 978-3-319-28417-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,299,309,,10.1007/978-3-319-28419-4_19,0.0,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF9OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385789700019,0

The aim of paper is to analyse and evaluate the differences in the preferences of location factors within the process of the collocation of the headquarters and branch offices. The data used in this paper were obtained in the questionnaire survey and are mainly of qualitative character. It is apparent, that head offices of enterprises with foreign owners more intensively perceive soft location factors. On the contrary, purely domestic firms consider mainly classical factors of economic nature. When dealing with decision-making on the location of enterprises branches, these differences disappear.

SMEs are reporting increasing interest in business advice, but they are not using all the services available on the market. This article analyses the supply and demand of the business advice sector and the nature of the available wide range of business advice. For the purpose of the analysis we have used secondary data - results of a study conducted on 303 SMEs and 60 companies registered for consultancy services. Our findings show that owners/managers of SMEs are familiar with the supply of business advice services, but are trying to solve problems by themselves rather than use services of business advisers. Those who have used services of business advisers are satisfied with their advice and knowledge, but only half of them will use their services again. These findings suggest that owners/managers in this relationship are seeking a different approach. Business support organizations, funded by the state, are not seen as providers of valuable business advice for SMEs. The goal of this research is to identify the reasons for not using business advice despite the fact that it can help company to survive or to become more competitive on the market. Results of this article can be important for accountants, entrepreneurs, but also academics interested in providing advice for to SMEs. Further research is needed in order to understand if and how advice was implemented. Implementation is necessary for the creation of the relationship between consultants and entrepreneurs and can minimize agency problems.","[Delic, Anamarija; Filakov, Lidija] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Delic, A (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",adelic@efos.hr,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,891,900,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600089,0

The neo-Schumpeterians agree with Schumpeter that innovation is stimulated by positive driving forces and associated with industrial renewal through creative destruction. Also Darwinian economists shed light on opportunity factors (variation) and selection. On the other hand, in neoclassical Schumpeterian models, fierce competition and low product demand may enforce innovation and productivity increases in established firms. An orthodox Schumpeterian tradition even maintains that innovation in depression is the cause of the following recovery. But the orthodox Schumpeterians are as reluctant as the neoclassical Schumpeterians to elaborate the underlying psychological mechanism. In the theory of transformation pressure, firms facing an actual decline in profit are supposed to be more creative and rational, or at least more anxious to follow near-rational heuristic rules, having a positive effect as a possible over-reaction on innovation and productivity growth.","[Erixon, Lennart] Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Erixon, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",lex@ne.su.se,,,,,,,118,8,8,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The spatial production function gives rise to direct, indirect, and total productions functions so we set out empirical checks to establish if these functions are concave. The ideas of spatial returns to scale and spatial concavity/convexity can easily be applied to other technologies (e. g., cost and distance functions) and other functional forms (e. g., Cobb-Douglas).

Accordingly, there are attempts to find different modalities for increasing the quality of the tourism product and increasing the competitiveness and realization of more substantial share of tourism in Croatian gross domestic product. Therefore, Kvarner represents receptive market, within which agricultural, but also all other products and services from the wider area of Croatia, are available to the tourist demand, as well as the very Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, by which also in the practical sense universality and the single economic objective about economic integration of the sea (blue) and the continental (green) line of Croatian and the County is realized. Approaches in modelling of competing diversification models are different within each Croatian tourist destination. Kvarner is basing its competitiveness, among others, also on the overall market offer of the quality and diversified Croatian products, using at the same time brand of bathing beaches as sales media. The intention is that Kvarner through systematic process becomes a bathing destination, since a significant portion of emitive tourist market perceives Kvarner with identification light motive of sea and sea-based products as the basic motive of tourist arrivals. Previous uneven and selective approach in the management of beaches, that is multiple diversification in determining the priorities of tourism development, as well as certain lack of systematicness in the repositioning of Kvarner as a destination of bathing tourism, represents certain limitations, but also unexploited possibilities for tourism development of Kvarner. Concretely, that was confirmed by the research results of the authors of this paper, regarding bathing beaches of Kvarner. In this paper, the authors have defined the importance of bathing tourism in Kvarner as a market, selling media for economic connecting of sea and continental Croatia, its historical dimension, as well as the necessity of repositioning the Kvarner as a destination of bathing tourism, and pointed to the importance of managing the Kvarner beaches by establishing a balance between preserving the natural values of beaches and ensuring the sustainable use of their development potential through branding.","[Gorse, Mateja] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija, Croatia; [Kutnjak, Goran; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic] Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Gorse, M (通讯作者)，Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija, Croatia.",mateja3007@gmail.com; goran.kutnjak@efri.hr; mirjana.grcic.fabic@efri.hr,"Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/GNP-4472-2022; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic/ABC-6230-2020; Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/R-3492-2018","Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/0000-0002-8995-7452; Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/0000-0002-8995-7452",,,,,12,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,179,189,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600017,0

This situation overcomes distances and borders among countries, regions and continents and it represents the basic prerequisite of global communication. Information, knowledge and skills became the source of the economic growth and information is accessible in the postmodern society nearly to all people. The development of new interactive media caused the situation in which not only the receipt of information from unlimited number of participants but simultaneously sending them to this number of people are enabled. We are witnesses predominantly of a rapid internet development and its different interactions which are implemented on the ever growing higher technological and cybernetic level and quality. E.g., corporate companies are able to utilize opportunities with the assistance of global communication and through regional world markets with the lightning speed reaction of business partners from different cultures. Globalization trends brought not only a series of negative phenomena (e.g. environmental threats, the increase of migration) but they have also positive contributions (e.g. technological development, innovation). All these processes are connected with the growing media influence, especially those that are at the latest time acting in the internet digital environment. All mentioned facts form the inhabitants needs and values from the economic point of view that are moving in the environment of super production (more products are made than there is the social consumption and it represents higher profits from enterprises) and super consumption (more products are consumed that is the total social and individual consumption what represents the higher utilization of non-renewable sources and wastes).

A rise in the short rate tends to flatten the yield curve as well as to slow down real growth the near term. The relationship between the spread and future GDP activity was proved already before. One question remains which spread is the best for the future prediction? Is it the spread between sovereign 10-year bonds and 3-month bonds or 30-year and 1-year or 10-year and 1-year sovereign bonds? This paper aims to analyse which spread is the most suitable for predicting of future economic growth in Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) between the years 2000 and 2016. The natural and probably the most popular measure of economic growth is GDP growth, taken quarterly. We have found out that the best predictive spreads in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are the spreads of 5-year and 3-month, 15-year and 1-year and 30-year and 3-month government bond yields which is in contradiction with the theory. These findings might be beneficial for investors and provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of the yield curve spreads as indicators of the future economic activity.","[Hvozdenska, Jana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Business & Adm, Lipova 471a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hvozdenska, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Business & Adm, Lipova 471a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",174974@mail.muni.cz,"Hvozdenska, Jana/AAA-8859-2021","Hvozdenska, Jana/0000-0003-4379-7120",Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1025/2015],Masaryk University,The support of the Masaryk University internal grant MUNI/A/1025/2015 Risks and Challenges of the Low Interest Rates Environment to Financial Stability and Development is gratefully acknowledged.,,12,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,250,257,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200026,0

Irrespective of the scope and field of their operations, SMEs are affected by EU legislation in various areas, such as taxation, competition and commercial law. Small and medium-sized enterprises are an integral part of the business environment in all countries. SMEs represent a majority share of the overall structure of business entities. SMEs in Europe have an important contribution to the market shaping, GDP creation, employment and they increase the competitiveness of the country. SMEs have more difficult access to foreign financial resources needed for their development and increase of their competitiveness. Financial groups often fail to provide funding, loans, guarantees and venture capital in the extent which is required by SMEs. One of the key factors of further dynamic development of SMEs are innovations, implementation of innovative processes and creation of better and more comprehensive supportive environment for research and innovation activities of SMEs.

Three generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models were applied: GARCH (1,1) for various volatility dynamics; EGARCH for asymmetric and leverage effect and GARCH-M for pricing of risk. The outcomes of the study are as follows: first, the volatility shocks are quite persistent but with varying degrees across the sectors. Both the ARCH effect (short-term effect) and GARCH effect (long-term effect) play their role in generating conditional future stock returns volatility. Further, overall the volatility process is mean reverting; however, the speed of mean reversion varies across the sectors. Secondly, the current study finds little evidence of asymmetry and leverage effect at both aggregate and disaggregates data. Thirdly, the pricing of risk (positive risk premium) is also evident, particularly at the disaggregate data in the Pakistani stock market.

The equilibrium method is effective in generating sharp predictions, but it sidesteps important questions about how equilibrium can be attained, optimality assessed, and available alternatives enumerated. This chapter describes an alternative approach in which the process of adjustment is a central theme. Individuals adapt to changes in their environment by making incremental changes in their behavior. These changes alter the environment faced by others, which leads to further dynamic adjustments. Trajectories may eventually converge to an equilibrium, but this is not inevitable.

On the contrary, others favour a higher corporate tax rates to make important source of tax revenues, which can subsidize government spending and programs for the nation's citizens. Corporate taxes are taxes against profits earned by businesses during a given taxable period, but corporate income tax rate is not objective way of comparison of tax burden on the grounds of different rules for setting corporate tax base and its amount, which are caused by individual tax legislations in the particular countries. For more accurate representation of a taxpayer's tax liability is used effective corporate tax rate, which include not only the statutory tax rate on corporate income but also other aspects of tax systems determining the total amount of effectively paid taxes. The aim of this article is to examine the dependence of the effective taxation on the corporate income tax rate on using regression analysis and to evaluate the effective corporate taxation using effective average tax rate. Most of changes in the effective corporate taxation is caused by a change in the statutory tax rate (more than 98 %).

Corruption implicates reduction of economic efficiency, increasing lack of competitiveness, bringing lower investment opportunities and slower economic growth. This phenomenon is a great obstacle to public service efficiency and employment growth because it is leading to higher poverty and above all instability, dissatisfaction and inequality among citizens. Presence of corruption has become the. conduct. of living and behaving in certain countries, while in others such activities occur in a much lesser extent. Generally, frequency of corruptive activities in society is on a relatively high level with a presence in all segments of social structures. Unfortunately, corruptive determination has become a reality of overall Croatian society including its entrepreneurial environment. Significant part of Croatian society and entrepreneurship is freely accepting corruption as a concept. modus operandi. because this predominates their future existence. Corruption is a negative theorem of Croatian national being which destabilizes national economic and social integrity which is already fragile due to a fact that corruption is an obstacle to operations of business subjects and entrepreneurship development. Corruption is a challenge for everyone -there is no country whit its absence, however each country has to oppose it aggressively and fight it with all available measures. In this paper the authors diversify kinds and forms of corruption actions, indicate corruption measurability in global and regional scales and its consequences in the terms of weak Croatian competitiveness. In the same time within this paper authors define segmentation and frequency of corruption in Republic of Croatia and also trying to implicate the importance of anticorruption measures with a goal of neutralizing this relevant social problem.","[Kutnjak, Goran; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic; Miljenovic, Dejan] Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Kutnjak, G (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",goran.kutnjak@efri.hr; mirjana.grcic.fabic@efri.hr; dmiljeno@efri.hr,"Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/R-3492-2018; Miljenović, Dejan/R-8088-2018; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic/ABC-6230-2020; Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/GNP-4472-2022","Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/0000-0002-8995-7452; Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/0000-0002-8995-7452",,,,,14,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,768,777,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600077,0

After that, they evaluated by Metfessel allocation method five groups of the strategic measures from a city development plan on the basis of their contribution to previously mentioned benefits. Based on this information the researchers were able to sort the measures with respect to stakeholders' preferences. In such a way they offered a recipe for local destination management organization for realization of such tourism policy which will be consistent with stakeholders' point of view, and simultaneously which will have significant positive impact on their activities and tourism development in the destination.","[Lusticky, Martin; Gunina, Daria] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Management, Dept Management, Jarosovska 1117, Jindrichuv Hrade 37701, Czech Republic; [Oberhel, Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Management, Dept Exact Methods, Jarosovska 1117, Jindrichuv Hrade 37701, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lusticky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Management, Dept Management, Jarosovska 1117, Jindrichuv Hrade 37701, Czech Republic.",martin.lusticky@vse.cz; xobem00@vse.cz; xgund00@vse.cz,"Gunina, Daria/O-1727-2018","Gunina, Daria/0000-0002-4149-4962",,,,,17,1,1,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,938,945,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-121,0.0,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500122,0

To compare dynamic properties of the models, we analyse propagation of the interest rate impulse, exchange rate impulse and a permanent change of inflation target. Differences in impulse responses pose the question which model should be treated as the most adequate. Analysis of in-sample inflation forecasting errors suggests that the model with rational expectations displays the lowest forecasting accuracy, while the model using expectations of enterprises is the best-performing model. In more general terms, our analysis suggests the best way of exploiting survey data on inflation expectations is not by using them as separate forward-looking information, alternative to macroeconomic models, but by combining both types of information.","[Lyziak, Tomasz] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski,"Lyziak, T (通讯作者)，Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland.",Tomasz.Lyziak@nbp.pl,,"Lyziak, Tomasz/0000-0002-0488-4259",,,,,48,6,6,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

This will provide us with an innovative measure of non-cognitive performance based on particular personal traits, such as responsibility, effort, motivation and critical capacity, as well as a common measure of cognitive proficiency. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the potential influence of multiple individual and family variables on both dimensions of educational output. From our results, we find that, despite some similarities, there are several important divergences with regard to some socio-economic variables that have been traditionally considered to be the most influential determinants of academic achievement which do not appear to have a significant impact on non-cognitive outcomes.","[Manuel Cordero, Jose; Polo, Cristina] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain; [Muniz, Manuel] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; University of Oviedo,"Cordero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain.",jmcordero@unex.es,"FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/S-5567-2018; POLO, CRISTINA/GVS-7343-2022","FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/0000-0001-8783-6748; POLO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-5164-164X","Spanish Government, Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-53702-P]","Spanish Government, Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","Research support from the Spanish Government, Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Project ECO2014-53702-P is also acknowledged.",,70,8,8,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In order to create appropriate measures for its reduction, it is necessary to know the exact relationship between the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) and the actual unemployment rate. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of various factors on change in the NAIRU rate using the example of selected OECD countries. The impact of the actual unemployment rate on the NAIRU is analyzed by examining the presence of hysteresis in unemployment rates, while the second part of the analysis examines the impact of the long-term unemployment rate and trade union density on the NAIRU. The results show that the hysteresis hypothesis is confirmed in almost all the countries when the analysis is applied to the individual, but not to the panel data. On the other hand, changes in the rate of the long term unemployed explain a high percentage of change in the NAIRU, while the impact of the trade union density varies considerably from country to country.

Knowledge management can be described as a set of practices that help to improve the use and sharing of data and information in decision-making. This paradigm shift, at a national scale, was driven by the Bologna Declaration by assuming that students play an active and central role in their training. Projects like Tuning Educational Structures in Europe and Definition and Selection of Competencies mentions information literacy skills (ILS) as a strategy for the individual to thrive in the 21st century. This requires a critical analysis on the nature of the information itself and of the informational skills that are needed as a basis for decision-making, issuing opinions and execution of duly informed and reasoned actions. This short-paper shows the relationship between the full time faculty of the School of Management and Industrial Studies (ESEIG) of Polytechnic Institute of Porto (IPP) and ESEIG's librarian. We assess, by a questionnaire applied to both faculty and ESEIGs' librarian, how they face collaboration among them in order to achieve a good performance in terms of information literacy of that student community. This study shows how these actors perceive their roles within the information literacy education in this context. We conclude that there is growing concern on the part of faculty to promote students acquisition of information literacy skills, but that collaboration with the librarian did not reach the parameters considered yet satisfactory by the information literacy movement. Finally, action proposals are presented to that community in order to facilitate dialogue and collaboration between those actors, in order to promote the acquisition of ILS by the students. Some proposals are presented in order to enhance and improve the relationship between them, and thus improve ILS that students acquire.","[Martins, Susana; Carvalho, Milena] Inst Politecn Porto, Escola Super Estudos Ind & Gestao, Oporto, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Martins, S (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Porto, Escola Super Estudos Ind & Gestao, Oporto, Portugal.",susanamartins@eseig.ipp.pt; milenacarvalho@eseig.ipp.pt,"Carvalho, Milena/Y-6973-2019","Carvalho, Milena/0000-0003-1897-9686; Martins, Susana/0000-0002-5282-1017",,,,,26,0,0,2,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,131,141,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100015,0

We find that the impact differs depending on whether the low fertility arises from a decrease in the fertility of mothers (the intensive margin of fertility) or the motherhood rate (the extensive margin of fertility). We show that an increase in the fertility of mothers decreases the capital stock and economic welfare. Conversely, we identify a U-shaped relationship between the extensive margin of fertility and the capital stock because of the existence of two opposing effects, such that the decline in fertility may reduce economic welfare. Furthermore, we show that an intragenerational income redistribution policy can eliminate the welfare loss resulting from the incomplete market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The notion of reserve adequacy, however, is not static and is intimately associated with the occurrence of financial crises as well as exogenous shocks, with many observers using the reduction in reserves below this benchmark as a sign of fragility. This article provides a benefit-cost type approach to evaluating reserve adequacy. The benefits of holding reserves are evaluated using a dynamic random effects probit model of financial crises while the cost of reserve holdings (output loss due to an over-investment in reserves) is obtained from a panel growth equation. Using the methodology outlined above, the study finds that in small states, the optimal holding of foreign exchange reserves is approximately 25 weeks of imports, approximately 13 weeks higher than the international rule-of-thumb. This estimate of optimal reserve holdings is interrelated with the economic characteristics of the country, particularly its fiscal stance. Indeed, this article finds that countries with a prudent public expenditure management framework in place are able to hold a smaller stock of reserves without necessarily impacting the expected growth for the country.","[Moore, Winston] Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Bridgetown, Barbados; [Glean, Adrian] Univ W Indies, Fac Social Sci, Bridgetown, Barbados",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University of the West Indies Open Campus; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University of the West Indies Open Campus,"Moore, W (通讯作者)，Univ W Indies, Dept Econ, Cave Hill Campus, Bridgetown, Barbados.",winston.moore@cavehill.uwi.edu,"Moore, Winston/L-1124-2019; Moore, Winston R/C-3189-2012",,,,,,27,9,11,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our study is based on the construction of a simultaneous equations model that is designed to capture the factors that jointly determine these endogenous variables, and employs a panel of departments (regions) over the period 1990-2012. The empirical results show that central government transfers to regional governments do not have a significant impact on regional income inequality levels. In fact, our estimates support the idea that regional inequalities have a significant and negative impact on the allocation to regions of intergovernmental transfers in that the richest regions receive greater transfers per capita. Intergovernmental per capita transfers also are positively determined by past public expenditure executed by regional governments, and negatively affected by the population size of the departments. These results have clear policy implications as they show that the normative scheme governing intergovernmental regional transfers in Uruguay must be revised if the objective is to give the country greater territorial cohesion.",,,,,"Rodríguez-Miranda, Adrián/H-1651-2015","Rodríguez-Miranda, Adrián/0000-0002-0096-1624",project I+D of the Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica - Universidad de la Republica - Uruguay,project I+D of the Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica - Universidad de la Republica - Uruguay,The authors would like to thank the financial support from the project I+D 2014 of the Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica - Universidad de la Republica - Uruguay.

Such forms include also telework which has the potential to be a tool for employment growth and ensuring the employability and adaptability of workers. Flexibility of telework is not only in eliminating commuting to the workplace but also in the possibility of integrating into the labour market risk groups such as the mentally challenged, mothers on and/or after maternity leave, residents of peripheral parts of cities or rural areas with high rates of unemployment etc. In this paper we analyse the use of telework in public sector in Slovakia.

The entrant's choice of target depends on the mechanism, and it may not maximize its ex-post profit (nor consumer welfare). In an auction, the entrant pays a higher price to take over a target with higher synergies, because these impose stronger negative externalities on incumbents and increase their willingness to pay for preventing entry.

Primarily foreign consumption resulted in the growth of the Slovak economy over past decades. How much the Slovak foreign trade depends on foreign demand was mainly demonstrated during the financial and economic crisis, in the year 2009 at extremely influenced foreign trade in Slovakia. Lowered foreign demand led to the decline of the exporting production, which was followed by the domestic consumption decrease resulting in the deepest plunge of GDP in the history of Slovakia. Recently Slovak economy has shown growth, which is in spite of worsened economic conditions in European Union, one of the biggest one in the EU. The objective of this scientific paper is to analyse structure of economic growth and real impact of domestic and foreign demand (export) on it. Contribution of export to GDP growth will also consider import intensity of exports, because Slovak economy has a big part of foreign added value (import) on total export of the country.

This can cause problems of practical nature for IFRS's users around the world. Some of these changes occur in order to improve existing standards. The other ones define completely new recognition and measurement rules for financial statement elements or eliminate the possibility of using some alternative procedures previously allowed by particular IFRS. Acknowledging that the IFRSs are subject to frequent changes and knowing that it represents comprehensive and complex set of accounting rules it is important to keep up to date with those changes and to translate them into the official national languages. During that process, some problems associated with adequate interpretation and translation of IFRSs from the original English language into the national languages can occur. Continuous changes in standards also require continuous education of accountants which can pose additional administrative and financial burden for enterprises. Since the financial statements should be prepared in accordance with adopted accounting standards, it is of greatest importance for accountants to be in line with the latest changes in IFRSs. The IFRSs are indispensable in the Croatian financial reporting system, especially for large and quoted companies. Empirical research was conducted in order to find out whether the changes in IFRSs cause problems to accountants in Croatia. The target respondents were the accountants employed by large and quoted companies in Croatia which are obliged to apply the IFRSs. The main goal of the research paper was to determine whether and to what extent users of IFRSs face with the problem of understanding the standards that result from the changes in standards and inadequate translation into the national language.","[Pavic, Ivana; Sacer, Ivana Mamic; Decman, Nikolina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, JF Kennedy Sq 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Pavic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, JF Kennedy Sq 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",ipavic@efzg.hr; imamic@efzg.hr; ndecman@efzg.hr,"Dečman, Nikolina/H-7850-2018; Pavic, Ivana/H-7941-2018; Mamic Sacer, Ivana/H-9069-2018","Dečman, Nikolina/0000-0001-5167-4070; Pavic, Ivana/0000-0002-1597-3652; Mamic Sacer, Ivana/0000-0001-9125-8637",,,,,9,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,492,502,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600050,0

Similarly, schools with more successful head coaches tend to earn better recruiting classes, while schools facing bowl bans, scholarship restrictions and probation tend to earn worse recruiting classes.

The electricity sector regulators adopt different incentive mechanisms to ensure that the firms undertake sufficient investment to maintain and modernise the grid. Thus, an effective regulatory treatment of investment requires understanding the response of companies to the regulatory incentives. This study analyses the determinants of investment in electricity distribution networks using a panel dataset of 129 Norwegian companies observed from 2004 to 2010. A Bayesian Model Averaging approach is used to provide a robust statistical inference by taking into account the uncertainties around model selection and estimation. The results show that three factors drive nearly all network investments: investment rate in previous period, socio-economic costs of energy not supplied and finally useful life of assets. The results indicate that Norwegian companies have, to some degree, responded to the investment incentives provided by the regulatory framework. However, some of the incentives do not appear to be effective in driving the investments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One form of this cooperation is put in practice by international organizations allowing membership or other ways of participation in their activities for other international organizations. The most typical situation is a participation of the European Union (EU) in international governmental organizations of economic nature. However, this issue brings many open and complicated problems. From the internal point of view, we can identify at least three important questions. The first one is aimed to the selection of international organizations which are suitable for the participation of the EU in their scope of activity. The second one is related to relations between the EU and its members with respect to the agenda of international organizations, in which they are represented, because of their views may be different. Finally, the question is which institutional structure of the EU should represent the EU in third international organizations. From an external point of view, it is mainly the fact that the EU is a member subject of the particular international organization in addition to all member states of EU, which actually means the dual representation of the members of the EU within the third organization. And such a matter of fact is not perceived very positively by other member states of that international organization.

US consumer price inflation at the sectoral level,JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Globalization; inequality; inflation; monetary policy; post Keynesian economics,,"It is well-known that the slope of the U.S. Phillips curve has flattened in recent decades. In this article we examine the Phillips curve at the sectoral level to better understand why the slope has flattened. We decompose the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator into its sectoral parts and find, using a standard new Keynesian Phillips curve econometric specification, that the goods and services sectors contributed unequally to the change in slope. Our analysis is novel in its consideration of PCE inflation dynamics at a microsectoral level within the goods and services categories. The hypothesis that we think accounts for our findings is that globalization and the shift in U.S. output away from manufacturing production toward services reduced the impact of U.S. labor market conditions on the determination of goods prices and likely created a glut of workers seeking employment in the low-wage domestic service sector. The latter implies that workers in the service sector have a de minimis ability to bargain for higher wages, which ultimately manifests itself as a flat Phillips curve slope in the aggregate data. Our results suggest that the full-employment level of unemployment in the U.S. labor market is likely much lower than commonly estimated. Consequently, we argue that aggregate-demand-management policy in the postglobalization era has been persistently biased by an artificial perception of scarcity in the labor market. This bias has restrained wage growth for those working in the domestic service sector, ultimately resulting in widening earnings inequality.",,,,,,,,,,,13,3,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Our results indicate that the main causes of deindustrialisation in the EU were shifting demand patterns caused by rising GDP per capita, followed by growing international trade which corroborates the hypothesis that the process is natural. In the second part we take a closer look at manufacturing productivity as an integral cause of deindustrialisation. We analyse the impact of market dynamics, concentration and firm size on manufacturing productivity, where we find evidence which supports the conclusion that a higher level of market dynamics increases productivity, while firm size and market concentration seem to decrease industry productivity.","[Skuflic, Lorena; Druzic, Marko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Theory, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Druzic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Theory, Zagreb, Croatia.",mdruzic@efzg.hr,"Škuflić, Lorena/H-7577-2018","Škuflić, Lorena/0000-0002-2978-2902; Druzic, Marko/0000-0002-6436-663X",,,,,25,13,13,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The afterlife motive, aligned to the Christian doctrine of belief in afterlife, heaven and hell, was one of the dimensions of motives for religious demand. For gains in the current life, although the various studies highlight two construct of personal gains and social gains, however, for this study, all items loaded onto only one construct, which is broadly termed as current life motives where religion is said to provide solace, inner peace; as well as social support and networking opportunities.","[Somasundram, Sotheeswari] Taylors Univ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia",Taylor's University; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Somasundram, S (通讯作者)，Taylors Univ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.",sothees@hotmail.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-11473-6-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,64,71,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3AI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000449461100009,0

NPL handling tools and methods currently used by the banks are not efficient enough to significantly reduce the NPL ratio and keep it within safe and sustainable limits. This paper analyses the current state and causes of NPLs in retail banking and the ways of improving their handling efficiency. An idea that retail banks should not only focus on administrative handling methods, but also actively promote financial awareness and especially rational consumer behaviour of clients as measures preventing the NPL, is presented. The idea is based on a synthesis of research results performed within three segments, which shape the background of the problem: first, the current NPL situation in retail banking, theoretical framework and methods of their control, second, the budgetary and borrower performance of households and contemporary trends within consumer behaviour and, third, the NPL determinants, evaluation and comparison of their impact. Recommendations for retail banks to invest into preventive NPL reducing measures and run them parallel to the currently used follow-up type NPL handling tools are developed. The recommendations are supported by simulation of payback potential of investment by using specially developed algorithm. Research methods used: comparative analysis, processing of statistical data, expert evaluation, mathematical analysis.","[Taujanskaite, Kamile] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Milcius, Eugenijus] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Saltenis, Simonas] Aalborg Univ, Selma Lagerlofs Vej 300, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Kaunas University of Technology; Aalborg University,"Taujanskaite, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",kamile.taujanskaite@vgtu.lt; eugenijus.milcius@ktu.lt; simas@cs.aau.dk,"Saltenis, Simonas/R-8392-2018","Saltenis, Simonas/0000-0002-2046-6110",,,,,79,1,1,0,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The analysis aims at MNEs innovation activities between 1998 and 2010 in the Czech Republic. A panel of 6 Czech Community Innovation Survey waves is analysed. The results suggest that there are ownership-specific endowments like firm's size, market orientation and MNEs spent more on research and development (R&D) if they were pushed by the governmental support, or the need to upgrade production capacity, and pulled to innovate by the information and knowledge of their suppliers. The location-specific endowments of the markets played an important role. The probability to innovate depended negatively on the market concentration. We observed U-shaped relationship with the peak negative value in the middle of the Herfindahl index domain. The higher is the technological level of industry the higher is the MNE's probability to innovate. The MNEs were consistently stressing throughout the whole period the existence of variety of hampering factors of innovation apart from technology and existence of prior innovation.","[Vokoun, Marek] Inst Technol & Business, Dept Management, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vokoun, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Dept Management, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",marek.vokoun@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vokoun, Marek/AAI-3302-2020","Vokoun, Marek/0000-0001-5659-3085",,,,,26,3,3,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2409,2416,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800299,0

The relative contributions of the three macroeconomic variables to individuals' life satisfaction are used to assess how each country performed on balance during the crisis. This approach follows a recent trend of using subjective well-being data for monitoring economic performance and for policy appraisal. We find that in the countries most strongly affected by the crisis, the effects on an average citizen's well-being may be of a similar magnitude as the effects of the most serious personal life events. The main driver of these effects is the drop in GDP, whose impact is aggravated by the increase of unemployment. Though the inflation rate went down in several of the countries, the effect was too weak to significantly reduce the negative effect of the changes in GDP and unemployment. The results show that GDP fluctuations are important drivers of subjective well-being.","[Welsch, Heinz; Kuehling, Jan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Welsch, H (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",welsch@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,20,14,14,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Since then, its ten principles covering human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption have helped entrepreneurs in more than 170 countries to advance broader societal goals, implement responsible practices and develop innovative solutions to address the current challenges of globalization. With its 12,000+ participants, it is now the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. Still, despite the remarkable progress achieved by the UN Global Compact so far, its membership is very unevenly distributed among regions. Regarding participation in the initiative, the Visegrad Group countries (V4) can be considered laggards since they are connected to the initiative through foreign multinational corporations rather than companies established on their territory. Moreover, little attention has been paid to it both by practitioners and scholars in these countries. To fill in the gap in the current state of knowledge, the paper focuses on the participants in the UN Global Compact that originate from the V4. Drawing on their regular Communications on progress, it analyzes their activities related to the UN Global Compact normative framework and proper implementation of its ten principles. Also, it examines the role of the local UN Global Compact networks in V4 countries regarding raising awareness, encouraging local companies to join and supporting them to meet the UN Global Compact standards.","[Zemanova, Stepanka; Drulakova, Radka] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zemanová, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",zemanova@vse.cz; radka.drulakova@vse.cz,"Drulakova, Radka/J-5997-2015",,,,,,16,15,15,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2490,2497,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800309,0

Together, these findings provide evidence for the thesis that the rising indebtedness of households in the U.S. is related to high levels of inequality, and that Veblen effects, whereby relative income matters for individual well-being and decisions, may contribute to rising household indebtedness.","[Carr, Michael D.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Jayadev, Arjun] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Jayadev, Arjun] Azim Premji Univ, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Carr, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Wheatley Bldg,100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",michael.carr@umb.edu,,,,,,,37,24,26,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Effects on teen fertility vary across different populations. Among 15-20 year-old non-poor whites, less restrictive legal access to alcohol decreases the probability of first pregnancy and abortion. For this group, easier legal access to alcohol likely increases the alcohol consumption in bars. For black and poor white young women, the results are sensitive to the alcohol consumption restrictions measure. A decrease in the MLDA increases the probability of first pregnancy and abortion. Yet, using a more precise measure that accounts for the MLDA and the woman's age, these results generally no longer hold.","[Cintina, Inna] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Cintina, I (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,540 Saunders Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",icintina@hawaii.edu,,", Inna/0000-0001-7075-7381",,,,,33,0,1,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Such violations of first-order stochastic dominance are framing effects, which expected utility theory, cumulative prospect theory and salience theory of choice under risk cannot account for. However, we propose a version of salience theory which unravels the underlying mechanism triggering such effects and which can explain the impact of event- and attribute-splitting on choices.

Economic advisors were guided by the idea that fiscal austerity would have neutral or expansionary effects on output and employment. In order to avoid large public deficits in the future, the government also introduced radical fiscal rules. The main conclusion in this article is that the fiscal austerity measures in the mid 1990s delayed the Swedish economic recovery and that neither these measures nor the radical fiscal rules were responsible for Sweden's impressive macroeconomic performance in the following years. The positive economic development in Sweden up until the Great Recession was driven by export, profit and technology, reflecting an international upswing and the country's flexible exchange rates and industrial composition. The floating exchange rate, together with independent monetary policy and luck, explain why Sweden could avoid a sharp decline in GDP growth during the global financial and EMU crises. The demanding fiscal rules restricted the possibilities and willingness of the non-socialist government to respond to high unemployment with an expansionary fiscal policy.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Erixon, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,,,,,90,5,5,0,22,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Unlike prior studies, which have analyzed such impacts in an experimental setting featuring the randomized allocation of customers to treatment and control groups, this study deals with a situation where the deployment of time-of-use rates was not experimental in nature. It was part of a full-scale program. By carefully drawing samples across four local distribution companies, we were able to interpret the study as a natural experiment and construct control groups and treatment groups. We used the Addilog model of consumer demand to estimate elasticities of substitution between peak, mid-peak and off-peak periods. The Addilog model includes as a special case the constant elasticity of substitution model that has been widely used in the literature on customer response to time-of-use rates. The estimated elasticities are well behaved and consistent with those found in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Qualitatively, the framework confirms that labour market reforms in one country benefit its trading partners, replicating the stylized facts.

The rationale is to combine the concepts of super-efficiency and sequential DEA models to subsequently construct an improved production possibility set for the directional distance function (DDF). With this enhancement, the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index (MLPI), which can be compared across sections and periods, is proposed. Therefore, the correct technical and efficiency change components can be obtained after decomposing the MLPI. This novel MLPI is employed to measure the green productivity growth of 36 Chinese industrial subsectors during the period 1998-2011, under the constraint of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. A comparison of the measures of the current study with the productivity growth indexes that have been previously used yielded the following results: (i) productivity growth rate is overestimated without considering CO2 emissions; (ii) the rates of technical and efficiency changes are under- and over-estimated respectively, and (iii) the rate of green productivity growth is also underestimated by the previous indexes. The main conclusions and its policy implications for China's green productivity growth through technology progress and structural adjustment are discussed in-depth (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.","[Li, Ke] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Math & Comp, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Ke; Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Hunan Normal University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Li, Ke/0000-0002-1314-7293",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University [1260-Y07200]; Ministry of Education [10JBG013],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University(Xiamen University); Ministry of Education,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No:1260-Y07200), and Ministry of Education (Grant No. 10JBG013).",,47,100,103,2,86,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

The results show that the Czech Republic could gain in situation when CCCTB would be introduced in all EU Members States - the share in the group tax base would increase by 1.22%. A very slight increase was also indicated in the case of the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Spain.

These problems call for reforms to mitigate or avoid the recessionary bias that is the outcome of current systems, as Keynes predicted in the discussion preceding the Bretton Woods agreements. In this paper we briefly review the evidence on international imbalances, and survey the rapidly growing literature on the subject.

Jumps and volatility do not coincide significantly, indicating that the model divides them efficiently. In addition, the stock market is often restrained by daily price limits and processes abrupt information more slowly.

We rely on a key feature of the institutional background whereby the colonial Government of India purchased a majority ownership stake in private railways at predetermined dates set by contracts negotiated decades before the companies came under state ownership. Controlling for individual railway fixed effects, year fixed effects, and railway-specific time trends, we find no evidence of a decline in TFP following state takeovers of private companies. Instead of reducing productivity, as the recent experiences with privatization would suggest, we find that the Government of India maintained productivity when it became the owner of railways. Government ownership influenced certain areas of operations such as the capital-labor ratio, but not others such as fares. Our results point to the conditions where state ownership is no worse than private ownership in terms of productivity. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (4) (2015) 997-1013.

(Labor Supply of New York City Cabdrivers: One Day at a Time,'' Quarterly Journal of Economics, 112 [1997], 407-441), who find that the wage elasticity of daily hours of work for New York City taxi drivers is negative and conclude that their labor supply behavior is consistent with reference dependence. In contrast, my analysis of the complete record of all trips taken in NYC taxi cabs from 2009 to 2013 shows that drivers tend to respond positively to unanticipated as well as anticipated increases in earnings opportunities. Additionally, using a discrete choice stopping model, the probability of a shift ending is strongly positively related to hours worked but at best weakly related to income earned. I find substantial heterogeneity across drivers in their elasticities, but the estimated elasticities are generally positive and rarely substantially negative. I find that new drivers with smaller elasticities are more likely to exit the industry, whereas drivers who remain quickly learn to be better optimizers (have positive labor supply elasticities that grow with experience). These results are consistent with the neoclassical optimizing model of labor supply and suggest that consideration of gain-loss utility and income reference dependence is not an important factor in the daily labor supply decisions of taxi drivers.","[Farber, Henry S.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Farber, HS (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,27,126,168,9,82,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Although project costs exhibit economies of scale over the capacity margin and economies of scope over the spatial margin, network expansion costs may not exhibit cost economies overall. That is, proportional increases in both transmission capacity and length (in miles) may result in a proportional (or even greaterthan-proportional) increase in expansion costs. Moreover, large projects (high-capacity pipelines spanning long distances) likely require installation of compression horsepower, which has direct cost effects. My results suggest such projects exhibit significant diseconomies in cost structure. As a result, pipeline tariffs based on cost-ofservice pricing likely present a disincentive for prospective pipeline customers to commit to long-term contracts which are necessary for the pipeline to acquire regulatory permission to build particularly for large, long-distance expansion projects. The implication is that cost-of-service pricing may inhibit network expansion, exacerbating congestion issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This article shows that incorporating these features renders wage-led growth in an open developing economy unfeasible in the traditional (Kaleckian) sense of the term. This resultwhich follows even if one sets aside the competitiveness considerations generally seen as impeding such growthoccurs due to the presence of a homogeneous goods-producing tradable sector that sets the ceiling to steady-state growth. A corollary, in light of findings from the new new trade theory' literature, is that increasing South-South trade may tend to narrow room for wage-led growth regardless of the other desirable effects of higher wages.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,27,11,11,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2015,66,4,,,,,740,770,,10.1111/meca.12092,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CS8YL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362375700007,0

The most consistent result suggests wholly foreign MNEs impart negative spillovers while joint ventures tend to generate positive spillovers.

The existing empirical studies suggest that AGOA has had a positive effect on the overall volume of trade between Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. However, the economic development literature emphasizes the importance of export diversification for developing countries; therefore, it is important to understand the effects of AGOA on the extensive margin of trade (i.e. the number of distinct products a country exports). Our empirical results suggest that AGOA does contribute to export diversification, specifically through its apparel provision. Countries that are eligible for the AGOA apparel provision export not only more apparel products, but also more non-apparel products to the USA. Thus, AGOA contributes to export diversification at the extensive margin of trade with the USA.","[Cook, Nathaniel P.

This paper adopts the recently developed globe vector autoregression (GVAR) model to empirically study not only the spillovers of housing prices and real income per capita among China's 35 major cities but also the impacts of interest rate shocks on housing prices among these cities. The empirical results show that China's first-tier cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, have comparatively large spillovers of housing prices, while spillovers in central and western cities are not significant. The housing prices of first-tier and eastern cities are affected not only by the real income per capita of these cities themselves, but also by that of other cities to a large extent, while housing prices of central and western cities are mainly affected by the real income per capita of these cities themselves. Real interest rate shocks have a smaller influence on the housing prices of central and western cities, but a greater influence on those of first-tier cities and eastern cities. Empirical studies have definite policy implications.

Using a framework with boundedly rational traders, we find that market-clearing institutions are always stable under a general class of learning dynamics. However, we show that there exist other, non-market-clearing institutions that are also stable. Therefore, in the long run, traders may fail to coordinate exclusively on market-clearing institutions. Using a replica-economies approach, we find the results to be robust to large market size. The theoretical predictions were confirmed in a series of platform choice experiments. Traders coordinated on platforms predicted to be stable, including market-clearing as well as non-market-clearing ones, while platforms predicted to be unstable were avoided in the long run.","[Alos-Ferrer, Carlos] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Kirchsteiger, Georg] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",University of Cologne; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Alós-Ferrer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",carlos.alos-ferrer@uni-koeln.de; gkirchst@ulb.ac.be,"Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/GQO-9340-2022","Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/0000-0002-1668-9784",,,,,34,6,6,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

However, immigration restrictions and capital expropriation risks impede factor flows. Using a political-economy approach that takes into account different generations' conflicting attitudes toward immigration and expropriation, we explore how these restrictions interact. Then, we run two separate country fixed regressions to explore the interdependence of policies empirically. The results from our theoretical model are borne out by the data: We find a positive relationship between emigration and foreign investors' perceived security of property rights in developing countries and a negative relationship between the US foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows to developing countries and the share of US green cards granted to natives from the respective countries.

Our main finding is an overall lack of significant gender differences in behavior. In the treatments with penalties for shirking, female employers offer higher rent compared to men and in those treatments this generosity affects female earnings adversely. We find that while workers do reciprocate more generous contract offers by shirking less, there are no pronounced gender differences in shirking. We find that not using a penalty when the option is available leads to significantly higher levels of shirking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper considers the possibility that (i) workers perceive a linkage between current contributions and future benefits, and (ii) they value employer's contributions less than own contributions, as the former are less salient. Under these assumptions, I find that employers' contributions have a stronger (negative) effect on employment than employees' contributions. Furthermore, a change in how contributions are divided, which reduces the share of employers, is beneficial for employment.

For this explosive case of the CES, the article demonstrates a new and surprising result: marginal and average products of labor and capital approach infinity as either labor or capital approach infinity. Obviously, in this explosive case of the CES, the law of diminishing marginal returns is eventually violated in a dramatic way. Some implications of this result for growth theory are discussed.

We show that an EGT that satisfies these axioms can be parametrically represented by more than one implicit production function that are derived from it. Here, these production functions take the form of distance functions first introduced by Shephard (Cost and production functions, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1953) and Malmquist (Trabajos de estadistica 4:209-242, 1953). One of these production relations has properties of a neo-classical production function that shows how standard inputs are transformed into standard (intended) outputs. The remaining reflect trade-offs, observed in nature, between emissions, emission-causing goods, and cleaning-up activities of the producing unit. We illustrate this by considering two cases: (1) where each type of cleaning-up activity jointly mitigates all types of emissions and (2) where cleaning-up activities are emission-specific allowing also for the possibility that a cleaning-up activity, while helping to reduce certain emissions, can also contribute to more of some other types of emissions.","Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Murty, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",s.murty@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,16,16,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

By combining robust predictions on the sign of the impulse responses obtained from a theoretical model with restrictions on the slope of the oil demand and oil supply curves, we identify oil supply and foreign productivity shocks in a time varying VAR with stochastic volatility. We find that from the 1980s onwards the relationship between oil prices and euro area exports has become less negative conditional on oil supply shortfalls and more positive conditional on foreign productivity shocks. Using the theoretical model we show that our empirical findings can be accounted for by (i) stronger trade relationship between the euro area and emerging economies (ii) a decrease in the share of oil in production and (iii) increased competitive pressures in the product market.

In a sharp contrast to the prediction of standard trade agreement models, we observe a strong negative correlation between tariff commitments and measures of import market power.

This research accounts also for the possible transient linkages and signal discontinuities. A major finding of this paper is deeply suggestive of a sharp causality running from oil price to real exchange rate in lower frequencies. This implies that Russia should better tackle with turbulence triggered by oil price and continue to reduce its energy dependency via drastic and proactive measures. The economic and fiscal initiatives of Putin administration may help to cope with sudden shocks, to lessen the great oil dependence and to build confidence needed for economic recovery. While our research does not say much about the routes through which oil price may affect differently real exchange rate, it clearly indicates the presence of short-term relationship conditional to GDP, government expenditures, terms of trade and productivity differential. The conditional analysis and signal detection appear as meaningful exercises to find new insights into the focal issue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results are mapped as complementarity space for the Germany economy. The space and its dynamics from 1990 to 2011 are analyzed by means of social network analysis. The results illustrate sectors being complements both from a dyadic and portfolio/network perspective. This latter is important, as complementarities may only become fully effective when integrated in a complete set of different knowledge resources from multiple sectors.

The policymaker faces uncertainty on the supply of migrants, but has more information than the public on its preferences and the extent and effectiveness of its enforcement activities. We show that a utilitarian government preferring more migrants than the majority may find it optimal to set a restrictive target to please the median voter, while relaxing its enforcement to admit more foreigners in a concealed way. Lax enforcement may be achieved either by deploying inadequate resources on cost-effective activities (domestic enforcement) or by allocating a larger budget on less effective tools (border enforcement). The attractiveness of one instrument over the other depends on the size of the immigrant flow: if the supply is large, border enforcement might be preferred because, although more costly, it brings the number of migrants closer to the utilitarian optimum. Hence, re-election concerns might provide a rationale for the widespread use of less effective enforcement tool, such as border control.

We characterize renegotiation-proof contracts and strategies for extensive form games with incomplete information and apply our results to two-stage games. If contracts are observable, then the second mover obtains the best possible payoff given that she plays an incentive compatible and renegotiation-proof strategy and the first mover best responds. If contracts are unobservable, then any Bayesian Nash equilibrium outcome of the original game in which the second mover plays an incentive compatible and renegotiation-proof strategy can be supported.

The volatility and persistence of these shocks have posed great challenges for monetary policy. This study employs a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to evaluate the optimal monetary policy responses to commodity terms of trade shocks in commodity dependent emerging market economies. The model is calibrated to the South African economy. The study shows that CPI inflation targeting performs relatively better than exchange rate targeting and non-traded inflation targeting both in terms of reducing macroeconomic volatility and reducing the losses of a non-benevolent central bank. However, macroeconomic stabilisation comes at a cost of increased exchange rate volatility. The results suggest that the appropriate response to commodity induced exogenous shocks is to target CPI inflation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that this impact depends on how the cost of moral hazard manifests itself-whether efficient effort is not feasible or desirable from the beginning, or whether inefficient effort is resorted to only as a punishment equilibrium. Which of these is the case depends on both the details of the technology and the contractual environment. In the former case, the presence of moral hazard moves the market away from positive sorting. In the latter case, whether moral hazard favors positive or negative sorting depends on how the power of incentives needed to implement effort varies with the observable types of the agents.","[Kaya, Ayca] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Vereshchagina, Galina] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Miami; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Vereshchagina, G (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",galinav@asu.edu,,"Kaya, Ayca/0000-0002-4784-4070",,,,,25,7,8,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We find a strong causal effect of recipients' expectations on dictators' transfers. Moreover, in line with our model, the correlation between transfers and expectations can be both positive and negative, obscuring the effect in the aggregate.

To explain changes in household debt, it is necessary to use an accounting framework that isolates net credit-market flows to the household sector, and that takes account of changes in the debt income ratio resulting from nominal income growth as well as from new borrowing. To understand the implications of changing household income and expenditure flows for aggregate demand, it is necessary to distinguish expenditures that contribute to demand from expenditures that do not. Applying a conceptually appropriate accounting framework to the historical data reveals that the rise in household leverage over the past 3 decades cannot be understood in terms of increased household borrowing. For both the decade of the 1980s and the full post-1980 period, rising household debt income ratios are entirely explained by the rise in nominal interest rates relative to nominal income growth. The rise in household debt after 1980 is best thought of as a debt disinflation, analogous to the debt deflation of the 1930s.","[Mason, J.

How can we as economic educators continue to provide sufficient value-added to justify our role in a world where much of what we now do is effectively being automated and commoditized? In this brave new online world, many successful and resilient faculty will add value (and differentiate their product) not by producing costly and elaborate multimedia lectures in which they become a superstar professor-celebrity, but rather through careful, clever, and innovative choices regarding both the adoption of the online content of other providers and the forms of online interactions they integrate into their course designs. Possible forms of faculty-to-student and student-to-student interactions run the digital gamut from discussion boards and electronic testing to peer assessments, games and simulations, and virtual office hours. This article explores basic descriptive and prescriptive questions economic educators and their administrators are likely to face as the online education tide rises. For example, how much does it cost to develop online content and how much time does it take? What are the key ingredients for a pedagogically sound online course?

Since persistence in success or failure is likely to be linked through, potentially time-varying, ability it is intrinsically difficult to identify the causal effect of succeeding on the probability of performing well in the future. We therefore employ a regression discontinuity design on data from professional golf tournaments exploiting that almost equally skilled players are separated into successes and failures half-way into the tournaments (the cut). We show that players who (marginally) succeeded in making the cut substantially increased their performance in subsequent tournaments relative to players who (marginally) failed to make the cut. This success-effect is substantially larger when the subsequent (outcome) tournament involves more prize money. The results therefore suggest that past successes provide an important prerequisite when performing high-stakes tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,"The climate change and various pollutions have been influencing our societies and economies. The environmental assessment, to be discussed in this study, is increasingly important because it serves as an initial step toward pollution prevention. Corporate leaders, policy makers, researchers and individuals who are interested in environmental protection have been paying attention to the assessment so that they can prepare policy suggestions on the global warming and climate change. As a methodology for the assessment, this study proposes a use of Data Environment Analysis (DEA) in a time horizon. Most of data sets on the climate change are sampled in a time series where the performance of organizations fluctuates every moment. In applying the DEA environmental assessment to such a data set, it is necessary for us to classify outputs into desirable (e.g., oil production) and undesirable (e.g., CO2 emission) categories because all organizations usually produce not only desirable but also undesirable outputs as a result of their economic activities. To unify the two different types of outputs, this study incorporates the concept of natural and managerial disposability into the computational framework of DEA and extends them into a time horizon. For the research purpose, this study incorporates Malmquist index into the proposed DEA environmental assessment to examine an occurrence of a frontier shift among multiple periods. The frontier shift indicates a technology progress and/or managerial innovation during an observed period. The index is further separated into four subcomponents in a time horizon. These subcomponents are differently expressed under the natural and managerial disposability. Thus, eight different subcomponents on the Malmquist index are proposed to measure the frontier shift. As an application, this study uses the proposed DEA approach to examine whether the frontier shift (due to technology progress) occurs or not in the petroleum industry from 2005 to 2009. Our empirical study finds that the industry has not exhibited any major frontier shift under natural disposability, but showing a considerable frontier shift under managerial disposability. In other words, the petroleum firms have improved their environmental performance by eco-technology to reduce an amount of CO2 emission during the observed annual periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study used the causality approach developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995) to explore the causality between oil prices and stock prices in the long-run and their short-term impact. The generalized impulse response functions were applied to the monthly data in the period from January 1997 to July 2013. In this study, to capture the different characteristics of oil refining, exporting and importing, three Asian economies were examined. The results indicate that the manner in which a market reacts to hikes in oil prices varies between different markets and periods. This depends on differences in the oil characteristics of the economy and the nature of the shock in oil prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of signals (car, clothing, club membership, etc.) purchased from profit-maximizing firms, men and women form beliefs about each other's qualities. The matching must then be stable in the following sense: there cannot be a man and woman who are unmatched and who both believe they would be better off if they were matched with one another. The model enables an analysis of the impact of third-degree (or gender-based) price discrimination on welfare. When third-degree price discrimination is not feasible, the cost of eliciting private information is higher but a monopoly intermediary may have stronger incentives to implement an efficient allocation. I show that gender-based price discrimination is more likely to have a positive impact the more symmetric the matching environment is. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

With more than two players, the stochastically stable equilibrium depends on how many players in the contest share each label. If the cost of fighting is high, then the long-run equilibrium is favorable to the label shared by fewer players - those players play hawk - while if the cost is low, then the opposite convention develops. This result provides one explanation for the emergence of informal property rights. In disputes over property, a fundamental distinction exists between the possessor, who is unique, and non-possessors, who can be several. For objects whose value is low relative to the cost of conflict over them, this asymmetry favors the development of informal property rights conventions.","Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Wood, DH (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",dhwood@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We contribute to the previous literature in two ways: we consider (i) the provision of several public goods and (ii) agents different not only in income, but also in their preferences over the various goods provided by the public sector. In this setting, both the distribution and size of goods provision depend on the heterogeneity of preferences. Our main result is that preference heterogeneity tends to decrease in-kind redistribution, while income inequality tends to increase it. An empirical investigation based on United States Census Bureau data confirms these theoretical findings.

We present a theoretical framework which serves to establish a link between employee trust and firm performance as well as to identify possible mechanisms through which the relationship may operate. We then analyse matched workplace and employee data in order to ascertain whether the average level of employee trust within the workplace influences workplace performance. We exploit the 2004 and 2011 Workplace Employment Relations Surveys (WERS) to analyse the role of average employee trust in influencing workplace performance in both pre- and post-recessionary periods. Our empirical findings support a positive relationship between three measures of workplace performance (financial performance, labour productivity and product or service quality) and average employee trust at both points in time. Moreover, this relationship holds when we jointly model average employee trust and firm performance in an instrumental variable framework in order to take into account the potential endogeneity of employee trust. We then exploit employee level data from the WERS to ascertain how individual level trust of the employee (rather than the average within the workplace) is influenced by measures taken by employers to deal with the recent recession. Our findings suggest that restricting paid overtime and access to training potentially erode employee trust. In addition, we find that job or work reorganisation experienced at either the employee or organisation level is associated with lower employee trust. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

With its religious heterogeneity, the Holy Roman Empire presents an ideal testing ground for this hypothesis. Using population figures of 272 cities in the years 1300-1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is precisely estimated, robust to the inclusion of various controls, and does not depend on data selection or small sample size. Denominational differences in fertility behavior and literacy are unlikely to be major confounding factors. Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development.

Individual decision making is compared to two group treatments, which differ based on the presence of a rematching rule. We find that individuals and groups differ in how they solve the intertemporal consumption problem, but not in how they improve their consumption planning within a sequence. Individuals' performance improves across sequences, groups without rematching perform approximately the same, while groups with rematching do significantly worse. Our main finding is that while groups perform better than individuals in the first sequence, this difference seems to disappear in the second lifecycle. Results show that in the second sequence groups in the rematching treatment deviate substantially more from optimum than groups that are left stable across sequences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis considers whether making one of the contribution options salient, either through its merits or by arbitrarily choosing one to feature during the experiment, helps overcome the increased coordination problem.

We incorporate both risks into an analytically tractable model with two overlapping generations. We derive the equilibrium dynamics in closed form and show that the joint presence of both risks leads to overproportional risk exposure for households. This implies that the whole benefit from insurance through social security is greater than the sum of the benefits from insurance against each of the two risks in isolation. We measure this through interaction effects which appear even though the two risks are orthogonal by construction. While the interactions unambiguously increase the welfare benefits from insurance, they can increase or decrease the welfare costs from crowding-out of capital formation. The net effect depends on the relative strengths of the opposing forces.","[Harenberg, Daniel] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ludwig, Alexander] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CMR, SAFE, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ludwig, Alexander] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, MEA, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Harenberg, D (通讯作者)，ETH, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",dharenberg@ethz.ch; ludwig@safe.uni-frankfurt.de,,,"German National Research Foundation [Sonderforschungsbereich SFB 884, SPP 1578]; Research Center SAFE - State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE",German National Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Research Center SAFE - State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,"Daniel Harenberg gratefully acknowledges financial support of the Sonderforschungsbereich SFB 884 (German National Research Foundation), and of Swiss Re.

These differences in social preferences explain to a large extent why women send less than men in trust games. Inequity averters can ensure equal payoffs if nothing is returned by sending one-fourth of the endowment while surplus maximizers can increase total payoffs by a factor of three for each dollar sent. Social preferences also help explain the size of gifts in dictator games and choice of compensation method for simple tasks, however, after controlling for social preference type, gender is still influential in these decisions. Women give significantly more to charity than men even after accounting for our measure of social preferences. Women prefer egalitarian payment systems both because they are inequity averters and because low self-confidence may lead them to believe they will earn more with equal sharing.

The methodology developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995) is used to verify the Granger non-causality hypothesis. The results show that capacity utilization Granger-causes capital accumulation in the Brazilian economy and, also that the profit share of GDP does not Granger-cause the national investment-capital ratio. This corroborates the Kaleckian proposal based on the fundamental role of the accelerator, and suggests that the Brazilian economy can grow with either a concentration or a de-concentration of income, provided a suitable institutional arrangement is in place.","[Morrone, Henrique] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, BR-90046900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Morrone, H (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, BR-90046900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",hmorrone@hotmail.com,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,4,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2015,,116,,,,,159,170,,,,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY1FT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366152800009,0

We try to answer these questions by looking at option-implied probability density functions of future inflation. Deriving densities from a new data set on options on the euro-area harmonised index of consumer prices (excluding tobacco) provides us with the full distribution of inflation expectations, including uncertainty and asymmetry of market participants' beliefs about the inflation outlook. The daily data set allows us to analyse the effects of monetary policy announcements and macro news in a time-varying event study framework despite the short sample period from 2009 to 2013. Due to renewed fears of deflation, we compare option-implied and statistical density functions to gain insight into deflation risk. Inflation expectations show a decreasing mean but growing uncertainty, especially since the intensification of the sovereign debt crisis in mid-2011. Around the same time, the influence of monetary policy announcements on inflation expectations across all horizons diminished. Tail events such as deflation, although still contained, have become more probable. The impact of macroeconomic news on inflation probabilities has overall decreased and shifted towards countries more affected by the crisis. This paper's results regarding the anchoring of inflation expectations are twofold: The mean and low sensitivity to actual news speak for anchored inflation expectations, whereas the growing uncertainty reveals market participants' concerns about possible extreme inflation or deflation outcomes in the future.

He is therefore unable to use the standard Bayesian methods. Instead, at each moment in time, the DM constructs a preference relation on the set of available actions based on their past performance. We postulate a set of axioms on this family of preference relations indexed by histories (of rewards). Two key conditions, a typical Exchangeability axiom and another labeled Consistency, that constraints the DM not to update her preferences after certain events (loosely based the the principle of insufficient reason), characterize thumb rules for ranking actions that are akin to the familiar fictitious play in game theory. Moreover, if in fact the stochastic process that generates the rewards is exchangeable, a DM that obeys our axioms (almost surely) cannot be distinguished in the long run from one that is fully cognizant of the environment and satisfies the expected utility hypothesis.

Data from over 900 working-age individuals in Sudan indicates that long-term urban residents in conflict areas have a higher probability of being employed in skilled sectors relative to similar individuals in a non-conflict city and a lower likelihood of becoming unemployed. Recent arrivals to the conflict city, however, are much more likely to become unemployed. The data also show that young women entering the labour market during the conflict are less likely to be unemployed in the conflict city. This is consistent with a framework where war-induced population displacement from rural to urban areas generates demand for services provided by higher-skill workers and increased competition for low-skill jobs. The data show that household wealth of long-term residents decreases in conflict zones. Negative wealth effects are smaller for those more dependent on skilled sectors.","[Alix-Garcia, Jennifer] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Bartlett, Anne] Univ New S Wales, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Int Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Alix-Garcia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 429 Taylor Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",alixgarcia@wisc.edu,"Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/W-1762-2019","Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/0000-0003-0200-0496","Jesuit Foundation, University of San Francisco; Faculty Development Fund, University of San Francisco; University of Wisconsin Graduate School","Jesuit Foundation, University of San Francisco; Faculty Development Fund, University of San Francisco; University of Wisconsin Graduate School","Jesuit Foundation, University of San Francisco; Faculty Development Fund, University of San Francisco; University of Wisconsin Graduate School.",,61,13,14,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The identifying assumption is that the probability of making an expectation error increases when the uncertainty faced increases. An analysis of the downturn in 2008-2009 shows that 44% of the decline in industrial production can be attributed to increased uncertainty.

We explore the optimal mix of familiar workers (who we call incumbents) and less familiar workers (newcomers) when production is group-based. If incumbents have a lower marginal return of effort, they will have less incentive to invest relative to newcomers. This is true, even when incumbents produce more for any given level of effort. This creates a tradeoff: less familiar agents will invest more whereas a more familiar team is inherently more productive. In our setup, the non-investing principal (weakly) prefers less familiar agents than the team that maximizes second-best surplus. On the other hand (symmetric) agents prefer a more familiar teammate compared with the second-best option. These insights have implications for team composition, job rotation and worker tenure.

For values sampled from monotone hazard rate (MHR) or regular distributions, we achieve a (1- is an element of)-fraction of the optimal revenue in polynomial time and quasi-polynomial time, respectively. Our algorithm for bounded distributions applies probabilistic techniques to understand the statistical properties of revenue distributions, obtaining a reduction in the algorithm's search space via dynamic programming. Adapting this approach to MHR and regular distributions requires the proof of novel extreme-value theorems for such distributions. As a byproduct, we show that, for all n, a constant or a polylogarithmic (in n) number of distinct prices suffice for near-optimal revenue for MHR and regular distributions, respectively.

Classical and recent examples include the Hansen-Jagannathan sets of admissible stochastic discount factors, Markowitz-Fama mean-variance sets for asset portfolio returns, and the set of structural elasticities in Chetty's (2012) analysis of demand with optimization frictions. The econometric structure of the problem allows us to construct convenient and powerful confidence regions based on the weighted likelihood ratio and weighted Wald statistics. Our statistics differ from existing statistics in that they enforce either exact or first-order equivariance to transformations of parameters, making them especially appealing in the target applications. We show that the resulting inference procedures are more powerful than the structured projection methods. Last, our framework is also useful for analyzing intersection bounds, namely sets defined as solutions to multiple smooth inequalities, since multiple inequalities can be conservatively approximated by a single smooth inequality. We present two empirical examples showing how the new econometric methods are able to generate sharp economic conclusions.","[Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kocatulum, Emre] DRW Holdings LLC, Chicago, IL USA; [Menzel, Konrad] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); New York University,"Chernozhukov, V (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; kocatulum@gmail.com; km125@nyu.edu,,,,,,,39,11,12,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We characterize the Markov Perfect Equilibrium of the continuous time dynamic game played by the monopolist and the forward-looking consumers, under the assumption that consumers benefit from the subsequent expansion of the network. The paper contributes to the theoretical discussion on the validity of the Coase conjecture, analyzing whether Coase's prediction that the monopolist serves the market in a twinkling of an eye remains valid in our setup. We conclude that the equilibrium network development may actually be gradual, contradicting Coase's conjecture.

J,"Lawson, C",,,,"Lawson, Clive",,,Order and process in institutionalist thought: Commons and Ayres,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Commons; Ayres; Process; Order; Social ontology,TECHNOLOGY,"Process is a central category in institutionalist economics. Conceptions of process, often bound up with ideas of historical time and circular or cumulative causation, are regularly used to distinguish institutionalism from mainstream theorising and to highlight similarities or complementarities with other heterodox positions. Discussions of institutionalist ideas of process, however, have tended to concentrate on the contributions of Thorstein Veblen to the exclusion of those of other major institutionalists. In contrast, this article considers two other important contributors to institutionalist thought: John Commons and Clarence Ayres. The differences between these authors' works are often thought to articulate some kind of a fault line in institutionalist thought, highlighting very different and indeed incompatible positions. I argue that although their overall projects are clearly very different, if attention is focussed on the general ontological presuppositions of each author, there exists a good measure of common ground between them. This is especially the case if comparisons are made, in line with the focus of this special issue, between their conceptions of process and order. From an ontological perspective, moreover, those aspects of their accounts that at first appear at odds, are rather shown to be quite compatible and even usefully complementary.","[Lawson, Clive] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Lawson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge Girton Coll, Cambridge, England.",clive.lawson@econ.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,7,7,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Additional evidence at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level shows that this education elasticity of demand mechanism can explain part of the correlation between the share of college-educated workers in a city and the employment share of service industries. The parametrization of a simple model suggests that this induced demand shift can explain around 6.5 percent of the relative demand shift in the United States between 1984 and 2002.

The racial gap in employment opportunities is larger when comparisons are made between job seekers with credentials that proxy for expected productivity and/or match quality. Moreover, the racial discrimination detected is driven by greater discrimination in jobs that require customer interaction.

During 1974-1996 growth in non-OPEC oil production Granger causes growth in OPEC oil production. OPEC oil production decreases significantly with positive shocks to non-OPEC oil production in the earlier period, but does not do so in the new industrial age. In the new industrial age OPEC oil production rises significantly with an increase in oil prices, unlike during the age of OPEC period. OPEC oil production responds significantly to positive innovations in global GDP throughout. Over 1997:Q1-2012:Q4 the negative effect on real oil price of positive shocks to non-OPEC oil production is larger in absolute value than that of positive shocks to OPEC oil production. The cumulative effects of structural shocks to non-OPEC oil production and to real oil price on OPEC oil production are large. The cumulative effects of structural shocks to OPEC production and real oil price on non-OPEC production are small. Results are robust to changes in model specification. An econometric technique to predict growth in OPEC oil production provides support for the results from the SVAR analysis. Results are consistent with important changes in the global oil market.

I here postulate a cooperative kind of optimizing behavior, called Kantian. It is shown that in simple economic models, when there are negative externalities (such as congestion effects from use of a commonly owned resource) or positive externalities (such as a social ethos reflected in individuals' preferences), Kantian equilibria dominate the Nash-Walras equilibria in terms of efficiency. While economists schooled in Nash equilibrium may view the Kantian behavior as utopian, there is some - perhaps much - evidence that it exists. If cultures evolve through group selection, the hypothesis that Kantian behavior is more prevalent than we may think is supported by the efficiency results here demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we propose a direct measure of expectations the black-market interest rate in Shanghai and study the behavior of money demand in the Chinese hyperinflation. Although the log-log schedule may provide an accurate description of money demand with relatively low interest rate, the pattern of seigniorage collected in the highest hyperinflation is consistent with the prediction of the semi-log schedule. The comparison of the seigniorage actually collected with the maximum steady state level shows that the economy might be on the increasing side of the Laffer curve except for the concluding stage of the hyperinflation. This suggests that the Chinese hyperinflation has been driven mainly by the government's quest for revenue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We link people's behaviour in a modified lottery experiment and a time preference game to detailed information about their family networks. We find that individuals with a dense family network are more likely to pay a fraction of their endowment to hide their earnings from the experiment. This association is mainly driven by male respondents. We also find that men with dense family networks have lower discount rates than those with smaller networks. Qualitative responses suggest that these men perceive us as an alternative bank: if they have no immediate purpose for the money, they prefer the research team to keep it for two weeks. This prevents them from spending it on things other than its intended use and may keep predatory members of the family network at bay. The negative association between family network density and investment decisions is stronger if these networks are characterised by members who sought financial support in the past. Taken together, our results offer tentative evidence that dense family networks, under some conditions, have adverse impacts on economic decision-making.","[Beekman, Gonne] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gatto, Marcel] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Nillesen, Eleonora] UNU MERIT, Econ Dev Innovat Governance & Inst Grp, Maastricht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University of Gottingen; Maastricht University,"Beekman, G (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",gonne.beekman@wur.nl,,"Gatto, Marcel/0000-0002-0108-3296",NWO [453-10-001]; United States Institute of Peace (USIP) [077-09F],NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); United States Institute of Peace (USIP),"We are grateful for financial support from NWO (NWO grant # 453-10-001) and the United States Institute of Peace (USIP grant # 077-09F).

In particular, we characterize the results from both a positive and normative standpoint, by highlighting the determinants of individuals' choice, with special focus on information costs, on the role of income and preferences, and by characterizing the optimal contribution rate to mandatory complementary pension plans.

This analysis is done for both the US and the UK using quarterly data, and the results reveal interesting differences between the two countries. One of the key findings is that the great moderation shows up only at certain frequencies, and not in all components of real GDP. A second result is that the great moderation appears to have shifted cyclical power from shorter and business cycles to long cycles, which has important implications for both policy formulation and the probability of less frequent but more severe economic crises. We use these results to explain why the incidence of the great moderation has been so ephemeral across GDP components, countries and time periods. This also explains why it has been so hard to detect periods of moderation (or otherwise) reliably in the aggregate data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We approach social exclusion as a multidimensional phenomenon by a three-mode principal components analysis (Tucker3 model). This method is applied to estimate an indicator of social exclusion for 28 European countries between 1995 and 2010. The empirical evidence shows that in the short run: (1) Granger causality runs one way from social exclusion to economic growth and not the other way; (2) countries with a higher level of social exclusion have higher growth rates of real GDP per capita; and (3) social exclusion has a larger effect than income inequality on economic growth. The policy implication of our analysis is that social inclusion is not a source of economic growth in the short term.,"[Dell'Anno, Roberto] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Scie Econom & Stat, I-84084 Salerno, Italy; Univ Salerno, CELPE, I-84084 Salerno, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Salerno,"Dell'Anno, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Scie Econom & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Salerno, Italy.",rdellanno@unisa.it,"Dell'Anno, Roberto/AAB-6385-2022","Dell'Anno, Roberto/0000-0001-7441-8328",,,,,123,12,12,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We describe the key features of the policies and incorporate them into forward-looking measures of the cost of capital and the effective average tax rate. We show that the treatment of expenses relating to IP income is particularly important in determining the effective tax burden. A key finding is that regimes that allow expenses to be deducted at the ordinary corporate income tax rate, as opposed to the lower IP Box tax rate, may result in negative effective average tax rates and can thereby provide a subsidy to unprofitable projects. We discuss the ways in which IP Boxes are likely to affect firms' decisions and relate this to possible policy aims. While some regimes attempt to link the tax benefit to real activities, others have designed a policy targeted at the income streams associated with intellectual property. A key concern is the role that IP Boxes may play in increased tax competition between European countries.","[Evers, Lisa] ZEW GmbH, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Miller, Helen] Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Spengel, Christoph] Lehrstuhl Allgemeine Betriebswirtschaftslehre & B, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Evers, L (通讯作者)，ZEW GmbH, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",evers@zew.de; helen_m@ifs.org.uk,,,federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the scope of the Research Programme Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the scope of the Research Programme Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the scope of the Research Programme Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies.

This form of preference elicitation, however, often reveals a high frequency of status quo (SQ) choices. This may signal an unwillingness of respondents to evaluate the proposed trade-offs in service levels, questioning the welfare theoretic interpretation of observed choices and the validity of the approach for regulatory purposes. Using the methodology for DCE in the regulation of water and sewerage services in England and Wales, our paper contributes to the understanding of SQ choices in several novel dimensions. First, we control for the perception of the SQ and the importance of attributes in day-to-day activities. Second, we use a split sample design to vary both the description of the SQ and the survey administration mode (online vs. in-person). Third, the service attributes can both improve or deteriorate, so that the SQ is not necessarily the least-cost option. Fourth, we examine SQ choices in individual choice tasks and across all tasks so as to identify the determinants of serial SQ choices. Our results suggest that individual SQ choices mostly reflect preferences and thus represent important information for the regulator. However, serial SQ choices are mainly driven by cognitive and/or contextual factors, and these responses should be analysed as part of standard validity tests.","[Lanz, Bruno] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Econ, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lanz, Bruno] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ctr Int Environm Studies, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lanz, Bruno] ETH, Chair Integrat Risk Management & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Provins, Allan] Econ Environm Consultancy Eftec, London, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Econ, Chemin Eugene Rigot 2, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,46,12,13,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

More specifically, a set of regional poverty lines will be derived and employed as deflators to correct household expenditures for spatial differences in prices and needs. The quality of these deflators depends on the extent to which the underlying poverty lines adhere to the principles of consistency and specificity. Central to reconciling both principles in practice is our pursuit for austerity in setting poverty thresholds as well as the view that differences in social norms mainly reflect differences in social inclusion needs. The particularity of the proposed method compared to standard practice lies in the combination of: (i) the pronounced subdivision in socio-economic strata; (ii) the use of a differential calorie threshold per sector; (iii) the introduction of protein intake; (iv) the derivation of a minimal house rent; and (v) the use of an austere non-food/non-housing allowance. The impact of this method is illustrated using a budget survey of the Democratic Republic of Congo.","[Marivoet, Wim; De Herdt, Tom] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Marivoet, W (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",wim.marivoet@uantwerpen.be,,"Marivoet, Wim/0000-0001-8853-4565; de herdt, tom/0000-0002-5288-7446",,,,,38,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In this critical comment, while sharing some crucial views with Moseley, the author makes a critique to some views in Moseley. The first critique concerns the so-called circular reasoning in the MELT as defined by the New Interpretation. The second concerns the relationship between Moseley's MELT and capital accumulation. In his definition of MELT with inconvertible credit money, Moseley seems to overlook a theoretical tradition embodied especially in the work of Okishio-Foley-Kotz, which to different extents points out that the incentive and the real magnitude of capital accumulation or new investment play a crucial role in determining the value of inconvertible credit money.","[Meng, Jie] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Meng, J (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Inst Econ, Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",mengjie99@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,18,5,6,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The results indicate that the U.S. has a CA in most services, except in more traditional ones, such as travel and transportation. However, India, and more recently China, gained a CA in modern services, such as computer and information services during the period considered in this paper. An examination of the distributional dynamics indicates that the likelihood of U.S. gaining CA over an initial position of comparative disadvantage (CDA) in its trade of a particular service with India is higher than the probability of losing its initial dominance. In contrast, the U.S. CA or CDA vis-a-vis China exhibits high levels of persistence over time. The regression results suggest that relative abundance of sector-specific labor, human capital, and FDI inflows have been significant sources of CA for the U.S. over both China and India.

This paper examines the theoretical properties and empirical performance of the WPC in sequential markets. The benchmark used to judge the WPC is the information share (IS) measure based on the variation of the efficient price. We derive the asymptotic value of the WPC, which is a complex combination of the unconditional means and variances of the returns of sequential markets, under the assumption of normality. We show that the WPC correctly converges to the IS only when the returns are uncorrelated with zero means. Our theoretical predictions based on normality hold well in simulations and in empirical analyses of the overnight price discovery for the S&P 100 index and its constituent Stocks. As the correlation between overnight and daytime returns increases, the WPC deviates from the IS substantially. Crown Copyright (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

For Thorstein Veblen, waste stems from individual efforts to show superiority, corporate efforts to increase pecuniary returns without increasing industry, or national efforts to exert military dominance. For John Maynard Keynes, waste assumes the form of idle factories, unemployed workers, and unsold goods resulting from insufficient demand. From a broader perspective, waste results from the efforts of rentiers to increase their returns. Both dimensions of waste relate to the Fed and other central banks' efforts to address the problem of social provisioning through the wealth effect. The ideas of Veblen and Keynes provide guidance for evaluating policy directed at enhancing the provisioning process. Based on Veblen's ideas, policies should promote the life process and not conspicuous consumption. Based on Keynes ideas, policies should stimulate demand, increasing profits and, in turn, creating jobs.","Westminster Coll, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA",,"Watkins, JP (通讯作者)，Westminster Coll, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA.",,,,,,,,14,8,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Lithuania is associated with countries where a high level of shadow economy exists. This paper examines the issues of human capital development under conditions of shadow economy. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the power and effects of the Lithuanian shadow economy in the context of human capital and to assess the inter-dependence between the power of the shadow economy and human capital. The theoretical justification for research on the inter-dependence between the power of the shadow economy and human capital is based on the analysis of how changes in the human capital structure and indicators reflect the power of the shadow economy and vice versa. Theoretical analysis has been made on the main features and factors of shadow economy and possible tools of human capital evaluation. On the basis of theoretical findings, the model of shadow economy power has been created and using the linear regression method, the dependence of shadow economy power on human capital has been evaluated. The power of the shadow economy has been calculated as a function of population, GDP, trade, unemployment and the labor force. Variables of social development, such as demographic changes and risk of poverty, indicators of HC economic development and indicators of HC economic potential have been used for the research. For the evaluation of the interdependence of the variables, the years 2005-2012 were used. In evaluating human capital under the conditions of the shadow economy, a few periods have been identified and distinguished. Firstly, the results showed that the level of human capital education and unemployment can be described as the most important indicators that reflect the economic environment and shadow economy. Secondly, the increasing level of the shadow economy increases shadow unemployment, and this in turn influences the attraction of direct foreign investment. And finally, research on the influence of separate factors of the shadow economy on variables of human capital could disclose a deeper understanding of the impact of the shadow economy on human capital.","[Ciutiene, Ruta; Meiliene, Evelina; Savaneviciene, Asta; Vaitkevicius, Sigitas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Management, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciutiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Management, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ruta.ciutiene@ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X",,,,,28,6,6,1,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

As such the analysis seeks to disentangle two causes of emission abatement: that attributable to the EU ETS and that attributable to the economic crisis that hit the EU in 2008/09. To do so, we use a dynamic panel data approach. Our results suggest that, by far, the biggest share of abatement was attributable to the effects of the economic crisis.

Using multiple factors, different specifications and modern estimation techniques, these models have gained wide acceptance because of their success in accurately fitting the observed commodity futures' term structures and their dynamics. It is not well emphasized however that these models, in addition to providing the risk neutral distribution of future spot prices, also provide their true distribution. While the parameters of the risk neutral distribution are estimated more precisely and are usually statistically significant, some of the parameters of the true distribution are typically measured with large errors and are statistically insignificant In this paper we argue that to increase the reliability of commodity pricing models, and therefore their use by practitioners, some of their parameters in particular the risk premium parameters should be obtained from other sources and we show that this can be done without losing any precision in the pricing of futures contracts. We show how the risk premium parameters can be obtained from estimations of expected futures returns and provide alternative procedures for estimating these expected futures returns.

On top of this, the enthusiasm of the countries in exploring new opportunities led them to start negotiations on signing a five trade agreement in 2010. The process was finalized in 2012. The agreement requires that all trade tariffs on industrial products and most of the tariffs on agricultural products will be removed in seven and ten years, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one that investigates possible economic impacts of this agreement on the Korean and Turkish economies. It employs a computable general equilibrium model and uses the Global Trade Analysis Project database. It finds that the agreement will benefit both parties in terms of GDP and exports. In particular, total gains of Korea and Turkey will be as high as 0.129 and 0.054 percent of their respective GDPs. Finally, the exports of Korea might increase up to 0.139 percent whereas that of Turkey might increase by 0.164 percent.","[Kilinc, Zubeyir; Kutuk, Merve Mavus; Oduncu, Arif] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Oduncu, A (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Nicosia, Cyprus.",zubeyir.kilinc@tcmb.gov.tr; merve.mavus@tcmb.gov.tr; arif.oduncu@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,21,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"RM 4503 WORLD TRADE CTR, 159-1 SAMSUNG-DONG,GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Using questionnaire data based on a sample of 476 self-employed taxpayers we show that perceptions of procedural and distributive justice predict voluntary compliance, and trust in authorities mediates this observed relation. In addition, the relation between retributive justice, i.e. the perceived fairness with regard to the sanctioning of tax evaders, and enforced compliance was mediated by power, just as the relation between perceived deterrence of authorities' enforcement strategies and enforced compliance. With regard to both retributive justice and deterrence also a mediational effect of trust on the relation to voluntary compliance was identified. Furthermore, voluntary and enforced compliance were related to perceived social norms, but these relations were neither mediated by trust nor power. Our findings are of particular relevance since the literature identifies self-employed taxpayers as evading considerably more taxes than employees and therefore they are an important audience for interventions to raise tax compliance.","[Kogler, Christoph; Muehlbacher, Stephan; Kirchler, Erich] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Kogler, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.kogler@univie.ac.at; stephan.muehlbacher@univie.ac.at; erich.kirchler@univie.ac.at,"Kogler, Christoph/HZL-3971-2023; Kirchler, Erich/K-7985-2013","Kogler, Christoph/0000-0002-8443-6009; Muehlbacher, Stephan/0000-0002-3665-4976; Kirchler, Erich/0000-0003-4731-1650",,,,,50,57,60,0,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We compare these two types of regulations in a global context taking into account heterogeneity in carbon content of both fossil fuels and renewable fuels. We find that although neither the ethanol mandate nor the emission standard is certain to reduce emissions relative to a business-as-usual baseline, at any given level of biofuel consumption in the policy region, a mandate, relative to an emission standard, results in higher GHG emissions, smaller expenditure on fuel imports, lower price of ethanol-blended gasoline and higher domestic fuel market surplus. This result holds over a wide range of values of model parameters. We also discuss the implications of this result to a regulation such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard given recent developments within the US such as increase in shale and tight oil production and large increase in average vehicle fuel economy of the automotive fleet.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; CO2 EMISSIONS,"Environmental protection, including the prevention of air pollution and health hazard materials such as PM2.5 and PM10, is now a very serious policy issue in China after attaining the rapid economic growth and development. The PM stands for Particular Matter, indicating the size of both solid particles and liquid droplets found in air. Unfortunately, the economic development has produced a serious healthcare problem in not only China and other surrounding nations. To enhance people's healthcare and appeal a good national image to the world, China is recently looking for the new industrial and environmental policy direction to attain social sustainability in terms of economic development and environmental prevention. To discuss policy implications on the new policy direction, this study utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for assessment on its regional performance by incorporating PM2.5 and PM10 as undesirable outputs, along with two disposability concepts (i.e. natural disposability and managerial-disposability). No previous DEA study has incorporated the amount of PM2.5 and PM10 in empirical investigation. Using a simulated data set for the period of 2013-2014, this study measures the efficiency of municipality cities under four different types of regional classifications. The empirical results indicate that the Chinese government should distribute its economic resources to cities, which locate in the northwest region (including Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi), and reinforce more strict regulation on energy consumptions for environmental prevention in major cities (e.g. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing). The industrial policy change from the economic growth to the environment protection is essential for the future of China, which is currently the second largest economic power in the world. The environmental protection can enhance the China's image of contributing in economics, industry and environmental protection to all other nations. It can be envisioned that the new policy effort reduces the regional imbalance and increases the social sustainability in China. The empirical findings and policy implications discussed in this study are applicable to not only China but also other industrial and developing nations and those are useful in guiding their industrial and environmental policy development.

In this paper, we show evidence consistent with major beneficial effects from so doing, with falling term premia and anchored policy rate expectations. To do this we construct term premia estimates using the method suggested by Adrian et al. (2013) for selected inflation targeting Latin American economies. They use synthetic prices constructed from estimated yield curves to derive holding-period excess returns and condition on the principal components of the yields. This approach is extremely easy to implement and fast to calculate. We detect a small drop in interest rate expectations since the global financial crisis but longer term rates seem remarkably well anchored. There is also relatively low correlation between our estimated Latin American and US term premia.","[Blake, Andrew P.; Rule, Garreth R.; Rummel, Ole J.] Bank England, Ctr Cent Banking Studies, London EC2R 8AH, England",Bank of England,"Blake, AP (通讯作者)，Bank England, Ctr Cent Banking Studies, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",andrew.blake@bankofengland.co.uk; garreth.rule@bankofengland.co.uk; ole.rummel@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,6,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

We integrate a demand system with age and income parameters into the REIM. The extended model thus addresses concerns about the effects of household heterogeneity. The initial testing is conducted with a model for the Chicago metropolitan area. First, using aggregate expenditure data by income and age groups, the almost ideal demand system with group fixed effects is constructed. Next, the estimated demand system is linked to the REIM to reflect long-term changes in the age and income distribution of households. The long-range simulation from the extended model takes into account structural changes in expenditure type stemming from changing demographic composition. The extended model further broadens the scope of impact analysis under various scenarios associated with age and income changes.","[Kim, Kijin; Kratena, Kurt; Hewings, Geoffrey J.

This hypothesis postulates that the demand pulls the innovative capacities of the suppliers only when and if they are accompanied by qualified knowledge interactions with creative customers. We empirically investigate this hypothesis based on the sector-level data of nineteen (manufacturing and service) sectors in fifteen EU countries over the period 1995-2007. We adopt the input-output framework to assess the strength of the inter-sectoral intermediate goods transactions. Our main findings confirm that demand actually pulls technological change only when it comes from competent customers able to implement effective user-producer knowledge interactions.

We have limited choice-theoretic understanding of why this should occur. We rationalize this as follows. Some scholars are assumed to be 'specialists': their research productivity consists of transforming dissertation chapters into publishable papers. We show how a department that hired such a scholar provides incentives to maximize research productivity. We show that his research productivity paths are characterized by a 'bang-bang' solution, that is, he works with either maximum or minimum effort. The department sets the scholar's wages proportional to their impatience to spur productivity and only succeeds if he turns out to be more impatient than the department. We also examine career development after tenure is granted: there occurs a clear polarization in terms of academic reputation and promotion prospects between the Specialist and other staff. The article provides a novel perspective on academic productivity and the tenure system.","[Faria, Joao Ricardo] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [McAdam, Peter] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; University of Surrey,"Faria, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",petermcadam@hotmail.com,"Faria, João Ricardo/AAG-5304-2021","FARIA, JOAO RICARDO/0000-0001-6484-3566",,,,,47,16,19,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this survey, we go back to the details of the debates that took place independently among psychologists and economists, and sketch an integrative interdisciplinary approach likely to favor a more fruitful collaboration between economics and psychology.

The novel feature of the model is that the estimation of this dynamic persistence is robust to any distributional form for the unobserved individual and job components, and the relationship between them. Then, additional assumptions are considered to separately identify the relative magnitude of these two components. In the data drawn from the PSID, we find that once individual and job-specific effects are taken into account the estimated persistence is significant but small. In addition, the ratio of the estimated variance of the job-specific effects to the variance of the individual time-invariant component is 40%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We discuss three types of production cost functions of the monopolistically competitive sector. Different types of production cost functions have different production factor components of variable and fixed costs. We find that differences in production cost components of the monopolistically competitive sector matter for the impacts of international factor mobility on the skilled-unskilled wage inequality.,"[Pi, Jiancai; Zhou, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Zhou, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pi2008@nju.edu.cn; zhouyu_0105@hotmail.com,"Pi, Jiancai/AAY-5955-2021; Zhou, Yu/D-1999-2011","Pi, Jiancai/0000-0003-4327-8355;",Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"We would like to thank the editor Till Requate and three anonymous reviewers for their sincere help and suggestive comments on improving this paper.

In particular, Galaabaatar and Karni (Econometrica 81(1):255-284, 2013) work with a strict partial order and present axiomatizations of the Multi-prior Expected Multi-utility and the Single-prior Expected Multi-utility representations. In this paper, we characterize both models using a preorder as the primitive. In the case of the Multi-prior Expected Multi-utility representation, like all the previous axiomatizations of this model in the literature, our characterization works under the restriction of a finite prize space. In our axiomatization of the Single-prior Expected Multi-utility representation, the space of prizes is a compact metric space. Later in the paper, we present two applications of our characterization of the Single-prior Expected Multi-utility representation and discuss the necessity of an axiomatization of the Multi-prior Expected Multi-utility model when the prize space is not finite. In particular, we explain how the two applications we develop in this paper could be generalized to that model if we had such an axiomatization.","Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Riella, G (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",riella@unb.br,"Riella, Gil/Q-3416-2019",,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico of Brazil [310751/2011-0],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico of Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"I thank Efe Ok, seminar participants at EESP, LAMES 2014 and EBE 2014 for helpful discussions and suggestions.

Such competitive pressure can lead individuals to engage in unethical behavior in an effort to get ahead. There are several forms of cheating in which individuals may engage to improve their own outcome: they may lie about their own performance in a task and they may lie about others' performance in a task. Our research is the first to examine how competition affects each of these two types of cheating behavior.

Much policy advice given in the aftermath of the financial crisis rests on the assumption that increasing public debt relaxes borrowing constraints of private households. This is the case for ad-hoc debt limits, which are exogenous to public policy. Instead, if debt limits are fully endogenous, as e.g. in the case of the natural borrowing limit, public debt has no impact. We assume that borrowing limits arise because of limited contract enforceability and are therefore determined as equilibrium outcomes. Using an incomplete markets economy in which households are subject to uninsurable earnings shocks, we show that public debt provides some liquidity, but less so than it would if constraints were imposed ad-hoc. We show that generating borrowing constraints as an equilibrium outcome substantially alters the answers to other important questions, such as for the welfare effects of government debt or its impact on real economic activity.

We show that, in denser areas, individuals choose to interact with more people and meet more random encounters (weak ties) than in sparsely populated areas. We also demonstrate that, for a low urbanization level, there is a unique steady-state equilibrium where workers do not interact with weak ties, while, for a high level of urbanization, there is a unique steady-state equilibrium with full social interactions. We show that these equilibria are usually not socially efficient when the urban population has an intermediate size because there are too few social interactions compared to the social optimum. Finally, even when social interactions are optimal, we show that there is over-urbanization in equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Then the quantiles are evaluated by utilizing Secant numerical approach to solve this nonlinear equation. Subsequently, the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model with GT distribution is utilized to estimate the corresponding volatility, and further estimate the value-at-risk (VaR) of seven stock indices in the developed and emerging markets. Empirical results show that, the stylized facts that appeared in most financial assets are seized effectively by this model and negative return and volatility spillover effects significantly subsist from the currency markets to stock markets. Moreover, the stock indices in emerging market have the higher return and the higher risk. As to VaR performance comparison, the modified historical simulation (MHS) and the EGARCH volatility specification significantly affect the VaR forecast performance for stock indices in the emerging market as compared with the developed market. Moreover, the VaR forecast performance of all models with GT is superior to that with normal return distribution only for stock indices in the developed market and only for 99% level. Turning to the whole market, the VaR forecast performance is almost the same as that for the emerging market. Finally, the MHS-EGARCH model with GT distribution is the optimal model to forecast the VaR among these eight models, irrespective of which of the three markets are used. This finding can provide the financial institutions to select an appropriate model to forecast and further control the market risk they faced. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows that, surprisingly, cardinal tournaments are superior to ordinal tournaments. The rationale is that, by utilizing all the available information more efficiently, cardinal tournaments allow the principal to implement higher power incentives, which makes them superior even though they restrict the form of the contract more than ordinal tournaments.

The results from the study established that practitioners in the IT industry tend to be risk takers who want to be trained and equipped with risk management skills while construction industry practitioners tended to be risk avoiders who resisted the changes required to implement risk management.

We examine a model with gender and marital status heterogeneity which accounts for the trends in the U.S. hours and the labor wedge. Apart from taxes, the model's labor wedge reflects non-distortionary cross-sectional differences in households' hours worked and productivity.

The advantage of using a single model, when comparing alternative policies across countries, is that it removes the concern that different conclusions are based solely upon model differences, which would be the case with multiple models. Each country faces certain key impediments to growth. In Egypt, the high level of tax evasion reduces the country's ability to carry out growth-enhancing fiscal policies, while the inadequacy of public infrastructure in Mauritius leads to a similar impediment to growth, requiring a fiscal solution. For Egypt, the revolution of 2011 affected growth, particularly because of the impact of a dramatic decline in tourism. In looking at how to increase growth, the focus is on the low rate of tax compliance in Egypt; the study finds that fiscal policies designed to reduce tax evasion are successful in modestly increasing GDP growth. Unlike Egypt, Mauritius has not suffered from any immediate shock, but public infrastructure shortages are bottlenecks in GDP growth, which has slowed in recent years. Therefore, the elasticities of private production with respect to stocks of public infrastructure are examined, and used to implement the general equilibrium model. Modest increases in spending upon public infrastructure, compensated for by corresponding decreases in current spending, were found to lead to increases in real GDP growth. However, beyond certain levels, higher infrastructure spending results in an eventual decline in real GDP growth.","[Feltenstein, Andrew; Condon, Jeffrey; Datta, Biplab Kumar] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Abdul-Razzak, Nour] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Chicago,"Feltenstein, A (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",afeltenstein@gsu.edu,"Datta, Biplab/AAI-1631-2020","Datta, Biplab/0000-0002-2559-850X",African Economic Research Consortium(AERC),African Economic Research Consortium(AERC),"We would like to thank Professor Hanan Nazier of Cairo University, who provided us with the social accounting matrix that formed the basis for the Egyptian general equilibrium model, and the late Professor Manal Metwaly of Cairo University, who was responsible for starting this project and whom we greatly miss.

I consider equilibria that are time-consistent and allow for history-dependent strategies. A new numerical algorithm is developed to solve for the set of equilibrium payoffs. For a baseline economy calibrated to the U.S. economy, the capital income tax with the highest social welfare is slightly procyclical, while the labor income tax is countercyclical. Compared with the data, this equilibrium provides a better account of the cyclical properties of U.S. tax policy than other solutions that abstract from history dependence. The welfare cost of no commitment is about 0.22% of aggregate consumption as compared to the Ramsey allocation with full commitment.","Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Feng, ZG (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",z.feng2@gmail.com,,"Feng, Zhigang/0000-0002-5200-237X; Ma, Likun/0000-0001-6171-796X",NCCR-FINRISK; Swiss National Computing Center,NCCR-FINRISK(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Computing Center,"I thank Felix Kubler for encouragement and guidance.

Today we are witnessing a period of food security pessimism triggered by increases in food prices, and their higher volatility, that began in 2008. However, previous episodes of food pessimism were ended by the Industrial and Green Revolutions, and policy-makers legitimately ask whether human ingenuity and technical advances will address today's worries without the need for their intervention. Here we explore some of the ways natural and social scientists have attempted to explore the supply and demand for food in the future to help policy-makers understand the challenges ahead. We are particularly struck that different communities have approached this problem in different ways that seldom reference each other. We describe two broad approaches: statistical extrapolation and economic simulation models of the food system that incorporate market mechanisms. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches and make some tentative suggestions about how they can together address important policy priorities.","[Godfray, H.

Based on a dataset collected by the Ministry of Agriculture of China from 2003 to 2007, this paper examines the impact of health on the earnings of migrant workers engaging in physically-intensive work requiring good health. Our findings indicate that a poor health status not only weakens the incentive of rural laborers to participate in the migrant labor force but also significantly reduces their earnings. A migrant worker in poor health only earns 67 percent of what a healthy worker makes. Among all the human capital characteristics and family economic factors, health status is the most influential on earnings for less educated workers. Labor productivity has a greater impact on earnings than the annual number of days that a person works. Ongoing health-care reforms aimed at the improvement of the health-care services available to rural laborers are urged to help reduce poverty in rural China.","[Qin, Lijian] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Finance & Publ Adm Sch, Bengbu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chien-Ping] Univ Houston Victoria, Sch Business Adm, Sugar Land, TX USA; [Liu, Xun] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Wang, Chenggang] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Jiang, Zhongyi] Minist Agr, Res Ctr Rural Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Finance & Economics; University of Houston System; University of Houston Victoria; University of Houston; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Qin, LJ (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Finance & Publ Adm Sch, Bengbu, Peoples R China.",qinlj28@163.com; chenc@uhv.edu; xun.liu@ttu.edu; chenggang.wang@ttu.edu; jiangzhongyi@263.net,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [13CGL102]; Ministry of Education of China [12YJC790152]; National Post-doctoral Council of China [2012M510316, 2013T60058]","National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); National Post-doctoral Council of China","The authors are grateful for the support of the National Social Science Foundation of China (13CGL102), the Ministry of Education of China (12YJC790152), the National Post-doctoral Council of China (2012M510316) and the National Post-doctoral Council of China (2013T60058).",,34,19,19,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2015,23,2,,,,,84,99,,10.1111/cwe.12108,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CE8MV,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352097700005,0

Monetary policy follows a standard Taylor rule for the interest rate. The macroprudential authority implements a Taylor-type rule for the loan-to-value, ratio reacting to output and house prices. Results show that introducing the macroprudential rule or extending the interest-rate rule to respond to house prices increases welfare, since it enhances financial stability. However, for the optimal policy mix, when both policies act together, monetary policy should ensure price stability while the macroprudential authority should safeguard financial stability.","[Rubio, Margarita] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Carrasco-Gallego, Jose A.] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, Hants, England",University of Nottingham; University of Portsmouth,"Rubio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,"Carrasco-Gallego, Jose/0000-0001-5315-4271; Rubio, Margarita/0000-0002-1525-9766",,,,,24,17,17,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We develop a laboratory product market in which low-cost production creates a negative externality for third parties, but where alternative production with higher costs mitigates the externality. Our first study, conducted in Switzerland, reveals a persistent preference among many consumers and firms for avoiding negative social impact in the market, reflected both in the composition of product types and in a price premium for socially responsible products. Socially responsible behavior is generally robust to varying market characteristics, such as increased seller competition and limited consumer information, and it responds to prices in a manner consistent with a model in which positive social impact is a utility-enhancing feature of a consumer product. In a second study, we investigate whether market social responsibility varies across societies by comparing market behavior in Switzerland and China. While subjects in Switzerland and China do not differ in their degree of social concern in nonmarket contexts, we find that low-cost production that creates negative externalities is significantly more prevalent in markets in China. Across both studies, consumers in markets exhibit less social concern than subjects in a comparable individual choice context.

We document that borrowing against collateral substantially increases the return volatility of long-lived assets. Moreover, otherwise identical assets with different degrees of collateralizability exhibit substantially different return dynamics because their prices contain a sizable collateral premium that varies over time.

This paper investigates the role a country's religious affiliation plays in destination choice for international tourism flows. To that end, a gravity model for international tourist arrivals is estimated by using a large dataset of 164 countries for the period 1995-2010. Results provide evidence that religious similarity have significant explanatory power in global tourism flows even after controlling for other measures of cultural affinity. Moreover, the presence of common religious minorities in the country has a positive impact on tourism flows.

This paper argues that such belief originated and persisted as a useful heuristic under conditions in which envy was likely to trigger destructive behavior and the avoidance of other people's envy, effectively prescribed by the evil eye belief, was a proper response to that threat. We hypothesize that in weakly institutionalized societies wealth differentiation and vulnerability of productive assets were the key factors enabling envy-induced destructive behavior and contributing to the emergence and spread of the evil eye belief as a cultural defense mechanism. Evidence from small-scale preindustrial societies shows that there is indeed a robust positive association between the incidence of the belief and measures of wealth inequality, controlling for potential confounding factors such as patterns of spatial and cross-cultural diffusion and various dimensions of early economic development. Furthermore, the evil eye belief is more prevalent in agro-pastoral societies that tend to sustain higher levels of inequality and where vulnerable material wealth plays a dominant role in the subsistence economy.

However, it has been argued that the youths tend to have more lax social and ethical norms concerning both property rights and online behavior. In this study we present the results of a vignette experiment, i.e. a scenario survey where responders are asked to provide an ethical judgment on different forms of unauthorized acquisition of a full season of a popular TV series described in a number of hypothetical stories. The survey is conducted both on a student sample and on a sample of individuals who openly endorse protection of intellectual property rights for cultural goods. In this way we can investigate the possibly limited external validity of studies relying solely on the student samples. The vignette experiment concerned ethical evaluation of unauthorized acquisition of cultural content in both virtual and real context and was focused on six dimensions previously identified as relevant to the ethical judgment. Surprisingly, we found that the rules for the ethical judgment do not differ between our samples, suggesting that the social norms on online piracy follow similar patterns in student and in other populations. Findings from studies relying on ethical or moral judgments of students may thus be valid in a much broader population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Monte Carlo exercises demonstrate that in lower dimension multivariate binary probit models, the multivariate quadrature-based SGI estimator with few quadrature points performs very well and comparable with the GHK simulator. But as the dimension of integration or dependence (error correlation) among equations increases, the GHK simulator outshines the SGI estimator. This indicates that for integration problems involving higher dimension multivariate probit models, and those with strong dependence among variables, the GHK simulator remains to be a more efficient approach.

Using data from 6668 Bangladeshi working children aged 5 through 14, the article estimates several binary and multinomial logit regressions, separately for boys and girls. The article confirms that most children work in the informal sector where formal sector's jurisdiction and regulations are absent. Specifically, the article finds that children are least likely to work in the service occupation and are more likely to work in the textile sector. The findings highlight the diversity in the occupational distribution of child workers by gender and show how their individual and family characteristics influence occupational choices. The service sector, which comprises of mostly maids, is a hidden sector. This sector makes children vulnerable to abuse. Thus, it is suggested that policy makers need to come up with effective legislations that would protect the children who work in the hidden informal' sector.","[Alam, Imam M.; Amin, Shahina; Rives, Janet M.] Univ No Iowa, Dept Econ, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA",University of Northern Iowa,"Amin, S (通讯作者)，Univ No Iowa, Dept Econ, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA.",shahina.amin@uni.edu,,,University of Northern Iowa,University of Northern Iowa,The authors are thankful to the anonymous referees and the editor for their valuable comments and suggestions.

We suggest that this novel approach to fundraising segmentation can be performed as the extension to the already existing analyses, utilising the demographic and psychographic profiles. Based on nationally representative survey results of Croatian households, we develop an analytical procedure. It might help managers of community nonprofit organisations to target the relevant individuals by applying Internet marketing tools (such as Google Analytics) and approaches. Our analysis allows prediction of how likely it is that an individual (based on his or her demographic/psychographic profile) could be identified as INLCM (i.e. successfully targeted for fundraising efforts). Empirical results from Croatia demonstrate that such individuals do not have a lengthy Internet experience and do not use it frequently. The reported level of community belonging for these prospects is rather high, while their relevant Internet activities are related to maintaining the existing social ties and obtaining information about local organisations. It is interesting that they might be living in multi-generational households, either without their own underage children, or with a single child.","[Alfirevic, Niksa] Univ Split, Fac Econ Split, Split 21000, Croatia; [Pavicic, Jurica] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Dorotic, Matilda] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Mkt, N-0442 Oslo, Norway; [Pavlovic, Danijela Krizman] Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Split; University of Zagreb; BI Norwegian Business School; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Alfirevic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ Split, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",nalf@efst.hr,"Alfirevic, Niksa/C-2967-2013; Dorotic, Matilda/AAT-6875-2020; Pavicic, Jurica/E-7558-2014","Alfirevic, Niksa/0000-0002-2130-982X; Dorotic, Matilda/0000-0002-1722-9309; Pavicic, Jurica/0000-0002-6580-1162",,,,,53,1,1,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

However, while the stock market reacted to the disclosure of the stress test outcomes, in the CDS market there is some evidence of a 'reverse' reaction.

In this study, we identify hiring discrimination against former juvenile delinquents in a direct way. To this end, we conduct a field experiment in the Belgian labour market. We find that labour market discrimination is indeed a major barrier in the transition to work for former juvenile delinquents. Labour market entrants disclosing a history of juvenile delinquency get about 22% less callback compared to their counterparts without a criminal record.

This special issue takes a stock of the extent of, and the factors affecting financial inclusion; the role of cross-border banking in financial deepening and access across Africa and the impacts of financial innovation on access as well as monetary policy. While Africa's banking systems are still shallow relative to peers, substantial progress has been made over the past two decades both in terms of financial inclusion and financial innovation, as well as cross-border banking. While access to finance has improved, the evidence based on the Global Findex database points to substantial heterogeneity within sub-regions of Africa and demographic characteristics. The evidence also suggests that foreign banks from emerging markets, including Africa, have contributed to financial access, but the opposite is the case for foreign banks from Europe and USA. However, challenges remain, including the gap between financial deepening and financial inclusion.","[Beck, Thorsten] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Beck, Thorsten] CEPR, London, England; [Senbet, Lemma; Simbanegavi, Witness] AERC, Nairobi, Kenya; [Senbet, Lemma] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",City University London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Simbanegavi, W (通讯作者)，AERC, Nairobi, Kenya.",witness.simbanegavi@aercafrica.org,"Beck, Thorsten/GRX-3987-2022","Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528",,,,,18,60,64,4,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We extend the Mortensen-Pissarides model to include a goods market with search and financial frictions. Households, who have limited commitment, face endogenous borrowing constraints when financing random consumption opportunities. We show that borrowing limits depend on the sophistication of the financial system, the frequency of liquidity shocks, and the rate of return on (partially) liquid assets that households can accumulate for self insurance. Moreover, firms' expected revenue is endogenous and depends on firms' market power in the goods market and the availability of unsecured credit to consumers. As a result of the complementarity between credit and labor markets, multiple steady states might exist. Across steady states unemployment and debt limits are negatively correlated. We calibrate the model to the US labor and credit markets and illustrate the effects of an expansion in unsecured debt similar to that seen in the US from 1978 to 2008. Under the baseline calibration, the rise in unsecured credit can account for approximately seventy percent of the decline in the long-term average unemployment rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The same holds for the lagged volume except for one case. This, perhaps, suggests that the trading volume (contemporaneous or lagged) is not adequately conveying information to induce traders' views of the desirability of trade and, therefore, points to the need for searching for other micro and macro variables to be used as potential proxy for information arrival to the stock market of the emerging economy.","[Bose, Shekar] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Nat Resource Econ, Muscat, Oman; [Rahman, Hafizur] Thompson Rivers Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada",Sultan Qaboos University,"Rahman, H (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada.",hrahman@tru.ca,,,,,,,37,12,12,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We apply a Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method, cross-referencing data from three databases: the Getting the Numbers Right (GNR) database developed by the Cement Sustainability Initiative, the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), and the Eurostat International Trade database. Our decomposition method allows seven channels of emission change to be distinguished: activity, clinker trade, clinker share, alternative fuels, thermal and electrical energy efficiency, and electricity decarbonisation. We find that, apart from a slow trend of emission reductions coming from technological improvements (first from a decrease in the clinker share, then from an increase in alternative fuels), most of the emission change can be attributed to the activity effect. Using counterfactual scenarios, we estimate that the introduction of the EU ETS brought small but positive technological abatement (2.2%+/- 13% between 2005 and 2012). Moreover, we find that the European cement industry has gained 35 billion Euros of overallocation profits, mostly due to the slowdown of production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we focus on reducing the imbalances that arose between the core and peripheral members of the euro area in the first decade of its existence. The idea is that stable positive spreads in peripheral countries could have decreased domestic demand, preventing the boom-bust cycles that plagued these economies. They could also prevent such developments in the future. We construct a panel model for euro area countries and estimate the relationship between real interest rates and the current account balance. Next, we use the estimated parameters to perform simulations.

Additionally, using the EUM-VaR model, this study investigates the hedging effectiveness of short and long hedged portfolios constructed with multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-type models that feature level effects and multivariate normal t and skewed t distributions for stock indexes and their corresponding futures in the Greater China Region. It is found that, all else equal, portfolios constructed using the multivariate skewed t distribution are far more effective in hedging than those that rely on the other distributions, and the effectiveness of hedged portfolios from the multivariate GARCH-type models with level effects outperform those without level effects. Additionally, the effectiveness of hedged portfolios from multivariate asymmetric GARCH-type models exceeds that of those from multivariate symmetric GARCH-type models. Thus, investors should select the multivariate asymmetry in volatility, multivariate asymmetry in distribution, and EUMVaR models to construct effectively hedged portfolios.

Consequently, a literature has evolved examining the similarities in US regional crime rates and whether a national trend exists or is emerging. The present article extends the recent research into the emergence of a national trend by considering convergence in alternative classifications of crime using a data set subject to a higher degree of disaggregation than considered hitherto. The results obtained overturn previous findings obtained using more highly aggregated data, indicating the detection of convergence to be dependent upon the level of disaggregation considered. In addition, the extent of convergence detected is shown to vary across classifications of criminal activity and reflect anecdotally noted changes in the evolution of crime at a national level. The implications of the observed regional variation in crime for the urban-rural divide and theoretical, empirical and policy analyses are noted.","[Cook, Steve; Winfield, Tom] Swansea Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Cook, S (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",s.cook@swan.ac.uk,,,British Academy [SG100765],British Academy,This research has benefited from funding received from The British Academy [SG100765].,,86,7,9,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis is conducted using panel quarterly data from the period 2001-12 for Central and Eastern European countries (including Turkey) with relatively flexible exchange rate regimes. The paper reconnects the empirical literature on exchange rates in Central and Eastern European countries with the most recent findings on exchange rate determination in advanced economies. Koyna's approach, which accounts for linkages between countries, is used in the study. The main findings indicate the existence of causal relations running from both nominal exchange rates to monetary fundamentals and in the opposite direction as well as the existence of a relatively strong link between exchange rates and differentials in the relative price of non-tradables.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Macroecon, Krakow, Poland; [Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Stat, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Macroecon, Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; monika.papiez@uek.krakow.pl; slawomir.smiech@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,65,3,5,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

The analysis shows that the number of existing groups in a country increases the probability of a terrorist group choosing the country as a base of operations. More important, terrorist groups are more likely to locate in a country where existing groups share similar ideology with the entrant, particularly for left-wing terrorist groups. A country's political instability and/or state failure raise the chances that a terrorist group will locate there. Terrorist groups are more likely to base their operations closer to the venues of their planned terrorist attacks.

We are building on the work of Carlstrom and Fuerst (Carlstrom, Charles T., and Timothy S. Fuerst. 2005. Investment and Interest Rate Policy: A Discrete-Time Analysis. Journal of Economic Theory 123: 4-20.) and Ascari and Ropele (Ascari, Guido, and Tiziano Ropele. 2007. Optimal Monetary Policy under Low Trend Inflation. Journal of Monetary Economics 54 (8): 2568-2583., Ascari, Guido, and Tiziano Ropele. 2009. Trend Inflation, Taylor Principle, and Indeterminacy. Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 48 (1): 1557-1584.) who separately considered effects of capital accumulation and trend inflation in a similar context. It is shown that the simultaneous presence of positive trend inflation and capital accumulation greatly affect the determinacy property of equilibrium under this setup. Namely, in the presence of positive trend inflation the determinacy region shrinks, and it is virtually impossible to produce a determinate equilibrium with the Taylor-type rule given a steady state of inflation of more than 5%. Even for a moderate value of 2.5%, the design of the rule that ensures the uniqueness of the equilibrium requires detailed knowledge of the parameters of an economy. We also show that for a large set of plausible parameters, the standard Taylor rule leads to indeterminacy. Alternative monetary policy rules such as interest rate smoothing, output growth targeting and price level targeting are also analyzed. It is shown that the latter improves the determinacy of the model solution, and the best way to guarantee the determinate equilibrium is to use price level targeting in the policy rule.","[Sossounov, Kirill] Natl Res Univ, HSE, Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm RA, Moscow, Russia; [Gerko, Elena] London Business Sch, Dept Econ, London NW1 4SA, England",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; University of London; London Business School,"Sossounov, K (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, HSE, Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm RA, Moscow, Russia.",ksosunov@gmail.com,"Sossounov, Kirill/O-7510-2018; sosunov, kirill/AAI-1412-2020","Sossounov, Kirill/0000-0003-0769-3009;",,,,,20,1,1,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

High demand volatility leads to Stackelberg competition with the information-advantaged firm leading. In the N-firm case an equilibrium with multiple leaders and multiple followers emerges endogenously. In a duopoly information acquisition game we identify conditions that determine whether neither, one, or both firms will pay to acquire early information and note that one firm's obtaining early information may generate a positive externality benefitting its competitor. Both symmetric and asymmetric outcomes are possible and Stackelberg market leadership may occur in equilibrium, but only when firms have different costs of information. Our finding that an information advantage may convey leadership which then affects the value of information to the players applies to other settings exhibiting first-mover advantage such as certain public good provision games.

Based on our approach, we are able to combine direct and indirect effects of foreign ownership and calculate the total effect of foreign firms on local productivity.

The memory mechanism is used to introduce a proxy of trust in the model. The key idea is that a lender, having lent many times to a borrower in the past, is more likely to lend to that borrower again in the future than to other borrowers, with which the lender has never (or has infrequently) interacted. The core of the model depends on only two parameters, which are common to all lenders: one is w and it is representing the attractiveness of borrowers, the other one is Q and it represents the memory of lenders in their assessment of counter parties. The stronger the w parameter, the more random the matching results between lenders and borrowers. The stronger the Q parameter, the more stable the trading relationships become. Model outcomes and real money market data are compared through a variety of measures that describe the structure and properties of trading networks. These include number of statistically validated links, bidirectional links, and 3-motifs. The model reproduces well features of preferential trading patterns empirically observed in a real market.

Drawing on a resource based view and social network analysis, the article presents the usefulness of structural analysis for networking improvement. This research contributes to the network theory by presenting the possible ways of using structural measurements for networking strategy adoption and by applying structural measurements to the seldom explored area of coopetition processes inside networks.

Answers from an agent-based model,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agent-based model; Bail-in; Bail-out; Crisis resolution,CREDIT,"Since the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis almost half a trillion euros have been spent to financially assist EU member states in taxpayer-funded bail-outs. These crisis resolutions are often accompanied by austerity programs causing political and social friction on both domestic and international levels. The question of how to resolve failing financial institutions, and how this depends on economic preconditions, is therefore a pressing and controversial issue of vast political importance. In this work we employ an agent-based model to study the economic and financial ramifications of three highly relevant crisis resolution mechanisms. To establish the validity of the model we show that it reproduces a series of key stylized facts of the financial and real economy. The distressed institution can either be closed via a purchase & assumption transaction, it can be bailed-out using taxpayer money, or it may be bailed-in in a debt-to-equity conversion. We find that for an economy characterized by low unemployment and high productivity the optimal crisis resolution with respect to financial stability and economic productivity is to close the distressed institution. For economies in recession with high unemployment the bail-in tool provides the most efficient crisis resolution mechanism. Under no circumstances do taxpayer-funded bail-out schemes outperform bail-ins with private sector involvement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Yet few economists have recognized that this elemental idea originates not only from the financial theory of investment and investment theory of business cycles put forward by John Maynard Keynes, but also in the credit view of money and finance advocated by Joseph Schumpeter. Nevertheless, Minsky described Schumpeter's business cycle theory as 'banal' because it relied on the real economy as Walras represents. The reason was that money was endogenous in Schumpeter's earlier view, as it emerged out of the credit system, which allowed for a discussion of the relationship between production and finance. This essay will focus on how Minsky related some ideas from Schumpeter's Theory of Economic Development with those in Keynes' General Theory Money and finance provide a link between Keynes' view of the investment decision as a determinant of output and employment with Schumpeter's view of the investment decision as a determinant of innovation and economic growth.","NIFU Nord Inst Studies Innovat, Res & Educ NIFU, N-0167 Oslo, Norway",,"Knell, M (通讯作者)，NIFU Nord Inst Studies Innovat, Res & Educ NIFU, Wergelandsveien 7, N-0167 Oslo, Norway.",,"Knell, Mark/JXX-7956-2024",,,,,,63,21,25,4,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The aim of the paper is to propose a predictive model DACSI Index based on economic I-Ecoi and non-financial indicators I-ESGi and appropriately selected predictive models DA(Eco) and DA(ESG) for manufacturing companies according to CZ-NACE classification. Predictive models were developed with the use of Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA). MDA results showed that the inclusion of non-financial indicators did not result in any significant changes in the classification of companies into individual groups compared to classification on the basis of economic indicators only. From MDA results it also follows that the statistical significance of non-financial indicators is low, but they signal a causal relationship between individual economic and non-financial indicators of sustainability. The results also showed that the predictive model DACSI Index, composed of economic indicators, environmental indicators, social indicators and corporate governance indicators has a much higher accuracy than the predictive model composed of economic indicators only. The essential conclusion of our research into corporate sustainability measurement is that the traditional performance assessment using economic indicators no longer suffices and does not reflect current performance of the company from the long-term perspective, and it is therefore necessary to include both economic and non-financial indicators into the predictive model DACSI Index. And the predictive model DACSI Index is just the type of model that will provide relevant information about the company's sustainability status to both the owners and investors.","[Kocmanova, Alena; Docekalova, Marie Pavlakova] Brno Univ Technol, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Simanaviciene, Zaneta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Brno University of Technology; Mykolas Romeris University,"Kocmanova, A (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kocmanova@fbm.vutbr.cz; zaneta.simanaviciene@ktu.lt; docekalova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019; Pavlakova Docekalova, Marie/O-8845-2017; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019","Pavlakova Docekalova, Marie/0000-0003-4628-5075; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405",Measuring Corporate Sustainability in Selected Sectors of The Czech Science Foundation [14-23079S],Measuring Corporate Sustainability in Selected Sectors of The Czech Science Foundation,This paper is supported by the grant No. 14-23079S Measuring Corporate Sustainability in Selected Sectors of The Czech Science Foundation.,,36,6,7,5,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this study, we apply a new method for sampling enterprises: respondent-driven sampling, or RDS. RDS is a modified method of chain-referral or network sampling, in which survey participants recruit other enterprises in their social network to the study. It incorporates a mathematical model to minimise biases inherent in network sampling. RDS has the potential to complement existing sampling methods, such as household listing, random walks and using existing frames. This study has three objectives: it evaluates the feasibility of using RDS to study enterprises, tests the statistical assumptions underlying the RDS approach and compares the sample characteristics with external data. We applied RDS in a survey of small and medium enterprises in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. To our knowledge, this is the first time RDS has been applied to enterprises. We find that RDS is a feasible, efficient method for obtaining a high-quality sample of enterprises: 608 enterprises were interviewed within 6 weeks and the statistical assumptions underlying RDS generally held. We also show that RDS captures less established businesses that are less likely to be in surveys based on government and commercial sampling frames. These findings lead to the conclusion that RDS is a viable complement to existing sampling methods.","[Lau, Charles Q.] RTI Int, Survey Res Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Bobashev, Georgiy V.] RTI Int, Ctr Data Sci, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Research Triangle Institute,"Lau, CQ (通讯作者)，RTI Int, Survey Res Div, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",clau@rti.org,,"Lau, Charles/0000-0003-3485-5632",,,,,26,1,1,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Our empirical evidence is based on findings from Spanish firms and is consistent with the core rationale that unlisted firms face more difficulties than their listed counterparts when looking for funding from external markets. As a result, unlisted firms tend to hoard significant amounts of cash out of the generated cash flow, while listed firms do not.

Simulation methods are used to evaluate the effects of changes in season length on the distributions of competitive balance measures for different distributions of the strengths of teams in a league. The popular RSD measure performs as expected only in cases of perfect balance; if there is imbalance in team strengths, its distribution is sensitive to changes in season length. It is therefore not recommended for comparisons of competitive balance for different sports leagues with different numbers of teams and/or games played. (JEL L83, D63, C63)","[Owen, P.

Using data from the European Social Survey, we investigate the relationship between political participation and personal values, using the Schwartz (1992) values inventory. A political participation hierarchy is theorized, and activities are categorized into four levels of participation (none, weak, medium and strong), based on the cost of participating and how unconventional the activity is. Empirical analysis points to individuals who are more open to change and more self-transcendent, being more likely to participate. Sub-sample analysis, contrasting East and West Europe, suggests that the role for personal values is more subdued in the East, with respect to moving individuals from not participating to at least voting. Furthermore, the use of a generalized ordered logit model in this study illustrates the complex nature of many of the determinants of political participation. In particular, we find that the influence of the majority of individual characteristics is not monotonic in nature, as you move up through the political participation hierarchy. These findings are important for researchers and policy-makers who may be interested in understanding determinants of and/or enhancing the level of political participation in an economy.","[Pacheco, Gail; Owen, Barrett] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Pacheco, G (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand.",gail.pacheco@aut.ac.nz,,"Pacheco, Gail/0000-0001-9988-0092",,,,,49,9,9,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The importance of inflation persistence is crucial to policy authorities and market participants, since the level of inflation persistence provides an indication on the susceptibility of the economy to exogenous shocks. Departing from classic econometric approaches found in the relevant literature, we evaluate inflation persistence through the nonparametric Hurst exponent within both a global and a rolling window framework. Moreover, we expand our analysis to detect the potential existence of chaos in the data generating process, in order to enhance the robustness of our conclusions. Overall, we find that inflation persistence is high from 1775 to 2013 for the annual data-set and from February 1876 to May 2014 in monthly frequency, respectively. Especially from the monthly data-set, the rolling window approach allows us to derive that inflation persistence has reached to historically high levels in the post-Bretton Woods period and remained there ever since.","[Plakandaras, Vasilios; Gogas, Periklis; Papadimitriou, Theophilos] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Komotini 69100, Greece; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",Democritus University of Thrace; University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Rangan.Gupta@up.ac.za,"Papadimitriou, Theophilos/AAD-7737-2020; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/GVU-6967-2022; Gogas, Periklis/N-8162-2014; Plakandaras, Vasilios/AAM-6020-2020","Gogas, Periklis/0000-0002-5134-3869; Plakandaras, Vasilios/0000-0001-9351-9546; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/0000-0001-9035-183X",,,,,41,8,8,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Each DEA model is formulated as a mathematical programming problem utilizing the values of inputs and outputs of all DMUs. The analytical process is developed on the basis of these inputs and outputs by identifying the best practices in the field. Additionally, DEA can be used as a method to evaluate economic efficiency. In this study, we propose the measurement of public postal operators' profit efficiency by DEA-based profit efficiency approach. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this approach we measured the profit efficiency of public postal operators (PPOs) in the European Union member states and Serbia as a candidate country. The implications are derived from the empirical study by using VRS model, CRS super-efficiency model and Slack-based model. First, we calculated profit efficiency and super-efficiency scores of all observed PPOs. After that, we repeated the analytical process without influential observations. Finally, we determined the target values of inputs and outputs for profit inefficient PPOs.","[Ralevic, Predrag; Dobrodolac, Momcilo; Markovic, Dejan; Mladenovic, Snezana] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Ralevic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe St 305, Belgrade, Serbia.",ralevicpredrag@gmail.com; m.dobrodolac@gmail.com; mdejan@sf.bg.ac.rs; snezanam@sf.bg.ac.rs,"Dobrodolac, Momcilo/I-3509-2017","Dobrodolac, Momcilo/0000-0001-8112-8329",Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development [TR 36022],"Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",This research was supported by Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development with project TR 36022.,,38,3,3,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

One possible explanation for overbidding is that participants in these experiments do not have a clear perception of probabilities, which causes them to bid aggressively. We test whether displaying probabilities of winning produces systematic differences in bidding. In our design, previous auction outcomes are not revealed across treatments; no significant differences in behavior across treatments are obtained. Our results are in contrast to previous experiments, which suggest that displaying probabilities could reduce the extent of overbidding. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the emergence of specific profiles of businesses or brands at SNS, called brand pages, this research focuses on the brand knowledge that customers develop in the context of SNS and its effect on brand equity. Then, the aim of this paper is to identify the role played by brand knowledge in the process of creating brand equity, as a driver of customer equity and intellectual capital. We suggest that the process of learning from SNS can be influenced by the gratifications that customers and users of SNS perceive. Then, five types of gratifications (purposive, self-discovery, interpersonal connectivity, social enhancement and entertainment) are recognized as learning facilitators that enhance customer knowledge about the brand or brand knowledge. Moreover, brand knowledge has been traditionally recognized as a source or dimension of customer based brand equity and, by extension, can enhance customer equity and intellectual capital. Our study analyses these effects through an empirical investigation of 295 users of SNS and the methodology involves the construction and analysis of a structural equation model. The results confirm the need of using SNS as an intellectual capital tool and provide useful information for firms, including what types of gratifications are more relevant to provide users through the use of SNS.","[Sanchez-Casado, Noelia; Gabriel Cegarra-Navarro, Juan; Tomaseti-Solano, Eva] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Business & Mkt Dept, Cartagena, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Sánchez-Casado, N (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Business & Mkt Dept, Cartagena, Spain.",noelia.sanchez@upct.es; juan.cegarra@upct.es; eva.tomaseti@upct.es,"Cegarra Navarro, Juan Gabriel/L-2291-2014; Sánchez-Casado, Noelia/KBA-0297-2024; Tomaseti, Eva/KCZ-1253-2024","Cegarra Navarro, Juan Gabriel/0000-0003-3371-5670;",,,,,49,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,441,449,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600051,0

After eliminating time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and other confounding factors, sizable returns of about 0.12 log points to applying fluent English skills are found in the general population, while the point estimate for immigrants is 026 log points. Returns to occupational use of other foreign languages are, if anything, restricted to a few specialized occupations. I find evidence that the particularly large returns of immigrants originate in parts of the service sector that are linked to imports and exports. As immigrants do not earn significant wage premia for applying their native language on the job in addition to those for English, any trade-fostering potential of immigrants is more likely to be unlocked by complementary fluency in the two business languages German and English.

There is a hot debate in China now about whether Chinese government should speed up the capital account opening, and we argue against this idea for several reasons. The further liberalization of Chinese capital account should follow an appropriate sequencing. Price-based tools should replace the traditional quantitative methods.

We find that the establishment of a state-level SEZ is associated with an increase in the level of GDP of about 20 %. This finding is confirmed with alternative specifications and in a sub-sample of inland provinces, where the selection of cities to host the zones was based on administrative criteria. The main channel is a positive effect on physical capital accumulation, although SEZ also have a positive effect on total factor productivity and human capital investments.

Subsequently, it has been verbally explained why the main result of the full-employment model would remain valid even in a two-sector specific-factor Harris-Todaro type model with urban unemployment.

This paper draws together established and new information about the contribution that higher education can make to social mobility using a life-course approach, considering differences by family background in terms of university attendance and achievement, as well as occupation and earnings following graduation. We find substantial socio-economic differences at each stage. Young people from poorer backgrounds are, on average, less likely to go to university than their richer peers. Even among the selected group who do go to university, they are less likely to attend the highest status institutions, less likely to graduate, and less likely to achieve the highest degree classes. These differences in degree outcomes contribute to the lower average earnings of graduates from poorer families, but earnings differentials go well beyond those driven purely by degree attainment or institution attended. The evidence strongly suggests that, even after taking these factors into account, graduates from affluent families are more likely to obtain a professional job and to see higher earnings growth in the labour market. We discuss the implications of these findings for the prospects of higher education as a route to greater social mobility.","[Crawford, Claire] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Crawford, Claire] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Gregg, Paul] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Macmillan, Lindsey; Wyness, Gill] UCL Inst Educ, London, England; [Vignoles, Anna] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Wyness, Gill] LSE, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of Warwick; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Bath; University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; University of Cambridge; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Crawford, C (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Crawford, C (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",c.l.crawford@warwick.ac.uk; p.gregg@bath.ac.uk; l.macmillan@ucl.ac.uk; av404@cam.ac.uk; g.wyness@ucl.ac.uk,"Macmillan, Lindsey/B-1840-2016","Macmillan, Lindsey/0000-0003-1262-303X","ESRC [ES/K005804/1, ES/L000105/1]; Higher Education Statistics Agency; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K005804/1, ES/L000105/2, ES/L000105/1, ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L000105/2, ES/L000105/1, ES/M010341/1, ES/K005804/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Higher Education Statistics Agency; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Ken Mayhew and an anonymous referee for very helpful comments on an earlier draft.

Using micro-level Vital Statistics data from 2000 to 2004, we examine mortality gaps of infants born to white, black, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Asian, and Native American mothers. We find that between-group mortality gaps are strongly and consistently (except for Mexican infants) associated with maternal marital status, education, and age, and that these same characteristics are powerful predictors of income and poverty for new mothers in U.S. Census data. Despite these similarities, we document a fundamental difference in the mortality gap for the three high mortality groups: whereas the black-white and Puerto Rican-white mortality gaps mainly occur at low birth weights, the Native American-white gap occurs almost exclusively at higher birth weights. We further examine the one group whose IMR is anomalous compared to the other groups: infants of Mexican mothers die at relatively low rates given their socio-economic disadvantage. We find that this anomaly is driven by lower infant mortality among foreign-born mothers, a pattern found within many racial/ethnic groups. Overall, we conclude that the infant mortality gaps for our six racial/ethnic groups exhibit many commonalities, and these commonalities suggest a prominent role for socio-economic differences.

Prior economic work has shown thresholds arising in convex-concave ecological models that exclude humans may disappear in models of coupled economic-ecological systems when economic agents are included as part of the system. Less well-understood is how this result may depend on the ability of humans to manage complex systems. We examine the role of institutions that condition the available management choices. We find institutional restrictions do not generate non-convexities when the ecological system is well-behaved, but that these restrictions may generate non-convexities when the ecological system is convex-concave. These results are tied to the concept of path controllability, which is when managers have sufficient controls to guide the system across the state space. Path controllability is the dynamic version of the Tinbergen rule, and generally requires separate controls to manage each possible ecological externality. We link the concepts of ecosystem externalities, thresholds, and path controllability to provide new economic insights into problems with the potential for multi stability, and we illustrate the importance of institutions for managing convex-concave systems.

We confirm a significant stock market interaction between the two blocs in which the BRIC drives the GIPS but not vice versa. Thus, the BRIC seems to be more influential on the GIPS than the GIPS on the BRIC. However, this interaction occurs only during downmarket conditions but not during upmarket times. The BRIC pulls down the GIPS during bad times but does not pull them up during good times. These results have significant implications for international policymakers and provide further evidence on the existence of asymmetric causal interactions between financial markets.","[Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser] UAE Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Roca, Eduardo] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",United Arab Emirates University; Griffith University,"Hatemi-J, A (通讯作者)，UAE Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",AHatemi@uaeu.ac.ae,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/AAC-3942-2019","Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/0000-0002-6212-1292",UPAR-UAE University [UPAR-2013(2)],UPAR-UAE University,This work was supported by the UPAR-UAE University [grant number UPAR-2013(2)].,,37,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, a player does not know whether a reciprocal action is intrinsically or strategically motivated. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the relationship between intrinsic and strategic reciprocity by running a two-period repeated trust game. In the strategic treatment the subjects know that they will meet twice, while in the non-strategic treatment they do not know and hence the second period comes as a surprise. We find that subjects anticipate strategic reciprocity, and that intrinsic reciprocity is rewarded. In fact, the total level of cooperation, in which trust is reciprocated, is higher in the non-strategic treatment. This indicates that strategic reciprocity crowds out intrinsic reciprocity: If one takes the repeated game incentives out of the repeated game, one sees more cooperation and higher social surplus.

The framework entails two core claims. First, the positive effects of deregulation on service exports are more prominent in the differentiated or knowledge-intensive service sectors such as insurance, business, and cultural and recreation sectors than those in the standardized ones such as travel and communication sectors. Secondly, the trade-stimulating impacts of deregulation in exporting country are of larger magnitude than those of deregulation in importing country. We then empirically test and prove these arguments using the Hausman Taylor estimation method and the World Bank's STRI dataset. From these results, some policy implications are drawn for service industry development.","[Kang, Gil Seong] Minist Strategy & Finance MOSF, 477 Galmae Ro, Sejong 30109, South Korea; [Won, Yongkul] Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, 163 Seoulsiripdae Ro, Seoul 02504, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Won, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, 163 Seoulsiripdae Ro, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",ksand90@korea.kr; ywon@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

We show that from the downstream firms' point of view, Cournot competition has the advantage of a more monopolistic effect, leading to the setting of a higher price, but has the disadvantage of inducing a lower incentive for the upstream firm to invest. On the other hand, Bertrand competition has the advantage of providing a greater incentive for the upstream firm to invest but has the disadvantage of a more competitive effect, leading to the setting of a lower price. Our main findings are as follows. First, R&D investment level is greater under Bertrand competition than under Cournot competition. Second, from the standpoint of the upstream firmand industry, Bertrand competition is more efficient than Cournot competition. Third, from the standpoint of the downstream firms, Bertrand competition is more efficient than Cournot when investment is sufficiently efficient and products are sufficiently differentiated.","[Lee, DongJoon] Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Choi, Kangsik] Pusan Natl Univ, Pusan, South Korea",Nagoya University of Commerce & Business; Pusan National University,"Choi, K (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Busandaehak Ro 63 Beon Gil 2, Pusan 46241, South Korea.",choipnu@pusan.ac.kr,"Lee, DongJoon/AAA-4773-2022; Choi, Kangsik/I-5231-2013",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H03396, 15K03749]; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044643]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03749, 15H03396] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are especially indebted to three anonymous referees for careful and constructive comments.

It considers a sample of advanced and emerging economies to discuss the four main questions debated in the literature, and addressed in the economic policy arena: the architecture of supervision, the role of the central bank as supervisor, the governance of supervision, and financial supervision vs. the internationalization of finance. Our survey finds that, on each of these issues, theory and practice do not offer clear-cut answers and unambiguous optimal solutions. At the same time, the most promising approach is to tackle financial supervision as a principal-agent problem, where economics and political economy approaches must be used in combination to improve both positive and normative analyses of supervisory governance.","[Masciandaro, Donato] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Masciandaro, Donato] SUERF, Vienna, Austria; [Quintyn, Marc] IMF, Inst Capac Dev, Washington, DC USA",Bocconi University; International Monetary Fund,"Masciandaro, D (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.;Masciandaro, D (通讯作者)，SUERF, Vienna, Austria.",donato.masciandaro@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,133,18,22,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This paper quantitatively investigates the sources of the fluctuations and the impacts of heterogeneous shocks on the conditional volatility of the real effective exchange rate through estimating a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model and an exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model. The variance decomposition and historical decomposition consistently demonstrate that about 90% of the real effective exchange rate fluctuations is attributed to demand shocks, about 9.10% of the fluctuations is due to supply shocks, while only around 0.74% of the variations is because of nominal shocks. Moreover, the historical decomposition reveals that these contributions are time-varying. In addition, the estimated EGRACH model reveals that the conditional volatility of the Korean real effective exchange rate in response to negative shocks is much larger than that in response to positive shocks. Our analysis implies that temporary capital flow regulations and discretionary monetary policies should be combined to stabilize the real effective exchange rate fluctuations in the presence of negative demand shocks.

Although comparable underlying assets are traded in the four markets, our results indicate that no long-run links exist among them. ZCE is by far the most endogenous market, and Euronext/Liffe is the most exogenous one. Finally, the model points to KCBT as the most influential and sensitive wheat market. Our findings indicate that the relative openness of the SAFEX wheat market supports information flows and linkages from KCBT and Euronext/Liffe.

Furthermore, compared with these existing works, the current model sheds more light on the relationship between the trade structure, international competition, productivity dynamics, and economic growth. It also shows the differences between industrial and macroeconomic phenomena, by presenting an example that illustrates how changes in nominal wages, the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect, and the degree of market competition in both countries affect economic growth in the home country.

Since the 1920s, there have been an ongoing set of initiatives undertaken by the League of Nations and the UNCTAD to set international laws on borrowing and lending standards, all of which have failed. To address the unenforceability problem, this paper proposes to use asset backed contracts where the usufruct of the asset transfers to the asset holder. Unlike conventional sovereign borrowing, there are international laws governing asset backed contracts which allow the international assets of a country to be seized. This paper exemplifies on the idea that asset backed contracts, which are also widely practiced in Islamic finance, can provide a solution to unenforceable sovereign debt contracts. The paper focuses specifically on Argentina which has defaulted twice in 13 years. If Argentina had utilized asset backed contracts prior to its 2001 debt default, it would have gained from the following advantages: higher debt-to-GDP ratios, larger welfare gains, lower probability of default and thus lower borrowing costs.

Empirical illustrations using child mortality data from South Africa suggest that consistency between achievement and shortfall improvements in standards of living is not only a matter of theoretical import but is also a problem that can be encountered in practice to a large extent.","[Permanyer, Inaki] Ctr Estudis Demog, Edifici E-2,Campus UAB, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centre d'Estudis Demografics (CED),"Permanyer, I (通讯作者)，Ctr Estudis Demog, Edifici E-2,Campus UAB, Barcelona, Spain.",inaki.permanyer@uab.es,"Permanyer, Inaki/M-3571-2015","Permanyer, Inaki/0000-0002-7051-5144",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Ramon y Cajal Research Grant Program; [ERC-2014-StG-637768]; [ECO2013-46516-C4-1-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Ramon y Cajal Research Grant Program; ;,Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Ramon y Cajal Research Grant Program and research projects ERC-2014-StG-637768 and ECO2013-46516-C4-1-R is gratefully acknowledged.,,21,2,2,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Several mechanisms have been demonstrated to promote group cooperation in linear voluntary contribution experiments - such as communication, costly punishment, and centralized bonuses and fines. However, lab experiments have largely neglected a central obstacle to efficient public good provision: Individuals typically have different, private demands for consumption, hindering the ability of either a central authority or the group members themselves to calculate and enforce the optimal behavior. I adapt the standard public goods game to incorporate heterogeneous incentives and provide an assessment of each mechanism in this richer environment. I find that baseline cooperation is similar to that in the standard linear game. Sanctions are weak and generally ineffective. Communication, however, does promote cooperation, especially when subjects are given the opportunity to reveal their demand or demand is observable. Finally, a centralized fine/bonus scheme is most effective at increasing contributions, but low demanders must pay a fine in equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The current research goes beyond the research on the diffusion of responsibility by investigating the influence of agents' character on principals' moral choices. Study 1 allowed principals to choose an honest or dishonest agent. The results indicated that having the opportunity to choose dishonest agents, regardless of the agents' ultimate intentions for their previous lies, increased the likelihood that principals would subsequently hire the agents to lie on their behalf to harm others. Study 2 was designed to avoid potential self-selection effects by randomly pairing principals and agents; it found that observing agents telling harmful black lies or seemingly harmless white lies led to increased immoral actions by their principals. Our results contribute to the literatures on moral diffusion and principal-agent relationships by revealing some of the inherent dynamics in the principal-agent moral interactions.

Network connections introduce the possibility of cascading failures due to an exogenous or endogenous attack depending on the profile of security investments by the agents. We provide a tractable decomposition of individual payoffs into an own effect and an externality, which also enables us to characterize individual investment incentives recursively (by considering the network with one agent removed at a time). Using this decomposition, we provide characterization of equilibrium and socially optimal investment levels as a function of the structure of the network, highlighting the role of a new set of network centrality measures in shaping the levels of equilibrium and optimal investments. When the attack location is endogenized (by assuming that the attacker chooses a probability distribution over the location of the attack in order to maximize damage), similar forces still operate, but now because greater investment by an agent shifts the attack to other parts of the network, the equilibrium may involve too much investment relative to the social optimum.

We have assembled a novel data set, where information on political institutions for northern central Italian cities between 1000 and 1300 is matched with detailed information on the earthquakes that occurred in the area and period of interest. Exploiting the panel structure of the data, we document that the occurrence of an earthquake retarded institutional transition from autocratic regimes to self-government (the commune) in cities where the political and the religious leaders were the same person (episcopal see cities), but not in cities where political and religious powers were distinct (non-episcopal see cities). Such differential effect holds for destructive seismic episodes and for events that were felt by the population but did not cause any material damage to persons or objects. Ancillary results show that seismic events provoked a positive and statistically significant differential effect on the construction and further ornamentation of religious buildings between episcopal and non-episcopal see cities. Our findings are consistent with the idea that earthquakes, interpreted in the Middle Ages as manifestation of the will and outrage of God, represented a shock to people's religious beliefs and, as a consequence, enhanced the ability of political-religious leaders to restore social order after a crisis relative to the emerging communal institutions. This interpretation is supported by historical evidence.","[Belloc, Marianna] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; CESifo, Munich, Germany; Univ Messina, Messina, Italy; CSEF, London, England; CNRS, Paris, France; Sci Po, Paris, France",Sapienza University Rome; Ifo Institut; University of Messina; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Belloc, M (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",,"Drago, Francesco/H-7563-2019",,EIEF,EIEF,"We thank the editor (Robert Barro) and four anonymous referees for comments that greatly have improved the article.

Evidence from China,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political resource curse; Land revenue windfalls; Promotion; Signaling; Corruption; China,ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; CORRUPTION; STATE; COMPETITION; FOUNDATIONS; INCENTIVES; TURNOVER; LEADERS; POLICY,"By analyzing a panel on the political turnovers of 4390 county leaders in China during 1999-2008, we find that the revenue windfalls accrued to these officials from land sales have undermined the effectiveness of the promotion system for government officials. Instead of rewarding efforts made to boost GDP growth, promotion is positively correlated with signaling efforts, and with corruption. The robust positive relationship between land revenue windfalls and political turnover, or specifically promotion, suggests that those who are politically connected to their superiors and those beyond the prime age for promotion are the primary beneficiaries. The case for corruption is substantiated by the evidence inferred from anti-corruption crackdowns, which reveals that the additional effect of land revenue on political turnover and size of bureaucracy (a proxy for corruption) decreases significantly in crackdowns but that land revenue has no effect on city construction expenditure (a proxy for signaling).

Medical treatment is an example of a credence good: only the physician knows the appropriate treatment, the patient does not. Even after a consultation, the patient is not sure whether he received the right treatment or whether he was perhaps overtreated. We find that with insurance, moral hazard looms on both sides of the market: patients consult more often and physicians overtreat more often than in the baseline condition. Competition decreases overtreatment compared to the baseline and patients therefore consult more often. When the two institutions are combined, competition is found to partially offset the adverse effects of insurance: most patients seek treatment, but overtreatment is moderated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To provide a micro foundation for the role of the aggregator, we build a model of multiple issues where newspapers choose their quality on each issue. Our model captures well the main trade-off between the business stealing effect and the readership-expansion effect. We find that the aggregator increases the quality only if the readership-expansion effect is large enough relative to the business-stealing effect. Using a condition obtained from empirical results, we find that the aggregator increases the quality and social welfare, but affects newspapers' profits ambiguously.","[Jeon, Doh-Shin] Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, IDEI, Mfg Tabacs, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Jeon, Doh-Shin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nasr, Nikrooz] Toulouse Sch Econ, Mfg Tabacs, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Jeon, DS (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, IDEI, Mfg Tabacs, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.;Jeon, DS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dohshin.jeon@gmail.com; me@nikrooz.com,,,NET Institute; Jean-Jacques Laffont Digital Chair,NET Institute; Jean-Jacques Laffont Digital Chair,"Jeon: Toulouse School of Economics (GREMAQ, IDEI), Manufacture de Tabacs, 21 Allee de Brienne, 31000, Toulouse, France and Department of Economics, Sungkyunkwan University (e-mail:dohshin.jeon@gmail.com); Nasr: Toulouse School of Economics, Manufacture de Tabacs, 21 Allee de Brienne, 31000, Toulouse, France (e-mail:me@nikrooz.com).

Compliance with commuter tax allowances and the role of evasion spillovers,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tax evasion; Self-reporting; Tax deductions; Spillover effects,ELASTICITIES; ENFORCEMENT,"This paper provides evidence of evasion in the context of a widely used commuter tax allowance, and explores evasion spillovers as a determinant of the individual compliance decision. For this purpose, we exploit discontinuities in the commuter allowance scheme and employ a research design resting on a large panel of individual tax returns. We find that around 30% of all allowance claims are overstated and, consistent with deliberate tax evasion, we observe sharp reactions of taxpayers to thresholds where the allowance discretely jumps to a higher amount. Further, we use variation in job changes to uncover spillover effects from the work environment on the individual compliance decision. These effects appear to be asymmetric: Job changers moving to companies with a higher fraction of cheaters increase their cheating. In contrast, movers to companies with a lower fraction of cheaters tend not to alter their reporting behavior. We provide suggestive evidence that the spillover has more to do with an information environment, but can ultimately not reject other behavioral explanations such as asymmetric persistence of norms.

Countercyclical remittances moderate the decline of households' consumption during recessions. These remittances also are used to finance the startup costs of microenterprises that bolster households' income during economic downturns. We show that the positive income effect from countercyclical remittances also leads to a decrease in salaried labor supply, which generates offsetting upward pressure on wages during recessions and adversely affects the recovery of the economy. Consistent with the microeconomic evidence, the behavior of remittances decisively affects labor force participation and the composition of employment between non-salaried and salaried employment over the business cycle. The model delivers labor market and aggregate cyclical dynamics that are consistent with the Mexican data, including a highly volatile and countercyclical unemployment rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Deeper insights on the issue are provided by examining the inter-relationship between knowledge spillovers from imports and inward FDI. Furthermore, human capital is added to the discussion as one of the appropriability factors for knowledge spillovers, with special focus on its quality-content, using journal publications and patent applications. Applying cointegration estimation method on 20 European countries from 1995 to 2010, the direct effects of FDI-related as well as import-related spillovers on domestic productivity are confirmed. Furthermore, a strong complementary relationship is found between knowledge spillovers through the channels of imports and inward FDI. When considering quality-adjusted human capital, countries with better human capital are found to benefit not only from direct productivity effects, but also from absorption and transmission of international knowledge spillovers through imports and inward FDI. Finally, technological distance with the frontier does not appear to play a role in the absorption of import and FDI related knowledge spillovers.","[Ali, Muhammad; Cantner, Uwe; Roy, Ipsita] Univ Jena, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, Grp I2M, Campusveij 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Southern Denmark,"Ali, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",m.alishuja@yahoo.com,"; Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","Ali, Muhammad/0000-0003-0668-5699; Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X",DFG [RTG 1411],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from DFG RTG 1411 The Economics of Innovative Change.

The program included life-skills and vocational training, as well as intern-ships with private sector employers. Participants were allocated by means of a public lottery. We rely on administrative data on formal employment, employment spells, and earnings, to establish the effects of the program in the short term ( 18 months), but also-exceptionally for programs of this type in Latin America and in developing countries in general-in the medium term ( 33 months) and in the long term ( 48 months). The results indicate sizable gains of about 8 percentage points in formal employment in the short term ( about 32% higher than the control group), although these effects dissipate in the medium and in the long term. Contrary to previous results for similar programs in the region, the effects are substantially larger for men, although they also seem to fade in the long run. Program participants also exhibit earnings about 40% higher than those in the control group, and an analysis of bounds indicates that these gains result from both higher employment levels and higher wages. The detailed administrative records also allow us to shed some light on the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. A dynamic analysis of employment transitions indicates that the program operated through an increase in the persistence of employment rather than from more frequent entries into employment. The earnings effect and the higher persistence of employment suggest that the program was successful in increasing the human capital of participants, although the transient nature of these results may also reflect better matches from a program-induced increase in informal contacts or formal intermediation.","[Alzua, Maria Laura; Cruces, Guillermo; Lopez, Carolina] CEDLAS FCE UNLP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Alzua, Maria Laura; Cruces, Guillermo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cruces, Guillermo] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lopez, Carolina] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Brown University,"Alzúa, ML (通讯作者)，CEDLAS FCE UNLP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Alzúa, ML (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",malzua@cedlas.org; gcruces@cedlas.org; clopez@cedlas.org,,"Cruces, Guillermo/0000-0002-1965-5897",International Youth Foundation; Labor markets for inclusive growth in Latin America project; Canada' s International Development Research Centre (IDRC),International Youth Foundation; Labor markets for inclusive growth in Latin America project; Canada' s International Development Research Centre (IDRC),"We thank Centro de Estudios Distributivos, Laborales y Sociales, Facultad de Ciencias Economicas, Universidad Nacional de La Plata (CEDLAS-FCE-UNLP), Calle 6 N 777, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); and Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA).

Using a two-sector dependent open economy model with intersectoral mobility costs for private capital, we show that public investment generates (i) a nonmonotonic U-shaped adjustment path for the real exchange rate with sharp intertemporal trade-offs and (ii) a crowding-in of private consumption, consistent with stylized facts. The effects of public consumption, however, are in sharp contrast to those of public investment. The effect of government spending on the real exchange rate depends critically on (i) the sectoral composition of public spending, (ii) the underlying financing policy, (iii) the sectoral intensity of private capital in production, (iv) the relative sectoral productivity of public infrastructure, (v) the elasticity of substitution in production, and (vi) intersectoral mobility costs for capital. In deriving these results, we identify conditions under which the predictions of the neoclassical open economy model can be reconciled with empirical regularities. Our results underscore the importance of decoupling the effects of government investment from those of government consumption in understanding the relationship between fiscal policy and the real exchange rate.","[Chatterjee, Santanu] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Mursagulov, Azer] Minist Finance, Baki, Azerbaijan",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",schatt@uga.edu,,,Sarah H.

In particular, their pollution haven behavior becomes more significant when the changes bring greater inter-provincial differences in environmental stringency.","[Lin, Liguo; Sun, Wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Lin, Liguo; Sun, Wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Adv Res, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Lin, Liguo] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Lin, LG; Sun, W (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Lin, LG; Sun, W (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Adv Res, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Lin, LG (通讯作者)，Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",lin.liguo@mail.shufe.edu.cn; 501809625@qq.com,,"Lin, Liguo/0000-0002-2424-9439",EEPSEA; Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics (SUFE); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission,EEPSEA; Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics (SUFE); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission),"The authors thank the anonymous referees and the editor for their comments and suggestions, which improved the paper.

In this way, trends and cycles of aggregate variables can be extracted from data consistently with the macroeconomic theory. A setting of an integrated random walk for the underlying stochastic trends fits the data best. An expansion in government spending can increase nominal fiscal revenue to a certain degree, but the effect is not persistent due to two kinds of crowd-out effects: it crowds out domestic investment; and it pushes up the price of domestic goods and simultaneously crowds out the foreign demand. The shocks to the nominal interest rate, foreign output and the government spending are the three major contributors to the variation of the fiscal revenue cycle.","[Liu, Kai] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Liu, K (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liukeynes@ruc.edu.cn,,"Liu, Kai/0000-0002-9493-4298",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503253]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15AZD004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71503253] and by the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 15AZD004].,,14,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find limited evidence for such a difference for total grant value, but in cases when the applicant is a public entity or the purpose of the project is construction and, therefore, visible to voters and thus may bring about electoral benefits, we do find effects of 16-21%. The decomposition of the effect suggests that favoritism plays a role both in the application and the decision making process as applicants from aligned townships apply in larger numbers and have higher acceptance rates.

For a given bankruptcy system, we explore the total and distributional welfare effects of health insurance mandates compared with the pre-mandate market equilibrium. We consider different combinations of premium subsidies and out-of-insurance penalties, confining attention to budget-neutral policies. We show that when insurance mandates are enforced only through penalties, the efficient take-up level may be incomplete. However, if mandates are also supported with premium subsidies, full insurance coverage is efficient and can also be Pareto improving. Such policies are consistent with the incentive structure for insurance take-up set in the ACA. Pareto improvement is possible because the legal requirement that medical providers dispense acute care on credit, together with the bankruptcy option, yields effective subsidies for medical care utilized by the uninsured. Those subsidy funds, however, can serve the initially uninsured better when they are given as ex ante subsidies on insurance premiums.","[Sorek, Gilad] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Benjamin, David] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Sorek, G (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",gms0014@auburn.edu,,,,,,,23,1,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Thus, it is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and enhance government accountability. However, whether or not adopting such transparency laws improves bureaucratic efficiency remains unexplored. We provide first quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on bureaucratic efficiency. Using panel data on 132 countries from 1990 to 2011, we find that adopting FOI laws, and in particular 'stronger' FOI laws, is associated with an improvement in bureaucratic efficiency, after controlling for self-section bias. FOI laws appear to be more effective in the long run, and if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of non-governmental organization activism, and political competition. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples, and estimation methods.","[Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Cooray, Arusha] Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia; [Cooray, Arusha] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Nottingham Malaysia; Australian National University,"Vadlamannati, KC (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway.",krishna.c.vadlamannati@svt.ntnu.no; Arusha.Cooray@nottingham.edu.my,"Cooray, Arusha/X-1507-2019","Cooray, Arusha/0000-0001-8809-9188; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya/0000-0001-5999-1126",,,,,48,16,17,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Acknowledging this fact, recently, governments in the Asian region individually have been taking effective actions in the form of voluntary targets and policy commitments to improve the production and use of low-carbon technology, such as solar, wind, geo-thermal, and so forth. Nevertheless, the diffusion of these technologies has been through liberalized trade, which has been low compared with trade and investment in other energy intensive sectors. Though effective tariffs are low, non-tariff barriers or behind-the-border constraints are very high. In this exploratory study, the potential for increased exports in low-carbon technology and services under a grand regional coalition, partial regional coalition, and stand alone scenarios is studied. We find that production, trade, and investment in renewable energy technologies are very low regionally. There is a large gap between the demand for and the supply of low-carbon energy technology and associated pollution abatement services. Behind-the-border constraints that exist within the exporting country, such as poor infrastructure and inefficient institutions, create this gap between actually realized and potentially possible exports. This supply gap provides an opportunity for those emerging Asian economies, which have the potential to contribute to the manufacturing of such technologies individually and collectively pooling their physical and human capital.","[Anbumozhi, Venkatachalam] Econ Res Inst South East Asia, Sentral Senayan 2,6th Floor Jalan Asia Afrika 8, Gelora Bung Karno 10270, Senayan Jakarta, Indonesia; [Kalirajan, Kaliappa] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Kalirajan, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",kaliappa.kalirajan@anu.edu.au,"Kalirajan, Kaliappa/X-5293-2019",,,,,,23,1,1,1,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We find two interesting new results. First, the financial integration measure based on portfolio equity and FDI stocks (GEQ turns out to have a large impact on top income shares, suggesting that the channel through which globalization affects income concentration is through FDI/equity flows.

Because the self-purification capacity of the environmental system is limited, a strong time effect is witnessed. Time lag and spatial spillover need to be considered to mitigate the effect of industrial pollution. Using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR), this paper decomposes the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of industrial pollution in China. Results show a significant spatio-temporality in the evolution of the provincial-level industrial pollution since 2007. As the major participants, state-owned enterprises play a leading role in the state economy and greatly affect pollutant emissions. In the central and eastern regions, an increasing proportion of state-owned output values is related to the decrease of industrial pollution emissions, whereas western regions witness an opposite trend. Emissions charge plays a positive role in curbing the emission from industrial enterprises in the central and western regions.

Two groups of children are considered: those born in the US (native born) and foreign-born children who immigrated prior to age 14 (the 1.5 generation). The analyses are conducted overall, within genders, and within racial and ethnic groups. Bilingualism is more prevalent if the parents are foreign born, less proficient in English, of the same ancestry (linguistic) group, and if the child lives in an ethnic (linguistic) concentration area. Although the effects are relatively smaller, a foreign-born grandparent living in the household increases child bilingualism, while a higher level of parental education tends to decrease it. Children of Asian and Hispanic origin are more likely to be bilingual than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts.","[Chiswick, Barry R.; Gindelsky, Marina] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Chiswick, Barry R.] IZA Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany",George Washington University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Gindelsky, M (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",brchis@gwu.edu; marina_g@gwu.edu,,,,,,,13,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We show that the rise in firing costs induced an increase in the capital-labour ratio and a decline in total factor productivity in small firms relative to larger firms. Our results indicate that capital deepening was more pronounced at the low-end of the capital distribution - where the reform hit arguably harder - and among firms endowed with a larger amount of liquid resources. We also find that stricter Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) raised the share of high-tenure workers, which suggests a complementarity between firm-specific human capital and physical capital in moderate EPL environments.","[Pica, Giovanni] Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo 2, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Milan,"Pica, G (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo 2, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",gpica@unisa.it,"Messina, Julian/ABE-9287-2021","Messina, Julian/0000-0002-3635-499X",Europlace Institut of Finance,Europlace Institut of Finance,"We are grateful to seminar participants at the University of Milan, the University of Naples Federico II, the 2012 EALE conference, 2013 EEA conference, 2013 SIE congress, the XII Brucchi Luchino workshop and the Italian Treasury Ministry for useful suggestions.

The question of the distributional impact of VAT design has received much attention in the literature. While VAT is a general equilibrium policy, its impact has been primarily considered in partial equilibrium contexts. However, the VAT is not only paid by final consumers in developing countries. VAT becomes a reporting burden for producers with exemptions and a financial burden if refunds of VAT credits are not timely. In this paper, we use a two-step modelling procedure -a computable general equilibrium (CGE), followed by a micro-simulation-to analyse the distributional and economic impact of various VAT designs for Niger. Our simulations show that while a flat rate is best for economic efficiency, a higher statutory VAT rate (at around five percentage points) with exemptions for staple foods, has the greatest potential for poverty reduction. When the two objectives are combined, a multiple rate is the best option if VAT credits are refunded. By using a disaggregated macro-micro framework, we illustrate the importance of capturing the specificities of VAT design to measure its distributional and economic impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the past three decades, during which population pressures contributed to substantial labor flows from neighboring countries into the United States and Europe, and contrast them with the coming three decades, which will see sharp reductions in labor-supply growth in Latin America but not in Africa or much of the Middle East. Using a gravity-style empirical model, we examine the contribution of changes in relative labor-supply to bilateral migration in the 2000s and then apply this model to project future bilateral flows based on long-run UN forecasts of working-age populations in sending and receiving countries. Because the Americas are entering an era of uniformly low population growth, labor flows across the Rio Grande are projected to slow markedly. Europe, in contrast, will face substantial demographically driven migration pressures from across the Mediterranean for decades to come. Although these projected inflows would triple the first-generation immigrant stocks of larger European countries between 2010 and 2040, they would still absorb only a small fraction of the 800-million-person increase in the working-age population of Sub-Saharan Africa that is projected to occur over this period.","[Hanson, Gordon; McIntosh, Craig] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hanson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gohanson@ucsd.edu; ctmcintosh@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,40,36,38,0,6,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

First, a framework is developed to quantify monetary discretion and the corresponding behaviors it causes in inflation and growth. Second, using Pakistan's case, which is an example of a typical discretionary monetary policy strategy, not only the direct long and short-term effects of monetary discretion on inflation and real growth but its indirect effects on the latter via inflation are ascertained. In the long run monetary discretion is significantly biased against inflation without creating real growth gains and there is no trade-off between discretion-induced inflation and real growth. The short-term direct impact of monetary discretion on inflation and real growth is mixed both positive and negative with varying lags; however, the gains induced by monetary discretion do not outweigh the losses it induced. Moreover, the indirect impact of monetary discretion via inflation on real growth is significantly adverse. On balance, there is nothing to gain from monetary discretion and therefore the efficacy of the policy of its active use for possible growth gains at the expense of price stability warrants re-thinking.

The main findings support the positive impact of disposal income on tax evasion, while unemployment rate has a negative impact. Among the interest rate effect models, if policy-makers want to hinder the extension of tax evasion, they should reduce the interest rate. Furthermore, government not only applies fiscal policy but also applies monetary policy for improving tax evasion. In our regional effect model, we have found evidence on a positive impact of the demographic structure variables on tax evasion except social expenditure of local government. We have also found clear evidence on the positive impact in South and East areas on tax evasion in the regional effect model.

However, the fractal market hypothesis disagrees, asserting that long-term memory can persist in the market. To understand why this conflict exists, we propose a method to explore the long-term market trend using the local Hurst exponent and seek to obtain the extra yield. Performance is evaluated by using both a simulation and the high frequency 5-min data and the daily data. The result indicates that the model performs well with the uni-fractal series in the simulation. However, the model shows limited predictive abilities with the data from the real market due to the multi-fractal characteristics. Although the long-term trends persist in the markets and can be identified with statistical significance, traders cannot beat the market because of the time-varying feature and because the strength of long-term memory is not strong enough to cover the transaction costs. The result reconciles the long-term auto correlations with EMH in a quantitative manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such a transformation of the labor skill composition should bring about macroeconomic effects such as wage compression, sectoral shifts and high skill unemployment, unless compensatory mechanisms exist. Relying on decomposition techniques, we argue that skill biased technological change (SBTC) occurred in Malaysia in recent years, and permitted unemployment figures to remain low and skill premia not to sink. We also develop a dynamic general equilibrium model, simulating the absence of SBTC and limit the number of admissions to higher education. The results are fed to a microsimulation module. They show that the reduction in wage inequalities could have been substantially more important had SBTC not been present. Furthermore, they suggest that the open-door higher education policy has contributed heavily to a reduction in wage inequalities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We attempt to find out if cointegration matters for forecasting accuracy by examining the relation between the stationarity and size of the forecasting error. Results based on three macroeconomic models of exchange rates do not provide strong support for the proposition that cointegration matters for forecasting accuracy. The simulation results show that while stationary errors tend to be smaller than non-stationary errors, this is not a universal rule. Irrespective of the presence or absence of cointegration, none of the three models can outperform the random walk in out-of-sample forecasting, which means that cointegration cannot solve the Meese-Rogoff puzzle.","[Moosa, Imad A.] RMIT, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Vaz, John J.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Monash University,"Vaz, JJ (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",john.vaz@monash.edu,,"Vaz, John/0000-0003-2781-8227",,,,,15,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It addresses the main differences between the orthodox, heterodox and MMT approaches to monetary theory while reconciling endogenous money theory with the state money approach. By emphasising the symmetry between how banks create money as they finance private spending and how the government creates money when it finances its own spending, we clarify some of the misconceptions surrounding MMT while showing that it is more consistent with the facts of experience. Furthermore, we argue that MMT's insistence that government spending or lending must precede bond sales is consistent with the Keynesian emphasis on effective demand as the driving force behind income and saving. We delve into MMT's implications for monetary and fiscal policy, with a particular focus on the eurozone. We conclude our paper by discussing two proposals of 'monetary cranks': narrow banking and government issue of debt-free money. This allows us to re-emphasise MMT's views on the nature of money.","[Nersisyan, Yeva] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Wray, L.

It suggests that domestic asset accumulation is the priority in developing countries, while there are three motives for accumulating foreign assets; inter-generational transfer, temporary 'parking' of funds, and stabilisation. The paper argues that the first of these is inappropriate for low income countries. The second is required if it is difficult to absorb extra spending in the domestic economy and takes time to build up domestic investment. The third is important, and depends on the extent to which the economy has other ways of adjusting to shocks.","[Venables, Anthony J.; Wills, Samuel E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Venables, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England.",tony.venables@economics.ox.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023",,AERC; BP; ESRC [ES/K0093031/1]; ESRC [ES/K009303/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K009303/1] Funding Source: researchfish,AERC; BP; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Paper written for AERC conference, Arusha 2015.

TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making technique similar to data envelopment analysis, which ranks a finite set of units based on the minimisation of distance from an ideal point and the maximisation of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Angolan banks using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature. Then, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to cost structure have a prominent negative impact on efficiency. Findings also indicate that the Angolan banking market would benefit from higher level of competition between institutions.","[Wanke, Peter] COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, Ctr Studies Logist Infrastruct & Management, Rua Paschoal Lemme 355, BR-20520120 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Joao Macanda, Nkanga Pedro] Univ Agostinho Neto, Fac Econ, Luanda, Angola; [Barros, Carlos] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal",University Agostinho Neto; Universidade de Lisboa,"Wanke, P (通讯作者)，COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, Ctr Studies Logist Infrastruct & Management, Rua Paschoal Lemme 355, BR-20520120 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",peter@coppead.ufrj.br,"Wanke, Peter/G-3184-2010","Wanke, Peter/0000-0003-1395-8907",Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation,Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation,Please acknowledge this Research made with support of Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.,,92,11,12,3,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Overall, I find that higher levels of corruption and a large informal economy are generally associated with poor economic outcomes. However, only the size of the informal economy has a statistically significant effect. This effect is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls and fixed effects, as well as an instrumental variable analysis. Further, these effects are large in magnitude. For example, a one standard deviation increase in the share of total employees that are informally employed explains a decrease in GDP per-capita of about 18%.

This period of growth resurgence, coined as Africa Rising, witnessed many countries having an annual average GDP growth rate that exceeded 5%. This phenomenon lifted the boats of resource-rich, resource-poor and some fragile countries. It was supported partly by a very favourable external environment and an improvement of institutional and macroeconomic policy frameworks. The goal of this paper is two-fold first, we examine the resilience of SSA over the past 20 years by assessing whether the growth acceleration of 1995-2008 (relative to 1974-1994) was accompanied by improved structural and macroeconomic indicators. Second, we evaluate whether African economies have replenished liquidity and policy buffers during the post-global financial crisis (2009-14 versus 2003-08). We find that improved macroeconomic frameworks allowed some African nations to withstand the 2008-09 crisis and implement countercyclical policies. However, restricted macroeconomic policy space during the post-crisis period may limit the region's response to current external headwinds (end of commodity super cycle and normalisation of US monetary policy) and growing macroeconomic vulnerabilities (rising fiscal deficits and external imbalances).","[Calderon, Cesar; Boreux, Sebastien] World Bank, Africa Reg AFRCE, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Calderon, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Africa Reg AFRCE, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ccalderon@worldbank.org,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

To address this question and overcome the potential simultaneity of religious activity and political attitudes, we exploit exogenous variation in the start date of the Selichot (Forgiveness), a period in which many Jews, including nonadherents, take part in an intense prayer schedule. Using a two-wave survey, we find that an increase in the salience of religiosity leads to the adoption of more hard-line positions against a land-for-peace compromise. Examining several potential mechanisms for this attitudinal shift, our evidence points to the impact of the intensified prayer period on adherents' tolerance for risk.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel; Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Tel Aviv University,"Rigbi, O (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",origbi@bgu.ac.il,"RIGBI, OREN/F-1690-2012","Rigbi, Oren/0009-0001-4035-0107; Cohen-Zada, Danny/0000-0003-2336-1629",European Community [249232]; Israeli Science Foundation [1255/10]; Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel,European Community; Israeli Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel,"For helpful comments, we thank Leif Danziger, Liran Einav, Mridu Prabal Goswami, Shigeo Hirano, and David Voas.

Using a sample of 38 countries for the period 1996-2009, we find a positive relation between the perception of happiness and the size of the mutual fund industry. Freedom of choice, a feature of countries that are dominated by individualistic behaviours and values, has a positive impact on the development of the industry. We also explain the positive relation between individuals' preference for private ownership and the development of mutual funds. Moreover, we prove that the industry is larger in developed countries with greater stock market liquidity, with low ratios of remittance inflows to GDP, and in which the industry is older.","[Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Tatu-Cornea, Delia] European Business Sch Paris, Paris, France; [Tulbure, Narcis] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragota, IM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela.dragota@fin.ase.ro; deliacornea@ebs-paris.com; narcis.tulbure@fin.ase.ro,"Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/C-6609-2011","Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/0000-0002-4864-7503","Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding [project PNII-IDEI] [1831/2008]; CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network [Regional Research Competition VIII-61]","Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding [project PNII-IDEI](Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); CERGE-EI Foundation under a program of the Global Development Network [Regional Research Competition VIII-61]","This work was supported by Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding [project PNII-IDEI, code 1831/2008].

Constrained exporters charge higher prices than do unconstrained firms that export to the same product-destination market. This pattern is the result of a two-fold effect. Distressed firms pass on their higher production costs through prices. However, they also charge higher mark-ups. We explain this evidence referring to models in which rival firms produce different brands of the same product for customers with significant switching costs and producers face capital market imperfections when they need external financing. Our empirical investigations corroborate this explanation: price gaps are higher when switching costs or other forms of demand rigidity are expected to be more relevant.","[Secchi, Angelo] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Pisa, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy",Paris School of Economics; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Trento; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Tamagni, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Pisa, Italy.",f.tamagni@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388; Tomasi, Chiara/0000-0002-1962-7351","French National Research Agency [ANR-10-LABX-93-01]; Marie Curie Program Grant COFUND Provincia Autonoma di Trento; Institute for New Economic Thinking, INET inaugural grant [220]","French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Marie Curie Program Grant COFUND Provincia Autonoma di Trento(Marie Curie Actions); Institute for New Economic Thinking, INET inaugural grant","The present work has been possible thanks to a research agreement between the Italian Statistical Office (ISTAT) and the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.

Higher volatility encourages the incumbent supplier to adopt an accommodation strategy rather than a pure exclusion strategy. When volatility is above a threshold, the incumbent always chooses accommodation regardless of the expected size of the entrant's innovation. And since an accommodation strategy merely redistributes surplus without blocking efficient entry, it may not warrant a prohibition of exclusivity contracts by the antitrust authorities.","[Stefanadis, Christodoulos] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Stefanadis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",cstefana@unipi.gr,"Stefanadis, Christodoulos/AAA-4102-2020; Stefanadis, Christodoulos/ABH-2232-2020","Stefanadis, Christodoulos/0000-0001-5974-6454",,,,,16,4,4,0,6,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

A test of the relationship between risk aversion and cognitive ability,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Decision making; Risk; Cognitive ability; Hypothetical bias,PREFERENCES; REFLECTION,"A body of literature based primarily on experiments suggests that cognitive ability and risk aversion are inversely related. In contrast, studies using observational data often find that lower ability, or lower income, is positively related to risky behaviors. One potential explanation for the conflicting conclusions is that experimental studies tend to measure risk attitudes by presenting subjects with choices between an option with a certain outcome and an option characterized by risk, which requires computation and, hence, cognitive effort. Additionally, these studies have primarily relied on the use of hypothetical choices. I use an experiment to test whether this frequently-used method of measuring risk preferences is biased toward finding results that indicate that individuals with lower cognitive ability are more risk averse than individuals with higher cognitive ability. I find that the inverse relationship between risk aversion and cognitive ability is not robust and that high-ability subjects may misrepresent their preferences when they face hypothetical choices. Also, similar to earlier studies, I find that low-ability subjects are more likely to make errors and show that the availability of a certain option reduces errors for the lowest ability subjects.

The estimation results show that, first, global, contagion and domestic factors are all significantly associated with both loan-led surge and stop episodes. Second, domestic factors are more relevant to stops than to surges and are associated more strongly with episodes in emerging countries than with those in advanced countries. Third, global risk and domestic growth shock are most consistent and important in predicting both types of episodes. Fourth, financial linkage is the most important contagion channel in the occurrence of loan-led episodes. Fifth, capital control is not a useful tool for avoiding either type of episode and may actually increase their likelihood. Finally, stops in emerging countries are strongly related to macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation, current account balance, net foreign assets, real exchange rate, and previous occurrence of surge episodes. Our results strongly suggest that emerging countries with lower institutional quality levels are more likely to experience both surges and stops.","[Baek, Seung-Gwan] Hongik Univ, Sch Econ, 94 Wausan Ro, Seoul 121791, South Korea; [Song, Chi-Young] Kookmin Univ, Dept Commerce & Finance, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 136702, South Korea",Hongik University; Kookmin University,"Song, CY (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Dept Commerce & Finance, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",sbaek@hongik.ac.kr; cysong@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Song, Chi-Young/0000-0001-9971-9784",Korea Institute of Finance,Korea Institute of Finance,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees, Chong-Ook Rhee, Yongkul Won and seminar participants in 89th Annual Conference of the Western Economic Association International and 73rd Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of International Economies for their helpful suggestions.

In contrast, we obtain a domestic merger outcome whenever firms are sufficiently heterogeneous (in terms of productive efficiency and product differentiation). A domestic merger unfolds a wage-unifying effect which limits the union's ability to extract rents. When products become sufficiently homogeneous, then cross-border mergers are the unique equilibrium. However, they may be either between firms with the same cost efficiency or with different cost efficiencies. Social welfare is never higher under a domestic merger outcome than under a cross-border merger outcome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Convex adjustment costs to capital have become a standard tool to deal with this. However, current microeconomic investment models feature non-convex adjustment costs as the dominant friction. This paper analyzes fixed costs to capital adjustment in a two-country business cycle model and finds that fixed costs unlike in closed economies dampen aggregate investment volatilities. Moreover, convex adjustment costs can serve as a stand-in for these fixed adjustment costs when one is interested in aggregate dynamics only. Yet, the mapping between fixed and quadratic adjustment costs co-depends on other model parameters. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These outcomes are the foundation of the widely-used sorting mechanism in trade models with firm heterogeneity. We also find that the substitution between FECs and productivity in determining export decisions is weaker for firms with higher productivity.

Utilizing a model with two types of households examined in the optimal taxation literature, this paper analyzes the impact of green spending, the properties of optimal tax rates, and the optimal provision of the public good. We derive a modified greened version of the Samuelson rule, that is, the optimal provision of the public good in connection with environmental sustainability. Our results indicate that the overall effect of green spending measured in terms of government revenue is subject to several factors such as the influence of green spending on environmental sustainability, the cost of green spending, pollution effects, and so on. To determine the optimal provision of public goods, the aforementioned factors have to be taken into account. For instance, if the pollution effect is stronger, the individual marginal effective tax rate and the commodity tax rate on the polluting good will increase to discourage the demand for consuming polluting commodities.","[Chen, Yunmin] Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lin, Brian Chi-ang] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Publ Finance, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Anderson, John E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Lin, BCA (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Publ Finance, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",calin@nccu.edu.tw,"Anderson, John/AAN-1893-2020; Chen, Yunmin/GWM-6731-2022","Anderson, John/0000-0002-4944-7300; Lin, Brian/0000-0002-3795-7418",Taiwan National Science Council (NSC) [NSC 96-2415-H-00-016-MY3],"Taiwan National Science Council (NSC)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The second author is grateful to the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC) for financial support under Grant No. NSC 96-2415-H-00-016-MY3.

But recently in many countries, interest rates have been pushed down close to the lower bound, limiting the ability of policy-makers to accommodate shocks, even with flexible exchange rates. This paper argues that when the zero bound constraint on nominal interest rates is binding and policy lacks an effective 'forward guidance' mechanism, a flexible exchange rate system may be inferior to a single currency area. With monetary policy constrained by the zero bound, a flexible exchange rate exacerbates the impact of shocks. Remarkably, this may hold true even if only a subset of countries are constrained by the zero bound, and other countries optimally adjust their interest rate targets. For a regime of multiple currencies to dominate a single currency in a zero bound environment, it is necessary to have effective forward guidance in monetary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is unlikely that the international community will move beyond the current consensus based on humanitarian principles and recognize that the free flow of people is a right, on the same level as trade and capital liberalization. At the same time, much of the criticism of migration policies is misplaced: efforts should be focused on improving the implementation of existing policies and fine-tune these policies in relation to entrance and integration, preferably in cooperation with the country of origin. The G20 should play a leading role in facilitating such coordination, also taking into account the increasing importance of South-South migration (such as the migration of Chinese citizens to Africa).","[Goldstein, Andrea] NOMISMA, Bologna, Italy; [Venturini, Alessandra] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Venturini, Alessandra] European Univ Inst, Migrat Policy Ctr, Florence, Italy",University of Turin; European University Institute,"Goldstein, A (通讯作者)，NOMISMA, Bologna, Italy.",andrea.goldstein@nomisma.it; alessandra.venturini@unito.it,"venturini, alessandra/AAR-2121-2020",,,,,,34,0,0,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2016,24,4,,,SI,,93,110,,10.1111/cwe.12169,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QM,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957500007,0

This paper studies cognitive performance in a high-stakes competitive environment. The analysis takes advantage of a natural experiment that randomly allocates different emotional states across professional subjects competing in a cognitive task. The setting is a chess match where two players play an even number of chess games against each other alternating the color of the pieces. White pieces confer an advantage for winning a chess game and who starts the match with these pieces is randomly decided. The theoretical analysis shows that in this setting there is no rational reason why winning frequencies should be better than 50-50 in favor of the player drawing the white pieces in the first game. Yet, we find that observed frequencies are about 60-40. Differences in performance are also stronger when the competing subjects are more similar in cognitive skills. We conclude that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that psychological elements affect cognitive performance in the face of experience, competition, and high stakes.

We apply viability theory to Judd's dynamic tax model [The welfare cost of factor taxation in a perfect-foresight model, Journal of Political Economy 95(4), 675-709 (1987)] to identify which economic states today are sustainable under only slightly constrained tax-rate adjustments in the future, when the dynamic budget constraint and the consumers' transversality condition at infinity are satisfied. We call the set of such states the economic viability kernel. In broad terms, knowledge of the viability kernel can tell the planner what economic objectives are achievable and assist in the choice of suitable controls to realize them. We observe that high consumption levels can only be sustained when capital is abundant and, unsurprisingly, that a very high consumption economy lies outside such kernels, at least for annual tax-adjustment levels limited by 20 percentage points. Furthermore, we notice that by and large the sizes of the kernel slices do not diminish as the tax rate rises; hence high-taxation economies are not necessarily more prone to explode, or implode, than their low-taxation counterparts. In fact, higher tax rates are necessary to keep many consumption choices viable, especially when capital approaches the constraint-set boundaries.","[Krawczyk, J.

By defining product complexity a la Hausmann and Hidalgo (2009), we find that a higher complexity level of a firm's product basket is associated to a reduction of its output fluctuations. This evidence is robust to the control for omitted variables, sample selection, and to the use of alternative volatility and complexity indicators. Across similar firms, active in different sectors and regions, both technological factors and product market conditions explain the effect of complexity on volatility. However, within narrowly defined sectors and locations, the complexity-volatility nexus fully reflects the role of the human capital content of firms' product baskets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our experiment focuses on two stochastic audit schemes for enforcing regulatory compliance. In the Random Audit mechanism firms are randomly chosen for inspection. In the Tournament Audit mechanism the probability of inspection increases with the degree of estimated under-reporting. To study the effects of social information, the experiment varies the observability of identity, output, and compliance decisions. Optimal output is theoretically independent of the auditing scheme, but equilibrium reporting is higher under the Tournament mechanism than Random auditing. Experimental findings are broadly consistent with the theoretical predictions for reporting, but deviate modestly for output. In particular, we find that average output is lower and reporting is higher in the Tournament treatment compared to the Random Audit treatment. At the individual level, a majority of participants misreported in most periods. Social observability does not affect output or reporting significantly in either of the audit treatments.

The downstream monopolist can offer the two goods either on an a la carte basis or as a bundle. We use this model to understand the incentives to bundle and the welfare properties of bundling in a two-sided market framework. We also contribute to the ongoing debate on a la carte pricing in the TV industry, where the two upstream firms can be viewed as two rival TV networks and the downstream monopolist as a cable operator.

We find strong evidence against the existence of a limited set of representative agents, which in turn seems to empirically support the need for (macroeconomic) models using a continuum of heterogeneous agents.","[Cherchye, Laurens] Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, E Sabbelaan 53, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; [Crawford, Ian] Inst Fiscal Studies, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Crawford, Ian] Univ Oxford, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [De Rock, Bram] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP 114, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [De Rock, Bram] Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP 114, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Vermeulen, Frederic] Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Vermeulen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",laurens.cherchye@kuleuven-kortrijk.be; ian.crawford@economics.ox.ac.uk; bderock@ulb.ac.be; frederic.vermeulen@kuleuven.be,,"De Rock, Bram/0000-0002-5114-1386; Cherchye, Laurens/0000-0003-3766-2449","European Research Council (ERC) [614221, 263707]; FWO (Research Fund-Flanders); ESRC Centre for the Macroeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies [RES-544-28-5001]; BELSPO; Research Fund KU Leuven [STRT/12/001]; FWO [G057314N]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish; European Research Council (ERC) [263707] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); FWO (Research Fund-Flanders)(FWO); ESRC Centre for the Macroeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); BELSPO(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Research Fund KU Leuven(KU Leuven); FWO(FWO); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),Laurens Cherchye gratefully acknowledges the European Research Council (ERC) for his Consolidator Grant 614221.

Relying on theoretical characterizations derived from an economic model of lifetime behaviour, we estimate a dynamic probit model with correlated random effects using longitudinal data to allow for a dynamic structure. The model is applied to a panel of married women drawn from the 1997-2002 French Labour Force surveys in order to represent their participation behaviour. It is estimated by maximum simulated likelihood. Our results show that women's decisions to go out to work are characterized by significant state dependence, unobserved heterogeneity and negative serial correlation in the transitory error component. In addition, we find that the presence of young children in a woman's household reduces her labour participation, but unequally according to their age and number. As expected, educational level has a positive impact on women's participation. Last, a rise in the husband's wage is found to raise female participation initially and to lower it subsequently. This empirical finding suggests that leisure may not systematically be a normal good, contrary to what is frequently assumed in the literature.","[Collet, R.] Univ Paris 01, CRIDUP, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Legros, D.] Univ Burgundy, Lab Econ Dijon LEDi, Dijon, France",Universite de Bourgogne,"Legros, D (通讯作者)，Univ Burgundy, Lab Econ Dijon LEDi, Dijon, France.",diego.legros@u-bourgogne.fr,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We first present a theoretical framework in which individuals randomly search for partners to exchange ideas, but that the returns to finding a partner are heterogeneous. In particular, some knowledge is more dependent on interpersonal exchange and most productive when shared with similar individuals. In this manner, we propose that agglomerative environments favor individuals with knowledge that is typically associated with soft skills where creativity and informal networking are important. We test this prediction using the most recent sample of the American Community Survey (ACS) in which college graduates are asked about their undergraduate major. Controlling for demographic and regional productivity effects, we find that the urban wage premium varies considerably across majors. In line with the predictions of our model, people with non STEM majors appear to benefit more from locating within a city. in the spirit of our results for majors, we also find that terminal degrees associated with the mastery of any existing cannon of knowledge such as a J.D. or M.D. experience a smaller urban wage premium.

We analyze the 2009 Recovery Act via instrumental variables using a new instrument, the spending done by federal agencies that were not instructed to target funds towards harder hit regions. We find a moderate positive effect on jobs created/saved (i.e., the extensive margin) and also a significant increase in wage payments to workers whose job status was safe without Recovery Act funds (i.e., the intensive margin). Our point estimates imply that roughly one-half of the wage payments resulting from the act were paid at the intensive margin. To provide a theoretical underpinning for the estimates, we build a micro-founded dynamic model in which a firm meets new government demand with a combination of new hiring and increasing existing workers' average hours. Faced with hiring costs and an overtime premium, the firm responds by increasing hours along both margins. Our model analysis also provides insight into how government spending policy should be structured to lower the cost of generating new jobs. Finally, we catalogue survey evidence from Recovery Act fund recipients that reinforces the importance of the intensive labor margin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Knight, J",,,,"Knight, John",,,The Societal Cost of China's Rapid Economic Growth,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LIFE SATISFACTION; INCOME; DECENTRALIZATION; INCENTIVES; TURNOVER,"In China, political control is centralized and economic management is decentralized. This gives rise to a serious principal-agent problem, in which the agents are often better informed than the principal. China also has a semi-marketized economy involving much state intervention. This intervention serves both a political and an economic function. It enables the Communist Party to remain in political command and generates formidable patronage resources. It also provides the policy instruments, including incentive structures for officialdom, to maintain a developmental state. The combination of economic decentralization and a semi-marketized economy creates a problem of weak accountability and a breeding ground for rent-seeking and corruption. For a quarter of a century China's leadership gave overwhelming priority to the objective of achieving rapid economic growth. This policy was viewed as providing political legitimacy and securing the best protection against social instability. It is argued that the leadership was able to solve the principal-agent problem in its pursuit of economic growth. By contrast, the solution to the principal-agent problem failed in other respects, giving rise to societal costs. Little attention was paid to the dramatic socioeconomic changes-including rising inequality and economic insecurity, environmental degradation, mass migration, rent seeking, and corruption-which accompanied economic growth and posed new challenges. It is argued that these changes help to explain the failure of life satisfaction scores to rise over the two decades from 1990-2010. They can also help to explain the rise in indicators of social instability over that period. It is to be hoped that the new leadership's current anti-corruption campaign, together with its declared policy intention to reduce state economic intervention and increase reliance on competitive markets, will strengthen deterrence and weaken opportunities for rent seeking and corruption. The paper carries the implication that China's economy cannot be well understood except through the lens of political economy.","[Knight, John] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Knight, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",john.knight@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,5,5,2,42,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Unsurprisingly, policy-makers are now examining ways to encourage greater levels of consumer participation to improve capacity utilisation and outcomes for consumers. We find that consumers are likely to be better off by responding to retail, rather than wholesale generation, pricing. Retail prices reflect potential savings across all supply chain costs including the primary driver of recent price increases, capital-intensive networks.

The case of Fiji,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,J-curve phenomenon; Devaluation; Fiji; Trade balance,J-CURVE; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; COINTEGRATION,"A number of countries, mostly small and island economies manage fixed exchange and often devalue it as a stabilisation strategy. The current paper investigates the effectiveness of devaluation in improving trade balance with reference to Fiji. A small island economy has limited exportable and hence highly depends on imports for both consumption and production purposes. A devaluation, therefore, inflates domestic price and appreciates the real exchange immediately by raising importable consumption and discouraging imports used in domestic production. The paper applies various econometric models for empirical investigation of its impact and transmission mechanism. Strong long-run relationship found between real exchange rate and trade balance explains that appreciation of currency has been responsible for the rising trade deficit in the economy. Moreover, the devaluation did not demonstrate J-curve phenomenon. The effect of devaluation strongly contributed to the domestic inflation has been while quite weak on stimulating aggregate demand.

We develop a random coefficient model in which people are allowed to differ in baseline happiness, and the way they transform income and leisure into utility. We hypothesize that additional dollars of income and leisure (work) hours do not necessarily increase (decrease) the utility of all individuals in the same way, and relative income positions and heterogeneity around relative income positions are important explanations for happiness. Using eight waves Australian household panel data (HILDA), we find strong evidence of heterogeneity in the income-happiness relationship, and differences in baseline happiness were partially explained by personality traits. In addition, we also find relative income positions to play an important role in explaining happiness. In some instances the marginal utility estimates of relative income positions were larger in magnitude than the marginal utility estimate of absolute income, affirming EJ Mishan's view that relative income is an important determinant of happiness.","[Schurer, Stefanie] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Yong, Jongsay] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Yong, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",jongsay@unimelb.edu.au,,"Yong, Jongsay/0000-0001-6866-1954","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government)","This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, which is a project initiated and funded by the Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) and is managed by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.

Despite these being order-driven markets, with no direct participation from bookmakers, we have found very similar results to those obtained by Lahvika (2014) for bookmakers' betting markets: the bias is stronger in matches between lower-ranked players, in later round matches and in high profile tournaments. This suggests that bookmakers' adjustments to respond to informed betting are not the main driver of FLB. The varying magnitude of the bias across different types of event in the main market also weakens arguments linking FLB to gamblers' risk preferences, and suggests the need to consider the microstructure features of the market together with the cognitive biases highlighted in the behavioural finance literature.","[Abinzano, Isabel; Muga, Luis; Santamaria, Rafael] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Muga, L (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.",luis.muga@unavarra.es,"Abinzano, Isabel/H-1992-2015; Muga, Luis/H-3523-2015; Santamaria, Rafael/G-5755-2015","Abinzano, Isabel/0000-0002-4658-8677; Muga, Luis/0000-0003-0374-0226; Santamaria, Rafael/0000-0001-7656-6412",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35946-C02-01]; Andalusian Regional Government [P12-SEJ-1713],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Andalusian Regional Government,This article has received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35946-C02-01].

Rabin's (1993) theory of fairness is adopted to demonstrate that although group violence may not be a Nash equilibrium it may be a fairness equilibrium in a game containing psychological payoffs. For this to happen the material stakes must be perceived as low and psychological payoffs are expressive. Although the material stakes are actually high, members of each group may choose expressively to support the use of violence because the probability of being decisive is low. The paper also considers the possibility of peace emerging as a fairness equilibrium. This can only happen if each group perceives the other as making some sacrifice in choosing peace.","[Jennings, Colin] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Jennings, C (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England.",colin.jennings@kcl.ac.uk,"Jennings, Colin/HIR-3150-2022","Jennings, Colin/0000-0002-5554-3825",,,,,53,2,2,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Through a lab-in-field experiment with villagers and real customary judges in rural Ethiopia, we show that post-arbitration payouts to agents disfavored by the customary system are downwardly biased. Introducing a costly formal law reduces these biases and draws the decisions of customary judges significantly closer to the law. At the same time agents advantaged by the law do not exploit their increased bargaining power. Instead, they make offers that are less advantageous to themselves and, in equilibrium, only a fraction of them make direct use of the formal law. Our results suggest that local customary dispute resolution institutions may have a role to play in shifting preexisting customs toward a desired outcome. In areas where formal legal institutions have limited outreach, the effects of increased competition between formal law and customary legal institutions may rise from changes in the latter, rather than from plaintiffs seeking justice under the rule of law.

Our paper develops a tractable model to illustrate that introducing innovation effort could well explain the puzzle of the relationships between the power of incentives, risk and risk-averseness of the agent. In particular, we assume that the agent can exert two unobservable efforts: a production effort and an innovation effort. While the production effort can increase output within a particular production method, the innovation effort can generate an innovative but riskier production method. We show that, when inducing innovation is unnecessary, the standard result that incentives tend to decrease with risk and risk averseness holds. However, when inducing innovation becomes necessary, incentives may increase with risk and risk averseness. The insights in this paper are especially important today, when innovative but riskier technologies upgrade very quickly.","[Chen, Pu; Li, Sanxi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianye] Shandong Univ, Res Ctr Games & Econ Behav, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianye] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Banking & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xundong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CAPFPP, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Shandong University; University of International Business & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, SX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",puchenias@gmail.com; lisanxi@gmail.com; yanjianye@gmail.com; yinxundong@gmail.com,"wang, chen/JED-7289-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303245, 71401034]; Ministry of Education of China [13YJC790077, 13YJC790174]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [14YQ06]; SRF for ROCS, SEM","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE; SRF for ROCS, SEM(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars)","The authors thank David Martimort, Wilfried Sand-Zantman and three anonymous referees for their valuable comments and constructive suggestions.

Using a generalized martingale approach, we solve the investor's optimal portfolio problem, determine the optimal allocation to fixed-term securities, and provide a representation of trading strategies in terms of a liquidity-related derivative. We apply our approach to two benchmark scenarios: fixed-term fixed-rate bank deposits, and unspanned closed-end securities that can only be traded at time 0. We show that both can be key parts of the investor's optimal asset mix, and we investigate the dependence of optimal allocations to fixed-term investments, implied liquidity premia and other characteristics on the underlying model parameters.

We study how market structure, specifically the size of the private sector, affects tariff pass-through, and how this mechanism influenced the extent to which households benefited from the trade liberalization. Our results suggest that a higher share of private sector in Chinese cities is associated with higher levels of tariff pass through rates. This effect works both through the distribution sector, and through the production of final goods. By incorporating the changes in consumer prices of tradable and non-tradable goods, we next investigate the impact of WTO accession on household welfare through changes in the cost of consumption. The results show that WTO accession of China was associated with welfare gains to almost every household across the per capita expenditure spectrum, and that the distributional effect is strongly pro-poor. The average welfare gain of WTO accession on Chinese households is estimated to be 7.3%. The distributional effect through higher levels of privatization was also pro-poor, indicating that privatization enhanced the pro-poor impact of trade liberalization. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Second, we estimate how the incidence of state diesel taxes varies with the point of collection, where the remitting party varies across states and over time. Moving tax collection upstream from retailers substantially raises the pass-through of diesel taxes to consumers. Furthermore, tax revenues increase when collecting taxes from wholesalers rather than from retailers, suggesting that evasion is the likely explanation for the incidence result.","[Kopczuk, Wojciech] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 1022 Int Affairs Bldg,MC 3308,420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Marion, Justin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Muehlegger, Erich] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Livermore, CA 95616 USA; [Slemrod, Joel] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St,R5396, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kopczuk, W (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 1022 Int Affairs Bldg,MC 3308,420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Marion, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Engn 2, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Muehlegger, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Livermore, CA 95616 USA.;Slemrod, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St,R5396, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",wk2110@columbia.edu; marion@ucsc.edu; emuehlegger@ucdavis.edu; jslemrod@umich.edu,"Slemrod, Joel/AAJ-5709-2020","Kopczuk, Wojciech/0000-0001-8678-275X; Muehlegger, Erich/0000-0002-5670-7895",,,,,47,35,38,2,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

Our test allows for very flexible specifications of the transition function and short-run dynamics and is significantly more powerful than all the other existing tests. Moreover, we develop a large sample theory general enough to deal with randomly drifting parameter spaces, which is essential to properly test for a unit root against stationary transitional models. An empirical application of our test to the exchange rate data is also provided.","Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Sungkyunkwan Univ, Suwon, South Korea; Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Tokyo; Vanderbilt University,"Park, JY (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 100 S Woodlawn, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",joon@indiana.edu,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A5A2A01020692]; JSPS KAKENHI Grant [26285049]; NSF [SES-0524868]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03605, 26285049] Funding Source: KAKEN","National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are very grateful to Frank Schorfheide and three anonymous referees for many helpful comments.

Our procedure combines the impact effects obtained from stress measures that rely on feedback centrality properties with the default probabilities of institutions. We also present new heuristics for designing feasible and relevant stress-testing scenarios that can subside regulators in financial system surveillance tasks. We develop a methodology to extract banking communities and show that these communities have a relevant effect on systemic risk. We find that these communities are mostly composed of non-large banks, suggesting that regulators should also broaden their surveillance efforts to these banking communities other than to the usual SIFIs and large banks. Finally, our results provide insights and guidelines for policymakers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study analyses prospects for the industry by estimating an industry-level cost function that includes output of both vehicles and component parts with capital, labour and intermediate goods as inputs. The cost elasticity of output (an indicator of scale properties) and the elasticity relationships among inputs are explored. One unexpected outcome of the work that appears to be robust is that during early years of the study period, the industry had constant returns or even diseconomies of scale. However, during later years, when output was greater, there were economies of scale. This finding is likely the result of some combination of the entry of new firms, the development of new models or technological change. The study concludes that if firm output can be increased, economies of scale can be expected to strengthen the position of the Brazilian industry in the international marketplace.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,53,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper uses a meta frontier and non-radial directional distance function to propose an alternative three stage approach to measure total-factor CO2 emission performance and technology gaps. The first stage calculates the CO2 emission performance of the group frontier. The second stage uses these results to calculate the technology gap ratio. The third stage integrates data from the first two stages to calculate CO2 emission performance under the meta frontier. This approach is easier to apply than other approaches in the literature, and effectively avoids the phenomenon of the technology gap ratio being greater than unity. The proposed approach can also decompose CO2 emission performance loss into two categories: management inefficiency and technical gaps. To demonstrate the method, an empirical analysis using data for 54 countries was conducted. The study highlighted three main findings. First, upper-middle income countries did not perform as well as high income countries and lower-middle income countries. Second, high income countries generally enjoy optimized production technology, whereas the lower-middle income countries generally had the lowest technological levels. Third, both management inefficiency and technical gaps negatively impacted CO2 emission performance, but management inefficiency played a dominant role. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We exploit a natural experiment in which voters face the same contest at different ballot positions due to differences in the number of local issues on their ballot. Facing more decisions before a given contest significantly increases the tendency to abstain or rely on decision shortcuts, such as voting for the status quo or the first-listed candidate.

Both firms supply a produced input to the domestic and foreign downstream firms that compete in an export market. The paper shows that complete privatization of the domestic upstream firm is never optimal. It will likely be fully nationalized if its market share is high, the domestic downstream firms' market share is low, and the total number of firms in the downstream is large. Simulation results reveal that the public firm's optimal profit margin may be negative and that the government ownership level may exhibit a reswitching phenomenon as the number of domestic downstream firms keeps growing.

Unlike existing models, we focus on local merchant guilds, rather than alien guilds, accounting for the main observed features of their behavior, internal organization and relationship with rulers. Our model delivers novel predictions about the emergence, variation, functioning, and eventual decline of this highly successful historical form of network. Our theory reconciles previous explanations and the large body of historical evidence on medieval merchant guilds. In doing so, we also shed novel light on the role of the guilds' social capital, and its importance for taxation, welfare, and the development of towns and their government in medieval Europe.

Analysis of buyer decisions reveals that prices are the main driver of purchase decisions while higher donations only affect purchase decisions when they are credible and price differences are negligible. Our results indicate that under intense competition the possibility of attracting customers through corporate social responsibility activities is limited, although the constant positive level of contributions suggests that norms lead to a certain minimum level of corporate social responsibility.

Qualifications can be acquired either before entering the labor market through formal education, or through learning-by-doing in a low-skill job. Spontaneously, the economy creates too many high-skill jobs and accordingly individuals devote too much effort to formal education. However, educational effort alone becomes insufficient when the rate of creation of these high-skill jobs is reduced to its optimal level. In conclusion, we show that an efficient policy would be to subsidize both education and low-skill firms whose workers quit when obtaining a job in the high-skill sector, both elements financed by a tax on high-skill firms.

Although some studies have found that individuals with lower cognitive skills tend to be risk averse, the literature has not addressed yet a comprehensive understanding of domain-specific risk preference variation by cognitive ability and by gains versus losses as well as high versus low probabilities associated with the outcomes. Thus, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of domain specific risk preference variations. The results of this paper show the following: individuals with low cognitive skills tend to be risk-averse (and more risk-averse compared to people with high cognitive ability) when facing high probability of gain or low probability of loss, however risk-seeking (although less risk-seeking compared to people with high cognitive ability) when facing low probability of gain or high probability of loss.

Chinese provincial leaders, despite facing strong career concerns, make different policy decisions depending on their career backgrounds. Provincial party secretaries who have risen from low to high positions within the province they govern (locals) spend a higher share of budgetary resources on education and health care and invest less in construction infrastructure than party secretaries who have made their most significant career advancements in other provinces (outsiders). Identification comes from variation in central leadership and term limits. As the promotion mechanism rewards infrastructure investments, locals are less likely to be promoted at the end of the term. We explore various mechanisms and provide evidence that the difference between locals and outsiders is not driven by knowledge or experience. Several pieces of evidence suggest that locals cater to low-level provincial elites, who helped them rise to power. Thus, local career trajectories limit the power of career concerns by fostering competing allegiances.","[Persson, Petra] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Stanford University; Paris School of Economics,"Persson, P (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Zhuravskaya, E (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",perssonp@stanford.edu; ezhuravskaya@gmail.com,,"Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina/0000-0002-3496-2086",Social Security Administration [5001537],Social Security Administration,"We are grateful to anonymous referees, Chong-En Bai, Andrei Bremzen, Francesco Caselli, Kate Casey, Stefano DellaVigna, Georgy Egorov, Claudio Ferraz, Ray Fisman, Ronny Freier, John Friedman, Sergei Guriev, Irena Grosfeld, Eliana La Ferrara, Samuel Lee, David Daokui Li, Ben Olken, Stephane Straub, Shang-Jin Wei, and participants of the NBER Summer Institute, the Econometric Society World Congress in Shanghai, the 13th Annual Conference of the International Society for New Institutional Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, the Global Institute China-Russia Conference at Tsinghua University, the CEPR Political Economy of Development Workshop, and participants of numerous seminars for helpful comments.

We employ a stochastic Lyapunov function approach to demonstrate that the SG mean dynamics is easily destabilized by the noise associated with real-time learning, because its Jacobian contains stable but very small eigenvalues. We also express caution on usage of perpetual learning algorithms with such small eigenvalues, as the real-time dynamics might diverge from the equilibrium that is stable under the mean dynamics.","[Slobodyan, Sergey; Bogomolova, Anna; Kolyuzhnov, Dmitri] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kolyuzhnov, Dmitri] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Moscow 117901, Russia",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics & Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Slobodyan, S (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic.",Sergey.Slobodyan@cerge-ei.cz,"Kolyuzhnov, Dmitri/H-2931-2014; Slobodyan, Sergey/H-2920-2014","Slobodyan, Sergey/0000-0002-9297-7972",GACR [P402/11/J018],GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"A previous version of this paper was circulated as Slobodyan, Bogomolova, and Kolyuzhnov, Stochastic Gradient versus Recursive Least Squares Learning, CERGE-EI WP 309, Oct 2006.

This study addresses these shortcomings and examines the effect of national sporting success on amateur sport participation in German football using longitudinal data from 1950 to 2014. Since an individual's decision to participate in sport also depends on other factors, the regression models also control for working hours, real wages etc. The results show that only World Cup title wins of the men's national team have a positive and statistically significant impact on the number of and percentage changes in individual club memberships, clubs and teams. The coefficients of European Championship titles and title wins of the women's national team turn out to be mostly insignificant.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate an equilibrium matching model of high school relationships. Variation in gender ratios is used to uncover male and female preferences. Estimates from the structural model match subjective responses on whether sex would occur in one's ideal relationship.

Our framework exploits a multiplicity of sectors and a continuous support of human capital choices to demonstrate that freer trade can induce crowding out of the middle occupations toward the skill acquisition extremes in one country and simultaneous expansion of middle-income industries in another. Individual gains from trade may be non-monotonic in workers' ability, and middle ability agents can lose the most from trade liberalization. Comparing trade and education policies, our model indicates that targeted education subsidies like Trade Adjustment Assistance are the most effective mechanism to bolster the middle class.

Furthermore, we find that the total (direct plus indirect) effects on all metropolitan areas are positive and larger in magnitude than the direct effects alone, indicating that freedom-enhancing reforms in one metropolitan area lead to positive-sum games with neighboring metropolitan areas.","[Bologna, Jamie; Young, Andrew T.] W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Lacombe, Donald J.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Agr & Nat Resource Econ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Lacombe, Donald J.] W Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA",West Virginia University; West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Bologna, J; Young, AT (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.;Lacombe, DJ (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Agr & Nat Resource Econ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.;Lacombe, DJ (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Reg Res Inst, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",Jamie.Bologna@mail.wvu.edu; Andrew.Young@mail.wvu.edu; Donald.Lacombe@mail.wvu.edu,,"Lacombe, Donald/0000-0003-0668-4047",,,,,34,20,21,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Household surveys are the traditional data source used to measure the top shares, but recent studies using administrative tax records suggest that these survey-based top share estimates may not be capturing all of the increasing concentration. In this paper, we reconcile the divergent top share estimates, showing how the choices of data sets and methodological decisions affect levels and trends. Relative to the new and most widely cited top share estimates based on administrative tax data alone, our preferred estimates for both wealth and income concentration are lower and have been rising less rapidly in recent years.","[Bricker, Jesse; Henriques, Alice; Sabelhaus, John] Fed Reserve Board, Richmond, VA 23261 USA; [Krimmel, Jacob] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; University of Pennsylvania,"Bricker, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Richmond, VA 23261 USA.",,,,,,,,53,65,77,0,11,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

In Jeffrey's rule, the input to a belief revision is not simply the information that some event has occurred, as in Bayes' rule, but a new assignment of probabilities to some events. Despite their differences, Bayes' and Jeffrey's rules can be characterized in terms of the same axioms: responsiveness, which requires that revised beliefs incorporate what has been learnt, and conservativeness, which requires that beliefs on which the learnt input is 'silent' do not change. To illustrate the use of non-Bayesian belief revision in economic theory, we sketch a simple decision theoretic application.

While the promised benefits to countries that open for capital inflows have not been realized, sudden and massive capital outflows often visibly wreak havoc on the economy. By using the recently developed asymmetric Granger causality test, we find overwhelming evidence across nine selected Asian countries in support of an asymmetric effect of capital flows on economic growth in the sense that cumulative capital inflows are irrelevant to growth, whereas cumulative capital outflows are destructive to growth. Based on a small open economy model expanded with heterogeneous investment goods and endogenous nonlinear credit constraints, we provide an economic intuition for the asymmetry that survives different levels of financial development. In particular, the arbitrage condition between heterogeneous investment goods sets a boundary over which massive and persistent capital inflows have no impact on long-run growth. On the other hand, endogenous nonlinear credit constraints trigger a debt deflation process, making large and persistent capital outflows destructive to growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The identification result uses a nonstandard but plausible condition on the unobservables: the assumption that the joint density of the unobservables of all agents is unimodal in the sense of achieving the global maximum at a unique point. Also, a three-step semiparametric estimator is proposed. Under mild regularity conditions, the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The estimator is nonstandard in the sense that the estimators of the intercept and interaction effect parameters converge at slower than the parametric rate.

Applying a prospect theory model of risk preferences, we show that loss aversion can explain both of these behavioral phenomena.

We compare a team-building treatment where subjects initially play a coordination game to gain common experience (CE) with an autarky treatment where subjects individually perform a task (NCE). In both treatments, subjects then play two-player control games where agents provide costly effort and principals can control to secure a minimum effort. CE agents always outperform NCE agents.

We identify trends in attendance demand by examining over 540 ODI matches played in Australia and England between 1981 and 2015. We use fixed effects and Tobit random effects models to isolate key determinants of attendance demand for ODI cricket and, in particular, the impact of uncertainty of outcome. We find that team strength has little independent effect on ODI attendances, but the uncertainty of the match outcome, as measured by the relative strengths of the teams over a long period of time, increases demand for ODI matches in England. Further, organising the ODI as a day/night (floodlit) game has a large positive impact on attendance in Australia.","[Sacheti, Abhinav; Paton, David] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Gregory-Smith, Ian] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Nottingham; University of Sheffield,"Paton, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",david.paton@nottingham.ac.uk,"Paton, David/E-7286-2011","Paton, David/0000-0002-7486-9353",,,,,24,5,5,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The method overcomes the problems associated with ordered self-reported health (SRH) responses when the conventional tools of inequality analysis are used. Applying the new method to the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, we find that over the study period of thirteen years, health inequality has increased by more than one hundred percent in spite of the multifold increase in average income. We conclude that the most likely explanations for the recent increase in China's health inequality are: aging population, worsening income inequality and poverty, division between urban and rural, and environment deterioration.","[Wang, Hongliang; Yu, Yiwen] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yiwen] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Econ, 86 Yushanxilu, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Audit University; Nanjing Audit University,"Yu, YW (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yu, YW (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Econ, 86 Yushanxilu, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",whongliang@nau.edu.cn; yiyu32312@163.com,"zhang, wb/JGM-5316-2023",,"National Social Science Foundation of China [10CJL020, 11CJY066]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [11YJC790023]; Jiangsu Province 333 High Level Teacher Training Project [BRA2012183]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Jiangsu Province 333 High Level Teacher Training Project,"The authors are grateful to the anonymous referees for providing constructive comments that helped improve the presentation of the paper.

The framework of Takahashi et al. (2013) is applied to investigate the effects of integrating the capital market. Several new findings are obtained. First, the inequality in nominal income displays a bell-shaped relationship with falling trade costs if capital mobility is not too low. Second, keeping the trade costs fixed, the inequalities in nominal income and industrial location behave differently when the capital market is integrated. Finally, integration of the product market and integration of the capital market have different impacts on inequality in real income. This explains why empirical findings on spatial inequalities are mixed.","[Zeng, Dao-Zhi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan",Tohoku University,"Zeng, DZ (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan.",zeng@se.is.tohoku.ac.jp,,"Zeng, Dao-Zhi/0000-0003-3348-3574","JSPS KAKENHI of Japan [26380282, 24330072, 24243036]","JSPS KAKENHI of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author wishes to thank two anonymous referees, editor Markus Jantti, Hideo Konishi, Yasuhiro Sato, Hajime Takatsuka, and Kazuhiro Yamamoto for their highly valuable and detailed comments.

We are particularly interested in investigating these determinants by controlling for state dependence, unobserved heterogeneity and endogenous initial conditions of firms. Our findings reveal that firms show a high persistence in export behaviour, and that export volume changes are determined primarily by changes in the intensive margin. In addition, our research suggests that having exported before, having achieved a certain productivity level and being large and foreign-owned, greatly increased the probability of exporting. Moreover, these results hold even for the export share of firms, except for productivity and foreign capital, which seem to be less relevant.","[Altuzarra, A.; Bustillo, R.; Rodriguez, C.] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Bustillo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",ricardo.bustillo@ehu.es,"Altuzarra, Amaia/A-4476-2019; MESANZA, RICARDO BUSTILLO/Y-1197-2019; Rodriguez, Carlos/DNT-3892-2022","Altuzarra, Amaia/0000-0002-9256-0050; MESANZA, RICARDO BUSTILLO/0000-0001-7246-8735; Rodriguez, Carlos/0000-0001-6629-2147",,,,,30,7,7,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We find that that electricity prices have long term correlation structure for the first and third time zones indicating that market participants bid hyperbolically and not at their marginal costs, market is not weak form efficient at these hours and exogenous shocks to change the mean level of prices will have permanent effect and be effective. On the other hand, for the second time zone we find that price series does not exhibit long term memory. This finding suggests the weak form efficiency of the market in these hours and that market participants bid at their marginal costs. Furthermore this indicates that exogenous shocks will have temporary effect on electricity prices in these hours. These findings constitute an important foundation for policy makers and market participants to develop appropriate electricity price forecasting tools, market monitoring indexes and to conduct ex-ante impact assessment.

What is the minimal allowance that motivates an individual to move from employment to unemployment? What is the minimal salary that motivates an unemployed individual to seek employment? This study examines those questions, specifically with regard to the differences between older and younger individuals. Our findings demonstrate that age has a strong impact on the threshold incomes and behavioral factors. Older people demand more money than younger people for giving up their jobs. Older workers also have a stronger status-quo bias and demonstrate a greater preference for work. However, there is no significant difference between young and old with respect to the income needed to motivate a switch from unemployment to employment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that the presence of collateral constraints improves the performance of the model in terms of overall goodness of fit.

However, the causes and potential consequences of this increase were only given scarce attention in the literature on the Euro area sovereign debt crisis. In order to fill this gap, we first determine the shocks that impact the variation in the share of sovereign debt held at home in an SVAR model on a sample of Eurozone countries between 2002 and 2014, distinguishing between external and domestic shocks. Thanks to several alternative tests, we show that home bias in sovereign debt responds positively to country-specific fundamentals and expectation shocks but we find no evidence that the increase in home bias is destabilizing per se in the short-run. Second, a stylized theoretical model backed by the empirical results predicts that the consequences for sovereign debt crisis depend on the relative impact of domestic initial destabilizing shocks and increased home bias. The analysis suggests that an increase in home bias in times of sovereign debt stress, despite reflecting deteriorating fiscal conditions, may make default less likely. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This happiness gap has persisted over time, despite predictions to the contrary by earlier scholars. It holds after controlling for a variety of covariates, such as the standard of living, life expectancy and Eastern Orthodox religion. Armed with a battery of surveys from the early 1990s to 2014, we argue that the happiness gap is explained by how citizens in post communist countries perceive their governments. Eastern Europeans link their life satisfaction to higher perceived corruption and weaker government performance. Our results suggest that the transition from central planning is still incomplete, at least in the psychology of people. Journal of Comparative Economics 44 (1) (2016) 108-124.

Building on a gravity model for migration, our econometric strategy controls for the multilateral resistance to migration and solves the zero migration flows problem by using a censored quantile regression approach. Further, the endogeneity problem of RTAs in migration settlement is addressed by using instrumental variable censored quantile regression. Our results suggest that the presence of a RTA stimulates the migration stocks among member countries. The pro-migration effect of RTAs is magnified if the agreement includes also provisions easing bureaucratic procedures for visa and asylum among member countries. Finally, we find an asymmetric effect of RTAs across the quantiles of the distribution of migration settlements.","[Orefice, Gianluca] CEPII, 113 Rue Grenelle, F-75007 Paris, France; [Figueiredo, Erik] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Econ, Jardim Cidade Univ, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil; [Lima, Luiz Renato] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr, 527A, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Universidade Federal da Paraiba; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Orefice, G (通讯作者)，CEPII, 113 Rue Grenelle, F-75007 Paris, France.",gianluca.orefice@cepii.fr,,,,,,,38,16,16,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

A supply and demand based correlation model between EUA and sCER price returns is proposed in detail using inverse Box Cox type marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves and simple emission reduction volume processes. The model includes financial players' EUA-sCER swap transaction in boom periods of carbon prices using the logit model for EUA and EUA-sCER swap volume correlations, and stronger energy price impacts on EUA prices than sCER prices using a mean-reverting lognormal process for energy prices. The empirical studies using EUA and sCER prices estimate the model parameters, resulting in a positive EUA volume impact on EUA-sCER swap transactions and a positive energy price impact on EUA prices. It is shown that high EUA-sCER price correlations during high EUA price periods stemmed from EUA-sCER swap transactions, whereas high EUA-sCER price correlations during the period of financial turmoil with low EUA prices came from the drop in energy prices. We also show that the leverage effects often observed in security markets exist in both the EUA and sCER markets according to the price-volatility relation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

That strategy is based on the comparison between the estimated long memory parameter before and after filtering out the breaks. To date the breaks, we use the probability smoothing of the Markov Switching GARCH model of Haas et al. (2004). Application of this strategy to the crude oil, heating oil, RBOB regular gasoline and the propane futures energy with the one, two, three and four months maturities show strong evidence for the presence of long range dependence in all futures energy prices volatility time series. This result of long range dependence in the volatility is confirmed by the superiority of the FIGARCH and FIEGARCH models compared with the Markov switching GARCH models in terms of out-of-sample forecasting and value at risk (VaR) performances. Moreover, we show that the proposed empirical strategy is robust to different data frequency. Practical implications of the results for market participants are proposed and discussed.

Therefore, this paper explores the effects of alternative energy price shocks on economic activity, and examines the relative performance of these alternative measures in predicting state level economic activity using the Davidson and MacKinnon J-test. The alternative energy price series considered are as follows: gasoline, diesel, natural gas, heating oil, and electricity. Alternative measures of energy price shocks produce different patterns of impulse responses than oil price shocks. Additionally, overwhelming evidence indicates that alternative energy price models, excluding models containing the price of gasoline, outperform the baseline model containing the price of oil for many states, particularly at short-to-mid forecast horizons. Using alternative energy prices should lead to a more accurate modeling of the energy price-macroeconomy relationship. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate that labour underpayment is approximately 43.7% in this period of assessment, a significantly higher figure than the estimates for Western economies. Underpayment in this period takes a U-shape relationship. Determinants of underpayment were proposed by seven hypotheses and confirmed by bootstrap method, except age discrimination. Test results show that intergenerational effects are the most salient factor for underpayment. At the same time, we construct an index to measure the wage distortion in the labour market. Our findings indicate a general trend in which underpayment is increasing and differs between workers of different demographic characteristics and across regions.

Such policies yield limited success if housing prices are driven up by fundamentals. Estimating a fundamental price trend from observed price data is a challenge. We present an empirical methodology to separate housing price trends into fundamental and affordable components. Deviating from the common practice, we replace current income by a long-run income measure constructed from household incomes at different quantiles. This income measure provides a more suitable basis for constructing affordable house price levels. It also serves as a better fundamental variable, especially for segmented housing markets like that of Singapore. These price trends provide policy-makers with useful information to intervene into property markets to achieve desirable outcomes.

We quantify shocks to wealth and financial pressure faced by various categories of households since the onset of the Great Recession. The shocks differ substantially across countries and across economic and socio-demographic characteristics. We find that the rising unemployment rate disproportionately affected the income-poor, while the declining asset prices more the income-rich. Although borrowers benefited from lower interest rates, debt service-income and debt-income ratios for poor households went up due to falling incomes. As a policy contribution we illustrate how our pseudomicro data can be used to assess the distributional impact of asset prices on consumption: the unprecedented declines in asset prices substantially contributed to the sluggish consumption growth driven by both rich and poor households. While the former were hit by large shocks to wealth, the latter also significantly cut their spending because of their high MPCs. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our results show that the crisis has a significant and positive impact on both the cost and profit inefficiencies of the commercial banks from the EU, and that this impact is higher on eurozone banks. In terms of cost efficiency, the most affected by the crisis are the large publicly traded banks, operating in old members of the EU.

We show that suppliers' responses dominated the market reaction to the 2006 US Food and Drug Administration warning to avoid fresh spinach contaminated with potentially deadly bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7. A modified Durbin-Wu-Hausman test for temporary price endogeneity is developed and used in a leafy green vegetable demand model. Test results indicate the price of bagged spinach was exogenous before the announcement but endogenous for approximately 12 weeks afterward. We show these results are consistent with the notion that suppliers temporarily limited the availability of spinach to consumers. Instead of consumers choosing the quantity purchased given exogenous prices, it was suppliers who limited the quantity marketed and consumers' choices established the market price.","[Arnade, Carlos; Kuchler, Fred; Calvin, Linda] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Arnade, C (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",carnade@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,28,2,3,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A firm is a promotion hierarchy in which a worker's status depends on past performance. We investigate the optimality of two types of promotion hierarchies: (i) standard promotion practices, where agents have a job guarantee, and (ii) up-or-out, in which agents are fired when unsuccessful. We show that up-or-out is optimal if success is difficult to achieve. When success is less hard to achieve, standard promotion practices are optimal provided the payoffs associated with success are moderate. Otherwise, up-or-out is, again, optimal.

Effective management of receivables can certainly be considered a complex system, which must react to demands of customers, must adapt to certain settings on the market and must also take into account the financial capacity of the company providing the trade credit.

The focus of the research was to evaluate their amount of spending on goods for daily use and the frequency of their purchases while also taking into account sociodemographic factors. What was also examined was their brand loyalty and attitude to price vs. quality. Women buy more frequently and in smaller volumes and almost half of the respondents did not spend more than 500 CZK on a single purchase. 60 % of seniors regularly make use of discounts, while one third do so only occasionally. Most of all the 65+ age group responds to special offers. Brand loyalty applies to less than a quarter of respondents, half of the respondents change goods according to price, which is the deciding factor for most of the elderly. The research shows that seniors do not form a homogeneous group, rather representing to some extent a kind of super segment. Many companies have come to realise that seniors represent an attractive consumer target group, which they must get to know.","[Celer, Cenek] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti nad Labem, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Celer, C (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti nad Labem, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",cenek.celer@ujep.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-636-0,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2016,6,,,,,,114,122,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP1JI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000539487200013,0

Analytically, we show that the effective labor force exhibits an intensive margin response, in the sense that in response to higher unionization the number of employed workers decreases, but each individual employed worker provides more working hours. This intensive margin response leads to the possibility of the coexistence of high unemployment and high growth. Moreover, unionization gives rise to an ambiguous effect on income inequality, whereas it has an unambiguously positive effect on the labor income share and growth rate. Our numerical study shows that the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital plays an important role in governing the steady-state consequences and affecting the impact of (de-) unionization. These results provide not only a plausible explanation of the empirical evidence, but also a reconciliation for the disparity in the empirical findings.","[Chang, Juin-jen] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hung, Hsiao-wen] Tamkang Univ, New Taipei 251, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Tamkang University,"Hung, HW (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei 251, Taiwan.",hwhung@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,"National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China","National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We would like to thank an anonymous referee, Ping Wang, Been-Lon Chen, Ching-Chong Lai, Jang-Ting Guo, Hsieh-Yu Lin, and participants at the 13th Annual Conference of the Association for Public Economic Theory and the AEI-Five Joint Workshop 2014 in Kyoto, for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Many useful models and methods have been developed for multiple criteria decision analysis within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. In contrast to the elaborate existing methods, this paper establishes a simple and effective method for managing the sophisticated data expressed by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. An inclusion comparison possibility defined on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is proposed, and some important properties are investigated. Then, an inclusion-based index that considers positive and negative ideals is offered. Considering the maximal comprehensive inclusion-based indices, this paper constructs a linear programming model (for consistent information) and an integrated, nonlinear programming model (for inconsistent information) to estimate the criterion weights and the optimal ranking order of the alternatives under an incomplete preference structure. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated by a practical example of selecting a suitable bridge construction method, and a comparative analysis with other relevant methods is conducted to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology.","[Chen, Ting-Yu] Chang Gung Univ 259, Grad Inst Business & Management, Dept Ind & Business Management, Coll Management, Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan",,"Chen, TY (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ 259, Grad Inst Business & Management, Dept Ind & Business Management, Coll Management, Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.",tychen@mail.cgu.edu.tw,", Ting-Yu/AAC-7043-2019",", Ting-Yu/0000-0002-2171-4139",Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 102-2410-H-182-013-MY3]; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital [BMRP 574],Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital(Chang Gung Memorial Hospital),"The author is very grateful to the respected editor and the anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments, which helped to improve the overall quality of the paper.

It shows that the joint behaviour of the three markets is better characterized by the Markov model with two regimes corresponding to low-and high-volatile market conditions. The relationship between changes in the market indexes under a regime is consistent with theory and persistent; the information transmission process of shocks to the markets is similar for the two regimes with a more important role for CDS shock; and the volatility in the money market is an important determinant of regime-switching.

Yet, the poor are more vulnerable to income shocks. We develop a model of endogenous risk-taking to explain these facts. In autarky, poor households adopt less risky production plans and obtain lower expected returns, but face higher relative risk than the rich. The introduction of risk-sharing generates negative risk externalities between agents. At the first best, the social planner imposes a homogeneous level of risk-taking in the group. At the second best, risk-taking is not enforceable and increases with insurance, generating moral hazard. Interestingly, the poor's risk-taking behavior is more sensitive to insurance. The social planner thus mitigates risk-taking by applying a lower insurance coverage in poor groups. The introduction of risk-sharing therefore reinforces the gap between rich and poor in terms of expected income and absolute risk, while the effect on relative risk is ambiguous.

The empirical analysis is made on OECD countries in the period 1980-2014. Exogenous variables in the estimated panel VAR model are standard growth variables expressed as gross fixed capital formation and the aggregate capital productivity. Endogenous variables are then fiscal variables, i.e. the social spending and the tax revenues. A third endogenous variable is GDP per capita. The empirical analysis suggests that social spending have not impact on economic growth in the long term. Impulse response functions showed that changes in social spending (both impulse and step) affect economic growth only in the short term, the changes disappear within four years. It is possible to conclude that policy makers should use social spending as a tool for the creation of an appropriate institutional framework rather than an instrument for the purposeful promotion long-term economic growth.","[Drobiszova, Agata] Mendelova Univ Brne, Provozne Ekon Fak, Zemedelskal 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Drobiszová, A (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ Brne, Provozne Ekon Fak, Zemedelskal 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdrobisz@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,102,108,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200011,0

Using a long panel dataset from Ghana, we empirically investigate the changing structure of earnings in self-employment relative to salaried work. Our analysis allows workers to sort into self-employment for different reasons, including expected earnings differentials and endogenous capital accumulation whilst highlighting constraints that workers may face. We estimate a correlated random coefficient model using IV-GMM, taking into account the endogeneity of sector choice and capital accumulation. We find that returns to productive characteristics in self-employment have increased significantly between 2004 and 2011 whilst self-employment has attracted increasingly skilled workers.

Many developed economic entities operatad there which were important within their own industries. Besides them there were many more craft workshops operating in Osijek whose products and services met the needs of the citizens in Osijek and its surroundings. Craftsmanship in Osijek has been developing since the late 17th century, and the first craftsmen began to work soon after the liberation of Osijek from the Turkish authorities. During the 18th and 19th centurycraftsmanship was rapidly developing and the products of a number of craftsmen were sold in the famous Osijek trade fair. After the Second World War the newly established communist government carried out the confiscation of almost all of these craft workshops and thus drastically changing the position of craftsmen in Osijek. The excuse for such a doing was an alleged economic cooperation with the occupier, i.e. during the Independent State of Croatia these craftsmen carried out their activities in a normal fashion and provided services to citizens and enemy soldiers. By these moves of the new government the craftsmanship in Osijek was nearly destroyed and thus the tradition of craftsmanship, which had been developing in Osijek during 18th and 19th century, came to an end. The circumstances of Osijek craftsmen is going to be illustrated on the examples of several craft workshops which were confiscated after the World War II.","[Gardas, Miro] Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Gardas, M (通讯作者)，Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",mgardas@pravos.hr,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,31,41,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600002,0

To this end, a panel data set of 17 European Union (EU) countries and 13 sectors over the period 1995-2007 is used as part of a twofold approach. First, we estimate aggregate and sectoral TFP for 17 EU countries by means of the augmented mean group estimator to control for endogeneity, cross-section dependence and heterogeneous production technologies. Second, we investigate the relative importance of the drivers of predicted TFP using a dynamic ordinary least-squares estimator. The results indicate that rationalization, human capital and information and communication technologies are the main drivers of TFP.","[Gehringer, Agnieszka] Flossbach von Storch Res Inst, Ottopl 1, D-50679 Cologne, Germany; [Gehringer, Agnieszka; Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Danzinger, Felicitas Nowak-Lehmann] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I,"Gehringer, A (通讯作者)，Flossbach von Storch Res Inst, Ottopl 1, D-50679 Cologne, Germany.;Gehringer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany.",agnieszka.gehringer@fvsag.com,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",Spanish MINECO [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Universitat Jaume I [P1-1B2013-06],Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,"We would like to thank the participants of the EconMod Conference 2013, Gottinger Workshop 'Internationale Wirtschaftsbeziehungen' 2013, ATINER Conference 2013 as well as of the XVII Applied Economics Meeting 2014 for their useful comments and suggestions.

However, base of strategic thinking is the accurate knowledge and understanding of the present - aim of our study is to support this. Croatia became EU-member in 2013 by which has undoubtedly found itself in the centre of attention. The research shown in present study investigates country's image by showing up in new market circumstances, from a narrower aspect the image in minds of the neighbouring Hungarians. A few months before the accession the country brand was studied with questionnaire survey, collecting the thoughts of 681 respondents by snowball sampling. Knowing elements of the Croatian country image and features of the perceived brand identity - that is according to the research findings far not a war-destroyed one but lying on tourism basis - can reveal strengths and weaknesses and show further possibilities at the same time. Using the results, opportunities of the Croatian tourism-related companies are revealed, paying outstanding attention on the area of Eastern Croatia. Based on the findings the neighbouring Southern Hungarian territory seems to be a promising market, however captivation needs further presentation and development. For supporting this propositions are drafted regarding the possible strategy that could moderate the absence of seaside and the ways and development directions of approaching different segments of the Hungarian audience.","[Gerdesics, Viktoria; Putzer, Petra; Orosdy, Bela] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Rakoczi Str 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,"Viktória, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Rakoczi Str 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary.",gerdesicsv@ktk.pte.hu; putzerp@ktk.pte.hu; orosdy@ktk.pte.hu,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,616,623,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600062,0

In this approach, the parameters in a CGE model are treated as fixed but unobserved, which we represent as prior mean values with prior error mass functions. Estimation of the parameters involves using an informationtheoretic Bayesian approach to exploit additional information in the form of new data from a series of Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs), which we assume were measured with error. The estimation procedure is efficient in the sense that it uses all available information and makes no assumptions about unavailable information. As illustration, we apply the methodology to estimate the parameters of a CGE model using alternative data sets for South Korea and for Sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Understood as an approach derivable from selected philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant, in social science subreption is suggested to occur through the introduction of an outside value that sets off a form of institutional evolution that we characterize as an evolution noire. Considering subreption and the rise of big business, we can mark a movement away from a past governed by comparatively noble values and towards a deteriorated, debased and degraded economic and social reality overtly influenced by comparatively ignoble, pecuniary values.","[Hall, John] Portland State Univ, Econ & Int Studies, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Dunlap, Alexander] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Social Anthropol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mitchell-Nelson, Joe] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Portland State University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Oregon,"Hall, J (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Econ & Int Studies, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",,,"Dunlap, Alexander/0000-0002-8852-9309",,,,,27,4,4,0,4,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63,4,,,,,475,492,,10.2298/PAN1604475H,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DX5CR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384397900006,0

The emphasis is on the relationship between public spending and private spending. The objective is to identify whether the effects of public spending on macro variables are reinforced or mitigated through the spillover effects on private spending. The evidence attests to the importance of stimulating private spending to maximize the positive effect of an increase in public spending on real growth. Concerns about the crowding out effects of higher public spending on private demand are more dominant in developing countries. Moreover, the scope for government spending to determine aggregate uncertainty is much larger in developing countries. Overall, the evidence attests to the importance of managing trends and variability of government spending towards maximizing the fiscal multiplier.

The study of the limitation of competition was conducted using the theoretically founded indicators of concentration and inequality as follows: Concentration ratio, Herfindahl-Hirschman index, Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, and Entropy index. The indicators were calculated for all the countries between 2004 and 2011. By comparatively analysing the obtained values of the indicators of concentration and inequality, we came to the conclusion that all three markets are characterised by a similar movement of the indicator, as well as that Croatian market, despite the relatively uneven market share distribution between individual companies, is more competitive than the other two.","[Kostic, Milan; Maksimovic, Ljiljana] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Kargujevac, Serbia; [Stojanovic, Boban] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia",University of Kragujevac; University of Nis,"Kostic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Kargujevac, Serbia.",mkostic@kg.ac.rs,"Kostić, Milan/AAT-1074-2021; Stojanović, Boban/HGC-2822-2022","Kostić, Milan/0000-0003-2883-1474;",,,,,43,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Based on this evidence, we identify a demand to explore this topic further and we exemplify our argument via instances of the specific manners in which globalization may influence a labor rights scheme: labor practices may be more predisposed to modify than labor laws, whereas both may impact an economy's assimilation into the international order. Lacking expanded state resources and readiness to implement legal protections, companies may oppose enhanced labor laws by disregarding them. Economies with stable legal systems may have beforehand laws that defend fundamental labor rights.

We build a DSGE model featuring three productive sectors (non-tradable, manufacturing and commodities), government and two types of consumers, according to whether or not they have access to financial markets (Ricardians and non-Ricardians, respectively). The model is calibrated and estimated using Bayesian methods and macroeconomic data from Colombia. Our results show that while non-Ricardian consumers have welfare gains from countercyclical fiscal rules, Ricardian consumers incur in considerable welfare losses from this type of policy. The specific quantitative results of our welfare evaluation are driven by the structural parameters estimated for the Colombian economy. In particular, the estimated persistence of the productivity shock is relatively low and implies lower welfare changes compared to similar studies for other countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, our proposed risk measure uses a nonparametric approach that allows us to get rid of any assumption on the distribution of returns. On the other hand, our asset pricing model is based on loss-averse investors of Prospect Theory, through which we implement the risk-seeking behavior of investors in a dynamic setting. By including EDR in our proposed model, unrealistic assumptions of commonly used equilibrium models - such as the exclusion of risk-seeking or price-maker investors and the assumption of unlimited leverage opportunity for a unique interest rate - can be omitted. Therefore, we argue that based on more realistic assumptions, our model is able to describe equilibrium expected returns with higher accuracy, which we support by empirical evidence as well.

This study is focused on financing strategies adopted by shipping companies during the crisis, analyzing relevant factors for a specific issue - the capital structure. The research methodology proposed for this analysis on relevant factors that could explain the capital structure of shipping is OLS regression applied on selected variables derived from the financial statements of the major shipping companies. The dependent variables reflecting capital structure are book value to total liabilities ratio and book value to total debt ratio. The explanatory variables are derived from the theory of capital structure. This study empirically illustrates the relevance of the capital structure theory for the studied economic sector and is a useful tool for the shipping companies, providing relevant information about the optimal capital structure adopted by shipping companies and about factors that influence this decision during a crisis period.","[Paun, Cristian; Topan, Vladimir] Bucharest Univ Econ Sci, Fac Int Business & Econ, Int Business & Econ Dept, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paun, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Sci, Fac Int Business & Econ, Int Business & Econ Dept, Bucharest, Romania.",cristian.paun@rei.ase.ro; topan_vlad@yahoo.com,"Topan, Mihai Vladimir/AAY-9149-2020; Paun, Cristian/I-5609-2016","Topan, Mihai Vladimir/0000-0002-1011-8737; Paun, Cristian/0000-0002-5057-3750",,,,,41,4,6,0,23,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63,3,,,,,359,384,,10.2298/PAN1603359P,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP2FK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378303300007,0

They allow to reduce or abolish the institutional barriers in foreign commerce, both inside and outside integration associations. Currently, the tariff preferences system of the European Union is one of the most effective and advanced models of preferential import in international trade. The process of its development is inextricably connected with the stages of the European integration. Within the EU a few preferential schemes based on multilateral and plurilateral agreements areapplied, and the principles of tariff modulation, country and industry-specific gradation are employed with consideration for the socioeconomic specificity of the recipient countries. The new political and economic realities require revision and adjustment of the EU system of tariff preferences to the changing institutional environment and the increasing role of European supranational institutions in the foreign trade policy. The European system of preferences must be developed and improved in accordance with the principles of international law and, the WTO, the WCO and specialized UNO committees.

Unsustainable production and consumption, the need for more luxury and wealth have resulted in different social inequalities, the pollution of the ecosystem, the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, which ultimately endangers human existence. The time has come for a different, more sustainable approach in the production of goods and services, as well as in their consumption. The aim of the paper is to emphasise the importance of implementing the concept of sustainable consumption, for the purpose of altering unsustainable purchasing habits, and thereby directing consumers towards sustainable consumption patterns, in order to achieve social cohesion, environmental protection and economic development. For the means of attaining a better insight into the functioning and implementation of sustainable consumption when it comes to the decisions of individuals, the research was conducted on a population of university students. Despite a high level of knowledge about eco products, the results explicitly showed a relatively low level of consumption of these products, primarily due to their insufficient information on their benefits. Therefore, promoting sustainable consumption require collaboration of universities with different stakeholders: governments (at global, national, regional and local levels), business and non-governmental organisations. The higher educational system, with its keen role in moulding young minds, must make a great effort in raising awareness on the importance of sustainable consumption, in order to improve the quality of life for all.","[Rakitovac, Kristina Afric] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Pula, Croatia; [Tadic, Matea] PANORA Ltd, Reg Dev Agcy Pozega Slavonia Cty, Pozega, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Rakitovac, KA (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Pula, Croatia.",kafric@unipu.hr; matea.tadic@pszupanija.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,172,182,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100020,0

When agents know their preferences at all states, the competitive equilibrium can be supported as a Nash equilibrium of the market game, that is, agents behave as if they were price takers. Therefore, if the associated competitive economy has a fully revealing rational expectations equilibrium, then so does the market game. This resolves the puzzle that agents behave as if prices were given, even though prices aggregate private information, at least for this private values case. Necessary conditions for Nash equilibrium show that the resulting allocation cannot deviate too far from a competitive equilibrium. When agents do not know their preferences at some states, though, a characterization result shows that the Nash equilibria of the market game tend to be far from competitive.","[Ritzberger, Klaus] Vienna Grad Sch Finance, Vienna, Austria; [Ritzberger, Klaus] Inst Adv Studies, Vienna, Austria",,,,,,Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 1242-G16],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The author gratefully acknowledges helpful comments and suggestions by Camelia Bejan, Larry Blume, Egbert and Hildegard Dierker, Martin Meier, Martin Summer, three anonymous referees, and Philipp Kircher (the editor), participants at the Econometric Society European Meeting 2013, and participants in the European Workshop on General Equilibrium Theory 2013.

It analyzes various types of texts, namely magazine/newspaper articles, academic books and journal articles. The time-range of analysis is approximately the past fifteen years. The conclusions present the prevailing discourse, but necessarily not the author's opinion. Since G is a social, human-made process, its reflections (discourse) could also indicate how it is evolving in reality.","[Rolenc, Jan Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Fac Int Relat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rolenc, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Fac Int Relat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",rolencj@vse.cz,"Rolenc, Jan Martin/M-5343-2018","Rolenc, Jan Martin/0000-0003-0735-4437",,,,,21,2,2,0,11,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1872,1879,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800232,0

Explaining these differences remains a complex and challenging problem. Scientific research has concluded that the impacts of socio-economic circumstances in local places (measured by social indicators) on subjectively perceived individual QoL are not direct, but complex, versatile and diverse. Objective differences of socio-economic factors in local places suggest that personal characteristics as well as other objective and subjective QoL factors, specific to individuals, could form some common patterns, able to disclose the differences in individually perceived QoL in different socio-economic conditions and diverse local places, e.g. cities, towns, or rural areas. The research aims at investigating differences in the patterns of individual subjectively perceived QoL in diverse local places. The differences of the considered local places are reasoned by the indicators of objective socio-economic conditions in cities, towns and rural areas. The tested presumption is that common patterns of individual subjectively perceived QoL differ, respecting objective socioeconomic factors in local places. The research concludes with the discovery and discussion of statistical regression models to predict individual subjectively perceived QoL in towns, big cities and rural areas. Residents' attitude to social environment, their abilities to deal with important problems in life, household total income and age are used as predictors to explain the differences of individual subjectively perceived QoL.

The aim of the society is to maximize the net social benefits which are negatively affected by the emission of pollutants. We show that the presence of an upper constraint on pollution growth rate affects the actual trajectory of emissions even when emissions are far below the level where the constraint binds. We get three main results. First, we find that for a society it is optimal to take into account the impact of the latent constraint at the outset of the planning horizon and to modify the emission flows even when the constraint is still slack. Second, we analyze how the constraint works effectively in the intermediate phases before the constraint binds. One crucial result is that the constraint on pollution growth may generate the unexpected result of increasing, instead of reducing, the emissions at the beginning and in the intermediate phases before the constraint binds. Finally, we state the boundary conditions to compute the optimal trajectory of emissions switching between regimes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These findings are contrary to the observation that counterfeiting of bank notes in some countries has recently experienced rapid increases. In this paper, we construct a model of counterfeiting in which counterfeiting can exist as an equilibrium outcome. A competitive search environment is employed in which sellers post offers and buyers direct their search based on posted offers. When sellers are uninformed, their offers are pooling and thus buyers can extract some rents by using counterfeit money. Therefore, counterfeit notes can coexist with genuine notes under certain conditions. We also explicitly model the interaction between sellers' verification decisions and counterfeiters' choices of counterfeit quality. This allows us to better understand how policies can affect counterfeiting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This phenomenon has enabled countries to undertake more in-depth specialization in niche parts of the production chain, with important benefits for their economic activity and growth. The Western Balkan countries are no exception. With their recent integration into global markets, an increasingly large share of their trade flows entail intermediate goods that are eventually processed and exported. This article analyzes the impact of different degrees of participation in IPNs on the economic performance of the Western Balkan countries, thereby testing the hypothesis that trade created by international fragmentation of production may generate effects on economic growth beyond the beneficial influence of total or final goods trade. The article focuses on the period 2002-2013. The results, using a set of panel data models, show that the degree of involvement in IPNs significantly affects economic performance, which partly explains the observed differences in the growth rates of the Western Balkan countries. We also find that the positive influence of processing trade on economic growth is greater than the traditional gains of an increase in foreign demand.","[Shimbov, Bojan] Univ Jaume I Castellon, World Bank, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Shimbov, Bojan; Alguacil, Maite; Suarez, Celestino] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Av Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Alguacil, Maite; Suarez, Celestino] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Av Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Av Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.;Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Av Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",alguacil@uji.es,"Suarez, Celestino/AAA-2446-2019; Shimbov, Bojan/ABF-6738-2021; Alguacil, Maite/K-9815-2014; Alguacil, Maite/AAA-2338-2019","Suarez, Celestino/0000-0002-3039-6240; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-58975-P],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),The authors would like to thank the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2014-58975-P) for its financial support.,,47,6,7,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

The only continuously accessible source of data on municipal economy since 2014 has been the Ministry of Finance information portal Monitor. Separated into governmental and territorial administration, it enables access to accounting and financial data in aggregate and segmented form. The data are periodically sent to Monitor by governmental organizations via the Central System of State Accounting Information.

At present, trams are usually equipped with the electric drive and electric current is drawn from the trolley line using the trolley booms Unlike rail transport, tram transport is often built within the roads, carries only the passengers and has shorter distances among stops, lighter and shorter vehicles, and shorter transport intervals, etc. In some countries, it is common that tram and rail subsystems are interconnected. Tramways also include the fast trams which are operated in a slightly different way. For example, they are always conducted beside the roads to avoid the congestions, and are also used as a backbone transport mode. Fast tram is most common in the United States of America that were pioneer of a revolution in transport. This revolution represented a fundamental impulse for the globalization initiation in the world. This paper deals with the practical solution and proposals in context of optimizing the timetables within tram subsystem. At the beginning of the paper, individual advantages and disadvantages of tram subsystem from the global conception are presented. The following chapter outlines the theoretical basis regarding the quality evaluation of tram system. The most important part of the paper presents a specific model example to optimize using the heuristic algorithm to coordinate the tram subsystem lines.

Separate from goodwill, the acquirer recognizes research and development assets acquired in a business combination and other intangible assets that meet either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion. Following the above, goodwill disclosed in financial report shall subsume the value of acquired intangible asset that is not identifiable as of the acquisition date. The aim of the article is to identify different assets derived from goodwill disclosed in financial reports prepared by entities doing business in Poland. Literature review concerning economic substance of goodwill precedes the empirical part of the article. A study was carried out on the financial data of one of the biggest company doing business in media sector in Poland. The main research method was analysis of information presented in financial reports prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. As a result of the study authors show that new intangible assets have been disclosed for the last 10 years. Findings show that Polish entities are also incorporated into global financial reporting trends.","[Strojek-Filus, Marzena] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Int Accounting, Ul 1 Maja 50, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; University of Economics in Katowice,"Maruszewska, EW (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Int Accounting, Ul 1 Maja 50, Katowice, Poland.",marzena.strojek@ue.katowice.pl; ewa.maruszewska@ue.katowice.pl,"Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/A-3596-2014","Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/0000-0003-0461-4133",,,,,17,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2151,2158,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800267,0

Although currency exchange is widely observed in the globalized economy, Zhou (1997) is one of the exceptional studies that adopted a search model to generate currency exchange endogenously. Moreover, in her model, currency exchange occurs only in the case where agents rarely consume foreign goods, which is contrary to the well-known fact that international trade increases the number of currency exchanges. We construct a monetary search model that has a feature that increased international trade increases the volume of currency exchange. We develop a two-country model in which each country has two types of agents: local traders who consume only the goods produced in the home country, and international traders who consume only the goods produced in the foreign country. For international traders, the foreign currency gives more opportunity to obtain the foreign goods than the home currency does. Thus, when an international trader holds the home currency, he has an incentive to exchange the home currency for the foreign currency. Unlike Zhou, the model has a feature that currency exchange is more likely to occur when many agents are engaged in international trade.","[Tanaka, Mariko] Musashino Univ, Fac Econ, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1358181, Japan",,"Tanaka, M (通讯作者)，Musashino Univ, Fac Econ, Koto Ku, 3-3-3 Ariake, Tokyo 1358181, Japan.",matanaka@musashino-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS [15K13003]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K13003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to the editor, professor Daniela Puzzello, and two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

It explores the long-and short-term relationships between GDP and government expenditures in these countries. A panel data set of 60 countries over the period from 1976 to 2010 is deployed to implement pooled mean group estimation. Countries are divided into three economic growth rate groups: high, middle, and low. Panel-based/error correction models are used to estimate long-term equilibrium relationships and short-term dynamics between government expenditures and GDP growth rates. Results indicate that the hypothesis of a common long-term elasticity and a short-term dynamic relationship between GDP growth rates and government expenditures cannot be rejected for high group countries, whereas for middle group countries this is true only for the long term, not for the short term. No long-term or short-term relationship between these two variables exists for low-growth-rate countries.","[Tatahi, Motasam] European Business School, London NW1 4NS, England; [Cetin, Emre Ipekci; Cetin, M.

Using five waves of the Community Innovation Survey in Sweden, we have traced the innovative behavior of firms over a decade, that is, from 2002 to 2012. We defined ISs to be either simple or complex (in various degrees). We call an IS a simple IS when firms engage in only one of the four types of Schumpeterian innovations, that is, product, process, marketing, or organizational, while a complex IS is when firms simultaneously engage in more than one type. The main findings indicate that those firms that choose and afford to have complex ISs are better off in terms of their future productivity in comparison with those firms that choose not to innovative (base group) and also in comparison with those firms that choose simple ISs. The results are mostly robust for those complex innovators that have a higher degree of complexity and also keep the balance between technological (product and process) and non-technological (organizational and marketing) innovations.","[Tavassoli, Sam] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Tavassoli, Sam; Karlsson, Charlie] Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Karlsson, Charlie] KTH, CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden; [Karlsson, Charlie] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden",Lund University; Blekinge Institute Technology; Royal Institute of Technology; Jonkoping University,"Tavassoli, S (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.;Tavassoli, S (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden.",sam.tavassoli@circle.lu.se,"Karlsson, Charlie/JQP-0947-2023; Tavassoli, Sam/JXM-6351-2024","Tavassoli, Sam/0000-0002-4581-736X",,,,,65,31,34,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Guided by the lifelong passion for new achievements, they join an organized network of globally successful leaders(2) with the purpose of re-engaging and proving themselves experts once again. Thiy way, with their engagement, they contribute to creation of new leaders. In new business affairs they find new solutions and possibilities for success based on empirical methods proven in practice, but also having respect for competition and new processes of emerging changes. Mentors, guided by passion for success, want to engage themselves in ailing companies, clubs, and various organizations which have problems being competitive or stagnate in development, in order to point to possibilities for prosperity within the worldwide globalization process. Mentors especially want to get involved and engaged in their homelands, in order to contribute the development of their domicile regions. This paper shows, with examples from the practice, various possibilities for mentorship in economy, sport and other organizations. Usually retired, once leaders and now in the roles of mentors, they prepare young talented people to become leaders in the areas they deal with. Mentors from the diaspora, with their life experience and knowledge, they primarily want to help young and inexperienced company leaders, and also other organizations in the country they came from, in order to be more competitive and successful on the world market. The goal of this paper, by using examples from the domestic and foreign practice, is to encourage leaders in the existing or startup companies, cultural, sport, tourist and other organizations to join the organized network of globally successful leaders in order to improve development and placement of products on the world markets. We especially want to emphasize the importance of using mentors from the diaspora, because they have experience and knowledge gained by years of working in the business world.

The choice of the issue was dictated by the significance which was given to human capital in the strategy for the European development till 2020 - Europe 2020. The choice of these two countries was a consequence of the convergence of the indexes characterising the an average level of quality of life (e.g. GDP per capita, the median of earnings, average earnings) with the existing huge disparities in human capital resources, both from the point of view of quantity and quality. The EU became a benchmark enabling the objective assessment of the issue connected with human capital in each of the aforementioned countries. In the paper the following research thesis was considered: the quality of human life depends on the level of education. Higher education (level 5 - 8 of the European Qualification Framework) guarantees the competitive advantage on the labour market and it ensures on attractive and stable employment. The research methods used in this paper were: the critical analysis of the data gained during the literature studies and the Hellwig method. These methods were complemented by the descriptive statistics instruments and the research report from the survey conducted via the Internet in the form of a questionnaire. As the result of the analysis it was indicated that the most important determinant of human capital development (common for Croatia, Poland and also the EU) was higher education. However, the thesis of the research stated before it was conducted was falsified. The analysis of the statistical data concerning people with higher education at the labour market revealed that, especially in Croatia, the percentage of the educated unemployed increases. The research results from the survey conducted at Gdynia Maritime University and the University of Split indicate that a possible source of such a situation is divergence between the educational offer and the expectations of the stakeholders - both employers and students. A change of this situation is necessary to make the development of the European Union smart, sustainable and characterised by social cohesion.","[Wasniewska, Anetta; Skrzeszewska, Katarzyna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland; [Raguz, Ivona Vrdoljak] Univ Dubrovnik, Branitelja Dubrovnika 29, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",Gdynia Maritime University; University of Dubrovnik,"Wasniewska, A (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",a.wasniewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; k.skrzeszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; ivona.vrdoljak@unidu.hr,"Vrdoljak, Ivona/C-9178-2013",,,,,,9,2,2,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,604,613,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600061,0

To do so, we develop a model of price posting and monetary exchange with inflation and finite populations. The model, which provides a game-theoretic foundation to Rocheteau and Wright (2005)'s competitive search monetary equilibrium, is used to derive theoretical propositions regarding the effects of inflation in this environment, which we test with a laboratory experiment that closely implements the theoretical framework. We find that the inflation tax is harmful - with cash holdings, production and welfare all falling as inflation rises - and that its effect is relatively larger at low inflation rates than at higher rates. For instance, for inflation rates between 0% and 5%, welfare in the two markets we consider (2[seller] x 2[buyer] and 3 x 2) falls by roughly 1 percent for each percentage-point rise in inflation, compared with 0.4 percent over the range from 5% to 30%. Our findings lead us to conclude that the impact of the inflation tax should not be underestimated, even under low inflation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Interviews with architects, urban planners and residents from a variety of backgrounds were used to understand city-making and home-making processes. In the first part, the article discusses the framework and process of urban reconstruction in the city of Sarajevo and the city of East Sarajevo, analyzing, how nation building and international capital reshape urban space. In the second part, the article explores how pre-war Sarajevans and displaced people in Sarajevo perceive the city as their home and its spatial and social reconfiguration as part of home-making understood as the process of investing spaces with the meaning of home. The article argues that ambivalence and fluidity reshape the dwelling space defined by post-war settlements and international capital flow with distinctive agendas.","[Badescu, Gruia] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Urban Conflicts Res, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Badescu, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Ctr Urban Conflicts Res, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",gruia.badescu@sjc.ox.ac.uk,,"Badescu, Gruia/0000-0003-0180-8960",Centre for Refugee and IDP Studies (CESI) at the University of Sarajevo,Centre for Refugee and IDP Studies (CESI) at the University of Sarajevo,"The author would like to acknowledge the support of the Centre for Refugee and IDP Studies (CESI) at the University of Sarajevo, particularly Dr. Selma Porobic for this research, as well as the two anonymous reviewers for their comments.",,45,5,5,0,12,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

To this end, we performed a laboratory experiment that proceeded in two parts. The first part involved an individual real-effort task in which subjects could commit themselves to a particular level of performance while being tempted by an alternative recreational activity. The second part consisted of bargaining in a power-to-take game in which previously earned revenues were at stake. The experimental treatments involved variations in the available information provided to peers about previous individual behavior. The results show that many subjects make a serious commitment. Further, the subsequent revelation of commitment level induces subjects to increase the credible components of their commitment decisions. Past individual behaviors also play a role in bargaining because (i) partners who have committed themselves benefit from lower rates of both take and destruction and (ii) partners who have succumbed to temptation suffer from higher rates of both take and destruction.","[Bonein, Aurelie; Denant-Boemont, Laurent] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Denant-Boèmont, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM, Rennes, France.",aurelie.bonein@univ-rennes1.fr; laurent.denant-boemont@univ-rennes1.fr,,"Denant-Boemont, Laurent/0000-0001-8783-1250",French National Agency for Research (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0105-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0105] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Agency for Research (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We are grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions provided by the editor and the two anonymous referees.

Policy makers are acutely aware of the possible adverse economic consequences of such cuts, and an important part of this issue is the regional dimension will policy to reduce emissions exacerbate the already large inter-regional disparities in China, and if so, will some policies be better than others? These issues have received relatively little attention in the literature. We contribute to a better understanding of these issues by exploring the regional economic effects of two sets of policies by which emissions might be reduced: a reduction in the number of permits under a tradable permit system and a subsidy to pollution abatement. We do this in a small two-region theoretical model designed to capture some of the salient features of the Chinese economy and the Chinese tax/expenditure system. We show that there are important regional implications of a national pollution reduction policy and that the preferred policy depends on how disparities are measured, on how the revenue from the sale of permits is spent and on how a subsidy is financed.

In contrast to most studies of this topic, we base our estimates on cross-price elasticities and therefore capture both the income and substitution effects of energy efficiency improvements. Our approach involves estimating a household demand model to obtain price and expenditure elasticities of different goods and services, utilising a multiregional input-output model to estimate the GHG emission intensities of those goods and services, combining the two to estimate direct and indirect rebound effects, and decomposing those effects to reveal the relative contribution of different mechanisms and commodities. We estimate that the total rebound effects are 41% for measures that improve the efficiency of domestic gas use, 48% for electricity use and 78% for vehicle fuel use. The primary source of this rebound is increased consumption of the cheaper energy service (i.e. direct rebound) and this is primarily driven by substitution effects. Our results suggest that the neglect of substitution effects may have led prior research to underestimate the total rebound effect. However, we provide a number of caveats to this conclusion, as well as indicating priorities for future research. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The literature has sought to address this issue using a specific asymmetric function, the so-called Linex loss function. However, is the Linex an actually asymmetric specification? In an attempt to answer this question, we applied the sieve estimation method, a fully nonparametric approach, in which the result could be any proper loss function. This way, our results could corroborate the quadratic or Linex loss functions used in the literature or suggest an entirely new function. We applied the sieve estimation method to the United States and to Brazil, an emergent country which has consistently followed an inflation targeting regime. The economy was modeled with forward-looking agents and central bank commitment. Our results indicate that the FED was more concerned with inflation rates below the target, but no asymmetry was found in the inflation-output process in the Volcker-Greenspan period. As to Brazil, we found asymmetries in output gaps from 2004 onwards, when the Brazilian Central Bank was more concerned with positive output gaps; but we did not find any statistically significant asymmetries in inflation.

Moreover, international trade of both commodities is highly concentrated, with only a few large companies active on both input markets. Given this setting, the paper presented investigates the strategy of quantity-setting (Cournot) mining companies that own both a coking coal and an iron ore division. Do these firms optimize the divisions' output on a firm level or by each division separately (division-by-division)? First, using a theoretical model of two Cournot duopolies of complementary goods, we find that there exists a critical capacity constraint below/above at which firm-level optimization results in identical/superior profits compared with division-level optimization. Second, by applying a spatial multi-input equilibrium simulation model of the coking coal and iron ore markets, we find that due to the limited capacity firms gain no (substantial) additional benefit from optimizing output on a firm level.

I study whether resource-rich countries are able to offset the volatility triggering effects of natural resources by diversifying their economies. Using input-output data, I construct an indicator that captures diversification of the production structure of the economy and density of inter-industry linkages. The results show that resource abundance exerts negative impact on growth through the volatility channel. While the direct effects of natural resources on growth are positive, their adverse indirect effects through volatility could be larger. I find that productive diversification offsets the volatility impact of natural resources. When diversification is controlled for, the negative growth impact of volatility induced by resource abundance disappears. However, the results do not hold true if export concentration measure is used instead of productive diversification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The level itself slowly varies depending upon the corresponding economic situation at the time of consideration. In particular, it turns out to be extraordinary during the peak period of the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis. Based on the concept of stochastic elasticity of variance, this paper develops an asset price model in a multiscale form and applies it to the pricing of European options and verifies a significant improvement over the constant elasticity of variance model in terms of the geometric structure (skew or smirk) of implied volatility. Our result implies that a theoretical model based on the random elasticity can derive market's volatility forecast more accurately than the constant elasticity so that investors can employ a dynamic investment strategy reducing risk more effectively.

In particular, we show that when agents are boundedly rational, altruistic preferences are evolutionarily stable, even in environments that are deemed unfavorable for altruism in the literature. The existing standard result is that when interactions are strategic substitutes and exhibit negative externality, only selfish preferences are evolutionary stable. The key assumption underlying this result is that agents are perfectly rational. Selfish agents are thus able to play the Nash equilibrium, gaining evolutionary advantages over altruists. By relaxing this assumption, we show that altruist preferences can survive among bounded rational agents. The simple intuition is that selfish agents, now with bounded rationality, choose excessive action, which in turn induces altruists to choose an action level closer to the Nash equilibrium an action level evolutionarily stable in the long run. We combine the level-k model of bounded rationality and the standard evolutionary model of altruistic preferences and characterize for the conditions under which altruism can proliferate in the long run.","[Kim, Nayoung; Hwang, Sung-Ha] Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Hwang, SH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",nykim0104@gmail.com; sunghah@sogang.ac.kr,"Hwang, Sung-Ha/A-9942-2017; kim, nayoung/IWV-4038-2023; Hwang, Sung-Ha/AAB-4907-2021",,,,,,26,0,0,0,10,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

However, many issues related to their trading behaviour cannot be addressed without high-frequency changes in institutional ownership. Based on a measure of the trading behaviour of institutional investors by using an institutional account dataset from China, we find that (i) active institutions trade speculatively by taking advantage of individual investors; (ii) individuals buying high and selling low offer liquidity only on average; (iii) foreign investors do not show significant patterns in speculation; and (iv) trading of active institutions significantly affects price. This study casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that institutional or sophisticated investors improve market efficiency by correcting mispricing, and provides direct evidence for institutional investors' speculation behaviour and their destabilising effect on the stock market. Results suggest that regulators in emerging markets should monitor institutions' speculation to bring fairness and justice to the stock market.","[Kong, Dongmin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Kong, Gaowen] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Jinan University,"Kong, DM (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",kongdm@hust.edu.cn,"Kong, Gaowen/GSM-6873-2022; Kong, Dongmin/AAT-2914-2021","Kong, Gaowen/0000-0002-7131-2808",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST-2014AC041],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We thank Steven Koch (the editor), an anonymous reviewer, and Bing Han helpful comments and valuable suggestions.

In a context of imperfect DI screening, the generosity of other social programs can play a role in this decision, and one empirically relevant factor is the availability and generosity of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits. UI's impact on DI applications and enrollment has been ignored in welfare analyses of UI, but I show that it leads to significantly altered results: the optimal level of unemployment benefits increases by about 50%, as more generous UI prevents workers from applying for DI, with significant cost savings to the government. The same logic applies to a wide variety of other social programs and contexts, and in a more general model I show that the impact of any such program on welfare can be expressed in terms of its redistributional effect and its effects on the tax base and on enrollment on other programs.

Beforehand, workers do not know who the discriminating employers are, but a worker with the discriminated against characteristic can avoid the discriminating employers by voluntarily disclosing the characteristic - and he would disclose if the benefit from being more likely to be matched with a nondiscriminating employer exceeds the cost of being more likely to be unemployed.

These experimental techniques can be helpful for informing policy that assigns welfare transfers, especially in the context of endogenous relationships or when impoverished families are omitted from income separability tests due to a lack of non-labor income, which is required for demand analysis of intrahousehold models. A trust game tests for Pareto efficiency, and a newly developed game tests for bargaining by determining if willingness-to-pay for a product changes based on endowment ownership. These games are applied in Salvador, Brazil, to a population not yet studied in the economic intrahousehold literature: adolescent mothers who live with their mothers. Their relationship is key for the welfare of adolescents' children. The game outcomes reject Pareto efficiency but little evidence of bargaining is found. Qualitative survey questions confirm a cooperative relationship.","[Reynolds, Sarah Anne] Cornell Univ Econ, Berkeley, CA 94703 USA",,"Reynolds, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94703 USA.",sar48@berkeley.edu,,"Reynolds, Sarah/0000-0002-2917-4579",Social Science Research Council; Cornell University's Einaudi and Latin American Studies Centers; Universidade de Brasilia,Social Science Research Council; Cornell University's Einaudi and Latin American Studies Centers; Universidade de Brasilia,"Generous funding was provided by the Social Science Research Council and Cornell University's Einaudi and Latin American Studies Centers.

We then characterize the value of information in these games and link it to the underlying parameters of the model. We investigate equilibrium efficiency, complementarities in information choices, and the trade-offs between public and private information. We show that information acquisition can be inefficient and that strategic complementarities in actions do not always translate into strategic complementarities in information acquisition. Finally, we find that public and private information can be complements.

This is particularly important with invasive species, such as the emerald ash borer (EAB), that are destroying ash trees throughout North America. This oversight has potential impacts in terms of increased mortality rates due to a loss of ash trees. To address this issue, we use a health production function to map heterogeneous environmental amenities to changes in health. We find that inclusive of health impacts, management of the EAB is qualitatively different than current practices and varies according to spatial distributions of wealth. This model has policy implications for the optimal management of environmental amenities where a link between nature and health exists.","[Jones, Benjamin A.; McDermott, Shana M.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"McDermott, SM (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mcdermott@unm.edu,,,,,,,23,15,17,1,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

I show this by investigating aggregate fluctuations at the industry level as well as idiosyncratic firm level shocks. By differentiating between temporary and permanent shocks at the firm level, I find that family firms appear to be less anxious to translate temporary shocks into changes in employment. This supports the idea that family firms are able to offer their employees implicit employment protection. Family firms are believed to have longer time horizons, and are as owners more easily identified with their company and its actions.

The main finding is that males affected by the earthquake in utero completed on average 0.5 years less schooling while females affected by the earthquake completed 0.8 years less schooling. Moreover those affected by the earthquake also fare far worse in the marriage market and become parents at a much younger age. In addition children of mothers affected at birth by the earthquake have 0.4 less years of education, while those whose fathers were affected at birth show no effects. Other outcomes also suggest that welfare of the affected individuals has been negatively impacted in the long run.

The model is similar to that of Fougere etal. (2009) and Sadahiro and Shimasawa (2002). It is, however, distinguished from them in several aspects regarding the individual utility function and the intergenerational transmission of human capital. We use the model to explore the effect of population aging on economic growth in Korea. The simulation shows that population aging causes a decrease in labor supply growth and an increase in capital stock growth, thus yielding capital deepening. The aging of the population may significantly undermine growth potential. However, the result is sensitive to the manner of intergenerational transmission of human capital. Our study shows that the mode of social transmission of human capital is quite important for long-term growth of the economy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results for classical business cycles suggest that EME tend to experience much deeper recessions and relatively steeper expansions during almost the same duration. The probability of expansions significantly increases with ERR flexibility. Our results strongly support floating ERR for both advanced and EME other than the East Asian countries. The impacts of external real and financial shocks and domestic variables are significantly greater under managed regimes as compared to floats. Consistent with an argument that high saving rates enhance the ability of a country to maintain an ERR, managed regimes performs better only in the East Asian countries. Supporting the de-coupling literature, external cycles become insignificant for growth under flexible ERR.

Although transparency reveals information about fundamentals, it also increases the precision of the exchange rate as a signal of those fundamentals that remain unknown (the signal-precision effect of transparency). If a central bank announcement reveals little information about fundamentals, then this effect dominates and transparency magnifies misalignment. One implication is that ambiguity can increase the effectiveness of intervention to support a declining currency during times of crisis.","[Fernholz, Ricardo T.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Fernholz, RT (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",rfernholz@cmc.edu,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Poland has had an exemplary experience as a former planned economy that managed the transition to a market economy within a relatively short period of time. The country is characterized by comparatively low R&D expenditures per capita as well as few patent applications, as compared to other European Union countries in the past decade. Aside from the previous literature's focus on industrial and service agglomeration economies, we investigate the impact of agglomeration economies stemming from the R&D sector and innovative activities for the location choices of firms in Poland. We also assess what role accession to the European Union played in this process. We use a panel data set comprising Polish NUTS II regions over the period 2003 to 2010. The analysis differentiates the effects for domestic, foreign, and entrepreneurial firms in the economy and enriches the former literature, which focused on the location decisions of FDI. We find a strong impact of R&D agglomeration economies for the location choices of all firms, a positive impact of EU membership on the location decisions of entrepreneurial firms, a positive impact of innovative activity for the location decisions of foreign firms, and a contingent effect of EU membership on the decisions of foreign firms to locate closer to the German-Polish border.","[Krenz, Astrid] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Gehringer, Agnieszka] Flossbach von Storch Res Inst, Cologne, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Krenz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",astrid.krenz@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,47,3,4,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

However, the informational role of social interaction might be affected by other information channels, which is to a large extent ignored in previous studies. Using a national representative household finance survey data covering more than 8000 Chinese households, we demonstrate that social interaction alone positively affects household stock market participation, but Internet access mitigates the influence of social interaction. In particular, among households with the access to Internet, sociable households in effect are associated with a 6 percentage-point decrease in the probability to participate in the stock market. This finding supports the substitution between Internet access and social interaction as information channels. Moreover, we also identify the social multiplier effect of social interaction: sociable households living in the communities with higher stock market participation rate are more likely to invest in stocks.

The current policy, announced in June 2010, of floating with reference to a basket' made the RMB 25 per cent stronger against a trade-weighted basket by early August 2015, while it was 10 per cent stronger against the US dollar. Thus, 14 percentage points arose from changes in the cross rates of the other currencies, notably from the fall of the euro since December 2014. Devaluation of the RMB by 3 per cent in August 2015 just covered the effective appreciation since December 2014. Effects of the cross rates of other currencies could be eliminated by managing the external value of the RMB with reference to a genuine trade-weighted basket. This could be a suitable intermediary exchange rate regime for China, as the risks associated with free floating are still great. Diversifying further the currency composition of the foreign exchange reserves and other foreign assets of the Chinese government, from US dollars towards euro and yen assets, would be a natural parallel shift. The euro-US dollar-yen exchange rates in late summer 2015 may offer a good opportunity to carry out this move.","Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Oksanen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We analyze the effects of this regulation in a labor market where adverse selection is an issue. Our results suggest that this policy would in fact reduce unemployment and worked hours, but it would also reduce the welfare of affected workers and aggregate welfare. This happens because in the new equilibrium wages are reduced and entry by firms is excessive.

Based on the summary statistics for 22 governance structures, I find that privatized domestic private firms have set up stronger governance than domestic private firms that have not experienced privatization. I propose seven hypotheses to explain the leading performance of privatized firms on corporate governance. I find that while some differences are explained by the diversity of firm-level characteristics, privatized firms' better performance on setting up a board of directors and providing the CEO with company shares is highly robust. Finally, I find strong correlations between local governments' fiscal conditions in the privatization year and privatized firms' governance, which suggests a significant role played by local governments in shaping corporate governance during the privatization process.

J,"Mabsout, R",,,,"Mabsout, Ramzi",,,Abduction and economics: the contributions of Charles Peirce and Herbert Simon,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC METHODOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,abduction; inference; Peirce; Simon; economics,INFERENCE; UNCERTAINTY; EXPLANATION,"A constantly changing social reality means economic theories, even if correct today, need to be constantly revised, updated, or abandoned. To maintain an up-to-date understanding of its subject matter, economists have to continuously assess their theories even those that appear to be empirically corroborated. Economics could gain from a method that describes and is capable of generating novel explanatory hypotheses. A pessimistic view on the existence of such a method was famously articulated by Karl Popper in The Logic of Scientific Discovery. He wrote there is no such a thing as a logical method of having ideas or a logical reconstruction of this process.' Herbert Simon responded to Popper and argued the opposite, namely, that there is a model of discovery and its name is abduction. Simon acknowledges his debt to Charles Peirce - the first modern logician to explicitly formulate a theory of abduction - and explains that abduction is a model of discovery that works as a problem-solving heuristic encoded in a computer program. Although Simon's account of a model of discovery was prescient, Peirce's description of abduction as loose inference is incompatible with an exclusive algorithmic operationalization. The paper also connects Peirce's abduction to explanation in economics and the economic literature on uncertainty. It is argued that explanation, uncertainty, and abduction complement each other and their combination is valuable to economics.","[Mabsout, Ramzi] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Econ, Beirut 110236, Lebanon",American University of Beirut,"Mabsout, R (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Econ, Beirut 110236, Lebanon.",ramzimabsout@gmail.com,,,,,,,76,9,10,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Further, we find that in a choice treatment individuals overwhelmingly prefer the individual incentive to the team incentive, despite the latter being more effective.

In particular, the education level of males and females as well as the local family structure impact the propensity for firms owned by each gender differently.

Our empirical exercise uses microdata for the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires and the estimation strategy applies a quantile regression approach which enables us to identify the characteristics associated with high consumption levels, and presumably, with high energy inefficiency. The two main results of the paper are the relative low importance of income and the high importance of the lack of access to natural gas, i.e. the lack of access to one kind of energy good (natural gas) leads to inefficiencies in the consumption of another energy good (electricity). This evidence suggests that efficiency programs should be targeted to such household groups. Other interesting results are the relevance of air conditioning units as one of the main determinants of high electricity consumption and the preliminary evidence that a move from houses to apartments leads to lower consumption (and very likely, to better energy efficiency levels).","[Hancevic, Pedro] CIDE, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Navajas, Fernando] UBA, Dept Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Navajas, Fernando] UNLP, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Matching detailed individual, household, and community-level surveys with behavioral field experiment data, we are able to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying individual risk taking after natural disasters. In addition to detailed survey data, individual propensity to undertake risk was elicited under a framed experiment setting from 192 respondents in flooded and 192 respondents in non flooded villages matched using propensity data. In the context of rural Punjab, Pakistan, we find that individuals who live in areas affected by the 2010 floods do exhibit higher risk aversion but there is significant individual variation. In addition, individuals who have personal experience of floods in the flooded villages exhibit lower risk aversion pointing toward a mitigating effect of personal experience. In multiple rounds of the experiment, we also find that the change in strategy between rounds depends on the severity of losses experienced and on the number of floods previously experienced in one's lifetime.

Psychological theories of ownership suggest that a special bond between a person and his/her possession arises in response to the innate motivation for effectance, self-identity and need for home. However, current empirical support is insufficient to make a causal link between these psychological needs and feelings of ownership. In four studies (total N > 800), we manipulated people's basic needs by inducing feelings of ostracism, which threatens the needs for belonging, self-esteem, control, and belief in a meaningful existence. Despite the fact that these social needs are closely related to the putative antecedents of feelings of ownership, the ostracism manipulation did not significantly affect participants' feelings of ownership, or their valuations of their possessions, whether measured by willingness to accept or willingness to pay. These results suggest that the special bond that people have with their belongings is not readily used to restore basic psychological needs following the experience of social exclusion.

We use multi-scale correlation analysis based on a modified method of time-dependent intrinsic correlation and the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise for this purpose. Three hypotheses on the type and strength of correlations in the short-, medium- and long-runs were tested. It is shown that price zones significantly differ in internal price-demand correlation structure over the comparable time scales, and not each of the theoretically formulated hypotheses is true for each of them. We can conclude that the answer to the question whether it is necessary to take into account the influence of demand-side on electricity spot prices over different time scales, is significantly dependent on the structure of electricity generation and consumption on the corresponding market.

In both contexts, we find that median group members have a significant impact on the group decision, but the median is not the only influential group member. Non-median members closer to the median tend to have more influence than other members. By investigating the same individual's influence in different groups, we find evidence for relative position in the group having a direct effect on influence. These results are consistent with predictions from spatial models of dynamic bargaining, for members with intermediate levels of patience. We also find that group deliberation involves bargaining and compromise as well as persuasion: preferences tend to shift towards the choice of the individual's previous group, especially for those with extreme individual preferences.

A difficulty arises when inequality among the poor needs to be assessed. The inequality may be analyzed in terms of either incomes or gaps. Depending on what side we focus on, the inequality level comparisons may be contradictory. This paper proposes a reinterpretation of the inequality component involved in the decompositions of well-known poverty indices. The alternative indices we introduce measure equally the income and gap inequality among the poor. The comparisons in inequality as measured by these indices are then independent of the viewpoint.

For a highly stylized specification of our model with private values, two alternatives, and binary, equally likely types we show the optimality of a voting procedure that combines two main elements: (i) there is an arbitrarily chosen default decision and abstention is interpreted as a vote in favor of the default; (ii) voting is sequential and is terminated when a supermajority requirement, which declines over time, is met. We show the optimality of such a voting procedure by arguing that it is first best, that is, it maximizes welfare when equilibrium constraints are ignored, and by showing that individual incentives and social welfare are sufficiently aligned to make a first best procedure incentive compatible. We also provide counterexamples where no first best procedure is incentive compatible when voters' binary types are not equally likely. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The offer was available during an 8-week window, soon after which the digital and CD albums were commercialized at pre-set prices. In this paper, we use weekly music sales data in the US between 2004 and 2012 to examine the effect of Radiohead's innovative strategy on the subsequent sales of the band's albums. We find that Radiohead's PYOP offer had no significant impact on CD album sales. Interestingly, it yielded a higher percentage change in the digital album sales compared what would have been obtained with a conventional release. This suggests that the increase in sales due to the vast media attention generated by the offer strategy must have dominated the cannibalization effect. Consequently, the PYOP offer had a positive impact on sales revenues, even if one assumes no revenues were obtained directly from the PYOP downloads. However, this success story does not readily apply to similar strategies adopted by other bands. We show that Nine Inch Nail's free provision of its new album, The Slip, decreased digital album sales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The paper points out the emergence of an innovative concept of services which is highly relevant but whose consequences may not be fully understood. This new perspective helps to focus on the true nature of services, but it also redefines the borders between services and goods. The paper addresses the problems left unresolved, or brought in, by the revisions. Furthermore, it studies the treatment of non-financial services in the BOP as compared to the SNA. Although the two approaches have been rendered more compatible, the BOP still incorporates several inconsistencies. The hesitancy to completely implement the new services definition tends to somewhat blur the measurement of trade in services.","[Broussolle, Damien] Univ Strasbourg LARGE, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Broussolle, D (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, Econ, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",damien.broussolle@unistra.fr,,,,,,,21,4,4,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The authors examine this empirically using firm-level data for 28 emerging market economies and find robust evidence that outsourcing increases the likelihood to spend on R&D and via this channel raises innovation output, whereas importing increases innovation output, but not R&D. The results hold when implementing an instrumental variables approach. It is found that results crucially depend on the institutional environment in the economy, e.g. property rights and intellectual property rights protection. The results suggest that better institutions magnify the gains from importing, but not from outsourcing.

One often neglected aspect is the prevalence of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China's exports, for which a substantial portion of benefits return to the investing countries. In this paper, we revisit China's export-related CO2 emission responsibilities by viewing them from a new, gross national income perspective. Using a recently developed environmental input output framework, one which distinguishes firms by ownership and trade mode, we find that China's CO2 emissions responsibility for each Yuan of national income from FIE exports, is actually higher than that attributable to Chinese owned enterprise (COE) exports. The result has a somewhat surprising implication: it suggests another source of conflict between China's and global interest in reducing CO2 emissions. From a purely Chinese (as opposed to global) standpoint, a higher share of exports by COEs rather than FIEs is favorable, even though COEs emit more CO2 when producing each unit of exports. This finding should sound an additional warning to those who still think that global climate change mitigation can be effectively pursued by allocating country-by-country emissions responsibility.

To do this we undertake a systematic comparison of a penalty based on the cartel overcharge with three other penalty regimes: fixed penalties, penalties based on revenue, and penalties based on profits. Our analysis is the first to compare these regimes in terms of their impact on both (i) the prices charged by those cartels that do form and (ii) the number of stable cartels that form (deterrence). We show that the class of penalties based on profits is identical to the class of fixed penalties in all welfare-relevant respects. For the other three types of penalty we show that, for those cartels that do form, penalties based on the overcharge produce lower prices than those based on profit) while penalties based on revenue produce the highest prices. Further, in conjunction with the above result, our analysis of cartel stability (and thus deterrence), shows that penalties based on the overcharge out-perform those based on profits, which in turn out-perform those based on revenue in terms of their impact on each of the following welfare criteria: (a) average overcharge, (b) average consumer surplus, and (c) average total welfare.

When modeled as predator-prey dynamics, economic activity in OECD countries is weakly profit-led. Convergence to a long-run equilibrium is relatively slow delaying the profit-squeeze stage for many years. Our 'race to the bottom' model suggests that the OECD countries have been engaged in undercutting each other's real unit labour costs. An extension of the model shows that the long-run equilibrium has been shifting south-west towards a lower wage share. It may even be that this race has the undesirable consequence of decreasing economic activity.","[Kiefer, David; Rada, Codrina] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Rada, C (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, 260 S Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",rada@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,36,82,92,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The Regional Entrepreneurship and Development Index (REDI) has been constructed for capturing the individual efforts, and their contextual features, of entrepreneurship across regions. The REDI method builds on a Systems of Entrepreneurship Theory and provides a way to profile Regional Systems of Entrepreneurship. Important aspects of the REDI method include the Penalty for Bottleneck analysis, which helps in identifying constraining factors in Regional Systems of Entrepreneurship, and Policy Portfolio Optimisation analysis, which helps policymakers consider trade-offs between alternative policy scenarios and associated allocations of policy resources. The paper describes the entrepreneurial disparities amongst Hungarian regions and provides public policy suggestions to improve the level of entrepreneurship and to optimise resource allocation over the 14 pillars of entrepreneurship in the seven Hungarian regions.","[Komlosi, Eva; Szerb, Laszlo] Univ Pecs, MTA PTE Innovat & Econ Growth Res Grp, Pecs, Hungary; [Szerb, Laszlo] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Pecs, Hungary; [Szerb, Laszlo] Dept Management Sci, Pecs, Hungary; [Acs, Zoltan J.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Pecs; University of Pecs; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Groningen,"Komlósi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, MTA PTE Innovat & Econ Growth Res Grp, Pecs, Hungary.",komlosieva@ktk.pte.hu; szerb@ktk.pte.hu; mailz.j.acs@lse.ac.uk; r.ortega.argiles@rug.nl,"Laszlo, Szerb/AAC-5918-2022; acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020","Laszlo, Szerb/0000-0002-6964-7422; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230",MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth research group [14121],MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth research group,"The research underlying this study was supported by the MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth research group, project number 14121, for which we are grateful.",,39,3,3,2,29,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Because an agent with a summary statistic cannot correct for the fact that earlier actions influenced later ones, even a small presence of old actions in the statistic can introduce very persistent errors. Depending on how fast these old actions fade from view, social learning can either be as fast as if agents' private information were pooled (rate n) or it can slow to a crawl (rate ln n). Consistent with Vives (1993), the fastest possible rate of learning falls to rate n((1/3)) if actions are also observed with noise, but may be much slower. Increasing the sample size of the summary statistic does not lead to faster asymptotic learning and may reduce short run welfare.

In fact, key authors in the study of the role of ethical norms in economic behavior like Amartya Sen argue that evolutionary game theory could contribute much to the study of social norms and behavior. Others have suggested that evolutionary game theory could be most helpful for formalizing the work of classic authors in evolutionary and institutional economics like Thorstein Veblen. Here I discuss the behavioral assumptions of evolutionary game theory models, and Jorgen Weibull's approach in particular. I will argue that Weibull's models, and evolutionary game theory in general, pose overly strong restrictions on the explanation of human behavior, which limit the potential of evolutionary explanation. I also suggest Tony Lawson's population-variety-reproduction-selection (PVRS) model as an alternative evolutionary framework that can successfully accommodate developments in behavioral economics, while also providing a solution to important critiques of Darwinian evolutionary analysis made by Richard Nelson, among others.","[Martins, Nuno] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Sch Econ & Management, Econ, Porto, Portugal; [Martins, Nuno] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Ctr Estudos Gestao & Econ, Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Martins, N (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Sch Econ & Management, Econ, Porto, Portugal.",,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,35,5,6,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We explore the underlying mechanics of debt sustainability analysis and show that the standard model is inappropriate for Greece since it ignores the highly concessional terms of Greek debt. Greek debt has been restructured repeatedly, and now two-thirds of the stock contains grant elements of about 54 percent. The present value of outstanding Greek debt is currently about 100 percent of GDP and will rise to about 120 percent under the new program. Greek debt sustainability therefore is less a problem of the debt stock. By simulating different paths of the gross financing needs, we show that there may be liquidity problems over the medium to long terms (in particular, in 2035 and beyond). However, our estimation of the financing need is subject to high uncertainty and mainly depends on whether Greece will be able to regain access to markets at reasonable terms.","[Schumacher, Julian] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [di Mauro, Beatrice Weder] INSEAD, Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; INSEAD Business School,"Schumacher, J (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany.",,,,,,,,49,7,7,1,15,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Consumers bear these expenses directly or indirectly through higher prices for renewable energy or taxes. The number of studies published over the last few years focusing on people's preferences for renewables has increased steadily, making it more and more difficult to identify key explanatory factors that determine people's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for renewables. We present results of a meta-regression on valuation of consumer preferences for a larger share of renewable energy in their electricity mix. Our meta-regression results reveal a number of important factors that explain the differences in WTP values for renewable energy. Different valuation methods show widely different values, with choice experiments producing the highest estimates. Our results further indicate that consumers' WTP for green electricity differs by source, with hydropower being the least valued. Variables that are often omitted from primary valuation studies are important in explaining differences in values. These variables describe individual and household characteristics as well as information on the type of power plant that will be replaced by renewables. Further, the marginal effect of a survey conducted in the US is pronounced. We also assess the potential for using the results for out-of-sample value transfer and find a median error of 21%.

Studying saving behavior in the Netherlands is informative because of the very different institutional background compared to the US, for which most of the empirical evidence is. In the Netherlands, the generous pension system and almost complete coverage of the public health- and long-term care insurance system makes precautionary saving less necessary. Using detailed administrative data, we present evidence on the extent to which the financial resources of retirees are affected by shocks such as the decease of a spouse or deteriorating health-similar to recent empirical studies by Poterba et al. (Explorations in the economics of aging. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp 23-69, 2011; Investigations in the economics of aging. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp 21-69, 2012; Discoveries in the economics of aging. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp 159-186, 2014) for the US. Moreover, we examine the extent to which retirees who do not experience any shocks are able to keep positive wealth at their disposal and sustain their consumption level during retirement. Our results show that the death of the spouse results in a significant reduction of household wealth compared to surviving couples-which is also found in the US-while health shocks result in higher household savings in old-age due to the almost complete coverage of health care expenditures. Although retirees in the Netherlands face limited uncertainty about health expenditures, our analysis shows that the elderly, on average, keep large amounts of assets even at a very old age. Our findings suggest that (1) the generous pension benefits are protective of household wealth, (2) illiquid housing wealth constrains the decumulation of household wealth, (3) bequests and transfers after the death of the first spouse are important.","[van Ooijen, Raun; Alessie, Rob] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [van Ooijen, Raun; Alessie, Rob; Kalwij, Adriaan] Netspar, Groningen, Netherlands; [Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Utrecht University,"Alessie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",r.van.ooijen@rug.nl; r.j.m.alessie@rug.nl; a.s.kalwij@uu.nl,,"van Ooijen, Raun/0000-0002-0654-5568; Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753",,,,,85,25,26,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2015,163,3,,,,,353,404,,10.1007/s10645-015-9254-z,0.0,,,52,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN8BQ,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358662400005,0

These results rely heavily on the fact that bequests benefit both the donor and the recipient, creating an externality that is not taken into account by donors. The double counting of the benefits of bequests is questionable on normative grounds. We study the consequences for bequest taxation of giving less than full social weight to the benefit to donors. We analyse a simple model of parents and children with different skills where parents differ in their preferences for bequests. The government implements nonlinear income taxes on both parents and children as well as a linear inheritance tax and gives differential linear bequest tax credits to donor parents based on income. The nonlinear income taxes take standard forms. The inheritance tax and bequest tax credits are of indeterminate absolute level and together determine the effective price of net bequests. This effective price plays both externality-correcting and redistributive roles. The optimal effective price will depend on the social weight given to donor benefits and the share of donors of a given skill type.","[Boadway, Robin] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Cuff, Katherine] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",Queens University - Canada; McMaster University,"Cuff, K (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",boadwayr@econ.queensu.ca; cuffk@mcmaster.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chair Programme,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canada Research Chair Programme(Canada Research Chairs),"The authors thank two anonymous referees and the guest editor of this special issue, Monika Butler, for their helpful comments.

We use an experimental moonlighting game with a sample of the U.S. population, over sampling immigrants, to observe interactions between immigrants and native-born Americans in a social dilemma situation that can elicit both benevolent and malevolent actions. We survey participants in order to relate outcomes in the moonlighting game to demographic characteristics and traditional, survey-based measures of trust and trustworthiness and show that they are strongly correlated. Overall, we find that immigrants are as trusting as native-born U.S. citizens when they interact with native-born citizens but do not trust other immigrants. Immigrants appear to be less trustworthy overall but this finding disappears when we control for demographic variables.

I develop a general equilibrium model in which labor market frictions prevent the costless adjustment of employment. Financial frictions arise from an imperfect enforcement contract. An environment in which borrowing limits are linked to the firm's physical capital stock can quantitatively account for the sluggish response of labor market variables to productivity shocks. I find that fluctuations in those variables are mainly driven by changes in financial conditions. The model can explain 75% of the variation in job creation observed in the data, and it can also account for the persistent reduction in both output and leverage that follows a contraction in credit availability.

We show that, given a social norm regarding minimum contributions, a pay-what-you-want firm should announce a minimum suggested contribution, which is positive but smaller than the profit-maximizing single price so as to benefit from -endogenous price discrimination, whereby consumers differentially contribute more than the suggested minimum. Furthermore, a pay-what-you-want scheme can improve market efficiency and, in special cases, generate more profit than a standard posted price scheme.

The threat of imprisonment allows the state to pay a lower wage outside the Gulag than otherwise, thereby raising the surplus left over for investment: this externality provides a reason for coercion over and above the direct productivity of those in custody. Just how credible the threat of imprisonment was under Stalin is documented using archival data now available; but the enormous scale of random imprisonment involved is, we argue, attributable not to economic factors but to Stalin's insecurity in the absence of a legitimate process for succession. We develop a model of demand and supply for industrial labour in such a command economy. To get more resources for investment or war, the state depresses the level of real wages; to avoid incentive problems in the wider economy, the harshness of prison conditions can be intensified. This is the logic of coercion we analyse. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (3) (2015) 531-548. University of Warwick, UK; Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPA), UK.

The study design featured a unique two-stage lottery-based allocation of vouchers that created both student-level and market-level experiments, which allows us to study the individual and the aggregate effects of school choice (including spillovers). After two and four years of the program, we find no difference between test scores of lottery winners and losers on Telugu (native language), math, English, and science/social studies, suggesting that the large cross-sectional differences in test scores across public and private schools mostly reflect omitted variables. However, private schools also teach Hindi, which is not taught by the public schools, and lottery winners have much higher test scores in Hindi. Furthermore, the mean cost per student in the private schools in our sample was less than a third of the cost in public schools. Thus, private schools in this setting deliver slightly better test score gains than their public counterparts (better on Hindi and same in other subjects), and do so at a substantially lower cost per student. Finally, we find no evidence of spillovers on public school students who do not apply for the voucher, or on private school students, suggesting that the positive effects on voucher winners did not come at the expense of other students.","[Muralidharan, Karthik; Sundararaman, Venkatesh] Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Bur Econ Res, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, World Bank, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; The World Bank,"Muralidharan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Bur Econ Res, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, World Bank, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,,,,,,,68,126,157,1,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Poverty is discussed not only in terms of wage earnings, but also in relation to employment conditions, social challenges that pile up together with income poverty, and intergenerational mobility. The paper finds that notwithstanding improvements in early decades, after fifty years, the problems of a social divide and poverty have come full circle. Social policy in Singapore retains its fundamentally productivist philosophical orientation, but the recent deterioration in poverty, inequality and mobility trends is leading to adoption of more welfare-oriented and universalist policy solutions. Social inclusion is now a national priority, and policy redirection for the future needs to take place in wide-ranging policy domains, including the labor market and economic growth.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Social Work, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Ng, IYH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Social Work, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",swknyhi@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,49,20,21,1,33,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

In particular, the panel quantile regression model is considered to explain the heterogeneous behavior of the FDI outflow; (ii) compare the major factors between the pollution intensive manufacturing industry and the non-pollution intensive manufacturing industry, and (iii) examine whether different levels of FDI outflow from a host country are differently related to FDI outflow reasons relating to both the gravity theory and PHH: Using annual panel data for the period of 2002-2012, we find that the determinants of FDI outflow differ based on the level of FDI outflows. Classical panel data analysis showed no different FDI outflow factors between the pollution and non-pollution industries, yet the panel quantile regression model showed different FDI outflow factors for the pollution and non-pollution industries. These findings provide meaningful options for policy makers and business practitioners to consider to further refine their plans to help the related stakeholders.","[Park, Sung Y.] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Kim, ChungAh; Song, Min Kyung] Gachon Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Songnam 461701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Gachon University,"Kim, C (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Dept Tourism Management, 1342 Seongnam Daero, Songnam 461701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",sungpark@cau.ac.la; cainkr@gachon.ac.kr; smk603@gachon.ac.kr,,"Park, Sung Yong/0000-0001-9149-7603",Chung-Ang University,Chung-Ang University(Chung Ang University),This Research was supported by the Chung-Ang University Research Grants of 2014.,,32,4,4,0,38,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

In theory, the program creates a poverty trap, with 100% benefit withdrawal rate (BWR). But is that what we see in practice? The paper proposes an econometric method of estimating the mean BWR allowing for incentive effects, measurement errors and correlated latent heterogeneity. Under the method's identifying assumptions, a feasible instrumental variables estimator corrects for incentive effects and measurement errors, and provides a bound for the true value when there is correlated incidence heterogeneity. The results suggest that past methods of assessing benefit incidence using either nominal official rates or raw tabulations from survey data are deceptive. The actual BWR appears to be much lower than the formal rate and is likely to be too low in the light of the literature on optimal income taxation. The paper discusses likely reasons based on qualitative observations from field work. The program's local implementation appears to matter far more than incentives implied by its formal rules.

Making use of a model of a small open economy with one monopolistically competitive industry, we derive conditions under which an exogenous increase in the world price of the monopolistically competitive good, arising from a shift in demand, is conflict generating between the owners of unskilled and skilled labour in the short run but Pareto improving in the long run. Output adjustments at the intensive margin make for conflict generation, but the converse holds for adjustments at the extensive margin in the long run. The analysis highlights the importance of the induced increase in the number of domestic varieties and of the skilled labour intensity in the production of goods relative to its intensity in the setting up of firms.

Preferences for particular car types, properties, and brands were studied. The data indicated only a slight correspondence between the personality dimensions of the Big-Five model and car preference. However, individual motives for car use and materialistic values predict preferences for certain car types and even more for car brands. The results demonstrated a clearly defined group of individuals who prefer cars with high performance. These individuals prefer German cars of prestigious brands, such as Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. For these individuals, affective motives, as well as materialistic values are important cues for car use and preference. These findings are discussed in terms of more sustainable modes of travel and campaigns to promote sustainable travel modes.

We begin by incorporating welfare into a theoretical model of the transmission of work-welfare norms across generations. Consistent with the predictions of this model, we find evidence that youths' attitudes towards work and welfare may be influenced by socialization within their families. Young people are more likely to oppose generous social benefits and to believe that social inequality stems from individual characteristics if i) their mothers support these views; ii) their mothers were employed while they were growing up; and iii) their families never received welfare. Finally, youths' work-welfare norms appear to be unrelated to their neighbors' welfare receipt suggesting that socialization occurs primarily within families rather than within neighborhoods.","[Baron, Juan D.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Berlin, Germany; [Erkal, Nisvan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",The World Bank; University of Melbourne; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Melbourne,"Erkal, N (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",juandbaron@gmail.com; d.cobb-clark@unimelb.edu.au; n.erkal@unimelb.edu.au,"Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013","Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886","Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations; Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; Australian Research Council [LP0347164]; Australian Research Council [LP0347164] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","The authors would like to thank Jeff Borland, John Creedy, David Ribar, Konstantinos Tatsiramos, Arthur van Soest, and participants at the 2007 Labour Econometrics Workshop (LEW) as well as at seminars at the University of Melbourne, the University of Copenhagen, Maastricht University, Universitat Regensburg, Universitat Erlangen-Nuremberg, Tilburg University, University of Zurich and IZA for many valuable comments and suggestions.

Both firms in the market, the up-stream manufacturer and the down-stream retailer, can be socially concerned. Firm's social concern is modeled through a broader firm objective. In addition to their profit both firms also care about a share of consumer surplus. In our two stage game, at first the manufacturer fixes the wholesale price per quantity, which has to be paid by the retailer. Subsequently, the retailer chooses the optimal quantity. First, the game is analyzed for exogenous levels of social concern for both firms. Afterwards, both firms are able to choose endogenously their respective level of social concern. The results show that firm's social concern increases firm profit for the manufacturer as well as the retailer's profit. Moreover, the firms' broader objective function softens the classical double marginalization problem, because in equilibrium all market participants, consumers included, are better off compared to a bilateral monopoly with two pure profit-maximizing firms. Therefore, firms' social responsibility results in a Pareto improvement.","[Brand, Bjoern] Graz Univ, Dept Org & Econ Inst, Graz, Austria; [Grothe, Michael] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ & Business Adm, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Graz; University of Bielefeld,"Brand, B (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Org & Econ Inst, Graz, Austria.",mail@bjoern-brand.com; mgrothe@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,,39,49,51,0,21,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Furthermore, we exploit information relating to whether or not parents encourage their children to donate to charity by talking to them about donating in order to unveil information related to the intergenerational transmission of philanthropic behaviour. Our findings suggest that an intergenerational correlation is only present in the absence of a control for whether the parent talks to the child about donating.

We show that, if the contribution cost is moderate (neither too high nor too low), cooperation can invade and dominate the population if, and only if, group cohesion displays an intermediate value. This reflects an interesting non-monotonicity of cohesion in the evolution of altruism: while some of it is needed to internalize the benefits of cooperation, too much cohesion prevents the spread of altruism among the population at large.

We compare the marriage, childbearing, school enrollment and employment decisions of women who gain greater access to garment sector jobs to women living further away from factories, to years before the factories arrive close to some villages, and to the marriage and enrollment decisions of their male siblings. Girls exposed to the garment sector delay marriage and childbirth. This stems from (a) young girls becoming more likely to be enrolled in school after garment jobs (which reward literacy and numeracy) arrive, and (b) older girls becoming more likely to be employed outside the home in garment-proximate villages. The demand for education generated through manufacturing growth appears to have a much larger effect on female educational attainment compared to a large-scale government conditional cash transfer program to encourage female schooling.

We conduct a choice experiment of consumer-stated preferences on the basis of an online survey in four US states and Japan after the Fulcushima nuclear plant accident. First, the results suggest that US consumers' willingness to pay for a 1% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions is $0.31 per month, which is similar to the results for the US a decade ago. Japanese consumers show a slightly lower willingness to pay of $0.26 per month. Second, the average consumer in both countries expresses a negative preference for increases in nuclear power in the fuel mix (to a greater extent in Japan). Third, renewable energy sources were endorsed by both US and Japanese consumers, who show a willingness to pay $0.71 and $031 per month for a 1% increase in the use of renewable source energy. This study also examines the differences in respondents' characteristics. Approximately 60% of the US respondents who did not change their perception concerning the use of nuclear energy subsequent to the Fukushima nuclear crisis have almost no preference for variation in nuclear power, which is in stark contrast to the Japanese respondents' opposition to nuclear energy.

Flexible acquisition means that players choose not only how much but also what kind of information to acquire. Information acquisition has a cost proportional to reduction of entropy. Hence, players will collect the information most relevant to their welfare but can be rationally inattentive to other aspects of the fundamental. When information is cheap, this flexibility enables players to acquire information that makes efficient coordination possible, which also leads to multiple equilibria. This result contrasts with the global game literature, where information structure is less flexible and cheap information leads to a unique equilibrium with inefficient coordination.

Even though those in employment are better off than the unemployed poor, macroeconomic data indicate that labour's share in gross value added has declined significantly during the first two decades following the first democratic election in 1994. A falling share of labour in income also means, by definition, that average labour productivity growth outstrips real wages growth. Data for South Africa suggest that productivity has indeed increased faster than wages in South Africa. This article argues that financialisation and more aggressive returns-oriented investment strategies applied by for instance large investment institutions translated into higher required rates of return on capital, which in turn caused an increased implementation of capital-augmenting labour-saving technology that reduces labour's share in income.","Univ Orange Free State, Dept Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Burger, P (通讯作者)，Univ Orange Free State, Dept Econ, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",BurgerP@ufs.ac.za,,"Burger, Philippe/0000-0001-6820-1130",,,,,17,6,10,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This study examines the potential impact of social fathers on children's health and behavioral outcomes. The current family and health literature mostly focuses on the impact of social fathers on the well-being of older children or adolescents. Using the data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we examine the health and behavioral outcomes of younger children (3-year olds) whose mothers marry (or live with) social fathers after the children are born. Moreover, most of the past studies neglect the self-selection problem; we apply the propensity score matching method to address the sample bias issue of the child's mother self-selecting to have a new partner. We found that children with social fathers did not differ significantly in terms of the probability of having asthma, measures of depressive, aggressive behavior and positive attitude, from children living with only biological mothers.","[Chan, Kwok Ho; Fung, Ka Wai Terence] United Int Coll, Div Business & Management, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Demir, Ender] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Tourism, Istanbul, Turkey",Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College; Istanbul Medeniyet University,"Fung, KWT (通讯作者)，United Int Coll, Div Business & Management, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",thomaschan@uic.edu.hk; econfkw@hotmail.com; ender.demir@medeniyet.edu.tr,"Demir, Ender/J-8808-2017","Demir, Ender/0000-0003-4034-269X; Chan, Kwok Ho/0000-0001-9113-1943",,,,,60,2,4,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In this study, we provide an insight to the use of copula functions, particularly addressing the key question of why Gaussian copulas caused so much instability during 2007-08. We empirically demonstrate that using an Archimedean copula, particularly the Gumbel, it is more efficient in capturing the top right hand side tail-dependencies, thereby illustrating the impact of fat-tails on non-linear parameters. This finding has significant implications for banks and their capital management requirements, particularly banks employing the Advanced Internal Rate-Based method.

The present study analyzes how this pattern changed between 1995 and 2009, by focusing on the ratio of value added through export of the intermediate goods with respect to value added induced by total exports (VSI) and the ratio of domestic value added due to final demand of the trading partner relative to total exports to that region (VAX). Using our new index of vertical specialization, VSI, we examine the extent to which the rise of the Chinese economy has changed East Asia's role in the global value chain. Our analysis shows that an increasing visibility of China in the global production network has been accompanied by a higher share of intermediate exports, even though China's VSI ratio is still lower than that of Japan or Korea. Meanwhile, the VAX ratio has fallen for all three countries in pairwise trade with one another, much faster than in inter-regional trade with other regions. Vertical specialization has progressed in the major exporting industries in China, Japan and Korea. This seems to reflect the strengthening ability of East Asia to create value added, in contrast to advanced countries in Europe and North America.","[Kwon, Taehyun; Ryou, Jai-Won] Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 143701, South Korea; [Kwon, Taehyun] Bank Korea, Seoul 143701, South Korea",Konkuk University; Bank of Korea,"Ryou, JW (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 143701, South Korea.",govjai@konkuk.ac.kr,,"Ryou, Jai-Won/0000-0002-6157-9322",,,,,18,14,17,1,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

In addition, the paper compares price-setting behaviour in Lesotho and South Africa using a comparable set of products. The findings reveal considerable heterogeneity in price-setting behaviour across products, outlets, locations and time. Variations in inflation are strongly correlated with the average size of price changes, but rising inflation raises the frequency of price increases and reduces the frequency of price decreases. Price decreases constitute an important determinant of inflation movements. Surprisingly, the frequency and size of price changes in Lesotho differ substantially from those in South Africa, despite the presence of common retail chains and their joint membership in a customs union and common monetary area. These findings open up opportunities for further research into the sources of heterogeneity across products and Lesotho and South Africa in the setting of prices.","[Nchake, Mamello Amelia] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Edwards, Lawrence] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Southern Africa Labour Dev Res Unit, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Edwards, Lawrence] Univ Cape Town, Policy Res Int Serv & Mfg, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Rankin, Neil] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; Stellenbosch University,"Nchake, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",mamello.nchake@uct.ac.za; Lawrence.Edwards@uct.ac.za; neilrankin@sun.ac.za,"Nchake, Mamello/AAR-2032-2021","NCHAKE, MAMELLO AMELIA/0000-0001-5028-3270; Edwards, Lawrence/0000-0002-2039-8920",Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries (PEDL) research initiative of the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) [223]; Economic Research Southern Africa; African Economic Research Consortium,Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries (PEDL) research initiative of the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); Economic Research Southern Africa; African Economic Research Consortium,"We are grateful for the Exploratory Research Grant (ref. 223) provided by the Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries (PEDL) research initiative of the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and the Department for International Development (DFID).

This paper considers an alternative approach by developing and testing a theoretical model for term life insurance demand by married households over age 50. Allowing for joint, cooperative decision making between spouses, empirical findings show that increasing the relative bargaining power of husbands results in reductions in the size of the insurance policies covering the lives of husbands in a manner consistent with theory. The intuition is that households reallocate resources to states of nature that husbands place greater weight by reducing the amount spent on purchasing insurance covering the lives of husbands. In contrast, marital bargaining power generally has a substantially smaller effect in the demand for life insurance covering the lives of wives. However, when bargaining power is shifted towards husbands, life insurance coverage increases among the subsample of wives who provide a large proportion of total household income and are more likely to require protection against lost future income in the event of death.","[Wong, Edwin S.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wong, E (通讯作者)，Northwest Ctr Outcomes Res Older Adults, Dept Vet Affairs, 1100 Olive Way,Suite 1400, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",eswong@uw.edu,,,U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development,U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development(US Department of Veterans Affairs),"This paper is based on a part of my doctoral dissertation accepted by University of Washington, Seattle.

There is a worldwide interest to extend its sustainable production significantly in a decade to come. However, the cultivation of energy crops is very site-specific and the exploitation of SRC biomass is a relatively new trend in biomass application for heat and power production with little information on its cultivation patterns and appropriate combustion technologies. In fact, documented biomass conversion technologies' impacts in the energy sector and their commercialisation are limited. This paper aims to present a summary of technical characteristics for different biomass conversion technologies. These characteristics are not necessarily unique to all types and possible modifications of the biomass conversion technologies applied for many countries. However, the lack of technical knowledge have created situations that were previously impossible to be solved without the aid of numerous research and development activities. The developers did not capture all of the economic benefits that the technology provides which would help to reach its technical accomplishment and commercial execution.","[Raslavicius, Laurencas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Transport Engn, LT-51424 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Azzopardi, Brian] Malta Coll Arts Sci & Technol MCAST, Inst Elect & Elect Engn, Triq Kordin 9032, Paola Pla, Malta; [Azzopardi, Brian] Oxford Brookes Univ, Fac Technol Design & Environm, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Azzopardi, Brian] Brian Azzopardi & Associates Consulting Firm, Birkirkara, Malta; [Kopeyka, Aleksandr K.] Odessa II Mechnikov Natl Univ, UA-65026 Odessa, Ukraine; [Saparauskas, Jonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Oxford Brookes University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odesa I.

In some instances, the decision maker may have to deal with the problems in which only partial information and uncertain preference relation is available. Consequently, the decision maker may provide interval fuzzy preference relation with incomplete information. In this paper, we focus our attention on the investigation of incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation. We first extend a characterization to the interval fuzzy preference relation which is based on the additive transitivity property. Using the characterization, we propose a method to construct interval additive consistent fuzzy preference relations from a set of n-1 preference data. The study reveals that the proposed method can not only alleviate the comparisons, but also ensure interval preference relations with the additive consistent property. We also develop a novel procedure to deal with the analytic hierarchy problem for group decision making with incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated and a supplier selection case in supply chain management is investigated using the proposed method.","[Xu, Yejun; Wang, Huimin] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yejun; Tao, Feifei; Wang, Huimin] HoHai Univ, Business Sch, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Patnayakuni, Ravi] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ & IS, Huntsville, AL 35763 USA",Hohai University; Hohai University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville,"Xu, YJ (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xuyejohn@163.com,"wang, huimin/HDM-8421-2022; wang, hao/HSE-7975-2023; Patnayakuni, Ravi/IUM-7882-2023; WANG, HUIYUAN/IXX-2427-2023; wang, hui/GRS-4730-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71101043]; major project of the national Social Science Fund of China [12ZD214]; International Academic Cooperation Team Development Foundation of Business School, Hohai University [UAH-2011-181]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); major project of the national Social Science Fund of China; International Academic Cooperation Team Development Foundation of Business School, Hohai University","The authors is very grateful to three anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments and suggestions that have led to an improved version of this paper.

Even though there is some evidence of state dependence, in the sense that transitions are relatively infrequent, we do find that these are significant, especially in the direction of fixity. Our testing procedure employs the Wilson (1927) statistic, which is appropriate for drawing inference based on relatively rare events.

We conclude that unlike the Bayesian value allocation approach in Krasa Yannelis (Econometrica 62(4):881-900, 1994), incentive compatibility is related to efficiency rather than to direct exchange of information.","[Angelopoulos, Angelos; Koutsougeras, Leonidas C.] Univ Manchester, Econ, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Koutsougeras, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",leonidas@manchester.ac.uk,,"Koutsougeras, Leonidas/0000-0003-1287-244X",,,,,21,17,18,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Specifically, we assume that agents are ex ante identical and their best response activity, as well as their value function, increases (strictly) concavely in the total activity of their neighbors in the network. There exists a unique and stable positive activity equilibrium on exogenous networks under mild conditions. When we endogenize network formation, equilibria become strongly structured: more active players have more neighbors, i.e., a higher degree, but tend to sponsor fewer links. Additionally, in strict equilibria, agents separate themselves into groups characterized by the symmetric activity of their members. The characteristic activity decreases in group size and the network is a complete multipartite graph.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Baetz, O (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",o.baetz@gmx.de,,,ESRC; Cambridge European Trust,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Cambridge European Trust,"This paper is based on a chapter of my Ph.D. dissertation submitted to the University of Cambridge, March, 2013.

The analysis covers 107 countries and 79 episodes of public debt reduction driven by discretionary fiscal adjustments during the 1980-2012 period. It shows that expenditure-based, front-loaded fiscal adjustments can dampen growth when there are credit supply restrictions. Instead, fiscal adjustments that are gradual and rely on a mix of revenue and expenditure measures can support output expansion, while reducing public debt. In this context, protecting public investment is critical for medium-term growth, as is the implementation of supply-side, productivity-enhancing reforms.","[Gupta, Sanjeev; Mulas-Granados, Carlos] IMF, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Baldacci, Emanuele] Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, I-00184 Rome, Italy",International Monetary Fund,"Mulas-Granados, C (通讯作者)，IMF, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",baldacci@istat.it; sgupta@imf.org; cmulasgranados@imf.org,,,,,,,36,10,11,0,8,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

In many dimensions, most notably wages and labour productivity, both economies developed quite similarly between 1995 and 2001-02, but diverged thereafter. We relate the development of wages and labour productivity in the two economies to sectoral structural change and to sectoral differences in labour productivity growth, skills upgrading, and foreign trade.","[Bickenbach, Frank; Liu, Wan-Hsin] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Niehues-Jeuffroy, Hector] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Bickenbach, F (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",,,,,,,,10,2,3,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Nevertheless, the mass production of charcoal can contribute substantially to deforestation, rendering it imperative to regulate charcoal use. This article uses nationally representative panel data on Tanzania conducted in 2008 and 2010 to examine how charcoal expenditures change over time within any given household. The focus of the analysis will be on identifying certain socio-economic factors that affect charcoal use at the household level. The framing of the analysis on variation in time within each household addresses the omitted variable bias that often undermines inference from comparisons across different households. We find that while charcoal expenditures increase with household income, the rise in charcoal use with income is relatively gradual. Household size is unrelated to charcoal expenditures, but urban-rural differences in fuel choice are large even though we include household fixed effects in all specifications. In this regard, policymakers and urban planners need to pay particular attention to the role of urbanization in predicting trends in charcoal expenditures in developing countries like Tanzania.

Depending on the treatment, an investor may decide to share profits with a paired person, and/or the paired person may compensate the investor for investment losses. Following sharing norms in African societies, predicted investment is higher if loss sharing is possible, and/or profit sharing is not possible. Contrary to these predictions, we find that investment is higher when losses may not be shared or when profits may be shared with friends.

Filers have an incentive to shift births from early January into late December, through induction or cesarean delivery, because child-related tax benefits are not prorated. We find evidence of a positive, but very small, effect of tax incentives on birth timing. An additional $1,000 of tax benefits increases the probability of a late-December birth by only about 1 percentage point. We argue that the response to tax incentives is small in part because of confusion about eligibility and delays in the issuance of Social Security numbers for newborns, as well as a lack of control over medical procedures on the part of filers with the highest tax values. In contrast to this small behavioral response, we do document a substantial reporting response among self-employed parents facing changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit as a result of a child's birth.

The integration of three features distinguishes our framework from the related literature: players' reports are aggregated by a mechanistic averaging rule, their strategy sets are intervals rather than binary choices, and they are ex ante heterogeneous. In this setting, players engage in a tug-of-war, as they exaggerate and counter-exaggerate in order to manipulate the center's decision. While incentives to exaggerate have been studied extensively, the phenomenon of counter-exaggeration is less well understood. Our main results are as follows. First, the cycle of counter-exaggeration can be broken only by the imposition of exogenous bounds on the space of admissible sender reports. Second, in the unique pure-strategy equilibrium, all but at most one player is constrained with positive probability by one of the report bounds. Our third and fourth results hold for a class of anchored games. We show that if the report space is strictly contained in the signal space, then welfare is increasing in the size of the report space, but if the containment relation is reversed, welfare is independent of the size of the space. Finally, the equilibrium performance of our heterogeneous players can be unambiguously ranked: a player's equilibrium payoff is inversely related to the probability that her exaggeration will be thwarted by the report bounds.","[Rausser, Gordon C.; Simon, Leo K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Simon, Leo K.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhao, Jinhua] Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Monash University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Simon, LK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",leosimon@berkeley.edu,"Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022","Rausser, Gordon/0000-0002-0647-128X",,,,,32,7,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It is shown that the economy either specializes in the production of the nontradable good or diversifies production. In the case of specialization, a tourism boom, i.e. an increase in the foreign tourists' demand for the nontradable good, makes the economy better off. In the case of diversified production, by contrast, a tourism boom induces a deterioration in the terms of trade and the economy may be worse off.","Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Yanase, A (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yanase@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285079, 24530240] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author would like to thank Kaoru Okamura, Masahiro Yabuta, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on an earlier manuscript draft.

In particular, it is argued both that there are convenient responses that protect each theory from what appears to be threatening evidence and that, for particular kinds of evidence, the two theories are empirically equivalent.

In particular, we show that chaotic dynamics may emerge, precisely due to MQS; under specific circumstances, MQS are responsible for the outcome of maximal differentiation in product qualities across providers.","[Cellini, Roberto] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Catania, CT, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Catania; University of Calabria,"Cellini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Catania, CT, Italy.",cellini@unict.it; lamantia@unical.it,,"Cellini, Roberto/0000-0003-1991-9685; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979","PRIN project, MIUR, Italy; COST Action [IS1104]","PRIN project, MIUR, Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST))","We thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

In the modern business cycle literature, multiplicative real shocks to production and/or preferences play an important role as the impulses that produce aggregate fluctuations. Introducing shocks in this way has the implication that fluctuating economies may enjoy higher welfare than their steady state counterparts. This occurs because purposeful agents make use of uncertainty in their favor. The result holds for a range of reasonable parameter values and in various models considered in the business cycle literature. One notable implication is that the welfare cost estimates which have been obtained in the literature using only consumption series may be biased and possibly seriously. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using the empirical observation that trade union members are dismissed less often than non-members, we construct a theoretical model to predict how absence behaviour will respond to the sick pay reform. We show that union members may have stronger incentives (1) to be absent and (2) to react to the cut in sick pay. In the empirical investigation, we observe more pronounced reactions to the statutory reduction in sick pay among union members than among nonmembers and find a positive relationship between trade union membership and absence due to sickness.

We use a bioeconomic framework to examine whether trade always increases private risks, focusing specifically on pathogen risks from live animal trade. When the pathogens have already established and traders bear some private risk, we find two results that run counter to the conventional wisdom on trade. First, uncertainty about the disease status of individual animals held in inventory may increase the incentives to trade relative to the disease-free case. Second, trade may facilitate reduced long-run disease prevalence among buyers. These results arise because disease risks are endogenous due to dynamic feedback processes involving valuable inventories, and markets facilitate the management of private risks that producers face with or without trade.

I compare this model to benchmark models with full commitment and/or without preference heterogeneity using data from three Indian villages. I find that the limited commitment model with heterogeneous preferences outperforms the benchmark models in a statistical sense and in terms of (i) explaining the dynamic response of consumption to idiosyncratic income shocks, (ii) accounting for the variation of consumption unexplained by household and time effects, and (iii) capturing the variation of inequality across time and villages and predicting changes in inequality. I also use the estimated models to predict the effects of a counterfactual tax and transfer policy on the consumption allocation. The limited commitment model with preference heterogeneity predicts larger benefits to the poor than its homogeneous counterpart.

This paper tries to answer these questions by deriving a linear quadratic framework for optimal monetary policy analysis - ala Benigno and Woodford (2005) - that is consistent with a Pareto inefficient labor market allocation, where the Hosios (1990) condition is not satisfied, and as a consequence, the flexible-price steady state of the model is distorted. The results indicate that maximization of expected utility of the representative household is equivalent to minimizing a quadratic loss function that consists of inflation, and two appropriately defined gaps involving unemployment and labor market tightness; and that search externalities give rise to an endogenous cost-push term in the New Keynesian Phillips Curve. Hence, full stabilization of both inflation and the welfare relevant unemployment gap is not feasible and deviation from complete price stability is welfare improving (because it allows to contain inefficient unemployment fluctuations). The inflation-unemployment trade-off and the welfare cost of search externalities are shown to be quantitatively sizable in response to shocks when steady state distortions are large and thereby the cost-push term is more volatile over the business cycle. Finally, a monetary policy rule that responds to unemployment growth rate is presented to be more efficient than a rule responding to unemployment gap. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A technique of split cosine bell tapering is suggested to improve the EGPH method. The simulation study shows that the optimal split proportion and bandwidth for the EGPH with split cosine bell tapering method respectively are p = 0.1 and LI = 0.9. The new method with the optimal parameters outperforms the EGPH and EGPH with cosine bell tapering. We further applied the EGPH method to estimate intraday volume series and high-frequency absolute return data. The results show that the seasonal fractionally differencing parameters are all estimated to be large, while the nonseasonal fractionally differencing parameters are all very small. This indicates that their long memory property may be mainly caused by the structure of long-range dependence at the seasonal lags instead of dependence at the nonseasonal lags.

Therefore, this study aimed to design a decision-making model for evaluating the efficiency and operating performance of Taiwan's listed semiconductor companies in 2010 to provide a basis for improving business performance. In view of this, this study combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) and improved grey relational analysis (IGRA) as efficiency tools to measure relative efficiencies; the semiconductor companies are divided into two groups, efficient and inefficient. We then integrate the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method (e.g. VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje, VIKOR), IGRA and the entropy weight method to evaluate the operating performance of the efficient and inefficient groups, respectively.

Gender bias is defined here, specifically, as the differential impact of a parent's education on a child's status depending on the gender of the parent vis-a-vis the child. Children's status is measured by school enrolment and participation in market work. Results from a basic model point to same-gender bias - father-son, mother-daughter in school enrolment and father-son in market work. In an extended model, results show that father-son bias in market work may be particularly pertinent for middle- to later-born children. Policy interventions should be mindful of such differential effects, particularly if the aim is to address persistent gender disparities in children's status.","[Alvi, Eskander] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Dendir, Seife] Radford Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Radford, VA 24142 USA",Western Michigan University; Radford University,"Dendir, S (通讯作者)，Radford Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Radford, VA 24142 USA.",sdendir@radford.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We propose a model with an endogenous labor force and compare with the model with an exogenous labor force. Because of discouraging the labor force, labor taxes decrease employment in our model less than the model with an exogenous labor force, have ambiguous effects on hours, and decrease less labor supply in our model. Due to boosting the labor force, unemployment compensation increases employment in our model and decreases in the model with an exogenous labor force, but with opposite effects on hours, labor supply is ambiguous in both models. To understand the net effect on labor supply, we feed in the data of increases in labor taxes and unemployment compensation in the EU relative to the US. We find that the model with an exogenous labor force explain excessively of decreases in employment and labor supply, with increases in hours against the data. In contrast, our model explains reasonable decreases in labor supply, with sensible decreases in employment and in hours. Thus, with an endogenous labor force, our model explains relative declines in labor supply better than the model with an exogenous labor force. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The question we address is: should a firm price discriminate when facing a price discriminating rival? Our main conclusion is that, if the consumers are sufficiently myopic, it is better to choose uniform pricing instead of price discrimination. This is in contrast with the consensus reached in classic price discrimination theory, and it shows that it may be better for a firm to unilaterally renounce to price flexibility when facing a flexible firm.

There is, however, substantial uncertainty around these projections. How should this uncertainty affect monetary policy? In many standard models uncertainty has no effect. In this paper, we demonstrate that the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates implies that the central bank should adopt a looser policy when there is uncertainty. In the current context this result implies that a delayed liftoff is optimal. We demonstrate this result theoretically through two canonical macroeconomic models. Using numerical simulations of our models calibrated to the current environment, we find that optimal policy calls for a delay in liftoff of two to three quarters relative to a policy that does not take into account uncertainty about policy being constrained by the ZLB. We then use a narrative study of Federal Reserve communications and estimated policy reaction functions to show that risk management is a long-standing practice in the conduct of monetary policy.","[Evans, Charles; Fisher, Jonas; Gourio, Francois; Krane, Spencer] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Evans, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",,,,,,,,86,34,36,0,11,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This same forecasting methodology is also used in evaluating policy proposals put forward by Congress to modify the Social Security program. Ours is the first evaluation to compare the SSA forecasts with observed truth; for example, we compare forecasts made in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s with outcomes that are now available. We find that Social Security Administration forecasting errors-as evaluated by how accurate the forecasts turned out to be-were approximately unbiased until 2000 and then became systematically biased afterward, and increasingly so over time. Also, most of the forecasting errors since 2000 are in the same direction, consistently misleading users of the forecasts to conclude that the Social Security Trust Funds are in better financial shape than turns out to be the case. Finally, the Social Security Administration's informal uncertainty intervals appear to have become increasingly inaccurate since 2000. At present, the Office of the Chief Actuary, at the Social Security Administration, does not reveal in full how its forecasts are made. Every future Trustees Report, without exception, should include a routine evaluation of all prior forecasts, and a discussion of what forecasting mistakes were made, what was learned from the mistakes, and what actions might be taken to improve forecasts going forward. And the Social Security Administration and its Office of the Chief Actuary should follow best practices in academia and many other parts of government and make their forecasting procedures public and replicable, and should calculate and report calibrated uncertainty intervals for all forecasts.","[Kashin, Konstantin; King, Gary] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Soneji, Samir] Dartmouth Coll, Dartmouth Inst Hlth Policy & Clin Practice, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA",Harvard University; Dartmouth College,"Kashin, K (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kkashin@fas.harvard.edu; king@harvard.edu; samir.soneji@dartmouth.edu,"King, Gary/K-2179-2019","King, Gary/0000-0002-5327-7631",,,,,27,7,9,0,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In Ireland, the contraction in economic activity that took place resulted in the country's overall unemployment rate increasing from 4.6% in 2006 to 15% in 2012. The country's youth unemployment rate rose from 9.9% to 33% over the same time period, while the proportion of NEETs increased from 10.1% in 2006 to 18.7% in 2012. Policymakers are aware of the unemployment rates of young and prime-aged people as well as the NEETs rate. However, little is known about these groups' profiles, whether their profiles have changed since the recession and also their labour market transition patterns pre and post the Great Recession. Given the importance of this information in the design of effective activation measures to assist unemployed and NEET individuals, this paper examines each of these issues in turn. Overall, the study found for all three groups examined that the rate of transition to employment fell dramatically between 2006 and 2011. The analysis showed that the drop in the groups' transition rates was not due to changes in the underlying sub-group population structures but to changes in the external environment that resulted in the impact of possessing certain characteristics changing over the recession. For example, education and nationality have become more important in finding a job in Ireland over the course of the recession, while there has been a fall in the scarring impact of unemployment durations.

A sample selected ordered probit model is developed to address this question. While the selection equation models the determinants of access to credit, an ordered probit model is used to determine the factors affecting the choice of credit sources in hierarchical order. Using household data from six Indian states, this study finds corroborative evidence that relatively resource-rich households, even while staying at distant locations, enjoy greater access to formal creditors. It also identifies a new factor, i.e., interlinked credit, as a significant variable influencing access to formal credit.

Component producers face the option to either merge with a similar component producer (horizontal merger) or a complementary one (vertical merger) of a composite good. Focusing only on strategic reasons, vertical mergers arise at equilibrium only when composite goods are very differentiated or when the number of producers is large while horizontal mergers arise otherwise. When efficiencies are considered, higher marginal cost savings are required for a horizontal merger in a composite industry not to result in a price increase as compared with those required for a regular industry. This finding can be used by antitrust authorities to be more demanding when dealing with horizontal mergers in composite goods industries.","[Pardo-Garcia, Cristina] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] CORE UCL, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Sempere-Monerris, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Cristina.Pardo-Garcia@uv.es; Jose.J.Sempere@uv.es,"Pardo-García, Cristina/AAZ-8024-2020; Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./E-6234-2016; Pardo-Garcia, Cristina/K-8197-2017","Pardo-García, Cristina/0000-0002-8068-3256; Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./0000-0001-6759-2117;",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45045-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"We would like to thank the Editor Victor Aguirregabiria and one referee for their valuable suggestions and comments that have substantially improved the paper.

We identify conditions under which the costs associated with extremism dominate the benefits of campaign information.

To this end, we employ the panel Granger causality testing approach that is based on Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) multivariate systems and Wald tests with country specific bootstrap critical values. Using annual data over the 1980-2010 period for 19 SSA countries, the study gives the following results. Based on liabilities as a proxy for financial sector development, remittances positively influence financial development only in four countries (Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Sudan) and financial development positively impacts remittances only in Gambia. On the contrary, considering credit to measure financial depth, the results show that remittances positively affect financial development only in Sudan and financial development does not influence remittances in any country. Consequently, there is no strong evidence supporting the view that remittances promote financial development in SSA countries and financial development seems not to be a relevant determinant of remittances received in SSA countries.

Estimating a panel smooth transition regression model on a sample of 22 industrialized countries, we find evidence for this hypothesis, showing that persistence of current-account imbalances strongly depends on the deviation of the real exchange rate from its long-term equilibrium. More specifically, while there is no persistence in cases of currency undervaluation or weak overvaluation, persistence tends to augment for overvaluations higher than 11%. In addition, whereas disequilibria are persistent even for very low overvaluations in the euro area, persistence is observed only for overvaluations higher than 14% for non-eurozone members.","[Mignon, Valerie] Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France; [Gnimassoun, Blaise] Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay,"Gnimassoun, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, Paris, France.",vlerie.mignon@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,72,15,15,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of tariffs on the outward stocks of FDI of the European Union (EU). We estimate a model based on the knowledge-capital theory of the multinational enterprise over the period 1995-2008 by using a sample of five EU countries and 24 partner countries. We consider, first, manufacturing sector as a whole and, then, six manufacturing industries defined at the two-digit level of the Nomenclature statistique des activites economiques dans la Communaute europeenne (NACE) classification. Explanatory variables include an index of applied bilateral tariffs and a dummy to capture the presence of bilateral investment treaties (BITs). A dynamic panel model is estimated through the generalized method of moments estimator, taking also into account the endogeneity of regressors. The results show that the pattern of EU outward FDI is a mix of vertical and horizontal FDI. BITs in force have a significant and positive impact on the outward FDI.

This paper aims to deepen our understanding of them by separately axiomatizing the gap between BS and the other two. We first introduce a new doctor separability condition (DS) and show that BS, DS, and irrelevance of rejected contracts (IRC) are equivalent to US and IRC. Due to Hatfield and Kojima (2010) and Aygun and Sonmez (2012), we know that US, Pareto separability (PS), and IRC are the same as substitutes and IRC. This, along with our result, implies that BS, DS, PS, and IRC are equivalent to substitutes and IRC. All of these results are given without IRC whenever hospitals have preferences.

A corporate intellectual capital can be affected by the actions of a business as a whole. For example, employees change their characteristics, including addresses, behaviour and preferences; but as the employee requirements change, basic beliefs or processes i.e., things that managers take for granted at an implicit and an explicit level of knowledge, must also change. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between intentional unlearning and Human Capital. In doing so, this paper has made a comprehensive review of the literature on the concept of unlearning and has developed and validated a model to measure the unlearning in 112 companies listed on the Spanish Stock Exchange. In this study, the intentional unlearning context covers: a) the examination of lens fitting, b) the framework for changing the individual habits and c) the framework for consolidating the emergent understandings. The methodology involved the construction and analysis of two structural models developed from a review of the relevant literature. In the Thereoretical Model, a relearning context to manage an appropriate link between individual forgetting and human capital was tested. In the Alternative Model that was tested, the relearning context attempts to re-orientate individual values and behaviours by changing organizational structures. The findings indicate that a process for consolidating emergent understandings would appear to be an intermediary step between the forgetting of old knowledge and the creation of Human Capital.","[Aledo Ruiz, Maria Dolores; Martinez Caro, Eva; Cegarra-Navarro, Juan-Gabriel] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Murcia, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Ruiz, MDA (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Murcia, Spain.",mdolores.aledo@upct.es; eva.martinez@upct.es; juan.cegarra@upct.es,"Martínez-Caro, Eva/H-9885-2015; Cegarra Navarro, Juan Gabriel/L-2291-2014","Cegarra Navarro, Juan Gabriel/0000-0003-3371-5670",,,,,41,1,1,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,432,440,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600050,0

The results and simulations imply that demographic and behavioural factors can significantly influence the obesity status both directly and indirectly through their impact on depression.

The classic econometric approach models volatility of returns with the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models where the conditional mean and the conditional volatility depend only on historical prices. We propose a new family of distributions in which the conditional distribution depends on a latent continuous factor with a continuum of states. The distribution has an interpretation in terms of a mixture distribution with time-varying mixing probabilities. The distribution parameters have economic interpretations in terms of conditional volatilities and correlations of the returns with the hidden continuous state. We show empirically that this distribution outperforms its main competitor, the mixed normal conditional distribution, in terms of capturing the stylized facts known for stock returns, namely, volatility clustering, leverage effect, skewness, kurtosis and regime dependence.","[Belhachemi, Rachid] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Math Sci, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Rostan, Pierre] Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Management, New Cairo, Egypt; [Racicot, Francois-Eric] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo; University of Ottawa,"Rostan, P (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Management, New Cairo, Egypt.",prostan@aucegypt.edu,"Racicot, François-Éric/O-3079-2019; Rostan, Pierre/HMD-2007-2023","Rostan, Pierre/0000-0003-1046-0214",,,,,38,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Survival functions estimates point uniformly to prolonged unemployment duration and increasing long-term unemployment. However, both these tendencies apply relatively more to the young unemployed. Estimations of hazard models indicate that shorter unemployment spells are more likely to be terminated by finding a job in comparison with spells lasting for more than one year. The hazard ratios are usually higher for prime age unemployed.

The life and work of both economists took place in three states and four political cultures. After a short biographical information with emphasis on the linkages between Schumpeter and Lederer, section II addresses the influence of BAohm-Bawerk's famous seminar in 1905-06 where both Schumpeter and Lederer first developed a greater interest in Marxian analysis. Next the role of the Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik is covered, which in the years of the Weimar Republic was edited by Lederer with Schumpeter as an associate editor. Among many important papers in the Archiv we find also Kondratieff's famous article on the long waves in economic life which had a strong impact on Schumpeter's Business Cycles (1939). Lederer and Schumpeter both shared the view that capitalist economies normally are in dynamic disequilibrium. Business cycles are seen as an integral part of capitalist development. Emphasis in economic theory should therefore be put on the analysis of the short-run and particularly the long-run dynamics of the economy. In section IV Schumpeter's analysis of business cycles and capitalist development is compared with Lederer's analysis. In section V Lederer's treatment of technological unemployment is analyzed and compared with the analysis of Schumpeter who considered technological unemployment as a special case arising from disturbance by innovations within the economic system. Finally, some reflections are made how far Schumpeter and Lederer were social economists.","Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ 520, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Hagemann, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ 520, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",hagemann@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,47,10,16,2,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In Slovakia this was inappropriately transferred to the municipalities and to citizens who are dependent on the help of the others. Still, there is no consensus on the degree of financial intervention from the state and other stakeholders in the provision of social services. In this contribution we present a model of its own creation and funding of economically justified costs (EJC) to social services. The model in Slovakia has been assessed and recommended by both, professionals and a general community. It is based on three financial pillars that have mandatory and also optional multi-source financing sources and includes forms of participation of different actors in the field of social services. These three pillars are followed by a fourth - optional pillar of funding the social services. The proposed model aims to maintain financial sustainability, accessibility, and quality for the produced public social services. The proposed model for the first time introduces into the Slovak social insurance system for all policyholders a new obligatory contribution for a long-term social care. Thus the mandatory funding sources for the policyholders in case of need of social services should be sufficiently guaranteed.","[Korimova, Gabriela; Strangfeldova, Jana; Hronec, Stefan] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Korimová, G (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",jana.strangfeldova@umb.sk,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,NEWTON COLL AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-05-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,86,98,,,,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3UF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380582800007,0

Numerous studies have highlighted the role of intellectual capital as a key driver of organisational performance due to its importance as an asset in the value creation process, yet few have analysed the relationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction. Considering the relevance of knowledge management and intellectual capital in the service sector, namely in the banking system (Curado 2008; Starbuck 2002), this study aims to assess the structure of intellectual capital in a Brazilian Credit Union, and how it relates to internal communication and job satisfaction. To accomplish this objective, a structural model, based on Longo and Mura (2011), was developed and tested on a sample of 109 employees from a particular branch of the union. Results confirm the three-dimensionality of the Intellectual Capital construct and that job satisfaction, as well as internal communication, are constructs separate from intellectual capital and should not be confused. In fact, internal communication may be considered as an antecedent of intellectual capital, whereas job satisfaction is a consequence. Furthermore, results suggest that intellectual capital plays a mediation role in the relationship between internal communication and job satisfaction. Nevertheless, the framework presented in this paper is not without limitations. Firstly, the sample size and the fact that it is a case study requires caution regarding extrapolation of conclusions. A second limitation has to do with the measurement of Relational Capital, as items employed have shown to be problematic in terms of convergent validity. Nevertheless, this study holds great potential for the strategic management of human resources in banking, in particular credit unions, which is a prime concern for bank administrations, bank branch collaborators, and society at large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the interrelationships between internal communication, intellectual capital and job satisfaction in a credit union, an organisation with particular structural and strategic features resulting from its external customers being members and owners.","[Leal, Carmem; Marques, Carlos; Marques, Carla] Univ Tras os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Vila Real, Portugal; [Braga-Filho, Elizomar] UNICRED Joao Pessoa Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Leal, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tras os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Vila Real, Portugal.",cleal@utad.pt; cmarques@utad.pt; smarques@utad.pt; elizomarfilho@live.com,"Leal, Carmem/V-7073-2017; Marques, Carlos/P-8077-2016","Marques, Carlos/0000-0001-6274-9082",,,,,53,0,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,199,207,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600024,0

We show that their choice of start date-based on nonenrollment at survey interview dates and often triggered by school vacations-systematically overstates experience and biases learning estimates toward zero for college-educated workers.

It features an endogenous hazard rate at which patented firms' monopoly profits are creatively destructed by arrivals of newer varieties, among other things. A patent's effective life is, therefore, endogenized and less than its legal life. This model is calibrated to a global economy with a set of baseline parameter values. The optimal patent length is computed with the algorithm of Golden Search Section, ranging from 17 to 19 years. With the creative-destruction hazard, the world needs a longer patent term to maximize social welfare but with the prevalence of research congestion, the world needs a shorter patent term. However, if the world's aggregate welfare appreciates varieties of goods in a way strong enough, the optimal patent term can surprisingly extend beyond 1000 years!","Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Lin, HC (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",hwlin@uncc.edu,,"Lin, Hwan C./0000-0002-9983-8078","BarclaysAmerican Summer Research Award from the Belk College of Business, University of North Carolina at Charlotte","BarclaysAmerican Summer Research Award from the Belk College of Business, University of North Carolina at Charlotte","The author wishes to thank two anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions, and gratefully acknowledges that the article was funded by the BarclaysAmerican Summer Research Award of 2010 from the Belk College of Business, University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

For the sample of 17 Czech banks we aim to identify the strategies that Czech banks adopted in order to increase their capital ratios. Our analysis shows that as with the large multi-national banks from advanced economies, retained earnings have played a major role in increasing the average capital ratio of Czech banks. In addition, the Czech banks have decreased their risk to strengthen the overall ratio. The results of our analysis are useful mainly from a regulatory point of view as currently the countercyclical buffer is set to its minimum of 0% of risk-weighted assets and the Czech National Bank may increase the buffer up to 2.5% in the medium or long-term.","Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Depaatuent Banking & Insurance, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Matejasák, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Depaatuent Banking & Insurance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xmatm37@vse.cz,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,6,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

We propose that the discriminatory power of credit scoring models can be thought of as a proxy for firm opaqueness, given that when these models perform poorly, lenders must invest in the production of 'soft information' to supplement the financial data used in these models. Measuring the discriminatory power of probit default models across quintiles of the Irish SME size distribution, we show that our proxy for firm opaqueness increases monotonically as firms get smaller. This finding supports an assumption that is the starting point to a wide strand of literature on SME bank financing. Our findings can also be interpreted as providing an insight to the literature on the determinants of banks' choice of lending technology. While smaller banks may, as found in a substantial previous literature, produce larger amounts of 'soft information' due to their organizational advantages, they may also do so out of necessity: hard-information-based default modelling is less effective among smaller firms, thereby forcing banks that lend to these borrowers to invest more in relationship banking technologies to retain competitiveness.","[McCann, Fergal] Cent Bank Ireland, Irish Econ Anal Div, Dublin, Ireland; [McIndoe-Calder, Tara] Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"McCann, F (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Irish Econ Anal Div, Dublin, Ireland.",fergal.mccann@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,35,9,9,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on competitive advantage factor (CAF) and resource theory, this article empirically tests ICT as one of several possible competitiveness factors. The research is focused on analyse of ICT competitiveness position over time, with special attention to different generations of ICT technologies. An electronic survey instrument has been used to collect Slovenian hotel manager's opinion on competitiveness resources in 2000 and 2010. Hypothesis testing and cluster analyses has been applied, SPSS was also used. The article's findings indicate that hotels need time to recognise the competitiveness potential of every new resource, and once they start to implement it its importance may change over time. Some firms might be slower in implementing new ICT resources, yet, over time, the resource use converges among the firms. The process is repeated with every new ICT generation. The study informs firms and researchers on practical and research issues forthcoming with ICT progression. Research results directly benefits hotel managers by providing actual information on how to employ different generations of ICT. This contribution is a novel way of connecting a firm's competitiveness with different web generations over time.","[Mihalic, Tanja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Pranicevic, Daniela Garbin] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia; [Arneric, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Split; University of Zagreb,"Mihalic, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",tanja.mihalic@ef.uni-lj.si,"Arneric, Josip/AAI-6473-2021; Praničević, Daniela Garbin/E-1315-2017; mihalic, tanja/F-3491-2013; Arneric, Josip/AAE-2023-2022","Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609; Arneric, Josip/0000-0002-2901-2609",,,,,67,7,9,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We use Fama and French's (1993) three-factor and Carhart's (1997) four-factor models to examine the subsequent 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year stock returns of firms that stayed debt free for 3- and 5-year periods. We measure debt capacity as the expected asset liquidation value of a firm, which is proxied by the firm-level tangibility measure defined by Berger, Ofek, and Swary (1996). We find that regardless of the level of debt capacity, zero-debt firms generate positive abnormal returns in the long run after controlling for key risk factors. We also find support for the notion that preserving debt capacity in the form of higher tangibility reinforces the positive abnormal returns over and above the effect of a zero-leverage policy.","[Moon, Gisung] Columbus State Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [Lee, Hongbok] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Macomb, IL 61455 USA; [Waggle, Doug] Univ W Florida, Dept Accounting & Finance, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA",University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; Western Illinois University; State University System of Florida; University of West Florida,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Western Illinois Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Macomb, IL 61455 USA.",H-Lee@wiu.edu,,"Lee, Hongbok/0000-0002-7219-6095",,,,,30,9,10,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find a statistically significant effect of volume on spread inconsistent with the work of Johnson (2008). On price, we find mixed results, consistent with the literature. On the effect of price volatility on spread, our results are completely the opposite of the cross-sectional literature but sides with the relatively recent work of Chordia et al. (2001). We allow for persistence of spread as a determinant of spread and find significant evidence of spread persistence across all 16 sectors.

The results also indicate that there is a unidirectional causal flow from bank-based financial development to stock market development in the short run. The study, however, fails to find any causality between bank-based financial development and economic growth.

In particular, this preliminary study analyses the impact of Human Capital on Corporate Reputation perceived by employees. To do this, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses have been developed in order to know the components of Human Capital in the Spanish audit sector, obtaining three factors: Staff Quality, Staff Management and Staff Results. These factors have been related to the dimensions of corporate reputation (according to the literature: resource management, business leadership, culture, ethics, media reputation and customer loyalty) having significant results. In particular, staff quality (firms with creative employees, who perform their best and think actions through, and where there is no trouble if individuals left) has a significant and positive influence on all the dimensions of reputation, except on media reputation. Staff management (firms with clear recruitment and succession training programs, upgrade employees' skills and employees who give their all) has a significant and positive impact on ethics and media reputation. Staff results (employees are satisfied and they do not have to bring down to others' level) have a positive and significant effect on business leadership and media reputation. In service firms, customers interact with the frontline employees. In such cases, the satisfaction of the employees and their contribution bring up to others' level are transmitted to the customers, which improve the perception of service quality and public opinion of the firm, getting better external recognition (media reputation and business leadership). Furthermore, their results strengthen the ethics of the audit firm. The practical implications for these results are several. First, the adequate management of Human Capital can increase the employee views of Corporate Reputation, affecting mainly the ethics and media reputation. Second, the factor Staff Quality has double significant and positive influence on reputation than others. However, Staff Management and Staff Results also have an important role in the configuration of employee reputation. Therefore, the effects of Human Capital factors on employee views of Corporate Reputation are relevant, confirming the importance of Human Capital in the configuration of internal reputation as well as the key role of intellectual capital in the formation of the corporate reputation.","[Olmedo-Cifuentes, Isabel; Martinez-Leon, Inocencia] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Olmedo-Cifuentes, I (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain.",isabel.olmedo@upct.es; ino.martinez@upct.es,"OLMEDO-CIFUENTES, ISABEL/AAH-8638-2019; Martinez Leon, Inocencia Maria/H-8391-2015","Martinez Leon, Inocencia Maria/0000-0002-8624-9848; Olmedo Cifuentes, Isabel/0000-0001-5029-6290",,,,,44,1,1,0,11,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,245,252,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600029,0
