We measure the effect of information disclosure on market outcomes using a large-scale field experiment that randomly discloses quality information in wholesale automobile auctions. We argue that buyers in this market are horizontally differentiated across cars that are vertically ranked by quality. This implies that information disclosure helps match heterogeneous buyers to cars of varying quality, causing both good and bad news to increase competition and revenues. The data confirm these hypotheses.

Although non-SOEs underperform the market in general after IPO but the poor performance is mainly caused by the IPOs with ownership control wedge. Non-SOEs with one share one vote structure outperform those with control-ownership wedge by 30% for three years post-IPO performance in adjusted buy-and-hold returns. Non-SOEs with control-ownership wedge have higher frequency of undertaking value-destroying related party transactions. These findings suggest that non-SOEs need to improve corporate governance such as disproportionate ownership structure to better safeguard the interest of long-run shareholders.

The occurrence hazard can be mitigated by reducing the polluting emissions, while the occurrence damage can be controlled via investments in adaptation activities. A full dynamic characterization of the optimal mitigation/adaptation processes is presented. The adaptation and mitigation policies interact strongly, and the evolution in time of each is affected by the option to implement the other. The conditions under which adaptation investments should begin promptly, take place after some delay or be avoided altogether are derived in terms of some key model parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study utilizes annual data from 1980 to 2012 on a panel of 18 developing countries. Our empirical analysis employs robust panel cointegration tests and a vector error correction model (VECM) framework. The empirical results of three panel cointegration models suggest that there is a significant long-run equilibrium relationship among economic growth, oil consumption, financial development, industrialization, trade openness and CO2 emissions. Similarly, results from VECMs show that economic growth, oil consumption and industrialization have a short-run dynamic bidirectional feedback relationship with CO2 emissions. Long-run (error-correction term) bidirectional causalities are found among CO2 emissions, economic growth, oil consumption, financial development and trade openness.

Our main finding is that the monetary policy wedge that captures economic fluctuations caused by monetary policy has significantly declined since the implementation of IT in the early 1990s. The results suggest that advanced economies, such as Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom, that adopted IT in the early 1990s have been successful in stabilizing business cycle fluctuations.","[Cho, Dooyeon] Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136702, South Korea; [Rhee, Dong-Eun] Myongji Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120728, South Korea",Kookmin University; Myongji University,"Rhee, DE (通讯作者)，Myongji Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120728, South Korea.",derhee@mju.ac.kr,,"Rhee, Dong-Eun/0000-0003-1177-6368; Cho, Dooyeon/0000-0003-2588-9347",,,,,36,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Second, the European business cycle has lagged the USA business cycle during the period of the Great Moderation. In the model, more generous unemployment benefits and greater employment protection (manifested as firing costs) can endogenously generate higher unemployment.

Some of these dilemmas are of an older vintage, such as how to deal with massive capital flows, how to combat high inflation when resource misallocation is a very burdensome legacy and expectations of high inflation are well entrenched. Other dilemmas are pretty new, or have got salience during the Great Recession. Romania has had to undertake a painful correction of its large macroeconomic imbalances. Light inflation targeting has provided leeway for mitigating the fallout from the financial crisis, although high euroization has dented its efficacy. The specter of stagnation in the Euro Area, financial deleveraging, unconventional policies which are pursued by key central banks, the ongoing reform of banking regulation and supervision, a growing shadow banking, how will the Banking Union evolve, etc, make up a very complicated European context and pose a range of big challenges for the central banks of New Member States (NMSs).","Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies SNSPA, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Daianu, D (通讯作者)，Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies SNSPA, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Therefore it is important to analyse the influence of the European Union policies on the cohesion. The common market itself is not able to solve the economic and social problems that are relevant for the EU countries.

The cohesion policy provides the possibility to finance various activities in order to promote economic growth in the European Union Member States. The convergence, regional competitiveness, employment and European territorial cooperation are the three main objectives of the current EU development aims. The cohesion policy can be helpful instrument for achieving economic convergence. The EU investments are meant to support the innovations as well as education and training in urban and rural areas, create sustainable high-quality jobs in order to reduce the unemployment and pursue low-carbon economy. In summary, the funds should lead to economic growth. This article presents the analysis of the relationship between the structural support and economic indicators of the EU. The research methods used in the article include the analysis of literature and statistical data, and correlation analysis.

The vast majority of studies in this field have concentrated on well-known determinants, such as inter-regional trade, financial integration, and industrial specialization, while largely ignoring spatial and geographical factors, including differences across regions in agglomeration, localization economies, market size, and urbanization. In this article, we incorporate these variables into our analysis and evaluate their roles in the comovement of regional business cycles. Our findings indicate two major results: first, low degree of synchronization during 1975-2000 has switched to relatively more correlated and synchronously moving regional cycles during 2004-2010. Second, having tested the variety of determinants, we find that the pairs of regions that have more similar industrial structure and market size, trade integration, and arbitrary degree of agglomeration and urbanization tend to synchronize more.

Using the West Bank as a counterfactual economy, we find that welfare declined by 14%-27%. Moreover, households with larger pre-blockade expenditure levels experienced larger welfare losses. We show that this large decline in welfare may be due to a combination of resource reallocation and reduced productivity. Workers were reallocated from manufacturing to services, and from industries that use imported inputs intensively, or export. In addition, labor productivity fell by 20% on average.

We do not consider the price index (LIV-EX 100 or 500), as is typically undertaken in previous studies, but rather examine the auction price series of the world's most traded wine-vintage pairs (5 Bordeaux first growth, 8 Bordeaux second growth, 5 Burgundy, 3 Rhone, 4 Italian, 5 Californian, 1 Australian and 1 Portuguese). A global equity index is also included using the Morgan Stanley Capital International World. Cointegration procedures, the Granger non-causality test, and ECM are used to analyse short- and long-run relationships among these markets. The results indicate a strong effect of financial markets on wine prices and short-term causality for certain wines. Moreover, the findings indicate short-run causality between the wines themselves, revealing a leader (exogenous) or follower (endogenous) status of certain fine wines in price dynamics, and also long-run causality for endogenous wines. This approach is relevant to portfolio diversification strategies and allows price movements to be anticipated more accurately than using an index approach.","[Faye, B.; Le Fur, E.; Prat, S.] LAREFI Univ Bordeaux, Dept Finance, INSEEC Business Sch, Bordeaux Wine Economists, Bordeaux, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Groupe Inseec,"Faye, B (通讯作者)，LAREFI Univ Bordeaux, Dept Finance, INSEEC Business Sch, Bordeaux Wine Economists, Bordeaux, France.",bfaye@inseec.com,"le Fur, Eric/AFQ-9173-2022","LE FUR, ERIC/0000-0002-3932-2125; FAYE, Benoit/0000-0002-0751-1968",,,,,47,26,27,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The timing rules out explanations that focus on disruptions during or since the recession, and industry and state data rule out bubble economy stories related to housing or finance. The slow-down is located in industries that produce information technology (IT) or that use IT intensively, consistent with a return to normal productivity growth after nearly a decade of exceptional IT-fueled gains. A calibrated growth model suggests trend productivity growth has returned close to its 1973-1995 pace. Slower underlying productivity growth implies less economic slack than recently estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.

The study reveals that sharecroppers' yields are significantly lower on plots leased from landlords who are non-kin and landlords with weaker economic and tenure-security status (such as female) than on plots leased from landlords with the contrasting characteristics. While, on aggregate, the results show no significant efficiency loss on kin-operated sharecropped plots, more decomposed analyses indicate strong evidence of Marshallian inefficiency on kin-operated plots leased from landlords with weaker bargaining power and higher tenure insecurity. This study thus shows how failure to control for the heterogeneity of landowners' characteristics can explain the lack of clarity in the existing empirical literature on the extent of moral hazard problems in sharecropping contracts.","[Ghebru, Hosaena H.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Holden, Stein T.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, As, Norway",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Ghebru, HH (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",hosaenag@yahoo.com,"Holden, Stein/AAD-4502-2019",,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)","This research is funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets, led by IFPRI and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD).

To this end we compute, over the period January 2004-December 2012, a parsimonious and fully documented SLRI. We also investigate its statistical significance in explaining the level and variability of stock returns for a group of large international banks across the subprime and the Eurozone sovereign debt crises. Main findings are two: our more parsimonious SLRI is close to Severo's but provides a stronger signal of liquidity stress and recovery episodes; we consistently fail to detect, within and across the two crises, a stable group of banks among the global systemically important ones listed by the Financial Stability Board.","[Gianfelice, Gianfranco] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, CEFIN, Dept Econ, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Marotta, Giuseppe; Torricelli, Costanza] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, CEFIN, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Torricelli, Costanza] CeRP, I-41121 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Torricelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, CEFIN, I-41121 Modena, Italy.",costanza.torricelli@unimore.it,"MAROTTA, Giuseppe/HGD-4412-2022; Torricelli, Costanza/B-7993-2016; Marotta, Giuseppe/F-8575-2016","Torricelli, Costanza/0000-0001-5927-2578; Marotta, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0129-0287",,,,,23,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study also applies Granger's test to analyse, in a sample of 1 5 OECD countries, the causality between the new indicator of human capital and GDP and the new indicator and innovation, concluding that the multidimensional indicator possesses a relation of causality that does not appear when tests are carried out with traditional measures of human capital (gross enrolment rate in secondary and average schooling years).","[Gimenez, Gregorio; Lopez-Pueyo, Carmen; Sanau, Jaime] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Giménez, G (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",gregim@unizar.es; clopez@unizar.es; jsanau@unizar.es,"Gimenez, Gregorio/AAB-5838-2019","Gimenez, Gregorio/0000-0003-3702-4017; Lopez Pueyo, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-9441-7859",,,,,75,9,12,1,20,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

In 2013, output was 13% below its trend path from 1990 through 2007. Part of this shortfall-2.2 percentage points out of the 13-was the result of lingering slackness in the labor market in the form of abnormal unemployment and substandard weekly hours of work. The single biggest contributor was a shortfall in business capital, which accounted for 3.9 percentage points. The second largest was a shortfall of 3.5 percentage points in total factor productivity. The fourth was a shortfall of 2.4 percentage points in labor-force participation. I discuss these four sources of the injury in detail, focusing on identifying state variables that may or may not return to earlier growth paths. The conclusion is optimistic about the capital stock and slackness in the labor market and pessimistic about reversing the declines in total-factor productivity and the part of the participation shortfall not associated with the weak labor market.","[Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hall, Robert E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hall, RE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,41,34,41,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

This article focusses on the role of real exchange rates in this growth. A 'bilateral real exchange rate' augmented trade gravity model applied to China's trade with 49 African countries over the period 2000-2011 shows that the real appreciation of most African currencies relative to the renminbi favoured China's exports to these countries, but had no impact on China's imports from Africa. This real appreciation of African currencies is explained by three main factors: the decision to peg them to other currencies (in particular to the euro), the amount of export of raw materials from African countries and the amount of financial assistance from international donors including China. Thus, a kind of detrimental sequence exists in Africa's relationship with China: China's imports of raw materials and its economic co-operation are among the factors explaining the appreciation of African real exchange rates, which itself stimulates China's exports of manufactured goods, and so restricts Africa's own industrial development.","[Jeanneney, Sylviane Guillaumont; Hua, Ping] Univ Auvergne, Ecole Econ, CNRS, CERDI UMR 6587, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Hua, P (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, Ecole Econ, CNRS, CERDI UMR 6587, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",ping.hua@udamail.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; La Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (Ferdi),Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); La Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (Ferdi),This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program 'Investissements d'avenir' 'ANR-10-LABX-14-01' and by La Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (Ferdi).,,31,7,8,4,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The analysis tests different channels of financial contagion across regions and real economy sectors by utilizing dynamic conditional correlation from the multivariate Fractionally Integrated Asymmetric Power ARCH (FIAPARCH) model. Evidence shows that the GFC can be characterized by contagion effects across regional stock markets and regional financial and non-financial sectors. However, Developed Pacific region and some sectors in particular Consumer Goods, Healthcare and Technology across all regions seem to be less affected by the crisis, while the most vulnerable sectors are observed in the emerging Asian and European regions. Further, the analysis on a crisis phase level indicates that the most severe contagion effects exist after the failure of Lehman Brothers limiting the effectiveness of portfolio diversification.

Another possibility is to focus firstly on the public finances consolidation and consequently on the sustainable economic growth. The choice must be done by particular country by the means of its politicians. Politicians are elected by the citizens of the country.

There are some noticeable differences across countries with peripheral economies generally being less diversified. Differences across firm size and age groups are more marked than cross-country variation, with smaller and younger firms significantly more reliant on a limited set of finance types and older, larger firms having more diversified financial structures.

Transportation demand on Slovenian motorways is price inelastic. The price elasticity of transportation demand statistically varies among different parts of the toll sections, so it would seem sensible to introduce a differentiated toll system that would allow the simultaneous achievement of multiple objectives, such as increasing the internalization of the external costs of transport, increasing transportation demand management on the basis of price and increasing cost recovery for the maintenance and development of toll roads in Slovenia. Transportation demand is even more responsive to changes in fuel price than changes in tolls, so transportation policy can manage transportation demand using differences in fuel prices. Based on estimates of demand models differentiated according to several geographical groups of road sections, we also find that growth in the price elasticity of transportation demand in Slovenia can be achieved through the expansion of the transport supply by increasing the competitiveness of rail transport and alternative transportation routes.","[Matajic, Mateja] Inst Traff & Transport Ljubljana Llc, SL-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Jagric, Timotej] Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Beko, Jani] Fac Econ & Business, Dept Polit Econ, SL-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Beko, J (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Dept Polit Econ, SL-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",jani.beko@uni-mb.si,,"Beko, Jani/0000-0002-7778-5745",,,,,24,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this article, we present a simple empirical strategy to nonparametrically identify tactical voting patterns directly from balloting results. This approach allows us to study the magnitude and direction of strategic voting as well as to verify which information voters and parties take into account to determine marginal constituencies. We show that tactical voting played a significant role in the 2010 election, mainly for Liberal-Democratic voters supporting Labour. Moreover, our results suggest that voters seem to form their expectations based on a national swing in vote shares rather than newspaper guides published in the main media outlets or previous election outcomes.

We show that not only a separating equilibrium can be supported, where information about the incumbent's costs is conveyed to the entrant, but also a pooling equilibrium, where the actions of regulator and incumbent conceal the monopolist's type, thus deterring entry. We demonstrate that the regulator strategically designs subsidies to facilitate, or hinder, entry deterrence, depending on which outcome yields the largest social welfare. Furthermore, we compare equilibrium welfare relative to two benchmarks: complete-information environments and standard entry-deterrence games where the regulator is absent.","[Munoz-Garcia, Felix; Espinola-Arredondo, Ana] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Muñoz-Garcia, F (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, 111C Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",fmunoz@wsu.edu; anaespinola@wsu.edu,,"Espinola-Arredondo, Ana/0000-0002-5983-9527; Munoz-Garcia, Felix/0000-0001-6727-3618",,,,,39,2,2,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Some of its aims are to increase young people employment, to improve employability, to promote measures for specific population groups and particularly for disabled people and entrepreneurs.

We carry out a meta-regression analysis on a sample of 269 estimates of the OLC to uncover reasons for differences in empirical results and to estimate the true' OLC. On statistical (and other) grounds, we find it appropriate to investigate two separate subsamples, using respectively (some measure of) unemployment or output as dependent variable. Our results can be summarized as follows. First, there is evidence of type II publication bias in both subsamples, but a type I bias is present only among the papers using some measure of unemployment as the dependent variable. Second, after correction for publication bias, authentic and statistically significant OLC effects are present in both subsamples. Third, bias-corrected estimated true OLCs are significantly lower (in absolute value) with models using some measure of unemployment as the dependent variable. Using a bivariate MRA approach, the estimated true effects are -0.25 for the unemployment subsample and -0.61 for the output subsample; with a multivariate MRA methodology, the estimated true effects are -0.40 and -1.02 for the unemployment and the output subsamples respectively.","[Perman, Roger] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Stephan, Gaetan; Tavera, Christophe] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, CNRS, F-35014 Rennes, France",University of Strathclyde; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes,"Perman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,48,31,31,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

From the international institutionalized relationships and the cross-border flows of financial, informational and human capital to the technological opportunities provided by the new media, we are facing a complex reconfiguration of the communication practices. In this respect, the development of online social networks, along with the advent of virtual professional groups contribute to the burst of a network-based intellectual capital, liable to be electronically accessed and exploited at low financial costs. As a prerequisite for the growth strategies and sustainable competitive advantage, organizations from developing countries should reconsider the importance of both their internal resources and the value of the social and information exchange within their networks, facilitating organizational learning and proper response to the field dynamics. Thus, becoming part of a network, sharing and capitalizing knowledge, as well as creating a capital of trust and a collaborative environment support, might facilitate the effort to reinforce their position within the network and generate incentives for the overall system development. Starting from these premises, our paper aims to discuss the standpoints and practices of European universities from developing economies with a view to provide a pertinent answer to a highly competitive environment. In order to explore the usage of the network-based intellectual capital, the paper employed an interview-based survey with 27 professors.

There are marked differences in the effect of increases in monetary aggregates in China, Japan and the U.S. on Euro area economic and financial variables over 1999-2012. Increases in monetary aggregates in China are associated with significant increases in the world price of commodities and with increases in Euro area inflation, industrial production and exports. Results are consistent with shocks to China's M2 facilitating domestic growth with expansionary consequences for the Euro area economy. In contrast, increases in monetary aggregates in Japan are associated with significant appreciation of the Euro and decreases in Euro area industrial production and exports. Production of goods highly competitive with European goods in Japan and expenditure switching in Japan are consistent with the results. U.S. monetary expansion has relatively small effects on the Euro area over this period compared to results reported in the literature for earlier sample periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The findings indicate that subsidising the small firm instead of the large is the optimum for the maximisation of social welfare in general. Meanwhile, if the initial marginal costs of the two firms are close to each other, providing subsidies to the small firm leads to more social R&D investment and higher aggregate production, but lower consumer surplus. Conversely, while the cost gap of the duopoly is large, subsidising the big firm becomes the preferable option for the authority to stimulate both R&D investment and total output of the industry, while sacrificing consumer surplus.","[Yang, Yong-Cong; Nie, Pu-Yan] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Yang, YC (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yangyongcong3787@sina.com,"NIE, Pu-yan/J-3547-2019","NIE, Pu-yan/0000-0002-6214-5980","Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education [14JZD021]; Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71271100]; Research Center for the Industrial Development of Guangdong and its Regional Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Characteristic and Innovative Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong","Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education; Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Center for the Industrial Development of Guangdong and its Regional Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Characteristic and Innovative Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong","This work is partially supported by the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education [grant number 14JZD021]; Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS (2012); National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [grant number 71271100]; Research Center for the Industrial Development of Guangdong and its Regional Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Characteristic and Innovative Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong (2014).",,25,20,20,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Unfortunately this reduction was accompanied by a significant decrease in government's fixed capital/GDP ratio from 90% to 55% - fiscal sustainability might have been restored, but government's balance sheet did not improve. A similar story can be told for State Owned Enterprises. Since the Great Recession the fiscal situation worsened markedly - the public debt ratio again approaches 50%. To restore fiscal sustainability this article suggests that the government faces two options: (1) to create room for future countercyclical policy, the government must cut current expenditure and reduce the public debt/GDP ratio to its pre-crisis level, or (2) substitute much-needed infrastructure capital expenditure for current expenditure while stabilising the debt/GDP ratio at its post-crisis level. Given that the much lower fixed capital/GDP ratio inhibits economic growth, the latter option might be more sensible.","[Burger, Philippe] Univ Free State, Dept Econ, Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Siebrits, Krige; Calitz, Estian] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of the Free State; Stellenbosch University,"Burger, P (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Econ, Econ, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",BurgerP@ufs.ac.za,,"Burger, Philippe/0000-0001-6820-1130",,,,,40,4,4,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

When purchasing sovereign debt, the central bank effectively swaps risky government paper for monetary liabilities only exposed to inflation risk, thus yielding a lower interest rate. As central bank purchases reduce the (ex ante) costs of debt, we characterize a critical threshold beyond which, absent fundamental fiscal stress, the government strictly prefers primary surplus adjustment to default. Because default may still occur for fundamental reasons, however, the central bank faces the risk of losses on sovereign debt holdings, which may generate inefficient inflation. We show that these losses do not necessarily undermine the credibility of a backstop, nor the monetary authorities' ability to pursue its inflation objectives. Backstops are credible if either the central bank enjoys fiscal backing or fiscal authorities are sufficiently averse to inflation.","[Corsetti, Giancarlo] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Dedola, Luca] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Cambridge; European Central Bank,"Corsetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",gc422@cam.ac.uk; luca.dedola@ecb.int,,"Corsetti, Giancarlo/0000-0001-8965-9853",Keynes Fellowship at Cambridge University; Cambridge-Inet Institute at Cambridge; Centre for Macroeconomics; ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Keynes Fellowship at Cambridge University; Cambridge-Inet Institute at Cambridge; Centre for Macroeconomics; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"A nontechnical version of this paper was delivered as Schumpeter Lecture at the 2015 Annual Congress of the European Economic Association (see Corsetti 2015).

Utilizing the panel data of Taiwanese manufacturing firms during 2002-2012, we further classify FDI methods by whole ownership or a joint venture to investigate a firm's foreign expansion decision. By performing Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, we find that if a firm is more productive, it is more likely to choose FDI rather than exporting. However, productivity of firms choosing whole ownership is not so different from choosing a joint venture. Furthermore, a more productive firm is more likely to conduct both whole ownership of the foreign subsidiary and a joint venture formation in the case of FDI.","[Hsu, Judy] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University,"Hsu, J (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan.",yphsu@fcu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [NSC-102-2410-H-035-004],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","I would like to thank the editor, Kap-Young Jeong, two anonymous referees, and conference participants at the 7th Asia-Pacific Business Research Conference for their valuable comments and incisive suggestions which helped to improve the paper substantially.

Non-parametric approaches, namely the Data Envelopment Analysis and the Malmquist index are employed to calculate technical efficiency and productivity. In addition, a second-stage regression is also estimated to identify the determinants of efficiency. The results indicate that banks in Kazakhstan operate below their optimum levels, with larger banks being more efficient than smaller ones.

The behavioral explanation for the pre-holiday effect is called holiday euphoria. In the current paper, we examine how the holiday period influences the time preference of students, by comparing their subjective discount rate before and after the Passover holiday in Israel. Although there is considerable research on the pre holiday effect and its influence on investors in the capital market, we are unaware of any prior research on the influence of the pre-holiday effect on time preference. Our results suggest that holiday euphoria induces impulsive behavior, making people more present-oriented (having a higher subjective discount rate) before the holiday. We also show how holiday euphoria affects people's immediate mood (feeling down in the present), and how it is affected by their level of pessimism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Two testable hypotheses emerge: (i) for each brand type, price differences across retailers are independent of brand quality differentials and (ii) at a given retailer, price differences between different brand qualities are independent of service quality differentials. Our empirical analysis, for a sample of the U.K. grocery retailer prices, discloses that retailers that offer higher service quality sell same quality brands at higher prices. In particular, service quality premia amount to 6% for national brands and are in the range of 9-15% for low-quality store brands. Besides, at a given retailer, the price premia paid for the national brand are very large: around 150% between national brands and low-quality store brands, and around 40% between national brands and high-quality store brands. Also, the price differential between the national brand and the low-quality store brand does not increase with service quality.","[Manez, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ Econ Struct 2, Valencia, Spain; [Manez, Juan A.; Moner Colonques, Rafael; Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.; Urbano, Amparo] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain; [Moner Colonques, Rafael; Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.; Urbano, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] UCL, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Mañez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ Econ Struct 2, Valencia, Spain.;Mañez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Valencia, Spain.",jamc@uv.es,"Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./E-6234-2016; Urbano, Amparo/F-8534-2016; Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; Moner-Colonques, Rafael/E-6302-2016","Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./0000-0001-6759-2117; Urbano, Amparo/0000-0002-2971-9612; Manez, Juan/0000-0003-1105-0815; Moner-Colonques, Rafael/0000-0002-4389-0870","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER [ECO2011-25033, ECO2013-45045-R, ECO2013-46550-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER under the projects [ECO2011-25033, ECO2013-45045-R and ECO2013-46550-R], and Generalitat Valenciana under the project [PROMETEOII/2014/054].",,26,1,1,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As with many commodity markets, the arrival of new information can lead to unexpectedly rapid changes or jumps in prices; this suggests that RINs prices may follow a more complex process than geometric Brownian motion (GBM). We investigate the potential presence of jumps, as well as time varying volatility in the spot price for RINs. Our results demonstrate that allowing for jumps and time-varying volatility provides statistically important improvements in the modeling of prices, relative to GBM. Both jumps and time varying volatility can contribute to the fatness of the tails in the distribution of price returns, which has implications for investments in capital projects linked to renewables.

The world economy and large economic areas are likely to be wage-led; and parameter shifts in different periods are unlikely to make a difference in this finding. The effects that can come from a wage-led recovery on growth and hence employment are positive, however they are also modest in magnitude. We then present an alternative scenario based on a policy mix of wage increases and public investment. A coordinated mix of polices in the G20 targeted to increase the share of wages in GDP by 1-5 per cent in the next 5 years and to raise public investment in social and physical infrastructure by 1 per cent of GDP in each country can create up to 5.84 per cent more growth in G20 countries.

J,"Ravallion, M",,,,"Ravallion, Martin",,,The World Bank: Why It Is Still Needed and Why It Still Disappoints,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AID; INDUSTRIALIZATION,"Does the World Bank still have an important role to play? How might it fulfill that role? The paper begins with a brief account of how the Bank works. It then argues that, while the Bank is no longer the primary conduit for capital from high-income to low-income countries, it still has an important role in supplying the public good of development knowledge-a role that is no less pressing today than ever. This argument is not a new one. In 1996, the Bank's President at the time, James D. Wolfensohn, laid out a vision for the knowledge bank, an implicit counterpoint to what can be called the lending bank. The paper argues that the past rhetoric of the knowledge bank has not matched the reality. An institution such as the World Bank-explicitly committed to global poverty reduction-should be more heavily invested in knowing what is needed in its client countries as well as in international coordination. It should be consistently arguing for well-informed pro-poor policies in its member countries, tailored to the needs of each country, even when such policies are unpopular with the powers-that-be. It should also be using its financial weight, combined with its analytic and convening powers, to support global public goods. In all this, there is a continuing role for lending, but it must be driven by knowledge-both in terms of what gets done and how it is geared to learning. The paper argues that the Bank disappoints in these tasks but that it could perform better.","[Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Ravallion, Martin] World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Georgetown University; The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Econ, Washington, DC USA.;Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",mr1185@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,48,19,24,0,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Economists formulated several ways of modeling these ideas, focusing upon how individuals are placed with respect to opportunities for achieving various outcomes, and what compensation is due to individuals with truncated opportunities. After presenting a review of the main philosophical ideas (section 2), we turn to economic models (sections 3 and 4). We propose a reformulation of the definition of economic development, replacing the utilitarian measure of GDP per capita with a measure of the degree to which opportunities for income acquisition in a nation have been equalized. Finally, we discuss issues that the econometrician faces in measuring inequality of opportunity, briefly review the empirical literature (section 6), and conclude (section 7).","[Roemer, John E.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Trannoy, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Trannoy, Alain] EHESS, Paris, France",Yale University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Roemer, JE (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,116,108,116,6,66,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Epstein argues that models in the social sciences are inadequate because they are based on a false ontology of methodological individualism, and proposes a new model of social ontology. I examine this model and point to flaws in it. More generally, I argue against Epstein's methodological approach, which treats social ontology as prior to social scientific modeling and as certifying the building blocks that modelers then use.

(2009). This framework is built on the interrelationships between efficiency, risk, capital and diversification. This study uses the Z-score to measure insolvency risk, the SFA to estimate cost efficiency, the ratio of total equity to total assets to capture bank capital and the HHI index to measure the diversification of revenue and earning assets. The results from the 3SLS estimator indicate that revenue diversification has an insignificant impact on insolvency risk, capital ratio and cost efficiency, but earning assets diversification has a negative effect on these three variables, supporting 'classical diversification', 'economic capital' and 'monitoring' behaviours. Moreover, a decline in cost efficiency leads to a rise in insolvency risk, implying 'bad management' behaviour; an increase in risk results in a reduction in cost efficiency, indicating 'bad luck' behaviour; and a reduction in capital ratio in the poorly capitalised banks leads to a growth in risk, suggesting 'moral hazard' behaviour. The results remain strongly robust when using an alternative risk measurement (the loan loss provision ratio) and an alternative SFA model.","[Thanh Pham Thien Nguyen] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nghiem, Son Hong] Queensland Univ Technol, IHBI, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Roca, Eduardo] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University,"Nguyen, TPT (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",thanh.nguyen8@griffithuni.edu.au,"Nguyen, Thanh/W-1463-2019; Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/C-7405-2015; Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Nghiem, Hong Son/F-6263-2010","Nguyen, Thanh/0000-0002-7348-1381; Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/0000-0002-5228-1866; Nghiem, Hong Son/0000-0002-2451-5290",,,,,47,7,7,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We find that the Dutch think that workers in physically demanding occupations should be able to retire earlier. A one standard deviation increase in the perceived demanding nature of an occupation translates into a twelve months decrease in the reasonable retirement age and a 30 to 40 percentage point increase in the willingness to contribute to an early retirement scheme for that occupation. There is some evidence that respondents whose own job is similar to the occupation they evaluate find this occupation more demanding than other respondents, but respondents are typically also willing to contribute to early retirement of demanding occupations not similar to their own.

Alternatively, once uncertainty of relative performance is removed, the gap in willingness to compete between the two groups disappears.

High dependence on foreign aid exhibits strong persistence even after controlling for potential drivers of aid-to-GDP ratio. We find that investment rate and manufacturing intensity are negatively correlated with aid-dependence while a growing investment-savings gap and inflation contribute to its persistence. Among resource-abundant recipients, the probability of high aid-dependence increases with resource rents although oil exporters are on average more self-reliant than non-oil countries.

The global sample was divided into four categories: developed exporters, developed importers, developing exporters and developing importers. The purpose of these categories was to observe whether factors unique to these countries influence the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. With the exception of developing importers, evidence of bi-directional causality between fossil fuel consumption and real GDP across all subsamples is observed. This leads to the conclusion that efforts to directly conserve fossil fuels may harm economic growth. In terms of non-fossil fuel use, the results are more diverse. Bi-directional causality between non-fossil fuel use and real GDP is found in the long and short run for developed importers; bi-directional causality only in the long run for developed exporters; negative long-run causality from real GDP to non-fossil fuels for developing exporters; and long-run causality from non-fossil fuel use to real GDP for developing importers. These results lead to the conclusion that other factors have been responsible for the progress seen in non-fossil fuel use. Thus it is concluded that economic growth on its own is insufficient to promote clean energy development. There is a need for policy makers to create an environment conducive to renewable energy investment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Unless disutility from social distance is strong enough, this creates a strategic tension as individuals with attributes that contribute little to group status would like to join high-status groups, thereby diluting the latters' status and changing stereotypes. Such social free-riding motivates the use of soft exclusion technologies in high-status groups, which provides a unifying rationale for phenomena such as hazing rituals, charitable activities or status symbols that is not taste-based or follows a standard signaling mechanism.

At each election a new political leadership arrives for each party. The leadership cannot choose the party's platform (ideological identities are fixed) but must decide whether or not to contest the election. Contesting elections is costly and this cost is higher if the party has recently been inactive. The distribution of voters' ideal policies, or public opinion, changes over time via a Markov process with a state independent persistence parameter. We characterise stable party systems where the set of contestants is invariant to the recent most observed opinion. We show that stable party systems exist only when public opinion is sufficiently volatile, while highly persistent moods lead to instability and change in the party system whenever public opinion changes.

In addition to generating these well-known networking effects, migrants can also provide valuable information about local finance, thereby easing the credit constraints foreign investors faced during the 2007 financial crisis. This paper sheds new light on the underlying mechanisms through which migration may affect foreign investment in the migrant's homeland by distinguishing between the effects on FDI's intensive and extensive margins. Gravity estimates for 140 countries for the period 2003-2012 suggest that migrants exert a positive effect on bilateral FDI. However, financial constraints moderate this effect, primarily through the extensive margin. Additionally, quantile regression reveals that the interaction between migration and credit constraints is significant only for the lower levels of FDI. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the interplay among migration, financial constraints and FDI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We assess the growth implications of alternative methods of financing public spending on education in a small open economy. We develop a multisector endogenous growth model with human capital accumulation and consider several fiscal instruments to finance the increase in government spending: transfers to households, output, capital and labor taxes. We find a significant difference in the growth impact generated by the choice of the financing method. The non-distortionary financing method provides the highest output increase through its strong effect on physical and human capital stocks. The other distortionary financing methods have lower impacts on long-run economic growth, with labor tax being the most performing. Our simulation results also suggest that even though all methods of financing considered in this paper are growth-inducing in the long-run, their transitional impacts differ. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the full-sample community independent transaction log (CITL), the micro-behaviours can be observed in a closed system. The micro-behaviours of the emitting companies are divided into compliance trading' and non-compliance trading' based on the emitting companies' trading motivations. The micro-behaviours of the financial intermediaries are measured by their influence on the total supply and demand in the market. Then, an AR-GARCH model is established to examine the dynamic relationships between carbon prices and the micro-behaviours of the emitting companies and financial intermediaries. The estimation results suggest that the prices-behaviours relationship is significant. Other important findings are as follows: (1) the mean value of carbon prices positively depends on the compliance trading of the emitting companies and the micro-behaviours of the financial intermediaries; (2) non-compliance buying increases the volatility of carbon prices, while the non-compliance selling stabilizes it and (3) the micro-behaviours of the emitting companies in the lower 50% in terms of emission levels have no significant influence on the mean carbon price, but their non-compliance buying stabilizes the carbon price.","[Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yin-Peng; Guo, Jian-Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development,"Guo, JF (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Guojf@casipm.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271200, 71210005, 71203210]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, under Grant Nos. 71271200, 71210005 and 71203210.",,19,11,11,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Adopting the indirect test approach, we propose a binary measure of Islamic Banks (IBs) reputation by testing their dynamic interactions with regard to conventional banks. Interestingly, we propose different qualitative econometric specifications to capture the drivers of IBs' reputation. Using panel data for 10 major conventional banks and 10 Islamic banks over the period April 2006 - February 2013 (about 17,800 observations), we show that reputation probability can significantly increase in line with Islamic banking performance, while excess risk taken by Islamic bankers will decrease it.

The realized value of the uncertain state of nature is the manager's private information. The paper first considers an economy where the manager cannot share her private information with the investor. Therefore, dividend payment is the only reputation building tool available to the manager. If the investor's prior beliefs about the manager's trustworthiness are sufficiently high, then the manager will return a dividend consistent with the lower possible state of nature having occurred and the investor will revise such beliefs downwards. However, if the beliefs are not so high, then the equilibrium will be mixed strategies. The paper then compares such a dividend-only economy with one where information sharing is an additional tool available for building reputation. Information sharing disciplines the potential opportunism accruing to a manager out of her informational advantage. It provides ex post verifiability of the state of nature and thereby, obviates downward revision of an investor's prior beliefs about a manager's trustworthiness. This results in a greater region of pure strategy play in the dividend-and-information-sharing economy. Since such pure strategy play implies investment with certainty, information sharing leads to higher investment. Further, pure strategy play implies returns consistent with the actual state of nature in the dividend-and-information-sharing economy while it implies dividend consistent with the lower state of nature in the dividend-only economy and these lead to higher return in information sharing.

We estimate the effect of the structural change on households depending on their location in the distribution of income and expenditure. Our estimates are calculated by applying a computable general equilibrium model incorporating microsimulation behaviour with top-down and bottom-up links. We estimate significant increases in real income and small increases in inequality from the changes; the pattern of effects is largely uniform across regions.

The sufficient statistic result holds in a large class of models which includes Taylor (1980); Calvo (1983); Reis (2006); Golosov and Lucas (2007); Nakamura and Steinsson (2010); Midrigan (2011); and Alvarez and Lippi (2014). Several models in this class are able to account for the positive excess kurtosis of the size distribution of price changes that appears in the data. We review empirical measures of kurtosis and frequency and conclude that a model that successfully matches the microevidence on kurtosis and frequency produces real effects that are about four times larger than in the Golosov-Lucas model, and about 30 percent below those of the Calvo model.

Furthermore, some companies charged higher premiums for comprehensive policies with larger deductibles. In contrast to current theories of adverse or propitious selection, our evidence suggests both that consumers are too confused or too poorly informed to arbitrage between policy types and that sellers of car insurance do not implement the incentive-compatibility constraints at the heart of consumer demand theory.

To isolate the role of sectoral specificity, we compare our model with otherwise identical multisector economies with either economy-wide or firm-specific factor markets. Sectoral factor specificity generates within sector strategic substitutability and tends to induce across-sector strategic complementarity in price setting. Our model can produce either more or less monetary non-neutrality than those other two models, depending on parameterization and the distribution of price rigidity across sectors. Under the empirical distribution for the U.S., our model behaves similarly to an economy with firm-specific factors in the short-run, and later on approaches the dynamics of the model with economy-wide factor markets. This is consistent with the idea that factor price equalization might take place gradually over time, so that firm specificity may serve as a reasonable short-run approximation, whereas economy-wide markets are likely a better description of how factors of production are allocated in the longer run.

Honesty in turn motivates managers to view an expropriation from shareholders as self-serving, opportunistic and unethical, thereby alleviating the agency conflict. Religious piety is thus expected to discourage agency-driven acquisitions that reduce shareholder wealth. We exploit the variation in religious piety across US counties (and states) and show that firms located in a more religious environment are indeed less likely to make poor acquisitions, measured by the stock market reactions to the acquisition announcement. To draw a causal inference, we use historical religious piety as far back as 1952 as our instrument. The two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis confirms that religious piety induces firms to make better acquisitions.

Specifically, the Porter hypothesis posits that more stringent environmental regulation, i.e., greater regulatory stringency, leads to greater profitability. In contrast, the conventional costly regulation hypothesis posits that greater regulatory stringency weakens profitability mostly by driving up abatement costs. This study empirically tests these two hypotheses. Of course, regulatory stringency is difficult to measure. More important, regulatory stringency as codified in legislated acts and promulgated rules does not necessarily reflect regulatory stringency in practice, which we deem as effective regulatory stringency. Measurement of effective regulatory stringency is even more challenging. With this challenge in mind, we divide effective regulatory stringency into its two constituent components-(1) legal requirements and (2) regulatory scrutiny-the latter representing government efforts to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. For our analysis, we examine legal requirements in the form of facility-specific effluent limits and regulatory scrutiny in the form of government monitoring inspections. For our empirical analysis, we analyze the U.S. Clean Water Act under which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency imposes numeric wastewater discharge limits on permitted facilities and conducts wastewater-related inspections. As its primary contribution, our study separately examines the effects of legal requirements and regulatory scrutiny on firm-level profitability in order to appreciate the influence of effective regulatory stringency.","[Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 436 Snow Hall,1460 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Rassier, Dylan G.] US Dept Commerce, Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20230 USA",University of Kansas,"Earnhart, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 436 Snow Hall,1460 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",Earnhart@ku.edu,,,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [R-82882801-0],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),This manuscript was partially developed under a STAR Research Assistance Agreement No. R-82882801-0 awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

By combining the GHM view of the firm as a bundle of asset ownerships with that of Alchian and Demsetz (1972), who viewed the firm as a nexus of contracts, the model yields, in some cases, optimal asset ownership different from the implications of the GHM model. We show that the nexus of contracts is a meaningful instrument to govern transactions even in the presence of asset ownership. The optimal contractual network structure depends on the relationship-specificity of investments, unlike the GHM model where the asset ownership depends solely on the asset specificity of investments.

With Malawi as a case study, we aim to address the scarcity of data available to understand the full cost and options of drinking water at a regional level covering both urban and rural areas. We studied options in the northern region of Malawi under the following thematic areas: urban piped water, water wells, handpump spare part supply networks, household point-of-use water treatment, the cost of entering a water business and capacity building in science education. Primary locally sourced data were collected as well as secondary publically available data. Additionally, local markets were surveyed for spare part networks. This research has shown that when looking at water resource economics in northern Malawi, it is not a monopoly and options are available at a range of costs. The data challenge policy-makers to reach the last 10% of the population still lacking improved drinking water. This will require a combination of expansion of urban piped water infrastructure, new boreholes in rural areas, increased handpump functionality rates, scale-up of household drinking water point-of-use treatment and growth of local universities to train local experts within the sector.","[Holm, Rochelle] Mzuzu Univ, Ctr Excellence Water & Sanitat, Mzuzu 2, Malawi; [Singini, Wales] Mzuzu Univ, Dept Fisheries, Mzuzu 2, Malawi; [Gwayi, Simeon] Mzuzu Univ, Dept Phys, Mzuzu 2, Malawi",,"Holm, R (通讯作者)，Mzuzu Univ, Ctr Excellence Water & Sanitat, Mzuzu 2, Malawi.",rochelle@rochelleholm.com,,,,,,,35,7,7,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main finding is that the majority of the member countries did not receive economic gains from the EMU in sovereign debt markets. Synthetic counterfactual analysis finds strong evidence that Austria, Belgium, Finland, France and the Netherlands have paid a positive and substantial euro-premium in their 10-year government bonds since the adoption of the single currency. After the most recent financial crisis, government bond yields have been higher in all member countries compared to the situation that would have occurred without the monetary unification.

These findings constitute a significant improvement over previous results in the literature, in terms of both speed of convergence and parsimony of the learning model. The learning model exhibits several appealing features: it is frugal, is easy to apply to a various range of learning objectives, and requires few procedures and little information. Particular care is given to behavioral interpretation of the modeling assumptions in light of evidence from the fields of psychology and social science. Our results highlight the need to depart from the genetic metaphor, and account for intentional decision-making, based on agents' relative performances. By contrast, we show that convergence is strongly hindered by exact imitation processes, or random exploration mechanisms, which are usually assumed when modeling social learning behavior. Our results suggest a method for modeling bounded rationality, which could be interestingly tested in a wide range of economic models with adaptive dynamics.","[Salle, Isabelle] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Salle, Isabelle] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Seppecher, Pascal] Univ Paris 13, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Seppecher, Pascal] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Universite Paris 13; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Salle, I (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CeNDEF, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",I.L.Salle@uva.nl,"Salle, Isabelle/GOP-1243-2022","Seppecher, Pascal/0000-0002-9059-9242","GREThA, University of Bordeaux; EU FP7 RAstaNEWS project [320278]","GREThA, University of Bordeaux; EU FP7 RAstaNEWS project(European Union (EU))","We are grateful to two anonymous referees and an associate editor, the participants at the internal seminar at CeNDEF, University of Amsterdam, on February 15, 2013, the participants at the internal seminar at GREDEG, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, on October 16, 2013, and the participants at the 2014 CEF conference in Oslo, Norway for helpful discussions and feedbacks.

We apply well-known univariate tests for nonlinearity, with distinct power functions over alternatives, but with different null hypotheses reflecting the existence of different concepts of linearity and nonlinearity in the time series literature. We utilize daily data on crude oil spot price for over 26 years, as well as monthly data on crude oil spot price for 41 years. Investigating the monthly price of crude oil along with the daily price distinguishes the approach of this paper from existing studies focusing on the time series structure of crude oil price. All the tests detect strong evidence of general nonlinear serial dependence, as well as nonlinearity in the mean, variance, and skewness functions in the daily spot price of crude oil. Since evidence of nonlinear dependence is less dramatic in monthly observations, nonlinear serial dependence is moderated by time aggregation in crude oil prices but not significantly.

For this, I measure inequality at the cohort level by using pseudo-panel data built from household surveys for fifteen Latin American countries (from circa 1995 to circa 2011) and measure democracy as the discounted cumulative value of the degree of democracy during the cohort's formative years. I find that cohorts that have higher discounted cumulative values of the degree of democracy show lower income inequality. However, the effect of democracy on income dispersion is driven by those cohorts that benefited from the surge of democracies that came to exist during the second half of the twentieth century.

In our framework information is a productive input, which is essentially specialized labor, so information acquisition is linked to the labor market and thereby to macroeconomic conditions. We show that when firms acquire information optimally, information acquisition is endogenously procyclical, and therefore economic uncertainty faced by the firms is countercyclical. Two-way feedback exists between economic uncertainty and macroeconomic activities, resulting in an amplification effect of TFP shocks, and possibly generating multiple equilibria. Our basic model can also be extended to explain countercyclical aggregate volatility. On the theoretical side, our model demonstrates that strategic complementarity (substitutability) in information acquisition coincides with strategic complementarity (substitutability) in production, and that reducing uncertainty through information acquisition improves resource allocation.

We define imitative dynamics which include the replicator dynamic as a special case as evolutionary dynamics that satisfy the imitative property and payoff monotonicity. Our definition of payoff monotonicity, which we use Radon-Nikodym derivatives to define, is weaker than the one proposed in Oechssler and Riedel (2002). We find that Oechssler and Riedel (2002)'s definition is too strong, and our definition is more adequate than theirs. We show that for a broad class of payoff functional dynamics, payoff monotonicity a la Oechssler and Riedel (2002) is equivalent to aggregate monotonicity in the sense of Samuelson and Zhang (1992). We then provide sufficient conditions for imitative dynamics and general evolutionary dynamics to be well-defined. Finally, with our definition of payoff monotonicity, a number of results that are standard for finite games extend to the case of games with continuous strategy space. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Considering a three-stage game in which the firms first make price discrimination decisions followed by two-stage pricing decisions, the two main results we obtain are the following: (i) if consumers underestimate the quality of the products at a level that is not very low, there are two subgame perfect Nash equilibria where both firms do not collect information about consumers' purchase histories so that neither firm price discriminates and where both firms collect consumer information to practice BBPD; (ii) BBPD is more profitable than uniform pricing if consumers overestimate at a more than moderate level.","[Chung, Hoe Sang] Korea Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",,"Chung, HS (通讯作者)，Korea Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,26,3,3,3,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This study provides a detailed analysis of the effect of incentive compatibility on discrepancies in reported preferences. Specifically, we construct several partial ranking models (for best and worst alternatives) and conduct various statistical tests to determine where, how, and why discrepancies occur between an incentive compatible auction and a non-incentive compatible ranking task. While most previous comparisons were done using consumer valuation, this study uses preference orderings to provide a more robust comparison. For this purpose, the bids reported under the auction exercise were recoded as implied ranks. Our results highlight the importance of different incentive structures on the way people report their preferences in the presence and absence of incentive compatibility. In general, individuals were following different behavioral rules to evaluate the alternatives under the two elicitation mechanisms. However, preference parameter estimates for the best and worst alternatives seem to be more immune, although for different reasons, to the effect of different incentive structures than for middle ranked alternatives. This suggests that incentive compatibility and incentive structure should not be ignored when the analysis of preferences over the middle ranked alternatives is desired.","[Kassas, Bachir; Palma, Marco A.; Zhang, Yvette] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kassas, B (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.",bmk11@tamu.edu,,"Kassas, Bachir/0000-0002-3922-471X",,,,,38,1,2,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

In contrast, PSM estimates suggest a weakly significant wage penalty for men and women only when kernel matching (KM) is used, but not when nearest neighbor matching (NNM) or radius matching (RM) techniques are used.

In an economy where firms with heterogeneous productivity operate under borrowing constraints, the redistribution reproduces hump-shaped responses for output and labor and procyclicality in observed productivity. In this model, a financial shock generates a persistent and hump-shaped response, whereas a productivity shock does not. Further, the redistribution of wealth significantly amplifies the persistence and hump shape of these responses following a financial shock. This model suggests that redistribution may thus be a key driving force behind the transmission of financial crises.","[Kobayashi, Keiichiro] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kobayashi, Keiichiro; Shirai, Daichi] Canon Inst Global Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Kobayashi, Keiichiro] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University,"Kobayashi, K (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",kobayasi@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We find that the upstream fixed cost plays an important role to affect the overall welfare comparison between total and partial deregulation. When the upstream fixed cost is sufficiently large, the number of downstream firms is limited in both situations; in other words, the duplication of downstream fixed costs is relatively irrelevant so that the double markup effect dominates. Consequently, the regulator can only replicate total deregulation to maximize social welfare in the event of partial deregulation. If it is the case, we suggest that total deregulation is superior to partial deregulation since the latter suffers more regulatory cost than that of the former.","[Lin, Chi-Chih] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 160 Linwei Rd, Jiaosi 26247, Yilan County, Taiwan",Fo Guang University,"Lin, CC (通讯作者)，Fo Guang Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 160 Linwei Rd, Jiaosi 26247, Yilan County, Taiwan.",cadylin@mail.fgu.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,5,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

While the standard approach in the literature on interest rate pass-through is focused on the impact of changes in the domestic money market rate, the objective of this study is to adapt the existing interest rate pass-through analysis to the case of a country with a currency board arrangement. To this end, the role of money market conditions in the euro area and the influence of the domestic business climate are taken into account. The impact of these factors on loan interest rates in Bulgaria is examined through symmetric as well as asymmetric error-correction models. The analysis identifies specific patterns in the response of loan interest rates depending on the sector of the borrower, the currency denomination and the maturity of loans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I find that the underlying common social institution of caste was crucial for the workings of the banking system and effectively acted as a club. Exclusion was achieved by restricting membership by birth and the practice of endogamy. These mechanisms created the necessary incentives to provide meaningful rules as well as their enforcement. I describe and analyze the privately provided self-regulatory mechanisms of clearinghouses, inter-bank lending and information sharing. The Chettiar banking system thus adds to existing instances of self-regulated banking as well as points to the economic underpinnings of caste as an institution.","[Nair, Malavika] Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36081 USA",Troy University System; Troy University,"Nair, M (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Sorrell Coll Business, Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36081 USA.",mnair@troy.edu,"Nair, Malavika/JWP-6637-2024",,,,,,62,9,10,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We consider this issue through a set of simple illustrative exercises, whereby the US raises the federal minimum wage in two steps over four years, first to $10.50 within one year, then to $15 after three more years. We conclude that the fast-food industry could absorb the increase in its overall wage bill without resorting to cuts in their employment levels at any point over this four-year adjustment period. We find that the fast-food industry could fully absorb these wage bill increases through a combination of turnover reductions, trend increases in sales growth, and modest annual price increases over the four-year period. Working from the relevant existing literature, our results are based on a set of reasonable assumptions on fast-food turnover rates, the price elasticity of demand within the fast-food industry, and the industry's underlying trend for sales growth. We also show that fast-food firms would not need to lower their average profit rate during this adjustment period.","[Pollin, Robert] Univ Massachusetts, Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollin, Robert; Wicks-Lim, Jeannette] Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Pollin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Pollin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",,,,,,,,38,5,6,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

News of a future sovereign default hampers financial intermediation. First, it tightens the funding constraints of banks, reducing their resources to finance firms (liquidity channel). Second, it generates a precautionary motive to deleverage (risk channel). I estimate the model using Italian data, finding that sovereign risk was recessionary and that the risk channel was sizable. I also use the model to measure the effects of subsidized long-term loans to banks.

Under current incentive schemes, the uncertainty and intermittency of these resources impose costs on the grid, which are typically socialized across the whole system, rather than born by their creators. We consider an institutional framework in which VERs face market imbalance prices, giving them an incentive to produce higher-value energy subject to less adverse uncertainty. In this setting, we consider an aggregator that owns the production rights to a VER's output, and also signs contracts with a population of demand response (DR) participants for the right to curtail them in real time, according to a contractually specified probability distribution. The aggregator bids a day ahead offer into the wholesale market, and is able to offset imbalances between the cleared day-ahead bid and the realized VER production by curtailing DR participants' consumption according to the signed contracts. We consider the optimization of the aggregator's end-to-end problem: designing the menu of DR service contracts using contract theory, bidding into the wholesale market, and dispatching DR consistently with the contractual agreements. We do this in a setting in which wholesale market prices, VER output, and participant demand are all stochastic, and possibly correlated.","[Campaigne, Clay; Oren, Shmuel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Oren, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, 4141 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",oren@ieor.berkeley.edu,,,Department of Energy,Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The authors thank Felipe Castro for his help with an earlier version of this project.

This article investigates efficiency gains specified as equities of scope associated with the likelihood of the two banks involved in merger under capital regulation. We find that merger incentives are encouraged when the narrowing banking is conducted by the consolidated bank, whereas discouraged when the synergy banking is conducted. Raising bank capital requirement leads to an increased interest margin of the consolidated bank with the narrow banking valuation; however, to a decreased margin of the consolidated bank with the synergy banking valuation. An increase in the capital regulation reduces the merger incentives in the narrow banking valuation whereas increases the merger disincentive in the synergy banking valuation. These findings are consistent with the organizational theory that predicts a comparative advantage of narrow banking proposals in bank mergers.","[Chen, Shi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tsai, Jeng-Yan; Jou, Rosemary] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Tamkang University,"Tsai, JY (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",tsaijy@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

When the effort choices of different agents in a firm are complementary, having hard-working coworkers makes an agent more productive. Therefore, in equilibrium, she will work harder. Foreseeing that a work ethic is more useful to hard-working agents, parents will be more willing to transmit it in societies in which the probability that their offspring will have coworkers with strong work ethic is higher. I then expand the model to incorporate the firm technology choice, allowing firms to decide between complementary and separable production processes. In societies with wide dissemination of work ethic, firms will want effort to be complementary (as in modern production processes), while the opposite is true when the dissemination of work ethic is narrow. Finally, I investigate the comparative dynamics of the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The manufacturing unit labor cost (ULCM)-based indicator reports a major competitiveness loss in Italy. Owing to the internationalization of production processes and to the fading representativeness of labor on overall costs we argue that price-based measures are more appropriate than those based on ULCMs to assess external competitiveness and play a more important role in explaining export growth. Measuring non-price competitiveness and considering global value chains are also crucial to correctly identify the determinants of trade flows in the four largest euro-area countries.","[Giordano, Claire; Zollino, Francesco] Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Directorate, Econ Outlook Div, Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Giordano, C (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Directorate, Econ Outlook Div, Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",claire.giordano@bancadi-talia.it; francesco.zollino@bancadi-talia.it,,,,,,,46,24,24,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

It is found that from a global perspective, the only policy regime that leads to a unique equilibrium is one where fiscal policy is active, i.e. the fiscal theory of the price level regime in Sims (1994). From a local perspective, there are three regimes. In particular, and relative to the previous literature following Leeper (1991), a new third regime exists where a passive fiscal rule combined with a passive monetary rule can still deliver determinacy where the same area of the parameter space would lead to multiple solutions if taxes were lump sum. To obtain the size of the new regime, the paper characterizes analytically the extent to which tax cuts are self-financing and how the distortionary tax Laffer curve looks near the steady state. In the new regime, monetary and fiscal backstops are brought into play so as to rule out off equilibrium dynamics, and inflation can temporarily increase in order to increase seigniorage revenues. With this flexibility, the monetary policy is consistent with the real debt remaining bounded, and the arithmetic that follows is monetarist and unpleasant in the sense of Sargent and Wallace (1981).

For each household, there are two channels through which the risky share responds to wealth fluctuations, the income channel and the habit channel. Across households, there are heterogeneous responses through both the habit channel and the income channel. Finally, two potential misspecification problems on time-varying relative risk aversion arise when both heterogeneous responses through the habit channel and the responses through the income channel are ignored. Our main empirical findings are to show the importance of the income channel and the heterogeneous responses, and to provide strong evidence of relative risk aversion varying with wealth, after correcting two misspecification problems.

The model also explains the observed cross-state variation in consumer default rates.

We employ a two-step procedure; first, we decompose manufacturing energy intensity change into two driving effects efficiency and structural change. The second step uses panel time series regression techniques to estimate the impacts of prices on the effects driving manufacturing energy intensity. The advantage of using these techniques is that they account for heterogeneity and cross-section dependence in the data, something recent energy intensity research has emphasised. The results from this decomposition support existing findings that efficiency is the major driver for observed reduction in energy intensity. Further, the second stage results indicate that rising prices improve efficiency; importantly these effects vary across countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Taking this into account reduces the value of leisure necessary to match the wide labor market business cycles experienced in the United States using the Mortensen-Pissarides model. For this calculation, we analyze a version of the model where unemployment insurance benefits not only expire but must be earned with prior employment. With these features, we can calibrate the model to be consistent with unemployment responding strongly to productivity shocks and mildly to changes in unemployment insurance policies. Our preferred calibration predicts that the standard deviation of unemployment since 1945 would have fallen by around 37% if there had not been programs extending unemployment benefits during recessions. We also find that the enactment of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program in 2008 increased the unemployment rate by 0.5 percentage points.","[Faig, Miquel; Zhang, Shiny] Univ Toronto, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Zhang, Min] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Min] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Toronto; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Faig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",miquel.faig@utoronto.ca,,"Zhang, Min/0000-0001-8361-6262",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203132],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are thankful for the comments received in the various places where this paper was presented.

Estimating the conditional labour demand model we find that offshoring impacts negatively labour demand, and in particular the demand for low- and medium-educated labour, with some evidence indicating that offshoring has tended to increase labour demand elasticities. Of particular interest are results for the subsamples of developed and developing countries. Most notably, we find that the negative effects of offshoring in developed countries are largest for high-educated labour, an outcome which we show is due to the offshoring of developed countries with other developed countries.","[Foster-McGregor, Neil] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Poeschl, Johannes; Stehrer, Robert] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies Wiiw, Rahlgasse 3, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",Maastricht University; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Foster-McGregor, N (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",foster@merit.unu.edu; Johannes.poeschl@wiiw.ac.at; robert.stehrer@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,21,16,16,4,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Estimates of a dynamic panel model for about 60 countries for 1975-2011 suggest that elections increase natural resource rents. The incumbent uses these rents for expanding public spending and reducing taxes before elections. However, these electoral cycle effects are statistically significant only in young democracies.

Building on recent developments in econometric model selection for more variables than observations, we saturate a regression model with a full set of designed break functions. By selecting over these break functions using an extended general-to-specific algorithm, we obtain unbiased estimates of the break date and magnitude. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the approximate properties of the approach. We assess the methodology by detecting volcanic eruptions in a time series of Northern Hemisphere mean temperature spanning roughly 1200years, derived from a fully coupled global climate model simulation. Our technique demonstrates that historic volcanic eruptions can be statistically detected without prior knowledge of their occurrence or magnitude- and hence may prove useful for estimating the past impact of volcanic events using proxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global mean temperature, leading to an improved understanding of the effect of stratospheric aerosols on temperatures. The break detection procedure can be applied to evaluate policy impacts as well as act as a robust forecasting device.","[Pretis, Felix] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Schneider, Lea] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-55122 Mainz, Germany; [Smerdon, Jason E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hendry, David F.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Columbia University; University of Oxford,"Pretis, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",felix.pretis@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Smerdon, Jason E/F-9952-2011","Schneider, Lea/0000-0002-8208-7300; Hendry, David/0000-0002-8013-576X",Open Society Foundations; Oxford Martin School; Robertson Foundation; British Academy,Open Society Foundations; Oxford Martin School; Robertson Foundation; British Academy,"We thank Vanessa Berenguer-Rico, Guillaume Chevillon, Niels Haldrup, Eric Hillebrand, Soren Johansen, Katarina Juselius, Oleg Kitov, John Muellbauer, Bent Nielsen, Max Roser, Timo Terasvirta, and anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

In response to a shock that brings the economy into a liquidity trap, an expansion in government spending increases output and causes a fall in the unemployment rate. Since movements in unemployment are persistent, the effects of current spending prevail into the future, leading to an enduring rise in income. As an enduring rise in income boosts private demand, an increase in government spending sets in motion a virtuous employment-spending spiral with large effects on macroeconomic aggregates.","[Rendahl, Pontus] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Rendahl, Pontus] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",University of Cambridge; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Rendahl, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.;Rendahl, P (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Rendahl, Pontus/JAN-9047-2023","Rendahl, Pontus/0000-0003-3052-5732",Centre for Macroeconomics (CfM); Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Centre for Macroeconomics (CfM); Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I would like to thank the editor, Francesco Caselli, and three anonymous referees.

To accomplish this, we work in a partial equilibrium model and place a small country framework in which foreign direct investment (FDI) takes place. Our results show that, when the domestic firms act under non-competitive conditions and the foreign firms under competitive conditions respectively, such a regulation represents a tax or subsidy on emissions. This is the result of a production effect, which reflects the decrease in social welfare associated with a drop in the level of production of the domestic firms, and a pollution effect, which reflects the increase in welfare related to the lower level of emissions. Furthermore, when we allow for the possibility that the foreign firms experience an exogenous technological change, generated by means of their headquarters, with spillovers in favor of domestic firms, it is found that the new optimal policy (with technological change) could be greater, equal, or lower than the previous one (without technological change); therefore, we can conclude that the effects of an exogenous technological change on the optimal environmental regulation are uncertain.","[Sampaolesi, Alejandro] UCES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Sampaolesi, A (通讯作者)，UCES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",asampaolesi@campus.uces.edu.ar,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This article adopts both a traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) panel model and a threshold panel model using data from 31 administrative regions (provinces) in China during the 2004-2013 period. The results reveal remarkable and significant nonlinear relationships between star-rated hotel expansion and inbound tourism development, thereby offering sound evidence supporting the research hypotheses. Star-rated hotel expansion in most provinces clusters in the standardized threshold between 0.48 and 0.83, while only a few hotels have realized leapfrog development' thus far. In addition, as in the particular case of star-rated hotels, inbound tourism development should be promoted through investments in human resources rather than through the exploitation of natural tourism resource endowments. The implications of our results are that rational development plans can be made according to different expansion levels of star-rated hotels in corresponding regions, when both hotel labour productivity and macro tourism environment are considered.","[Shi, Ruyi; Ji, Shengbao; Wang, Xiaozhen] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China; [Li, Fan] Beijing Int Studies Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology; Beijing International Studies University,"Ji, SB (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R China.",jishengbao9646@126.com,,,"High-level Papers Project of China University of Mining and Technology [2012LWB19]; Jiangsu Province Graduate Research AMP; Innovation Project [KYZZ_0383]; National Natural Sciences Fund Project [71273259, 71303234, 71403269]; China Humanities and Social Science Fund Project of Ministry of Education [13YJC630058]; China Post-doc Research Foundation [2012M510142]",High-level Papers Project of China University of Mining and Technology; Jiangsu Province Graduate Research AMP; Innovation Project; National Natural Sciences Fund Project; China Humanities and Social Science Fund Project of Ministry of Education; China Post-doc Research Foundation,"This work was supported by the High-level Papers Project of China University of Mining and Technology [grant number 2012LWB19]; Jiangsu Province Graduate Research & Innovation Project [grant number KYZZ_0383]; National Natural Sciences Fund Project [grant number 71273259], [grant number 71303234], [grant number 71403269]; China Humanities and Social Science Fund Project of Ministry of Education [grant number 13YJC630058]; China Post-doc Research Foundation [grant number 2012M510142].",,50,10,11,6,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our results suggest that diversification may not attenuate the output volatility effects of openness for transition countries already at medium or higher levels of diversification, but nonetheless may have this effect at lower levels of diversification. Further, while inflation volatility and conflict both increase output volatility, better political institutions contribute to output stability in transition countries. In addition, we find that differences between diversification at the export margins are not just conceptual, but also substantive: the effect of openness is conditional on export diversification at the intensive margin but not at the extensive margin. These findings are robust to different assumptions regarding the potential endogeneity of openness and institutional quality as well as to alternative proxies for institutions and output volatility and additional control variables.

As auctions, they are novel in that they feature publicly recommended but non-binding bid prices and bidders with identical budget constraints. Recommended prices prove to be reasonable forecasts of player value and bidding on average tends to follow those recommendations. Individual bidding behavior, however, follows a distinct pattern of overbidding followed by underbidding (relative to recommended value). Participants tend to overbid early, paying more than the recommended value for the first two or three players they win, irrespective of who those players are. Underbidding for the next few picks then follows, with some overbidding occurring for the last pick. This behavior suggests a new variety of declining price phenomenon which we believe is reflective of the auction environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Just world beliefs research suggests that individuals believe they merit unequal treatment they experience. Merit depends on ability and effort so that disadvantage (advantage) may undermine (bolster) confidence in own relative ability. Because decisions determining economic success rely on such beliefs (e.g. competitiveness), inequality may self-perpetuate. In multiple experiments, I randomly assign unequal pay for an identical task where performance depends on cognitive ability. I find that pay level consistently and substantially affects beliefs but not performance. Finally, I show that among males high pay increases competitiveness by 33%.","[Butler, Jeffrey V.] Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Via Sallustiana 62, I-00187 Rome, Italy",,"Butler, JV (通讯作者)，Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Via Sallustiana 62, I-00187 Rome, Italy.",jeff.butler@eief.it,"Butler, Jeffrey/AAF-7098-2020",,National Science Foundation [SES 04-17871]; UC Berkeley's X-lab,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UC Berkeley's X-lab,"I owe a great debt of gratitude to George A.

To understand the behaviour of the nominal yield curve in Chile, we rely on an affine dynamic term structure model which allows the term structure to decompose into the expected short-term interest rate (related to the monetary policy expectation) and the term premium. We show that most of the fall of long-term interest rates as well as its dynamics are related to the term premium rather than the expected short-term interest rate.

We focus on single-peaked/single-plateaued preferences with worst indifferent allocations, single-troughed preferences and single-troughed preferences with best indifferent allocations. We begin by introducing a weak variant of no-veto power, called I*-weak no-veto power, which form together with unanimity and a stronger version of Maskin monotonicity a sufficient condition for Nash implementation in general environment. We apply this result to the above preference domains and we prove that any SCC that has full range is Nash implementable if and only if it satisfies Maskin monotonicity. We examine the implementability of some well-known correspondences. We give examples of SCCs that are monotonic in the unrestricted domains and also monotonic in our setup, and we provide exemples of SCCs that are not monotonic in the unrestricted domains, but monotonic and therefore Nash implementable in our context.

This places the power sector at the forefront of any move away from fossil fuels, even though fossil-fuelled generators are more dependable and flexible than nuclear reactors or intermittent renewables, and vital for the second-by-second balancing of supply and demand. Renewables tend to supplement, rather than replace, fossil capacity, although output from fossil-fuelled stations will fall and some will have to retire to avoid depressing wholesale power prices. At times of low demand and high renewable output prices can turn negative, but electricity storage, long-distance interconnection, and flexible demand may develop to absorb any excess generation.

This paper analyzes whether tax avoidance behavior interacts with these costs and how policies of competing governments respond to it. We show that the interaction in itself may lead to profit taxes that are inefficiently high (low), provided the costs are attenuated (magnified) by higher profit taxes. Further, internal efficiency costs might render infrastructure provision inefficiently low. We also clarify the implications of the decision to set up an internal capital market and of external finance for the behavior of competing governments. The results are consistent with empirical findings that are not inherently related to the notion of fiscal competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

From a theoretical point of view, higher progressivity increases overall employment through a wage moderating effect and also because employment of low-paid workers is more elastic to wages. We test these theoretical predictions on a panel of 21 OECD countries over 1998-2008. Controlling for the burden of taxation at the average wage, our estimates suggest that a more progressive tax schedule reduces the unemployment rate and increases the employment rate. These findings are confirmed when we account for the potential endogeneity of both average taxation and progressivity. Overall, our results suggest that policy-makers should not only focus on the detrimental effects of tax progressivity on in-work effort, but also consider the employment-enhancing effects.","[Lehmann, Etienne] Univ Pantheon Assas Paris 2, CRED TEPP, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Lucifora, Claudio; Moriconi, Simone] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Lucifora, Claudio] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Moriconi, Simone] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, 162A,Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Van der Linden, Bruno] Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, IRES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Luxembourg; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Lehmann, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas Paris 2, CRED TEPP, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",etienne.lehmann@gmail.com; claudio.lucifora@unicatt.it; simone.moriconi@unicatt.it; bruno.vanderlinden@uclouvain.be,"Lehmann, Etienne/HFZ-8470-2022; Lehmann, Etienne/AAI-3084-2020","Lehmann, Etienne/0000-0002-2408-9674; LUCIFORA, Claudio/0000-0001-6352-1709",,,,,68,13,14,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We use the model to study Plan Colombia, a large intervention aimed at reducing the downstream supply of cocaine by targeting illicit crops and blocking the transport of cocaine outside this source country. The model fits the main patterns found in the data, including the displacement of the drug trade to other source countries, the increase in coca crops' productivity as a response to eradication, and the lack of apparent effects in consumer markets. We use a reasonable parametrization of our model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different policies implemented under Plan Colombia. We find that the marginal cost to the U.S. of reducing cocaine transacted in retail markets by one kilogram is $940,000, if it subsidizes eradication efforts; and $175,000, if it subsidizes interdiction efforts in Colombia.

Our results indeed show that strategic voting arises. Its extent depends on (i) information availability; (ii) the relative importance of the intermediate candidate; (iii) the electorate's relative support for one's preferred candidate; (iv) the relative position of the plurality-supported candidate in one's preference ordering.

The results from analyzing real-side news and price news reveal that nominal rates are less sensitive to news, while real interest rates respond to some news in the opposite direction at the zero lower bound as they would do in normal times. This suggests that, at least in the short run, policies that increase inflation (e.g., fiscal expansion) are favorable to the economy at the zero lower bound; this result is consistent with the prediction of the New Keynesian models. By using an identification strategy based on heterogeneity, I find that at the ZLB, monetary policy news is less effective in affecting short-and medium-term real rates and its effect dies off faster.

Both countries have a long history of relying on FDI in industrial development. The existing literature on productivity spillovers suggests that productivity spillovers may be one of the most important effects that foreign MNEs impart to local firms in developing countries. Yet still, few studies exist in both countries on productivity spillovers and their transmission channels. Three spillover channels were examined: demonstration, competition, and information. In addition, the backward linkage channel was examined for the case of Malaysia. The results reveal that there is limited evidence of negative productivity spillovers from foreign firms to domestic firms through the competition effects in Kenya. In Malaysia, there is evidence of positive spillovers from foreign-owned firms to domestic firms through the demonstration effects. In addition, there is evidence of negative spillovers through the competition effects as well as backward linkages. There is also evidence of positive productivity spillovers from domestic firms to foreign-owned firms through backward linkages. Productivity spillovers are found to be dependent on the technology gap.","[Kinuthia, Bethuel Kinyanjui] Univ Nairobi, Sch Econ, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Kinuthia, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Nairobi, Sch Econ, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",bkijus@yahoo.com,,,,,,,42,3,4,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Using data for 124 countries over a 16-year time period, I examine spatial relationships in defence spending to investigate how countries account for the military spending of other countries when setting their budgets. Using specially developed weighting matrices, the regression results indicate that defence budgets are positively spatially correlated. These results provide support for the use of 'external' factors when examining defence budgets over this time period. The importance of a country's spatial location when setting its budget is further examined through the identification of regions of high and low defence spending.","[Skogstad, Karl] Lakehead Univ, Dept Econ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada",Lakehead University,"Skogstad, K (通讯作者)，Lakehead Univ, Dept Econ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",kaskogst@lakeheadu.ca,,,Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Queen's University,Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); Queen's University,"I am grateful to Huw Lloyd-Ellis, Ugurhan Berkok, Beverly Lapham, Andrea Craig, Lealand Morin, Derek Stacey and Matt Webb for valuable advice.

We consider 'public spirit' (a positive attitude adopted by citizens for the benefit of the community) and associational activity (individuals' engagement in voluntary activities) two major expressions of prosocial behaviour and estimate their impact on Palestinians' 'tax morale' (intrinsic motivation to pay taxes). The empirical analysis employs a unique Palestinian public opinion survey conducted in 2007 in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. By using a bivariate probit model, we find that tax morale increases with public spirit but it is lower among Palestinians involved in associational activities. Predicted conditional probabilities indicate that public spirit has more impact when the respondent has low confidence in the institutions and in the rule of law. Finally, more public spirit is required for a self-employed person in order to deal with tax compliance than for a worker in the public sector, unless the worker in the public sector has lower confidence in the institutions and in the rule of law than the self-employed person.","[Andriani, Luca] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Andriani, L (通讯作者)，Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",luca.andriani@bbk.ac.uk,"Andriani, Luca/JNS-6687-2023","Andriani, Luca/0000-0001-5541-4583",,,,,47,16,17,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

First, the determinants of the emergence and persistence of exploitation and class are investigated, and the role of labor-saving technical change and, even more importantly, power is highlighted. Second, it is shown that the concept of exploitation provides the foundations for a logically coherent and empirically relevant analysis of inequalities and class relations in advanced capitalist economies. An index that identifies the exploitation level, or intensity of each individual can be defined and its distribution studied using the standard tools developed in the theory of inequality measurement.","[Cogliano, Jonathan F.] Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, Althouse 112 POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA; [Veneziani, Roberto] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Yoshihara, Naoki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Naka 2-1, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan; [Yoshihara, Naoki] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Management, 2-22 Eikokuji Chou, Kochi, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Yoshihara, Naoki] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Thompson Hall 200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Dickinson College; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Hitotsubashi University; Kochi University Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Cogliano, JF (通讯作者)，Dickinson Coll, Dept Econ, Althouse 112 POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",coglianj@dickinson.edu; r.veneziani@qmul.ac.uk; nyoshihara@econs.umass.edu,"Cogliano, Jonathan/P-8606-2019","Cogliano, Jonathan/0000-0002-5292-7727; Yoshihara, Naoki/0000-0002-0804-787X",,,,,36,12,12,2,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2016,67.0,2,,,SI,,242,290,,10.1111/meca.12114,0.0,,,49,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK7ZK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375145700003,0

In our setup, firms look to a variety of noisy information sources when making input decisions. We devise a novel empirical strategy that uses a combination of firm-level production and stock market data to pin down the information structure in the economy. Even when only capital is chosen under imperfect information, applying this methodology to data from the United States, China, and India reveals substantial losses in productivity and output due to the informational friction. Our estimates for these losses range from 7% to 10% for productivity and 10% to 14% for output in China and India, and are smaller, though still significant, in the United States. Losses are substantially higher when labor decisions are also made under imperfect information.

A one percent increase in the tax cost of giving causes charitable receipts to fall by about four percent, an effect three times larger the consensus in the literature. Further analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in the tax response by subsector: health care and home care are more tax-sensitive than other charities, while higher education and arts are less tax-sensitive. The results are consistent with substantial tax response heterogeneity within the sample and between sampled and unsampled charities, implying that the mean tax elasticity of charitable contributions is a poor predictor of tax incentive effects for individual charities.

This article provides evidence that professional athletes suffer from a left-digit bias when dealing with signals about differences in performance.

For the estimation of causal effects, we exploit the fact that tiny time differences can be attributed to random shocks.

We conduct a large-scale field experiment to examine voluntary contributions to a carbon offsetting program during the online purchase of a bus ticket We systematically vary the individual payoff structure by introducing different price rebates (2.5%, 50%, 75%) and corresponding matching grants (1/3: 1 1:1, 3:1). Using data on returning customers, we investigate the long-term effects of the different stimuli, both while treatments were in place as well as their persistence for the time after treatment removal. In the first bookings, our results show that all price rebate schemes increase the participation rate in the offsetting program, while we find weaker effects for matching grants. When bookers are treated repeatedly, only the equal (1:1) matching scheme continues to lead to higher participation rates. Even after removing the subsidies, we report higher participation rates for customers previously facing a 1:1 matching scheme. This treatment is also the only one increasing net contributions of customers compared to the control group. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For the EU countries and the years 1980 to 2007, we built a unique dataset containing information on patent production in eight different technologies, proxies of market regulation and technology-specific renewable energy policies. Our main finding is that, compared to privatisation and unbundling, reducing entry barriers is a more significant driver of renewable energy innovation, but that its effect varies across technologies and is stronger in technologies characterised by potential entry of small, independent power producers. In addition, the inducement effect of renewable energy policies is heterogeneous and more pronounced for wind, which is the only technology that is mature and has high technological potential. Finally, ratification of the Kyoto protocol, which determined a more stable and less uncertain policy framework, amplifies the inducement effect of both energy policy and market liberalisation.

We employ three second generation heterogeneous linear panel models and one recently developed non-linear panel estimation technique that allows for cross-sectional dependence. With respect to 28 major oil exporting countries, an increase in oil prices leads to an improved real oil trade balance, although it is detrimental to non-oil and total trade balances. This finding might be due to the expenditure effect arising from increases in proceeds from oil exports. A decrease in oil prices is found to be beneficial for both total and oil trade balances in these oil exporting countries. Forty major oil importers seem to be increasingly shielded from positive oil shocks over the 1970s and 1980s; however, they must worry about oil price declines. A decline in oil prices has a negative impact on both total and real oil trade balances resulting from increased oil imports in emerging economies. Hence, a decline in oil prices is beneficial to oil exporters due to the quantity effect outweighing the price effect, while for oil importers a stable oil price is more desirable than a price decline. These results are important to take into account if we are to gain a full understanding on the magnitude of the trade and macroeconomic effects of oil price changes and what the policy responses should be.

We present the range in baseline projections for Latin America, and identify key differences between model projections including how these projections compare to historic trends. We find relatively large differences across models in base year assumptions related to population, GDP, energy and CO2 emissions due to the use of different data sources, but also conclude that this does not influence the range of projections. We find that population and GDP projections across models span a broad range, comparable to the range represented by the set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Kaya-factor decomposition indicates that the set of baseline scenarios mirrors trends experienced over the past decades. Emissions in Latin America are projected to rise as a result of GDP and population growth and a minor shift in the energy mix toward fossil fuels. Most scenarios assume a somewhat higher GDP growth than historically observed and continued decline of population growth. Minor changes in energy intensity or energy mix are projected over the next few decades. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The hypothesis of permanent income as a function of the socio-demographic characteristics and the degree of education of the household head is included in the model. We obtain the elasticity of income, wealth, age of head of household, size of household and number of occupied; as well as the semi-elasticity of the user cost of residential capital. It should be noted that expenditure on housing is inelastic, although it is more sensitive to current income than the permanent income. We show that this market structure is regressive, therefore a sensitivity analysis is performed in order to measure the impact on the housing expenditure related to certain variations of the long-run user cost of owner-occupied.","[Adamuz Pena, Maria de las Mercedes] ITAM, Dept Adm & Contaduria Publ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gonzalez Tejeda, Leonardo] Univ Tecnol Mexico Unitec, Posgrad & Educ Continua, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Peña, MDA (通讯作者)，ITAM, Dept Adm & Contaduria Publ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;Tejeda, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Tecnol Mexico Unitec, Posgrad & Educ Continua, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",adamuz@itam.mx; leonardo_gonzalez@my.unitec.edu.mx,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,9,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

The underlying economy is one in which unemployment can arise but can be mitigated by tax cuts and increases in public production. Such policies are fiscally costly, but can be financed by issuing government debt. Policy decisions are made by a legislature consisting of representatives from different political districts. With the available policies, it is possible for the government to completely eliminate unemployment in the long run. However, with political decision making, the economy always has unemployment. Unemployment is higher when the private sector experiences negative shocks. When these shocks occur, the government employs debt-financed fiscal stimulus plans which involve both tax cuts and public production increases. When the private sector is healthy, the government contracts debt until it reaches a floor level. Unemployment levels are weakly increasing in the economy's debt level, strictly so when the private sector experiences negative shocks. Conditional on the level of workers employed, the mix of public and private output is distorted.","[Battaglini, Marco; Coate, Stephen] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Battaglini, Marco] EIEF, New Delhi, India",Cornell University,"Battaglini, M; Coate, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Battaglini, M (通讯作者)，EIEF, New Delhi, India.",battaglini@cornell.edu; sc163@cornell.edu,,"Battaglini, Marco/0000-0001-9690-0721",,,,,60,10,13,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Englis formed an original teleological economic school upon Kant's noetics. This paper describes Englis's relation to the Austrian school: the polemic approach of Karel Englis to Austrian Economics, followed by Englis's agreement with certain postulates of the Austrian School.

The proposed time-varying ARFIMA-GARCH model is applied to the monthly CPI inflation rates of the seven advanced economies (G7) from 1955 to 2014. The main finding of this study is that neglecting structural changes in the inflation level and volatility appears to overestimate the long run and GARCH persistence.

We analyze MTO's impacts on children's long-term outcomes using tax data. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood when young (before age 13) increases college attendance and earnings and reduces single parenthood rates. Moving as an adolescent has slightly negative impacts, perhaps because of disruption effects. The decline in the gains from moving with the age when children move suggests that the duration of exposure to better environments during childhood is an important determinant of children's long-term outcomes.","[Chetty, Raj] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Landau 323, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hendren, Nathaniel; Katz, Lawrence F.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hendren, Nathaniel; Katz, Lawrence F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Landau 323, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Hendren, N; Katz, LF (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Hendren, N; Katz, LF (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",chetty@stanford.edu; nhendren@fas.harvard.edu; lkatz@harvard.edu,,,"IRS [TIRNO-12-P-00374]; National Science Foundation; NIA [R01 A0031259]; Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard; Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1260964] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","IRS; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard; Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Internal Revenue Service or the US Treasury Department.

In this paper, we study the determinants of the occurrence and timing of colonization of non-European countries by Western European powers. Of particular interest is the role of early development measures that are known to be strong correlates of present-day levels of income. We show that non-European societies with longer histories of agriculture and statehood and higher levels of technology adoption in 1500 were less likely to be colonized, and tended to be colonized later if at all. We also find that proximity to the colonizing powers, disease environment, and latitude are significant predictors of the occurrence and timing of colonization, although their impacts are less robust to choice of country sample. Our models have high explanatory power, and their support for the significance of early development is robust to the use of alternative indicators of early development and disease, to the use of instruments to focus on the exogenous component of early development, and to the joint estimation of the colonization and timing equations to correct for potential selection bias.

Given the spatial heterogeneity of economic development across different regions, the nationwide market will have differing impacts on China's regional economies. The present paper uses a multi-regional CGE model to examine the effects of a nationwide carbon market on regional economies and CO2 reduction efficiency under different emission reduction targets. The results indicate that such a market can effectively reduce costs across the whole society, improving welfare and allocation efficiency of production factors and so reducing regional economic disparities and promoting coordinated regional development. These measures can help China to achieve more ambitious reduction targets with the same abatement costs, and large-scale inter-regional transfer of funds during emissions trading can be invested in CO2 mitigation technologies in economically backward regions, promoting CO2 reduction efficiency and industrial upgrading.

In contrast, tax authorities employ the tools of predictive analytics to identify taxpayers for audit, with a range of variables used for conditioning. The paper explores the compliance and revenue consequences of the use of predictive analytics in an agent-based model that draws upon a behavioral approach to tax compliance. The taxpayers in the model form subjective beliefs about the probability of audit from social interaction, and are guided by a social custom that is developed from meeting other taxpayers. The belief and social custom feed into the occupational choice between employment and two forms of self-employment. It is shown that the use of predictive analytics yields a significant increase in revenue over a random audit strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper shows that such reference dependence can affect savings in opposite directions depending on whether people face liquidity constraints. Existing models for wealth and intertemporal choice predict that reference dependence reduces savings, but these models abstract from liquidity constraints. Introducing a liquidity constraint, I find that reference dependence can increase optimal savings for people without access to credit. Ex post, after reference points have been formed, liquidity constraints force consumers to take part of an income loss in early periods, inducing those who are reference dependent to concentrate the full loss in early periods and save in order to eliminate future losses. Further, anticipating a liquidity constraint raises the expected level of future consumption and thus the expectations-based reference point for future periods, creating an ex-ante savings motive. These findings underscore that it is important to account for financial market imperfections when applying or testing reference-dependent models in low-income settings, and potentially explain heterogeneity in how much the poor save when facing binding liquidity constraints.","[Kramer, Berber] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Kramer, B (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",b.kramer@cgiar.org,,"Kramer, Berber/0000-0001-7644-6613",,,,,35,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This paper improves our understanding of these tradeoffs by conducting an empirical analysis based on a set of nationwide panel data collected in 2008 and 2012 and covering five provinces, 101 villages, and 2020 households. Evidence is found to suggest that it is not always the case that rural households that are affected by pollution reap the off-farm employment benefits associated with industrialization. Specifically, although industrial pollution incidence is found to be positively related with the level of local off-farm employment, this relationship is statistically insignificant when migrant labor is included. It can be explained as areas that less economically benefited from industrialization tent to have more labors migrated out and the average annual wage income of one migrant labor is much higher than that of local off-farm labor.

In an otherwise standard Bewley model, we feature households' business productivity risks and borrowing constraints, which we find generate the Pareto distributions. Households with low productivity rely on wages and returns from safe assets, while high productivity households choose not to diversify their business risks. The model can quantitatively account for the observed income distribution in the U.S. under reasonable calibrations. Furthermore, we conduct several comparative statics to examine how changes in parameters affect the Pareto distributions. In particular, we find that the change in the top tax rates in the 1980s potentially accounts for much of the observed increase in top income dispersion in the last decades. Our analytical result provides a coherent interpretation for the numerical comparative statics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the relationship between wealth and herd size among large-scale hog producers is positive.

Second, although low risk aversion and large disagreement can significantly distort the security market line (SML) and the effect is amplified in a dynamic model, per capita volatility of consumption growth is implausibly high compared to empirical estimates from microeconomic data.

We extend the literature by using a novel approach with the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) model (Shin et al., 2014). The main advantage of this model relies on its ability to simultaneously capture the short- and long-run asymmetries through positive and negative partial sum decompositions of changes in the independent variable(s). Moreover, we rely on local gold prices instead of those from London converted into local currencies like in most of previous studies. The results show that gold is not a hedge against inflation in the long run in all cases. In the short run, gold is an inflation hedge only in the UK, USA, and India. Furthermore, there is no long-run equilibrium between gold prices and the CPI in China, India and France. This difference may be due to traditional aspects of gold and custom controls for gold trade in these countries. Our robustness check suggests that the data time-frequency does not change the specification of the NARDL model but can change conclusions regarding the role of gold as a hedge against inflation in certain countries.

We found that in determining which journals to submit a manuscript to, authors care about submission fee, journal quality as measured by rank and impact factor, and journal usages by authors (citations) and subscribers (library subscriptions). The finding on network effect running from libraries to authors may help justify the practice of open-access journals, where subscription is free, but authors pay a hefty fee after manuscript acceptance. Our findings indicate that a $100 increase in submission fee can reduce the number of yearly submissions by up to 36 (or an elasticity of -0.11).

While a body of research documents that time spent working is associated with increased body mass index (BMI), this paper explores possible mechanisms for that relationship using time use data. This paper finds that, for workers in non-strenuous jobs, 10 additional hours spent working are associated with an increase in BMI of 0.424 for women and 0.197 for men, representing an increase of 2.5 and 1.4 pounds, respectively. The paper does not find a relationship between working time and BMI for workers in strenuous jobs. For workers in non-strenuous jobs, the effect of time spent working on BMI becomes smaller after accounting for time spent sleeping for both men and women and time spent in exercise and food preparation for women only; the effect becomes larger after accounting for screen time for both men and women and time spent in secondary eating and commuting for women only. Screen time is the single time use channel associated with the largest differences in the estimated effect of time spent working on BMI for both women and men employed in non-strenuous jobs. After controlling for all time use channels, the effect of hours worked on BMI decreases for women, but increases for men. These findings suggest plausible mechanisms for the association between time spent working and obesity.","[Abramowitz, Joelle] US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Abramowitz, J (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",joelle.h.abramowitz@census.gov,,,,,,,43,11,12,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

For this purpose, we analyze two liquidity measures and one information asymmetry measure. The analysis allows us to study as well the effect of a change in insider trading regulation, namely the implementation of the Market Abuse Directive (European Union Directive 2003/6/EC) on the Dutch stock market. The first set of results shows that, in accordance with theories of asymmetric information, the intensity of legal insider trading in a given company is positively related to the bid-ask spread and to the information asymmetry measure. We also find that the Market Abuse Directive did not reduce significantly this effect. Secondly, analyzing liquidity and information asymmetry around the days of legal insider trading, we find that small and large capitalization stocks see their bid-ask spread and the permanent price impact increase when insiders trade. For mid-cap stocks, only the permanent price impact increases. Finally, we could not detect a significant improvement of these results following the change in regulation.","[Degryse, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [de Jong, Frank] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Lefebvre, Jeremie] IESEG Sch Management, LEM CNRS, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France",KU Leuven; Tilburg University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management,"de Jong, F (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",f.dejong@uvt.nl; j.lefebvre@ieseg.fr,,"Degryse, Hans/0000-0002-0130-057X",,,,,32,0,0,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2016,164.0,1,,,,,83,104,,10.1007/s10645-015-9261-0,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF6BD,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371439100005,0

Addressing endogeneity concerns, we find that case disposition in Bulgarian courts is largely driven by the demand for court services. The number of serving judges, a key court resource, matters to a limited extent only in a subsample of courts, a result suggesting that judges adjust their productivity based on the number of judges serving at a court.

Much of government spending is well anticipated over a one year horizon. Once news and surprise shocks are treated as different shocks, there is no depreciation puzzle for news shocks while it is still there for surprise shocks. Fiscal foresight seems to lie at the heart of the different exchange rate responses to news and surprise shocks, depending on the timing of the anticipated budget adjustment following the shock.

The mixture model decomposes the marginal distribution of durables ownership across all households, into three conditional distributions (one each for lower, middle and upper classes), along with their weights in the population distribution, endogenously determining class membership. This approach provides a potentially deeper understanding of the dynamics of classes, in particular the lower class, than can be obtained using poverty lines or PCA alone. It avoids many well-known problems with expenditure data, ameliorates the impact of changing survey designs, and enables an analysis of the behavior and membership of classes over time. I use the mixture approach to show that the urban lower class in India became smaller but poorer during the 1990s. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When we study micro-level data of individual forecasts, we find mixed evidence of an asymmetric loss function, suggesting that inflation forecasters are heterogeneous with respect to the shape of their loss functions. We also find strong evidence that inflation forecasts are in line with forecast rationality. When we pool the data and study sectoral inflation forecasts of financial analysts, trade unions and the business sector, we find evidence for asymmetry in the loss function and against forecast rationality. Upon comparing the micro-level results with those for pooled and sectoral data, we conclude that forecast rationality should be assessed based on micro-level data, and that freer access to this data would allow a more rigorous analysis and discussion of the information content of the surveys.

Calomiris and Stephen H. Haber introduces a framework for understanding financial crises and credit abundance with politics at its center. Using the historical experiences of five nations to illustrate, the authors propose that democracies such as the United States and Canada can have stable banks and ample credit so long as populist forces do not dominate the policy agenda, and that strong autocratic states such as Mexico can also achieve stability at the cost of restricting credit. Weak autocracies, such as Brazil over much of its history, often require inflationary finance and suffer from the banking fragility that comes with it. The authors identify populist ideologies and related policy decisions (such as unit banking, deposit insurance, and the Community Reinvestment Act) as underlying causes of banking instability in the United States as typified by the recent subprime crisis. Canada, in contrast, by holding populist forces in check through calculated political choices, remains crisis-free.","[Rousseau, Peter L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Rousseau, PL (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

The model distinguishes between objective norm compliers, for whom the right action is a function of the state of the world, and subjective norm compliers, for whom it is a function of their belief. The former seek as much information as possible; the latter acquire only information that lowers, in expected terms, normative demands. The source of 'moral wiggle room' is not belief manipulation, but the coarseness of normative prescriptions under conditions of uncertainty. In a novel experimental setup, we find evidence for such strategic information uptake. Our results suggest that attempts to change behavior by subjecting individuals to norms can lead to biased information acquisition instead of compliance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Second, the fit markedly improves, when correcting for variation in output growth and the opportunity cost of money, using elasticities implied by the theories of Baumol-Tobin and Miller-Orr.

Third, using Dubin and McFadden's discrete-continuous model, the present value of US consumer surplus from the introduction of residential air conditioning is estimated to be $85-$185 billion (2012 dollars).","[Barreca, Alan] Tulane Univ, Inst Study Labor IZA, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Barreca, Alan; Clay, Karen; Deschenes, Olivier; Greenstone, Michael; Shapiro, Joseph S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Clay, Karen] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Deschenes, Olivier] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Study Labor IZA, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Greenstone, Michael] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Shapiro, Joseph S.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Tulane University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carnegie Mellon University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Chicago; Yale University,"Barreca, A (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Inst Study Labor IZA, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.;Barreca, A (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Clay, Karen/0000-0003-3978-6656; Barreca, Alan/0000-0002-3521-0011",,,,,63,322,346,19,174,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

While most of the literature studies assimilation through a human capital framework, we examine the role of job search assimilation. To do so, we estimate an equilibrium search model of immigrants operating in the same labour market as natives, where newly arrived immigrants have lower job offer arrival rates than natives but can acquire the same arrival rates according to a stochastic process. Using Canadian panel data, we find substantial differences in job offer arrival and destruction rates between natives and immigrants that are able to account for three quarters of the observed earnings gap. The estimates imply that immigrants take on average 13 years to acquire the native search parameters. Due to immigrants facing much lower on-the-job offer arrival rates than natives, the model predicts that earnings growth through job search is minimal for immigrants prior to their job search assimilation.","[Bowlus, Audra J.; Robinson, Chris] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Miyairi, Masashi] Univ Ottawa, Educ Policy Res Initiat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Ottawa,"Robinson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",robinson@uwo.ca,,"Bowlus, Audra/0000-0002-7671-2210",Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; CIBC Centre for Human Capital and Productivity,Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); CIBC Centre for Human Capital and Productivity,"The authors thank Yahong Zhang, participants at the 2014 Guelph Workshop on Human Capital and Productivity, the 46th Annual Meetings of the CEA and the 2011 UM/MSU/UWO Labour Day conference and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Using data for fourteen European countries, this study investigates the issue of nonstationarity in inflation by considering the possibility of nonlinearity. In particular, we consider the properties of a threshold, smooth transition and structural break in testing for a unit root in the inflation rates. By and large, the results support the view that the inflation rates of the European countries are characterized by a unit root process based on the conventional linear unit root tests. However, the results of the nonlinear unit root tests show that the inflation rates are characterized by nonlinear mean reversion after considering the nonlinear properties of the threshold, smooth transition and structural break. The mean reversion in inflation favors the hypothesis of, for example, the natural rate of inflation and the sticky-price model and implies that shocks only have transitory effects.

However, if consumers are playing an endogenously repeated game, a class of simple efficient equilibria exhibits the asymmetry of fast loss and slow recovery of customers after a bad signal.

We propose a new approach based on the cross-correlation estimates to understand how economic growth and CO2 emissions are related. Our proposal is that if there is a positive cross-correlation between the current level of income and the past level of CO2 emissions and a negative cross-correlation between the current level of income and the future CO2 emissions, then CO2 emissions will decline with an increase in income over time, consistent with the environmental Kuznets curve.(EKC) hypothesis. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, for 21 out of 181 countries (12%), there is clear evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis. Second, we ask whether a rise in income reduces emissions in the future. We find that for 49 countries (27%), income growth will reduce emissions in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We study the relevance of the regional disaggregation by using the proposed models to forecast the corresponding headline inflation and testing whether it is more accurate than alternative forecasts based on aggregated models. The results for Spain show that this is the case. Country disaggregation forecasts are also reliable for the EA12, but only because derived headline inflation forecasting is not significantly worse than alternative forecasts.

However, China now faces a number of environmental degradation problems, in part, caused by her past agricultural reforms. In this paper we estimate, using a provincial-based panel dataset, a third-order translog cost function for China's grain production sector over the period 1990-2011. Results from the estimation, including estimated elasticities of demand for and substitution of factors, suggest that labor and capital are substitutes. This arises because the increasing cost of labor, induced by urbanization and the growth of the manufacturing sector, has lead to a substitution of machinery for labor in the production of wheat. The results are consistent with current government policies to encourage via subsidies and agricultural mechanization, which we show to be technically, a substitute for labor. We further conclude this will create an additional bonus of reducing the amount of fertilizer that is needed to efficiently and securely produce wheat in China, as the new capital is more efficient at fertilizer distribution.

The first view expects rebellion to be most likely in areas home to the geographic concentration of ethnolinguistic minorities. The second expects more rebel activity where the opportunity costs of insurrection are low. Evidence from the armed conflict in Ukraine supports the second view more than the first. A municipality's prewar employment mix is a more robust predictor of rebel activity than local ethnolinguistic composition. Municipalities more exposed to trade shocks with Russia experienced a higher intensity of rebel violence throughout the conflict. Such localities also fell under rebel control earlier-and took longer for the government to liberate-than municipalities where the labor force was less dependent on exports to Russia.

It is argued that the difference stems from the mainstream habit of thinking in terms of a full-information benchmark, where uncertainty arises from incomplete information. Degrees of uncertainty (or ambiguity) refer to the quantifiable extent of incompleteness. In contrast, Keynesian uncertainty cannot, even in principle, be eliminated. By treating uncertain knowledge as the norm, Keynesian uncertainty theory analyses differing degrees of uncertainty in relation to grounds for belief and thus considers the cognitive role of institutions and conventions in influencing the degree of uncertainty. The paper offers a simple diagrammatic representation of these differences, and illustrates its use with different depictions of the crisis, its aftermath and the policy response appropriate to each understanding.","[Dow, Sheila] Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Dow, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",s.c.dow@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,9,11,0,4,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JAN 28,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,20163.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-3,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DD8TN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370199900001,0

This article reassesses the relationship, but analyses regional differences. I find that the positive relationship is strong in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North African countries and Latin America. The relationship is not significant in Western Europe and Asia. In North America/Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa, the marginal effect even becomes negative.

Our results show that one of the newly added variables namely government shutdown provides statistically significant out-of-sample predictive power over the equity risk premium relative to the historical average.

Furthermore, the results of voting in the individual conditions of WBO in terms of the number of voters and the structure of the selected projects. The analysis also covered the information concerning WBO and the Smart City Wroclaw project included on internet websites of the city and within the strategies and programming documents. Key changes observed in the principles of forming WBO concerned the scale of the financed projects, increases of the scope of preparatory works, increase of the role of project leaders, strive for more even distribution of the realized projects within the area of the city, increase of citizen participation in the creation of projects through implementing alternative planning methods (i.e.. Citizen Labs). The conducted analysis revealed that WBO is not just an element of actions in the scope of social participation. It is also a uniquely important area of actions contributing to the formation of Smart City 3.0. Its form is subject to constant improvement thanks to efficient communication of the authorities and the inhabitants by means of a number of information channels (including innovative ones) and the analysis of the obtained through this information. These are essential both at the stage of picking up the ideas and their subsequent selection as well as realization assessment. The budget evolution is directed also at increasing activeness of the inhabitants within the regions which were so far characterized by their relative passivity.

That part of the discussion concludes by asking briefly what can and should be done about globalization. The second half of the paper turns to the WTO.

In this article, we assess the forecasting ability of several classes of time-series models for electricity wholesale spot prices at a day-ahead horizon in France. Electricity spot prices display a strong seasonal pattern, particularly in France, given the high share of electric heating in housing during winter time. To deal with this pattern, we implement a double temporal segmentation of the data. For each trading period and season, we use a large number of specifications based on market fundamentals: linear regressions, Markov-switching (MS) models and threshold models with a smooth transition. An extensive evaluation on French data shows that modelling each season independently leads to better results. Among nonlinear models, MS models designed to capture the sudden and fast-reverting spikes in the price dynamics yield more accurate forecasts. Finally, pooling forecasts give more reliable results.","[Bessec, Marie; Meritet, Sophie] Univ Paris 09, LEDa CGEMP, Paris, France; [Fouquau, Julien] ESCP Europe, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Bessec, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, LEDa CGEMP, Paris, France.",marie.bessec@dauphine.fr,,,,,,,32,9,9,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Consistent with the recent literature on recursive learning and expectations, we replace the agents in the economy with econometricians. Unlike the recursive learning literature, however, the econometricians in the analysis here are Bayesian learners. We are interested in the extent to which expectational stability remains the key concept in the Bayesian environment. We isolate conditions under which versions of expectational stability conditions govern the stability of these systems just as in the standard case of recursive learning. We conclude that Bayesian learning schemes, while they are more sophisticated, do not alter the essential expectational stability findings in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To know the future intentions of customers of any service is a key objective to develop service improvement and retention strategies. This need has also become apparent to professional sports clubs. In this study, the relationship between perceived quality (tangibles, staff, complementary services and outcome quality), perceived value, emotions, satisfaction and future intentions of spectators are analyzed for a sporting event. Consequently, the main objectives proposed in this study were to test a model of causal relationships whereby the perceived value is a function of perceived quality, satisfaction is a consequence of quality, perceived value and emotions, and future intentions are a function of satisfaction and perceived value, and to know the importance of perceived value in predicting future intentions of the spectator. The research was conducted on a basketball club of the Spanish premier league, where 563 spectators were surveyed with a self-administered questionnaire. The original scale used for the analysis of perceived quality consisted of 9 items with an alternative seven-point response and was called Eventqual-R, that is the short version of Eventqual which is used in the regular leagues of professional basketball. Results indicate that perceived value is the best predictor of the satisfaction and future intentions of spectators, while quality and emotions have limited relevance as predictors of spectator satisfaction.","[Calabuig-Moreno, Ferran; Crespo-Hervas, Josep; Nunez-Pomar, Juan] Univ Valencia, FCAFE, Gasco Oliag 3, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Valantine, Irena; Staskeviciute-Butiene, Inga] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Valencia; Lithuanian Sports University,"Calabuig-Moreno, F (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, FCAFE, Gasco Oliag 3, Valencia 46010, Spain.",ferran.calabuig@uv.es; josep.crespo@uv.es; juan.m.nunez@uv.es; irena.valantine@lsu.lt; inga.staskeviciute@lsu.lt,"Butiene, Inga Staskeviciute/AAD-9184-2020; Valantine, Irena/AAD-3844-2020; N, Juan/GRX-8056-2022; Valantine, Irena/AAV-4873-2020; Calabuig, Ferran/A-9738-2009; Nunez-Pomar, Juan Manuel/AAG-6454-2019; Crespo Hervas, Josep/I-5526-2016","N, Juan/0000-0002-9476-9392; Calabuig, Ferran/0000-0002-4538-2976; Crespo Hervas, Josep/0000-0002-8509-0353",,,,,67,21,23,2,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this statement, Keynes outlines the functions of financial systems in Entrepreneurial Economies, the type of economies he hypothesizes we live in. In entrepreneurial economies, investing firms have to be able to get hold of the necessary amount of means of payment required to purchase or order investment goods and to build balance sheets where in- and outflows of cash are broadly matched within reasonable margins of safety. This means that financial systems' primary role in Keynesian economics is not to allocate savings or capital but to allocate liquidity and to allow investors to build liquid balance sheets. The article develops this proposition, presenting Keynes's basic concepts on the matter and showing how modern financial systems perform their role.","[Cardim de Carvalho, Fernando J.] Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Cardim de Carvalho, Fernando J.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"de Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA.;de Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,National Research Council (CNPq),National Research Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Fernando J.

Traditional forms of generation are typically located close to the load or population centers, while wind- and solar-powered generation must be located where the energy source is found. In the case of wind, this has meant significant new investment in wind plant in primarily rural areas that have been in secular economic decline. This article investigates the localized economic impacts of the rapid increase in wind power capacity at the county level in Texas. Unlike input-output impact analysis that relies primarily on levels of inputs to estimate gross impacts, we use traditional econometric methods to estimate net localized impacts in terms of employment, personal income, property tax base, and key public school expenditure levels. While we find evidence that both direct and indirect employment impacts are modest, significant increases in per capita income accompany wind power development. County and school property tax rolls also realize important benefits from the local siting of utility scale wind power, although peculiarities in Texas school funding shift localized property tax benefits to the state.","[De Silva, Dakshina G.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [McComb, Robert P.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, MS 41014, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Schiller, Anita R.] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",Lancaster University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Dundee,"De Silva, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.;McComb, RP (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Econ, MS 41014, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.;Schiller, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",d.desilva@lancaster.ac.uk; robert.mccomb@ttu.edu; a.schiller@dundee.ac.uk,,"Schiller, Anita Ryu/0000-0002-7771-2589; De Silva, Dakshina/0000-0001-8820-1955",,,,,26,17,22,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Agent_Zero's observable behavior results from the interaction of these internal modules. When multiple Agent_Zeros interact with one another, a wide range of important, even disturbing, collective dynamics emerge. These dynamics are not straightforwardly generated using the canonical rational actor which has dominated mathematical social science since the 1940s. Following a concise exposition of the Agent_Zero model, this chapter offers a range of fertile research directions, including the use of realistic geographies and population levels, the exploration of new internal modules and new interactions among them, the development of formal axioms for modular agents, empirical testing, the replication of historical episodes, and practical applications.

Are the availability and use of such information beneficial or detrimental to consumer surplus? We develop a model in which a monopoly sells a network good and price discriminates based on information about consumers' influence and consumers' susceptibility to influence. The monopoly optimally offers consumers price discounts for their influence and charges price premia for their susceptibility; the price premia and the price discounts are simple functions of the pattern of network effects. We determine under which conditions, relative to uniform price, consumer surplus increases, and we characterize the value of information on network effects for the monopoly.","[Fainmesser, Itay P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Fainmesser, Itay P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Galeotti, Andrea] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; University of Essex,,,,,Economics Department at Stanford University; European Research Council [283454]; Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council (ERC) [283454] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Economics Department at Stanford University; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"A previous version of the article was circulated under the title The Value of Network Information.

One of the company's financial goals is to provide optimal financial structure that has the purpose of maximizing business performance. The aim of this paper is to determine the degree of correlation between financial structure (measured by indicators of indebtedness and interest coverage) and profitability (measured by profit rates and rates of return on equity). This paper seeks to answer the question of cause and effect in the context of financial structure and profitability of the company: whether a certain financial structure (higher or lower indebtedness) causes more or less profitability, or there is a reverse effect. Empirical research is conducted in the case of joint stock companies in Montenegro, which according to the Law on Accounting and Auditing of Montenegro have the obligation to draw up quarterly financial statements. It should also be noted that the legal form of companies is one of the factors of the financial structure, and consequently, this research can be the basis for further analysis in the case of other legal forms of enterprise.","[Filipovic, Ana Lalevic; Demirovic, Selma] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ Podgor, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro",University of Montenegro,"Filipovic, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ Podgor, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro.",savana@t-com.me; selma987@t-com.me,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,408,416,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100044,0

In a stylized OLG model, agents need to forecast the future price level, they observe the current price and perceive with idiosyncratic noise the expectation announced by a more informed authority. When forward guidance communication is loose, the market becomes a main source of information about the future. Reliance on market information amplifies the impact of shocks on prices, which increases ex ante uncertainty and worsens agents' forecasting ability, harming social welfare. However, an appropriate policy can convert the perils of the announcement in opportunities. Capacity-limited agents will act as if observing the state of the economy with error even if some public authority announces it exactly. The amount of the error will depend both on the stochastic properties of the state itself and of any noise in public signals about it.. issuing a much more detailed inflation report. the Fed would no longer be itself responsible for generating unnecessary market fluctuations. -Sims (2005)","[Gaballo, Gaetano] Banque France, Monetary Policy Res Div DGEI DEMFI POMONE, F-75049 Paris 01, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Gaballo, G (通讯作者)，Banque France, Monetary Policy Res Div DGEI DEMFI POMONE, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs 41-1391, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",gaetano.gaballo@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,46,27,30,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

Using four iterations (2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011) of the Business Operations Survey, this research seeks to shed some new light on this conundrum by using a multivariate probit regression (mvprobit) approach applied to pooled samples in excess of 22,000 unit record observations of NZ firms. The results suggest that factors including firm size, high perceived quality, investment/research and development (R&D) capability, major technology change, application of formal IP protection and new export markets are systematically and positively related to innovation; while many external issues, such as those related to geography, market structure, business environment, have little influence. At the firm level, innovations in NZ are highly dependent on the firms' internal ability to develop new technologies and market demand. The (very small) size of firms does matter in NZ, which lacks a major home market' or a major trade block on its doorstep, such that ultimately, government may need to be involved to maintain a viable scale for domestic R&D.","[Hong, Shangqin] Greater Christchurch Grp, Dept Prime Minister & Cabinet, Wellington, New Zealand; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Urban & Reg Studies Inst, Groningen, Netherlands; [Trinh Le] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res Trust, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Waikato; University of Groningen,"Oxley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",loxley@waikato.ac.nz,"McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023","Le, Trinh Van Thi/0000-0002-7541-158X; Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323","Marsden Fund, New Zealand","Marsden Fund, New Zealand(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ))","This work was supported by the Marsden Fund, New Zealand.",,61,22,23,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

If companies want to be competitive in an international market environment, they need to develop more and more effort. The development of science and technology allows companies to use modern technology. Their products become more competitive and these technologies allows at the same time to minimize costs. Thus, we can conclude that companies around the world have the possibilities to optimize their core processes. But if companies want to be successfully in international environment, they cannot focus their activities only to core processes, but also to support activities and processes. These activities and processes are named as facility management. In the past, the term facility management associated only with the management of buildings. However, this definition was inadequate. Facility management is characterized as management area whose aim is streamline support processes in companies and reduce their costs by appropriate settings of these support processes. It is a method of mutual harmonizing of employees, work activities and working environment, which incorporates the principles of business administration, architecture, humanities and sciences. This article deals with the definition of basic concepts, objectives and activities that fall under the area of facility management. Article focuses on possibilities of implementing the facility management (internal and external). It highlights the advantages and disadvantages of both procedures. It describes the importance of supporting business processes, because these activities often determine business success and competitiveness in globalizing market environment.","[Janoskova, Katarina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Janoskova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.janoskova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Janoskova, Katarina/P-3277-2015",,project VEGA [1/0870/16],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0870/16 Bartosova, V. et al.: Application of facility management in managing the transport companies in the Slovak Republic.",,20,5,5,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,759,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800094,0

I investigate if real wage rigidity is sufficient to solve this in an open economy. Starting from a closed economy benchmark in which wage rigidity makes labour market variables sufficiently volatile, I find that the puzzle reopens in the open economy, despite a rigid real wage. This is because terms of trade movements move the wedge between the consumer and producer real wage in such a way that labour market variables respond less to productivity shocks.

Even though residential properties are a basic necessity, there is no previous study that attempts to estimate the long-run and short-run relationship between loans and price level in residential properties in Malaysia. It is believed that property price level moves in the same direction as loan supply. The estimations are divided into two parts: the detection of long run relationships and the estimation the long-run and short-run elasticities from an ARDL model. The results support the hypothesis that the loan supply has a positive impact on the residential price levels; the robustness test also supports this conclusion.

Additionally, the authors decompose Taiwan and Korea's gross exports into various meaningful components. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the inter-country input-output (ICIO) table which endows with cost structures of industries as well as trade information, facilitating in keeping track of the flow of products and value-added. The ICIO table used in this paper comes from the World Input-Output Database. The authors also use the way Wang et al. (2013) decomposed the intermediate goods exports into various components to provide further insights. Findings - The empirical results indicate that Taiwan and Korea's ICT export to the world shrink by 47.8 and 40.9 percent when the trades are measured in value-added terms. Taiwan and Korea's ICT export will also decrease by 75.1 and 57.8 percent. From the viewpoint of value added in trade, the share of value added embodied in Taiwan and Korea's gross ICT exports continued to decrease and reached 24.9 and 42.2 percent in 2011, while the components of pure double counted terms kept growing in recent years. Originality/value - With global value chains flourishing in recent years, conventional trade statistics not only fails to highlight the vertical specialization among different countries, but also distorts the measurement of a country's competitiveness.

Firstly, the definitions, operational rules and characteristics of intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and POWA operator have been introduced. Then, intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy prioritised ordered weighted aggregation (ITFPOWA) operator has been defined as well as the computational method of associated weight, and some properties have been studied and proved.

The results allow for the identification of inputs or outputs that are the drivers of the overall productivity change. Their contributions are then decomposed into efficiency change and technical change components. Using input-output tables of the US economy for the period 1977-2006, we show that technical progress has been the main source of productivity change.

It demonstrates that strategic delegation has differential impacts on adoption dates under Cournot and Bertrand competitions. Strategic delegation with 'own-performance'based incentive schemes always leads to early adoption in markets with Bertrand competition compared to that under no-delegation, but not necessarily so in markets with Cournot competition. It also shows that under strategic delegation with 'own-performance'-based incentive schemes, adoption occurs earlier (later) in markets with Cournot competition than in markets with Bertrand competition, if the degree of product differentiation is high (low). In contrast, under strategic delegation with 'relative-performance'-based incentive schemes, adoption dates do not differ across markets with different modes of competition. It also analyses implications of firms' choice over types of managerial incentive schemes on the speed of diffusion of new technology.","[Mahathi, A.; Pal, Rupayan] IGIDR, Film City Rd, Mumbai 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Ramani, Vinay] BIndian Inst Management Udaipur IIM U, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Udaipur (IIMU),"Pal, R (通讯作者)，IGIDR, Film City Rd, Mumbai 400065, Maharashtra, India.",rupayan@igidr.ac.in,"Pal, Rupayan/AAF-4646-2020; Pal, Rupayan/AAU-4717-2021; Pal, Rupayan/AAN-7062-2021","Pal, Rupayan/0000-0002-9475-2179;",,,,,33,4,4,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

The economy is modelled by use of the, so-called, fK endogenous growth model based on microfoundations describing the labour institutions. Despite a rather small formal difference, the model differs much in its properties from traditional growth models. The fK model generalises the well-known AK model but is free of the known shortcomings of the latter. Our analytical results as well as computer simulations show that, despite the presence of temporary acceleration opportunities, the unstable windfalls prohibit long-run sustainable growth. The windfall can be followed by a restructuring leading to a long-run economic decline after ceasing the capital inflow. The effect of the capital inflow depends on the relation between the expected inflow growth rate and the economic growth rate of the benchmark model (without inflow), as well as on the time preferences in the economy. If the capital inflow is expected to grow faster than the proper growth rate of the economy, this can lead to a decline in wages.","[Matveenko, Vladimir] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Matveenko, V (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",vmatveenko@hse.ru,"Matveenko, Vladimir D./F-3219-2016",,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research [14-01-00448, 14-06-00253]",Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research [grant number 14-01-00448], [grant number 14-06-00253].",,31,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This phenomenon is becoming more significant in both developed and emerging countries and influences the effectiveness of national economy. We survey 45 chief financial officers (CFOs) from not public and not financial companies operating in the Czech Republic and Poland to document the internal determinants of going public. We use statistical analyses and comparison with recent academic literature and empirical evidence to interpret the survey-gained data. First, the most important IPO motivations are enhanced publicity and reputation of the company and establishment of the firm's market value. These benefits are expressed by CFOs across all firms and in both countries. A considerably larger number of CFOs is motivated by raising external equity capital. Surveyed companies tend to conduct an IPO in the expansion stage of their life cycle. Next, the significance of other going public determinants differs between Czech and Polish respondents and across companies varying in size and age. Third, our findings indicate that theories on IPO formulated for well-developed capital markets can explain going public determinants in smaller emerging markets. We suggest that our evidence can be a source of knowledge for enterprises while formulating new financial strategies. Furthermore, we also expect that survey results will be beneficial for investment bankers, stock exchanges and macroeconomic policy makers while discussing and designing incentives to attract more enterprises onto the primary capital markets under the specific conditions of the Czech Republic and Poland.","[Meluzin, Tomas; Zinecker, Marek] Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, CZ-61200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Lace, Natalja] Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema St 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Brno University of Technology; Riga Technical University,"Meluzin, T (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, CZ-61200 Brno, Czech Republic.",meluzint@fbm.vutbr.cz; zinecker@fbm.vutbr.cz; Natalja.Lace@rtu.lv,"Zinecker, Marek/AAL-5760-2021","Meluzin, Tomas/0000-0001-5238-5166",Analysis of Relations among Capital Markets of European Union Countries [2016/1],Analysis of Relations among Capital Markets of European Union Countries,The research is covered by Institute of Economic Research Torun.

Although concerned by some of its problems for many years, it was only after more concentrated reflection on both its parts and their combinations that I became aware of its manifold deficiencies, some of which I outlined in my previous critique (O'Donnell, 2014). In this paper, facilitated by Davidson's (2015b) rejoinder, these criticisms are deepened, broadened, and strengthened. Because the debate deals with fundamental matters in several disciplines, a considerable amount of investigation, unpacking, and logical dissection is required to clarify the argumentation beneath the compressed and seemingly smooth surface of the ENE position. For this reason, my reply is divided into two parts. This contribution primarily examines the central role of framing in ENE arguments, and clarifies the various misunderstandings and misrepresentations to which it leads. The subsequent contribution provides more detailed discussion of mathematical, stochastic, and methodological issues.","[O'Donnell, Rod] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Econ, Econ, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"O'Donnell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Econ, Econ, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",,,,,,,,29,3,3,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This paper revisits and expands the scope of the border effects analysis by estimating the border effect in trade with US states as well as countries in the European Union (EU) and the G-20 using more recent data from 2001-10. Furthermore, we perform the Blinder-Oaxaca nonlinear decomposition to decompose the border effects into various components, including the transaction costs, the tariff and non-tariff measures, and the unexplained component. Results from the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood model show that, compared to existing estimates from the 1980s and 1990s, the size of the border effect in trade between Canadian provinces and US states has declined. The border effects for Canada-EU and Canada-G-20 bilateral trade flows sit at somewhat elevated levels. About a third of the border effects in overall trade with EU and G-20 countries can be attributed to the variables related to transaction costs in foreign trade. While the significance of tariffs has declined, the prevalence of non-tariff measures seems to be on a rise. That said, we find that the welfare-changing measures combined - tariff and non-tariff measures - play a limited role in explaining the border effects in comparison with the role of transaction costs and the unexplained component.","[Suvankulov, Farrukh] Bank Canada, Calgary, AB, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Suvankulov, F (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Calgary, AB, Canada.",fsuvankulov@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,77,3,4,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Based on market capitalization, the top 100 companies included in BSE 200 of Bombay Stock Exchange, India, have been included in the study. Data required have been obtained from the annual reports of the companies for the period from 2007-08 to 2011-12. Content analysis reveals that companies report extensively on 'community involvement'. The determinants of corporate social reporting have been identified through multiple regression analysis. The variables that have been tested are size, age, nationality, industry type, ownership, liquidity, leverage, profit, dividend, reserves, and gross fixed assets.

A basic prerequisite for understanding the role of internal audit in corporate governance is analyzing the association between the internal audit, internal control and corporate governance. Namely, in order to ensure the successful business operation, and to protect the interests of the capital owners, management is interested in establishing an adequate system of internal control to support the achievement of its objectives. Information about extent of management's control in the company therefore is undoubtedly of great importance. Internal audit activities that include participation in the risk management processes and assessment of internal control effectiveness directly affect the quality of corporate governance, through its connection with other governance participants. By providing objective assurance on the effectiveness of the risk management, internal control and corporate governance and consulting services to improve in key areas, internal audit completes the quality of governance process which improves possibilities for achieving company's objectives and helps to reduce the risk exposure. In addition, internal audit provides information that directly contributes to the quality of decision-making process both for internal and external users, thus optimizing the use of limited organizational resources. Development of the internal audit activity is a result of response to changes in business that are taking place globally. In recent years, companies are faced with major changes related to the development of business, technology, and regulatory requirements, especially after major corporate scandals and the crisis that followed. That enabled internal audit opportunity to extend the scope of work according to the needs and new demands, acting as a support to management but also to other governance bodies, such as the Audit Committee. This paper is aimed to analyze the importance of internal audit in corporate governance, its modern role and also tendencies of future development.","[Tusek, Boris; Novak, Ana; Barisic, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Tusek, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",btusek@efzg.hr; anovak@efzg.hr; ibarisic@efzg.hr,"Barišić, Ivana/H-9909-2018; Barišić, Ivana/Y-3493-2019; Novak, Ana/H-8588-2018; Tusek, Boris/H-9445-2018","Barišić, Ivana/0000-0003-2635-1063; Novak, Ana/0000-0002-5264-6482; Tusek, Boris/0000-0002-0942-4761",,,,,23,0,0,0,14,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,338,346,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600033,0

The paper gives an analysis of the rating leading world countries on an index of globalization, which shows that the Russian economy is only entering globalization processes. Methodological basis of the study is methods of system analysis, comparisons and analogies, logical-semantic modeling. The authors assess consequences of the sanctions considering a comparative analysis of the world's leading countries in export and import of goods. The main directions of the Western impact on the Russian economy are systematized, as well as consequences of the import substitution for the European countries are assessed. It is shown that the economic constraints arising under the sanctions against Russia, may serve as a serious impetus for the development of domestic companies and changing foreign goods for Russian. The obtained results find out tools of the economic policy that are more practical. They are focused on the development of the Internal Market and import substitution in the period of introducing sanctions. Thus, it is possible to say that in the context of the world economy globalization, any sanction restrictions are destructive in nature with a strong boomerang effect, as they are reflected in countries which initiate sanctions.","[Vertakova, Yulia; Polozhentseva, Yulia; Klevtsova, Maria] 94,50 Let Oktyabrya St, Kursk 305040, Russia",,"Vertakova, Y (通讯作者)，94,50 Let Oktyabrya St, Kursk 305040, Russia.",vertakova7@yandex.ru; polojenceva84@mail.ru; klevtsovam@mail.ru,"Vertakova, Yulia/N-9934-2015; Polozhentseva, Yulia/O-2864-2015; Klevtsova, Maria/O-2804-2015","Vertakova, Yulia/0000-0002-1685-2625;",Russian President's grant [9726.2016.6],Russian President's grant,This paper is an output of the science project of the Russian President's grant on the state support of the leading schools of sciences Scientific School-9726.2016.6 Implementation of the state economic policy by means of development of instruments of strategic and indicative planning,,16,4,4,0,15,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2354,2361,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800292,0

The GARCH (1, 1) model was used to find the outcomes and the effects. In the two sectors out of 24 sectors, the GARCH and ARCH effects were significant, namely, in the Jute and Banks & Investment Companies. We studied the mean reverting process in the KSE sectors over a specific time period. Since, the mean reversion varies over different time periods. Therefore, it would be a good area for future research to study the reasons, why the market reacts differently over different time periods and to determine the reasons for such variations.

The analysis results show that the convergence process prevails at lower levels of wage differentiation, but the convergence linkages are substituted by the divergence linkages with increasing level of wage differentiation, while intensity of substitution is increasing.

The results show that the ocean economic efficiency of most coastal regions is at medium or high levels, and the longitudinal changes in spatial distribution of 11 coastal regions remain relatively stable. Furthermore, the efficiency of coastal regions has positive spatial correlation and spatial agglomeration, where a spatial spillover effect exists between adjacent regions due to geographical distance.

In this paper, we model corporate saving as a demand for liquid assets by credit-constrained firms in a dynamic open-economy macroeconomic model. We find that the implications of this model are very different from standard models, because the demand for foreign bonds is a complement to domestic investment rather than a substitute. We show that this complementarity is at work when an emerging economy is on its convergence path or when it has a higher TFP growth rate.

A co-summability approach using a century of data,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environmental Kuznets Curve; CO2 emissions; Output; Co-summability; South Africa,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; NEXUS,"There exists a huge international literature on the, so-called, Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, which in turn, postulates an inverted u-shaped relationship between environmental pollutants and output. The empirical literature on EKC has mainly used test for cointegration, based on polynomial relationships between pollution and income. Motivated by the fact that, measured in per capita CO2 equivalent emissions, South Africa is the world's most carbon-intensive non-oil-producing developing country, this paper aims to test the validity of the EKC for South Africa. For this purpose, we use a century of data (1911-2010), to capture the process of development better compared to short sample-based research; and the concept of co-summability, which is designed to analyze non-linear long-run relations among persistent processes. Our results, however, provide no support of the EKC for South Africa, both for the full-sample and sub-samples (determined by tests of structural breaks), implying that to reduce emissions without sacrificing growth, policies should be aimed at promoting energy efficiency.

We introduce this feature into a structural DSGE model with financial frictions. The asymmetry results from the assumption of occasionally binding credit constraints which we introduce via a penalty function. Our simulations show that a large loan-to-value ratio (our macroprudential tool) tightening can have a much stronger impact on the economy than a loosening of the same size. In contrast, small policy innovations, whether expansionary or contractionary, have effects of almost equal magnitude.

It argues that these financial instruments have added several implications to the dynamics of capitalist economies, so that it forms a new sphere of accumulation here called the fourth dimension, with a new form of capital (the derivative form). In this new dimension, it is possible to observe three major changes compared to the previous dimensions. The first concerns the emergence of new property relations, marked by the separation between the ownership of assets and ownership of the rights on the performance of these assets. The second change relates to the new nature of the gain obtained in derivative transactions, here termed as casino gain. Finally, these changes create the conditions to consider a relationship of subordination of prior dimensions to the fourth dimension, which is consolidated when derivatives markets become the central locus for determining spot prices in key markets.","[Carneiro, Ricardo de Medeiros; Rossi, Pedro; Mello, Guilherme Santos] State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Econ, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Carneiro, Ricardo de Medeiros] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Inter-American Development Bank,"Chiliatto-Leite, MV (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave,NW,NE-1131 Off EXD Brazil, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",marcosvcleite@gmail.com,"Rossi, Pedro/AAZ-6912-2020","Rossi, Pedro/0000-0002-2504-9922; Carneiro, Ricardo/0000-0001-6623-684X; Santos Mello, Guilherme/0000-0002-9847-7012",,,,,58,3,6,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

In this study, we employ a student-fixed effects model to estimate the impact of teacher credentials on student achievement in the context of the biggest education system in the world: China. We find that having a teacher with the highest rank (a credential based on annual assessments by local administrators) has positive impacts on student achievement relative to having a teacher who has not achieved the highest rank We further find that teacher rank has heterogeneous impacts, benefiting economically poor students more than non-poor students.

They underpin this by claiming that the only study in the survey to deviate from this consensus view, i.e. Colombier (2009), was rebutted by Bergh and ohrn (2011). This comment shows that the claim by Bergh and Henrekson (2011) cannot be upheld because the analysis by Bergh and ohrn (2011) is based on a flawed dataset. The re-estimation of Colombier's (2009) regressions with time-fixed effect does not reject his main findings. Moreover, it is demonstrated that recent empirical evidence on the growth impact of government size in rich countries is not as unanimous as the survey by Bergh and Henrekson (2011) suggests.

Despite their potential benefits, the political implementation of green tax reforms is not straightforward. Changes in environmental taxes have different intergenerational effects which need to be taken into account when considering their political support among a country's population. In this paper, we analyze the economic and intergenerational welfare effects of introducing a green tax reform to ameliorate the Spanish social security system. We consider two types of energy taxes: an energy-consumption tax and an energy input tax. We find that both types of reforms are favored by young individuals, but rejected by older generations. The number of generations supporting the reform depends crucially on the disutility that individuals derive from pollution, suggesting that an increase in environmental awareness may be needed for green tax reforms to be politically viable.

In 1938, Harold Hotelling published a forceful and far-reaching proposal for marginal cost pricing entitled The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility Rates. After several years and many pages of discussion, Ronald Coase gave a name and a clear formulation to the debate in his 1946 article The Marginal Cost Controversy. We will tell much of the story of this controversy by comparing the frameworks of Hotelling and Coase, while also bringing in other contributors and offering some thoughts about contemporary relevance. The arguments marshaled by Coase (and his contemporaries) not only succeeded in this particular debate, as we shall see, but more generally served as part of the foundation for various fields of modern economics, particularly institutional, regulatory, and public choice economics as well as law and economics. Yet the underlying issues are quite difficult to resolve, and the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments for marginal cost pricing can turn on specific elements of the industry.","[Frischmann, Brett M.] Yeshiva Univ, Intellectual Property & Informat Law Program, Cardozo Law Sch, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Hogendorn, Christiaan] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT USA",Yeshiva University; Wesleyan University,"Frischmann, BM (通讯作者)，Yeshiva Univ, Intellectual Property & Informat Law Program, Cardozo Law Sch, New York, NY 10033 USA.",frischma@yu.edu; chogendorn@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,30,16,17,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Although ethics is but one of the many institutions that affect economics, it plays a major role in setting the basis on which to build its entire theoretical structure. Approaching the analysis from institutionalism places ethical issues at the forefront of economic debate, thus opening the door to future dialogue between disciplines and analytical approaches.","[Garcia-Quero, Fernando] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Ollero-Peran, Jorge] Penitentiary Inst Seville, Andalucia, Spain",University of Granada,"García-Quero, F (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Business & Econ Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Univ La Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",fgquero@ugr.es,,"Garcia Quero, Fernando/0000-0002-3000-6601",,,,,78,2,3,0,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Researchers often suggest that the federal government impose Pigouvian taxes to correct for these effects and achieve efficiency. We propose an alternative incentive-based regulation: tradeable capital tax permits. Under this system, the federal government would require a state to hold a permit if it wanted to reduce its capital income tax rate from some predefined benchmark. These permits would be tradeable across states. We show that, if the federal government sets the correct number of total permits, then social efficiency is achieved.

It proposes that temptation is the outcome of impulsivity i.e., biased over-confident (suboptimal) belief in success. This proposal challenges the standard literature that portrays temptation as the outcome of present-biased preferences. The payoff of the proposed modeling is that it can easily explain, first, regret, and second, the Allais paradox. Concerning regret, it is nothing but impulsivity-in-reverse: Regretting a rational decision means changing your belief about that decision so that what appeared optimal at the time now appears suboptimal. Concerning the Allais paradox (the certainty effect), it is the outcome of people's fear of regret. Fear of regret leads people to become over-cautious, using biased under-confident beliefs that lead them to compulsive behavior such as seeking zero-risk options. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To do so, we construct a theoretical model by combining technology adoption and technology spillover models through backward linkage. If the technological gap is large between the multinational and local firm, it may be reasoned that the local firm is making the strategic decision not to adopt the advanced technology in order to avoid direct competition with the multinational firm. In this case, even though the transferred technology is diffused and the local firm has the capacity to absorb it, the technology spillover may not occur. Additionally, we apply the model to analyze the effect of local content requirements (LCR) on technology transfer and technology spillover. The analysis shows that LCR may fail to enhance technology spillover because these do not encourage the adoption of the technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines how incorporating monopolistically competitive firms with a working capital requirement (in which firms borrow funds to pay their wage bills) improves the ability of the search models to match the empirical fluctuations in unemployment and vacancy without resorting to an alternative wage setting mechanism. The monetary authority follows an interest rate rule in the model. A positive labor productivity shock lowers the real marginal cost of production and lowers inflation. In response to the fall in price level, the monetary authority reduces the nominal interest rate. A lower interest rate reduces the cost of financing and partially offsets the increase in labor cost from a higher productivity. A reduced labor cost implies the firms retain a greater portion of the gain from a productivity shock, which gives them a greater incentive to create vacancies. Simulations show that a working capital requirement does indeed improve the ability of the search models to generate fluctuations in key labor market variables to better match the U.S. data.

The MNMCPI has several advantages, including the ability to apply group heterogeneity as well as its decomposability to different components, which facilitates identifying the effective factors on performance. The results indicate that the gas-fired and combined cycle power plants have a constant trend and show little progression, while the steam power plants have the worst performance. This is due to the factors such as lack of specified regulations about the type of consumed fuels. Moreover, there does not exist any technological leadership among the fossil-fuel power plants. It was also found that even by considering these conditions, proper resource management and utilizing suitable benchmarks can reduce the current level of CO2 emissions in the power plants up to 25%.

The analysis employs the estimation of a nonstructural indicator (H-statistic) introduced by Panzar and Rosse and draws upon a panel dataset of eight MENA countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) over the period 1997-2012. The empirical findings are robust towards three different panel data econometric techniques (Ordinary Least Squares, Pooled Generalized Least Squares with Fixed Effects, and Generalized Method of Moments) and consistent with other similar studies, providing sufficient evidence in favour of a banking monopolistic competition regime. Furthermore, the estimation of three other alternative measures of competition (Lerner index, adjusted Lerner index, and conduct parameter) provides similar results, revealing that the banking sector in the MENA region is characterized by a low level of Significant Market Power (SMP). Overall, the analysis shows that, despite similarities in the process of financial regulatory reforms undertaken in the eight MENA countries, the observed competition levels of banks vary substantially, with Algeria and Morocco consistently outperforming the rest of the region.","[Polemis, Michael L.] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Polemis, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",mpolemis@unipi.gr,"Polemis, Michael/AAM-7918-2021","POLEMIS, MICHAEL/0000-0003-2223-0547",,,,,47,13,14,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A widely used alternative to obtain estimates of individual tax responsiveness is to exploit the diversity of tax treatment generated by a tax reform to recover tax induced outcome differences in data. Response estimates obtained from analysis of tax reforms are less useful for describing effects of prospective policies, but represent an underexploited source of information for out-of-sample validation of labor supply models. The present study describes how estimates of responses in working hours and income, generated from a tax reform, can be used to validate a discrete choice labor supply model; thus, bringing together and providing guidance to how results of two main avenues of obtaining estimates of tax responsiveness can be compared and interpreted.

This question is commonly answered using a shift-share analysis, which imputes the effects of composition changes on cities' average wages in a purely mechanical way. This paper argues that a shift-share approach can be misleading if compositional shifts spill over into industrial and occupational wages. Using data on Germany, this paper finds that the spillover effects from a shift in industrial and occupational composition are large and imply a total effect on cities' average wages of 2.8 times the effect that is predicted by a shift-share exercise. In addition, results indicate that in the case of Germany, accounting for adjustments along the occupational mix is crucial to identify these spillovers, even if one is only interested in the effect of an industry-specific shock.

We introduce liquidity constraints, myopia and loss aversion into testable hypotheses and document that: First, the PIH fails in urban China and the consumption is consistent with the liquidity constraints. Second, in regions with the high and moderate economic levels, the consumption behaviors show liquidity constraints in the early period of market-oriented economic reforms (i.e., 1980s). However, with time, the consumption pattern changed to myopia. Third, in region with low economic level, the reverse is observed: a period of myopia gave way to a period of liquidity constraints. Our results suggest that neither myopia nor liquidity constraints are an adequate characterization of consumption in different regions of urban China, and offer clear policy implications for governments who are concerned with boosting the household income and expanding domestic demand.","[Xu, Jin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Kong, Dongmin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Kong, DM (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",jinxu@hust.edu.cn; kongdm@hust.edu.cn,"Kong, Dongmin/AAT-2914-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372130, 71173078]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We acknowledge the helpful comments from Le Wang, Shasha Liu, Yan Sheng, and seminar participants at Sun Yat-sen University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Zhongnan University of Economics and Law for helpful suggestions.

This paper empirically examines (a) the statistical properties of the Korea's representative implied volatility index (VKOSPI) derived from the KOSPI 200 options and (b) the macroeconomic and financial variables that can predict the implied volatility process of the index, using augmented heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models with exogenous covariates. The results suggest that the elaborate HAR framework is proficient at describing the dynamics of the VKOSPI and that some domestic macroeconomic variables explain the VKOSPI. More importantly, we find that the stock market return and implied volatility index of the US market (i.e., the S&P 500 spot return and the VIX from the S&P 500 options) play a key role in predicting the level of the VKOSPI and explaining its dynamics, and their explanatory power dominates that of domestic macro-finance variables. Further, while the domestic stock market return does not predict the VKOSPI, the US stock market return does so rather well. When two global factors, both the US stock market return and the US implied volatility index, are incorporated into the HAR framework, the model exhibits the best performance in terms of both in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting ability.","[Han, Heejoon] Sungkyunkwan Univ SKKU, Coll Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kutan, Ali M.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Kutan, Ali M.] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"The authors are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from Robert I.

When both the TTIP and the TPP are realized and China is excluded, the combined damage to the Chinese economy is higher than the damage with the TTIP alone. However, the inclusion of China in the TPP has a positively effect on economic variables in China. This indicates that the impacts of China's participation in the TPP compensate for the negative impacts of the TTIP.

If an agent cares about them or believes others do, they can affect equilibrium selection. We present evidence from lab experiments showing that changes in the size and the sign of third-party externalities have a significant impact on tacit coordination. Decision makers are more willing to incur a cost to try to avoid imposing a large negative externality on a third party, than they are to avoid a small negative externality or to generate a large positive externality. However, when decision-makers' incentives are at odds with the interests of third parties, many of them appear to ignore third-party externalities even if they are large in magnitude, and ignoring them implies substantial earning inequalities and reductions in group earnings.

In our framework majority voting equilibrium exists despite the multidimensional policy choice set. We examine single and multi-jurisdictional economies. We identify five competing incentives that influence choice of tax instruments. Equilibria generally entail a mixture of tax types. With multiple jurisdictions, strong reliance on head taxation in rich communities arises to deter poorer households from immigrating, in spite of local incentives to use alternative tax instruments to redistribute wealth. If relocation costs preclude inter-community mobility, the equilibrium tax system is fundamentally affected, with redistribution incentives then dominating choice of instruments and tax rates. Limiting or eliminating head taxation fundamentally alters stratification, public good provision levels, and tax systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The panel analysis suggests that credit constraints have a negative impact on the capital import decision. However, the results also indicate that institutions such as creditor rights, an efficient debt enforcement and accounting standards improve access to external finance and reduce credit constraints with regard to capital imports. Firm-level difference-in-difference estimations that exploit a reform of the Brazilian bankruptcy law confirm the importance of credit market institutions for upgrading the technology embodied in capital goods.

The true random effects stochastic frontier model (Greene, 2005a,b), which can disentangle time-varying technical inefficiency from time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, and the conventional fixed and random effects models are used to estimate efficiency for the aggregated and individual industry groups. The results indicate that efficiency estimates are sensitive to model specifications of firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity. We find a significant gap in efficiency estimates between the true random effects model and the fixed and random effects models, which would imply considerable heterogeneity of manufacturing firms in Ethiopia. Our results suggest that firm-specific heterogeneity would be particularly significant in the food and beverages, non-metals, and furniture industries. We also show that the production of the Ethiopian manufacturing sector is largely responsive to changes in intermediate inputs compared to labor and capital inputs. The estimated technical efficiency considerably varies across firms within an industry suggesting a significant potential for improving efficiency in the sector. We discuss that the major problem for the variation in efficiency is the inability of firms to operate at their full production capacity, which was mainly caused by shortage of raw material supply. Generally, it is important to differentiate between inefficiency and unobserved heterogeneity in a stochastic frontier framework when firms operate under diverse social, industrial and environmental conditions.

The unique equilibrium outcome of a continuous-time multilateral bargaining game between a single seller and two buyers (i.e., a three-player war of attrition game) show that it does not benefit the buyers the long side of the market if the probability of obstinacy is constant and independent of the initial demands. This result is robust in the sense that the buyers' heterogeneity about their flexibility does not weaken the intensity of the competition. When the seller decides which buyer to negotiate first, he not only chooses his bargaining partner but also picks his outside option. The seller can strengthen his bargaining position against both buyers by picking the unattractive buyer, who is greedier or tougher than the other buyer, first and by leaving the attractive buyer aside because he starts the sequel with a strong outside option.

Instead, a separate number of convergent clubs or blocs in the region have formed in recent years. Finally, and most importantly, we observe at the end of the period of our examination that economies in the region are, generally, converging at different speeds to two opposing poles of convergence, that is, groups of relatively depreciating currencies and, on the other, groups of relatively appreciating currencies.

In 2007, we conducted a field experiment with 1451 subjects in Cartagena, Colombia. We interpret the behavior in the game as a measure of what in the literature has been called social capital. We played the game in two similar and adjacent neighborhoods. The 'treatment' neighborhood, Pozon, had been targeted for over 2 years by a CCT program, Families en Accion; the 'control' neighborhood, Cienaga, had not. In 2008, with the program being implemented in both neighborhoods, we played the same public goods game, and were therefore able to implement a difference in differences strategy to estimate the impact of the CCT on our measure of social capital. In 2007, the level of cooperation we observed in the treatment neighborhood was considerably higher than that in the control one. Although similar in many dimensions, the two groups turned out to be significantly different in some observable variables; the positive result was robust to controls for these differences. In 2008, we found that the level of cooperation was statistically identical across the two neighborhoods, and similar to the levels observed in 2007 in the treatment one. We conclude that the CCT program did improve cooperation. In analyzing the effect of the CCT on cooperation we also look at other (individual and group) determinants of individual behavior in the game, and we compare our measure based on behavior in the game to more traditional measures of social capital used in the literature that we collected in a context-specific survey.

In line with this theory, we find that persistent shocks have a significant impact on happiness while transitory shocks do not.

Public spending on childcare increased from 1 to 3 billion euro over the period 2004-2009. Using a differences-in-differences strategy we find that, despite the substantial budgetary outlay, this reform had only a modest impact on employment. Furthermore, the rather small effects we find are likely confounded by a coincident increase in the EITC for parents with young children of 0.6 billion euro, which presumably also served to increase the labour supply of the group. The joint reform increased the maternal employment rate by 2.3 percentage points (3.0%) and maternal hours worked by 1.1 h per week (6.2%). The results further suggest that the reform slightly reduced hours worked by fathers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bettendorf, Leon J. H.; Jongen, Egbert L.

The number of students enrolling in these courses has also increased. These courses are less costly for universities to offer and provide students with more flexibility than traditional classes. This study examines the relationship between online learning and knowledge retention in introductory economics courses. Student assessment data are matched to transcript and demographic information to control for individual student attributes. Using a differences-in-differences matching estimator, we determine the effect online coursework has on knowledge retention by comparing performance on the assessment.

Will they when it reduces efficiency, such as in political logrolling? We introduce the Stakeholder Public Bad game, in which common fund contributions increase one person's earnings (the Stakeholder) while reducing others' earnings and overall efficiency. The Stakeholder position rotates through all group members or just alternates among two people (making it easier to form a coalition). High Stakeholder rewards provide a lever for reciprocity: if someone contributes when another is Stakeholder, he may be rewarded with a gift when he becomes Stakeholder. Reciprocity is only possible when agents know others' roles and actions, so information provision may be pro- or anti-social. In a laboratory experiment, we combine a rotating or alternating asymmetry in payoffs with varying: levels of information provision to examine pro- and anti-social reciprocity. We find that subjects in the Stakeholder role willingly sacrifice social welfare. We also see both anti-social and pro-social favor trading:, particularly when coalition-forming is easier. Favor trading does not change the mean level of public bad provision. People who trade favors tend to be less risk averse. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The case of China,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article studies the impact of health insurance on individual out-of-pocket health expenditures in China. Using China Health and Nutrition Survey data between 1991 and 2006, we apply two-part and sample selection models to address issues caused by censored data and selection on unobservables. We find that, although the probability of accessing health care increases with the availability of health insurance, the level of out-of-pocket health expenditure decreases. Our results from a selection model with instrumental variables suggest that having health insurance reduces the expected out-of-pocket health expenditure of an individual by 29.42% unconditionally. Meanwhile, conditional on being subjected to positive health expenditure, health insurance helps reduce out-of-pocket spending by 44.38%. This beneficial effect of health insurance weakens over time, which may be attributable to increases in the coinsurance rates of health insurances in China.","[Jung, Juergen] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Streeter, Jialu Liu] Allegheny Coll, Dept Econ, Meadville, PA 16335 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University; Allegheny College,"Jung, J (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Stephens Hall ,Room 101K,8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",jjung@towson.edu; jstreeter@allegheny.edu,,"Jung, Juergen/0000-0003-3791-6293",,,,,28,23,23,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In a centralized network, bad (self-regarding) suggestions have a negative and permanent effect, whereas good (cooperative) suggestions have a null (or even negative) effect due to their limited credibility. In a decentralized network the positive effect of good suggestions is permanent (although smaller than in the centralized network), while bad suggestions have a more limited effect. Although allocation to positions in the network is exogenous, we find a positive correlation between network centrality and other-regarding behavior when transmitting good and bad messages.

It involves finding available positions, completing applications, and attending interviews, to name but a few of the activities involved. The optimal unemployment insurance (UI) literature models the cost of these activities as either a reduction in leisure or an unpleasant bad that reduces utility, ignoring their associated monetary costs. If search requires out of pocket expenses on goods and services that improve the probability of a successful job search, a low UI benefit may make a job search unaffordable. This paper investigates the optimal structure of UI in an economy where job search is not only unpleasant, but also requires a monetary investment. Numerical experiments suggest that without access to capital markets, the optimal UI system should include a higher benefit for the newly unemployed than is implied by assuming a job search is free. This allows workers to purchase the stock of goods and services needed to find work. In contrast, when workers can accumulate savings, more benefits should be provided to the long-term unemployed, so they have the financial resources needed to conduct a job search even as they exhaust their own savings.

By using bilateral trade data, we examine the relationships between trade flows and various environmental stringency indices. Previous studies have used energy intensity, abatement cost intensity, and survey indices for regulations as proxies for the strictness of environmental policy. However, they have overlooked the indirect effect of environmental regulations on trade flows. If the strong version of the Porter hypothesis is confirmed, we need to consider the effect of environmental regulation on gross domestic product (GDP), because GDP induced by environmental regulation affects trade flows. The present study clarifies the effects of regulation on trade flows by distinguishing between the indirect and direct effects. Our results indicate an observed non-negligible indirect effect of regulation, implying that the overall effect of appropriate regulation benefits trade flows.","[Tsurumi, Tetsuya] Nanzan Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Seto, Aichi 4890863, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban Engn, Nishi Ku, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Hibiki, Akira] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Tohoku University,"Tsurumi, T (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 27 Seirei Cho, Seto, Aichi 4890863, Japan.",tsurumi@nanzan-u.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Hibiki, Akira/AAE-3851-2019","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; Hibiki, Akira/0000-0001-5955-492X","JSPS KAKENHI [25740068]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03347, 25740068] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was funded by the JSPS KAKENHI (grant/award no.: 25740068).,,38,19,19,6,51,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We hypothesized that the sense of ownership is a psychological derivative of resource acquisition and allocation. We predicted a valuation order of stable ownership or no-ownership < alternating (interchanging) ownership < sudden reversals in ownership. One hundred and sixty-six participants played an object-acquisition game, a computer simulation of gaining or losing the ownership of an object (e.g., a pen, a mug, or a flashlight) with different outcome sequences, preprogramed but unbeknownst to the participants. After each game, the participant valued the target object by indicating their willingness-to-pay price, if the last outcome was a loss, or willingness-to-accept price, if the last outcome was a gain. The valuation of an object was highest after experiencing a final reversal in ownership from losses to a final gain or from gains to a final loss, followed by alternating ownership and stable (patrimonial) ownership or constant non-ownership. Wins or losses are not created equal due to different trajectories in how people come to own (lose) objects. The results also suggest that loss aversion is better understood as a specific result of ownership experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Wang, X. T.

The freedom to trade and economic freedom indices are employed. Hitherto, unexplored financial sector concepts of formalisation, semi-formalisation, informalisation and non-formalisation are also introduced. The following findings are established. First, relative to money supply, (i) with the exception of the economic freedom mechanism, liberalisation policies have generally decreased the growth of the formal financial sector to the benefit of other financial sectors; (ii) apart from the foreign direct investment and economic freedom channels, liberalisation policies have been fruitful for semi-formal financial development at the cost of other financial sectors and; (iii) with the exception of economic freedom, both the informal and non-formal sectors have developed owing to liberalisation to the detriment of the formal financial sector. Second, relative to gross domestic product, the semi-formal, informal and/or non-formal financial sectors have also generally improved as a result of liberalisation.

However, our review of the available econometric evidence and our panel growth regressions suggest that there is no strong evidence of real spillovers in the region after 1994, once global shocks are controlled for. More generally, we find no evidence of real spillovers from South Africa to the rest of the continent post-1994. We investigate the possible reasons for this lack of spillovers. Most importantly, the economies of South Africa and the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa might have decoupled in the mid-1990s. That is when international sanctions on South Africa ended and the country re-integrated with the global economy, while growth in the rest of the continent accelerated due to a combination of domestic and external factors.","[Basdevant, Olivier; Jonelis, Andrew; Mircheva, Borislava; Slavov, Slavi] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Slavov, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sslavov@imf.org,,"Basdevant, Olivier/0000-0002-1800-5008",,,,,24,1,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Should a firm desire to enter the platform, it must pay an entrance fee to the platform owner, as well as incur a fixed setup cost. Since the platform can be maintained at zero cost, the platform owner aims to maximize the total entrance fee revenue. When a product is introduced, it reduces the prices of the other goods, thereby adversely affecting the revenue of other firms. Under condition of free entry, the entering firm does not take this effect into account. In contrast, the platform owner does take it into account. As a result, the entrance fee may act to raise welfare by eliminating socially undesirable goods.","[Chang, Ming Chung; Ho, Yan-Ching] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chung Li City, Taiwan; [Peng, Hsiao-Ping] Yu Da Univ, Dept Int Business, Zaoqiao Township, Miao Li County, Taiwan",National Central University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chung Li City, Taiwan.",mcchang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

Estimating the External Returns to Higher Education in China,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Despite its significance in policymaking and theory, empirical work on external returns to education has not been fruitful, and most studies focus on developed countries. This paper discusses external returns to education in China, an important developing economy. Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we estimate a fixed-effects instrumental variables model and find positive returns of about 10 to 14 percent. Negligible returns are found for urban, female, and highly educated workers, and returns are positive and statistically significant for rural, male, and poorly educated workers. This suggests that China should increase public investment in education and target rural areas and poorly educated workers. Gender differences in the external returns to education may also imply that China should make more efforts to enhance the capacity of networking and competitiveness for women.","[Fan, Wen] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Inst Urban Dev Studies, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fan, Wen] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Govt Studies, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yuanyuan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA Lincoln Ga, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Wang, Liming] Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Wang, Liming] Beijing Univ Technol, Irish Inst Chinese Studies, Dublin 2, Ireland",Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; Trinity College Dublin,"Ma, YY (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing TILDA Lincoln Ga, Dublin 2, Ireland.",wen.e.fan@gmail.com; mayu@tcd.ie; liming.wang@ucd.ie,"Ma, Yuanyuan/HSH-7412-2023","Ma, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-1090-4551",Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"The present research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

Not only have short-term policy rates been cut to zero, but the monetary base, and even more so commercial bank reserves, have been increased hugely. Yet bank lending to the private sector and the broad money supply have stagnated, and the recovery has been weak. While the prior level of bank equity was patently too low, the way in which the regulatory requirements for higher equity ratios have been introduced encouraged deleveraging, especially via reductions in cross-border lending.

A simple structural growth model serves as a guide for the empirical specification and a reference point for the interpretation of the empirical results. Our estimates suggest significant potential gains from reducing crime during periods of worsening economic conditions, when market sentiment is pessimistic, and thus uncertainty regarding the return to saving is above average, employment is low, and the strain on government-sector resources through high public-safety spending is already sizable. Crime does not seem to be so harmful to growth when economic conditions are sufficiently satisfactory. In this respect, our results provide an explanation for the inconclusive empirical evidence, based on reduced-form models, regarding the strength of the growth-crime relationship.

Detailed career histories of boardroom executives in all FTSE 350 companies between 1996 and 2008 are utilised. The paper highlights the failure of existing arrangements to adjust pay outcomes where career performance is poor. The leading theoretical reasons for this disconnect, namely managerial power and neoinstitutionalism, are not consistent with the data. The paper identifies a settling-up process at work, whereby pay is adjusted in the light of both past pay and past performance. From a policy perspective, a case is made for adopting a cumulative or career-oriented approach to rewarding executive performance through the use of truly long-term incentives in the form of 'career shares'.","[Gregory-Smith, Ian] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Main, Brian G.

First, we investigate whether taxes generally matter for the labour supply decisions of our respondents. Around 41 per cent report taking taxes into consideration, implying that the majority of the German population is unresponsive to taxation. Second, we look at self-reported labour supply adjustments following a recently enacted payroll tax change. Only around 12 per cent of our respondents report an actual labour supply response, but we find evidence of an income, as well as a substitution, effect of the tax change. Our conclusion is that the effects of taxes on labour supply in Germany are likely small. We analyse the correlation with economic and socio-demographic variables and find that the self-employed are relatively more sensitive to taxation and that low interest rates reduce incentives for expanding the labour supply.

In the model economy, a positive productivity shock is amplified through endogenous fluctuations in the financial market. The paper shows that if wages are set via Nash bargaining, the productivity shock substantially increases wage volatility and, as a result, the shock has very little effect on firm profitability and hiring workers over the business cycle.

More precisely, the variation in the realized cross-sectional standard deviation of profit growth and stock returns is larger than the variation in the forecast standard deviation. Moreover, the forecast standard deviation of profit growth and stock returns are negatively or uncorrelated, the uncertainty measures increase stock returns due to a risk premium, but they decrease profit growth.

Global economy-environment models that are used to assess climate change issues traditionally do not distinguish households by income or other attributes. To facilitate progress in this area, we review and assess literature on methods to include household heterogeneity in global long-term Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. We distinguish among three categories of approaches: 1) the explicit modeling of multiple household types within the CGE framework, 2) micro-simulation modeling, and 3) direct modeling of income distribution. For each of these approaches we describe the method, key assumptions, limitations and several prominent examples from the literature. Moreover, we discuss data needs, including the contents of household survey data, their availability and processing. We conclude with an overview of what each method could provide for global, long-term climate-related research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For the smaller US stocks, we estimate lower bounds of 8-10% for the volatility and 0.3-0.5 for the autocorrelation of the pricing errors, at monthly horizon. We infer that approximately 50% of the pricing errors of the smaller stocks originate from the market-wide component, whereas for larger stocks, virtually all of the pricing errors are market-wide. In practice, this evidence means that market-wide bubbles and busts are far more important than idiosyncratic sources of pricing errors, like thin trading, low liquidity or little analyst following.","[De Moor, Lieven] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Ixelles, Belgium; [De Moor, Lieven] Vrije Univ Brussel, Solvay Business Sch, Ixelles, Belgium; [Sercu, Piet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Sch Business & Econ, Leuven, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; KU Leuven,"De Moor, L (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Ixelles, Belgium.",lieven.de.moor@vub.ac.be,"De Moor, Lieven/HGC-3651-2022","De Moor, Lieven/0000-0002-1290-2971",,,,,6,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In addition to the methodological contribution of the paper, it investigates the efficiency of the Slovak banking industry over the years 2000-2011 so as to find whether employment of a specific approach changes the view on efficiency of individual commercial banks. To this end, the non-parametric method of evaluation is employed based on the slack-based measure model of data envelopment analysis.The results suggest that general impressions of the efficiency status of individual banks as obtained within the three approaches are similar in most cases.","[Bod'a, Martin; Zimkova, Emilia] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; emilia.zimkova@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016; Zimková, Emília/ABA-2577-2022","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898; Zimková, Emília/0000-0003-1648-8103",Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica [26110230082]; European Social Fund [018/2012/1.2/OPV],Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"The authors extend their gratitude to Professor Emmanuel Thanassoulis of Aston Business School in Birmingham for a very careful reading of this text and for his comments.

Reducing price would help maintain cash flow, but low prices can erode brand image and, hence, long-term sales. The paper extends earlier work of the same authors by explicitly deriving a firm's optimal cash management behavior, taking into account that a too low cash level results in bankruptcy. There are different sets of initial conditions for which qualitatively different solution trajectories are optimal. We distinguish mild and severe recessions. With mild recessions bankruptcy can be avoided for sure when the brand image is large enough.

It first presents an argument on how and why dictators restrict civil liberties and diffusion of information to survive in office, even if this reduces their personal consumption. The argument predicts that autocracies have slower technological change than democracies, which in turn impairs GDP per capita growth rates. These and other implications from the argument are tested empirically, and so are implications from alternative explanations on the association between democracy and technological change. Drawing on an extensive global dataset, with some time series going back to the early 19th century, the paper reports robust evidence that democracy increases not only technology-induced growth but also net economic growth rates. Notably, the results hold when accounting for the endogeneity of democracy, country-fixed effects, and sample-selection bias.","[Knutsen, Carl Henrik] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Knutsen, Carl Henrik] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, ESOP, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Knutsen, CH (通讯作者)，POB 0317 Blindern, Oslo, Norway.",c.h.knutsen@stv.uio.no,,"Knutsen, Carl Henrik/0000-0002-5470-9045",Research Council Norway [240505],Research Council Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Oslo; Associated Researcher, ESOP, Department of Economics, University of Oslo.

The empirical results found strong matching combinations for: efficiency-seeking motive and fiscal incentive, market-seeking motive and market preference incentive, and capability-seeking motive and financial incentive.

As a result, it has one of the highest homeownership rates amongst market economies. This paper provides a historical perspective of the main housing problems faced by successive prime ministers and their respective policy responses. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew (1959-1990), the government established an integrated landhousing supply and housing finance framework to channel much needed resources into the housing sector to deal with a chronic housing shortage. Under Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (1990-2004), asset enhancement schemes to renew aging estates as well as market deregulation measures were implemented. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (2004-present) has been confronted with a different set of challenges - investment demand for housing, rising inequalities and rapidly aging population. These problems have brought about the introduction of carefully crafted macroprudential policies, targeted housing grants to assist low and middle income households, and schemes to help elderly households monetize their housing equity.","Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Phang, SY (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",syphang@smu.edu.sg,"PHANG, Sock Yong/D-1443-2009","Phang, Sock-Yong/0000-0001-6280-3202",,,,,16,10,12,4,46,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We focus on the effects of patience on two types of career investments: work effort and on-the-job search. Whereas the former increases the probability of obtaining a promotion, the latter affects the chance of receiving an outside job offer. We propose a theoretical career model which allows for these two distinct career paths. To test the theoretical predictions, we make use of the DNB Household Survey. This large Dutch longitudinal survey contains detailed information on individual time preferences, on-the-job search behaviour and indicators of work effort. The results show that on-the-job search and work effort increase with patience. The relation between patience and job mobility is more ambiguous. These findings may be hard to reconcile with standard on-the-job search models but can be rationalized by models in which work effort and on-the-job search are substitutes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of the estimation of a random-effects probit model with panel data, the authors find that the superior characteristics of these types of two-way trading firms (in terms of size, productivity, foreign ownership and skilled labor) explain their greater resistance to losing their status as exporters. However, even when these distinctive traits are controlled for, the effect of sourcing inputs from abroad on export exit is significantly different for large and small firms, playing a role in continuing to export only for the latter. Thus, it seems that small firms which are both importers of intermediates and exporters have an added advantage which enables them to confront the uncertainty of foreign markets in better conditions and translates to a lower likelihood that they will stop exporting.","[Diaz-Mora, Carmen; Corcoles, David; Gandoy, Rosario] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Díaz-Mora, C (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain.",Carmen.diazmora@uclm.es,"Juste, Rosario Gandoy/AAI-4061-2020; Diaz-Mora, Carmen/S-6629-2016; Corcoles Gonzalez, David/S-5831-2016","Juste, Rosario Gandoy/0000-0002-0203-4816; Diaz-Mora, Carmen/0000-0002-2440-4865; Corcoles Gonzalez, David/0000-0003-3523-0976",Catedra de Innovacion y Desarrollo Cooperativo y Empresarial (University of Castilla-La Mancha and Fundacion Caja Rural Castilla-La Mancha) as well as UCLM internal [GI20152903],Catedra de Innovacion y Desarrollo Cooperativo y Empresarial (University of Castilla-La Mancha and Fundacion Caja Rural Castilla-La Mancha) as well as UCLM internal,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Catedra de Innovacion y Desarrollo Cooperativo y Empresarial (University of Castilla-La Mancha and Fundacion Caja Rural Castilla-La Mancha) as well as UCLM internal funding for research groups (GI20152903).,,47,3,3,2,17,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,JUL 14,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-20,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CM8NL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357958500001,0

We try to answer the question of whether the differences that exist among different welfare state regimes, according to prevailing welfare state typologies, lead to different responses to the consequences of the crisis. Welfare state regimes are the result of different institutional perceptions of social risks hence it is realistic to expect specific responses to the effects of crisis among different welfare state regimes, and similar responses among the countries that belong to the same welfare state regimes. In order to recognize convergent vs. divergent processes, we perform a comparative analysis of the dynamics of the key welfare state determinants of the EU-15 countries, grouping according to welfare state regimes, in the pre-crisis and crisis periods. The results indicate that institutional rigidity and inherent inertia has remained a key factor of convergent welfare state processes in countries that belong to the Social Democratic and Corporatist welfare state regimes. Deviations from such a course are the most evident in the Mediterranean welfare state regimes, especially in Greece and Portugal where austerity measures have been formulated under the strong influence of the Troika.","[Josifidis, Kosta; Supic, Novica; Pucar, Emilija Beker] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Hall, John B.] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",University of Novi Sad; Portland State University,"Supic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",novicasupic@yahoo.com,"Supic, Novica/Q-8905-2019; Supic, Novica/ABF-9244-2022","Supic, Novica/0000-0002-9526-7255","Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia [47010]","Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia","The first version of this paper was presented at the 10th International Conference Developments in Economic Theory and Policy (Bilbao, June 27-28, 2013).

The purpose of the research is to assess the impact of innovations on economic growth during recession. The analysis of the situation in manufacturing sectors of Lithuania during economic recession in 2007 to 2009 has revealed several characteristics of innovations for this period due to which Lithuanian manufacturing enterprises managed to successfully function and remain competitive. The influence of household consumption expenditure on the growth of GDP in Lithuania is described by the function close to the linear, so we see a direct relation between these two variables. The influence of export on GDP is described by a convex function which has showed the declining influence of export on the GDP growth in the long-term perspective. Thus, contrary to a rather popular belief in transition countries, the main engine of growth in the long-term is not export. The long-term GDP growth is impossible without stimulating the growth in household consumption expenditure.","[Snieska, Vytautas; Valodkiene, Gitana] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Snieska, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, K Donelaicio G 20, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vytautas.snieska@ktu.lt,"Snieska, Vytautas/S-2053-2017","Snieska, Vytautas/0000-0001-8777-273X",Research Council of Lithuania [IEP-01/2012],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research is funded by a grant (No. IEP-01/2012) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,38,10,11,5,45,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Consequently, a number of non-survey techniques have been developed in the last decades to estimate I-O tables. These techniques usually depart from observable information on the row and column margins, and then the cells of the matrix are adjusted using as a priori information a matrix from a past period (updating) or an I-O table from the same time period (regionalization). This paper proposes the use of a composite cross-entropy approach that allows for introducing both types of a priori information. The suggested methodology is suitable to be applied only to matrices with semi-positive interior cells and margins. Numerical simulations and an empirical application are carried out, where an I-O table for the Euro Area is estimated with this method and the result is compared with the traditional projection techniques.","[Fernandez Vazquez, Esteban; Ramos Carvajal, Carmen] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Oviedo, Spain; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

Specifically, we utilize the MSC data on both expected inflation and consumer sentiment to construct a vector autoregressive (VAR) model for forecasting gasoline prices for 2003-2014. Our findings indicate that the VAR forecasts are superior to the comparable benchmark forecasts obtained from a univariate integrated moving average (MA) model in terms of both predictive information content and directional accuracy. As such, we conclude that the MSC data on both expected inflation and consumer sentiment have significant predictive information for gasoline prices. Further inspection reveals that the VAR forecasts are particularly accurate for the period since 2008, reinforcing the notion that consumers are economically rational. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Are foreign and domestic sales complements or substitutes? Using a French firm-level database combining balance-sheet and product-destination-specific export information over the period 1995-2001, we study how demand conditions in foreign markets affect domestic sales through variations in exports. We identify a number of exogenous shocks affecting the firms' demand on foreign markets, including product-destination specific imports or tariff changes, and large foreign shocks such as financial crises or civil wars. Our results show that exogenous variations in firm-level exports positively impact domestic sales, even after controlling for domestic demand conditions. A 10% exogenous increase in foreign sales generates a 1 to 3% increase in domestic sales in the short-run. This result is robust to various estimation techniques, instruments, controls, and sub-samples. It is also supported by the natural experiment of the Asian crisis in the late 1990's.

Other occupations within the public sector exhibit sizeable wage gaps which cannot be explained by workplace or worker characteristics.

This demographic shift has considerable implications for the development of social policy. Here too, countries differ widely. This paper sets the context for the rest of the volume. The focus is mostly on countries in East and Southeast Asia, but it includes contrasting comparisons to key regional countries such as India and Australia.

Small changes in market-access costs can cause a change in the type of equilibrium, leading to discontinuous price changes, deleveraging, and portfolio-flow reversals.

As a specific novelty, we consider cooperativeness, time and risk preferences - elicited experimentally - together with factors like socioeconomic and personality characteristics. We find a number of robust predictors of link formation and of the position within the social network (local and global network centrality). In particular, cooperativeness has a complex association with link formation. We also find evidence for homophily along several dimensions. Finally, our results show that despite these systematic patterns, social network structures can be exogenously manipulated, as we find that random assignments of students to groups on the first two days of university impacts the students' friendship formation process.

Contrary to previous literature, it is shown that the unraveling result first derived by Milgrom (1981) is relatively robust to costly reporting. A separating equilibrium exists even with arbitrarily high reporting costs. Intuitively, the costs work as a signaling device and a combination of disclosure of information and costly signaling accomplishes full separation. With reporting costs there are typically multiple equilibria. For example, a pooling equilibrium exists if and only if the reporting costs are high. Finally, a separating equilibrium exists when the receiver has to make a costly effort in order to access the information in a report, as long as this cost is not too high. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A novel aspect of this study is that we focus on the worst possible outcome. We investigate the maximal cartel price, the largest price for which the conditions for sustainability hold. We analyze how the maximal cartel price supported by different cartel strategies adjusts in response to the introduction of (ex-ante and ex-post) leniency programs. We disentangle the effects of traditional antitrust enforcement, leniency, and cartel strategies on the maximal cartel price. Ex-ante leniency cannot reduce the maximal cartel price below the price under antitrust without leniency. On the other hand, for ex-post leniency, improvement is possible and granting full immunity to single-reporting firms achieves the largest reduction in the maximal cartel price. To reduce adverse effects under both leniency programs, fine reductions to multiple-reporting firms should be moderate or absent. Finally, ex-post leniency should provide less generous fine reductions to multiple-reporting firms, which is supported by the current practice in the US and the EU.","[Houba, Harold; Motchenkova, Evgenia] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wen, Quan] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Houba, H (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",harold.houba@vu.nl; e.i.motchenkova@vu.nl; wenq2@u.washington.edu,,"Motchenkova, Evgenia/0000-0003-2535-4350; Houba, Harold/0000-0001-9085-7339",,,,,43,8,8,2,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We advance existing literature in two dimensions. First, we express the Ramsey rule in terms of elasticities of substitution, which are easier to estimate. This extends the scope of applications of the Ramsey rule in policy issues. Second, we illustrate the proposed optimal tax rule by estimating the corresponding elasticities of substitution using Mexican data. According to the model and the data, the optimal value added tax structure for Mexico in 2002 would have been a 7% tax rate on food and 5.5% tax rate on all other market goods.","[Rodriguez-Zamora, Carolina] Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,,jean-lim@kif.re.kr; carolina.rodriguez@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

However, little is known to what extent a strategyproof and efficient mechanism can limit justified envy. We define an assignment to be unjust if a student i is not assigned to a school a that she prefers to her own assignment, i has higher priority at a than some student j who is assigned to a, and none of the students ranked higher at a than i are dependent on j. We prove that Top Trading Cycles is the unique mechanism that is strategyproof, efficient, and just. This demonstrates that a strictly stronger notion of fairness than justness is either unachievable by a strategyproof and efficient mechanism or it is only achievable by TTC.

The paper provides a relatively weak restriction, referred to as regularity, on the unknown part the competing mechanism game. This condition makes it possible to characterize the set of supportable equilibrium outcomes of the unknown part of the game using information about the part of the game the modeler does understand. In addition, the paper provides a canonical game called the reciprocal contracting game which supports as an equilibrium every equilibrium outcome of any regular competing mechanism game that embeds the known part of the game.

To examine this question, we decompose CPI inflation and core inflation into their permanent and transitory components, using a correlated unobserved-components model. The stationarity of inflation may be time-varying, so we examine the performance of the core measure of inflation separately for periods in which inflation is I(1) and I(0). For a period in which inflation appears to be I(1), we find that core inflation and the permanent component of overall inflation are closely related, but there are some caveats. For a period in which inflation appears to be I(0), we decompose the core and overall price levels and find that the permanent component of the core CPI is much more volatile than the actual core series and that the core excludes volatile permanent shocks to the overall price level.","[Bradley, Michael D.; Sinclair, Tara M.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Jansen, Dennis W.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",George Washington University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Sinclair, TM (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",tsinc@gwu.edu,"Sinclair, Tara M/I-2772-2019","Sinclair, Tara M/0000-0002-1990-3264",Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP) at the Elliott School of International Affairs; Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University,Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP) at the Elliott School of International Affairs; Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University,"Sinclair gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the Institute for International Economic Policy (IIEP) at the Elliott School of International Affairs.

Financial turmoils and hikes in the nationwide risk premia, coupled with high indebtedness levels and stiff fiscal measures, boost the output costs of fiscal consolidations and severely affect their effectiveness in bringing the public debt-to-GDP ratio down in the short term.

It does so by estimating a multinomial logit model with propensity matching comparing those survey respondents that made the experience of social security transfer in the past (either difficult or easy) to those that never had such experience. Estimations were run separately for two clusters of country: the older EU-15 and the newer EU-12. The results suggest that an easy experience with the transfer of social security across countries may increase the propensity to move abroad for professional reasons. In contrast, difficulties are likely to negatively affect mobility incentives. The sign of the effect is stable across countries, but intensity varies depending on the group of countries considered belonging to the EU-15 or EU-12.

High-quality child care is believed to promote,such language skills, and it is thus of concern that children from immigrant families are underrepresented in formal child care across OECD countries. How can we increase their participation, and can such participation improve family integration? We study an intervention in some districts of Oslo where children aged four and five were eligible for 20 h of free childcare weekly. Taking advantage of the intervention being available in some city districts and not in others, we estimate the effect of the intervention on the enrollment of children and on their parents' employment and education, using outcomes measured for the same family before and after the child's age of eligibility. We find that the intervention increased the participation for children from immigrant families by 15%. However, we do not find support for effects on parental employment or education. The performance in tests at school entry (age six) for children from immigrant families in city districts with free child care is better than that of similar children in comparison districts. Overall, our results suggest that subsidizing center based child care can improve the cognitive development of children from immigrant families. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey supplement to the Health and Retirement Survey, I use a fixed-effects tobit specification to estimate the effect of hours worked, labor income, non-labor income and assets on meal production decisions for respondents between 45 and 75 years of age who either live alone or with their spouse/partner. These relationships are estimated separately by gender and household structure (single-headed and dual-headed households). Among single males, increasing labor supply by 10 h per week was associated with 33.8 fewer minutes per week allocated to at-home meal preparation, 39.5 fewer minutes per month eating at restaurants, and $6.73 more per week spent on groceries. In contrast, the time and expenditure allocations of single females did not respond to changes in hours worked. Within dual-member households, increasing own-labor supply by 10 h per week was associated with a decrease in time allocated to preparing meals for both the male (30.4 min per week) and female member (30.5 min per week) with only weak evidence that the spouse/partner compensated by increasing their allocation of time.","Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Dunn, RA (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",dunn.econ@gmail.com,,,National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Mental Health [T32 MH18029-21],National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Mental Health,"The author wishes to thank Barbara Wolfe, John Mullahy, Karl Scholz, Daniel Hamermesh and Mark Aguiar for their valuable input along with seminar participants at Texas A&M University.

These ratings have the potential to substantially improve the match between products and consumers, however the extent to which they do so likely depends on whether the ratings reflect actual consumer experiences. This paper evaluates one potential source of bias in consumer ratings: mimicry of the reviews of experts. Using a rich dataset on consumer product ratings from the brewing industry and a regression discontinuity empirical framework, I show that expert reviews influence consumer ratings. Consumer ratings fall in response to negative expert reviews and increase in response to positive expert reviews. The results are most pronounced for strongly negative or strongly positive expert reviews. This mimicry limits the extent to which information on product quality from actual consumer experiences diffuses to the population. I suggest that nudges could be implemented to limit the extent to which mimicry affects ratings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Pratt, GA",,,,"Pratt, Gill A.",,,Is a Cambrian Explosion Coming for Robotics?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"About half a billion years ago, life on earth experienced a short period of very rapid diversification called the Cambrian Explosion. Many theories have been proposed for the cause of the Cambrian Explosion, one of the most provocative being the evolution of vision, allowing animals to dramatically increase their ability to hunt and find mates. Today, technological developments on several fronts are fomenting a similar explosion in the diversification and applicability of robotics. Many of the base hardware technologies on which robots depend-particularly computing, data storage, and communications-have been improving at exponential growth rates. Two newly blossoming technologies-Cloud Robotics and Deep Learning-could leverage these base technologies in a virtuous cycle of explosive growth.

We find that bilateral privatization leads to higher tariffs than no privatization, but unilateral privatization yields the highest tariff for a privatized country and the lowest tariff for a non-privatized country. However, a higher environmental tax is called for when a privatization policy is practiced. We also investigate a privatization choice game between two governments and show that unilateral privatization is the Nash equilibrium of the game. Finally, we compare the local optimum with the global optimum and show that the latter is independent of the regimes of privatization policies. We find a need for trade and environmental policy coordination between the two governments for global welfare maximization.","[Xu, Lili; Lee, Sang-Ho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Gwangju 500757, South Korea",Chonnam National University,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Gwangju 500757, South Korea.",lilixuchonnam@hotmail.com; sangho@chonnam.ac.kr,"Lee, Sang-Ho/E-7848-2017; Xu, Lili/AAY-4923-2021","Lee, Sang-Ho/0000-0002-0283-5998; Xu, Lili/0000-0001-9660-3145",Chonnam National University,Chonnam National University,"This paper was presented at the international conferences of Eurasia Business and Economics Society (Singapore; 2014), Korean Economic Association (Seoul, Korea; 2014), East Asian Association of Environment and Resource Economics (Busan, Korea; 2014), Fudan University (Shanghai, China; 2014), and National University of Kaohsiung (Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 2014).

Despite the importance of these findings, the empirical plausibility of the symmetry hypothesis has not been tested yet. In this article, we contrast the symmetry assumption with an empirical exercise based on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions data set for the European Union in the period 2005-2007.

By employing the Bartlett corrected trace test, which provides better approximations of the finite sample distribution to determine the rank of cointegration, the results support the existence of a single long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables.

In this paper, I introduce the assumption of endogenous information acquisition into otherwise standard house allocation problems. I find that there is a unique ex ante Pareto-optimal, strategy-proof, and nonbossy allocation mechanism: serial dictatorship.

We develop a search and matching model with heterogeneous sectors and ex-post collective wage bargaining and test the predictions of the model using a difference-in-difference approach on manufacturing sector data in a set of OECD countries during the period 1980-2000. We find that union power reduces investment per worker particularly in sunk capital intensive industries. We refine our empirical analysis showing that the underlying hold-up problem is exacerbated when strikes are not regulated after a collective contract is signed and there is no arbitration, while the presence of social pacts may sustain cooperative equilibria that alleviate the hold-up problem.

The system includes a large-scale hydrothermal power system with many hydroelectric plants and multiple owners. Due to the historical harnessing of natural resources, the National Interconnected System (NIS) was developed outside of the economic scale of the BES. The central components of the NIS enable energy generated in any part of Brazil to be consumed in distant regions, considering certain technical configurations. This interconnection results in a large-scale complex system and is controlled by robust computational models, used to support the planning and operation of the NIS. This study presents a different vision of the SEB, demonstrating the intrinsic relationship between hydrological stochasticity and the activities executed by the system, which is an important sector of the infrastructure in Brazil. The simulation of energy scenarios is crucial to the optimal manner to operate the sector and to supporting decisions about whether expansion is necessary, thus, avoiding unnecessary costs and/or losses. These scenarios are an imposing factor in the determination of the spot cost of electrical energy, given that the simulated quantities of water in the reservoirs are one of the determinants for the short-term energy price.

With very low home-country wages in relation to the cost of undocumented migration, the opportunity to migrate often hinges on the possibility of obtaining credit from a human smuggling organization or family and friends. This paper examines the conditions under which migration is optimal for an individual who lacks liquid assets, with a focus on alternative options for financing migration costs. One is by accumulating the required amount of savings out of source-country income, with or without financial support from the family or social network. The other is debt-bonded migration, which involves borrowing from a smuggling organization and paying off the loan while working in the host country. I find that greater financial support from the family network increases the attractiveness of debt-bonded relative to self-financed migration.","Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Djajic, S (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, 11A Ave Paix, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",slobodan.djajic@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This paper uses a panel of 23,000 energy-intensive, Chinese firms from 1999 to 2004 to examine how firms responded to severe power shortages in the early 2000s. Our results suggest that, in response to electricity scarcity, Chinese firms re-optimize among inputs to production by substituting materials for energy (both electric and non-electric sources) a shift from make to buy of intermediate inputs to production. While outsourcing can be costly, Chinese firms were able to avoid substantial productivity losses by doing so. As a result of the increase in electricity scarcity from 1999 onward, we find that unit production costs increased by eight percent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This question has never been empirically addressed despite its profound importance especially since many developed countries have embarked on fiscal consolidation programs, which in many cases have led to sizeable increases in unemployment and poverty, and are met with public dissatisfaction. Using a data set for 29 OECD countries over the period 1971-2009, we argue that fairness matters, namely that improving the targeting of social transfers and their effectiveness in terms of poverty alleviation, higher public expenditure on training and active labor market programs and programs like social housing directed to the poor, even decreasing the VAT rate on necessities, improve the success probabilities of consolidation attempts. Introducing such concerns sheds new light on the prevailing view that the successful fiscal adjustments are those that rely on spending-cuts rather than on tax increases. The results of this paper provide empirical evidence that ameliorating the effects of adjustment, by supporting the weaker parts of society, is crucial for the success of fiscal consolidations and argues that fair fiscal adjustments may provide the double dividend of enhancing the probability of success of the adjustment and of promoting social cohesion.","[Kaplanoglou, Georgia; Rapanos, Vassilis T.] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10559, Greece; [Bardakas, Ioanna C.] Bank Greece, Econ Res Dept, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Kaplanoglou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Sofokleous 1, Athens 10559, Greece.",gkaplanog@econ.uoa.gr; vrapanos@econ.uoa.gr; impardaka@bankofgreece.gr,"Kaplanoglou, Georgia/AAL-7674-2021; Rapanos, Vassilis/HKM-8686-2023",,,,,,45,11,12,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2015,68.0,2,,,,,197,219,,10.1111/kykl.12080,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF4XH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352556700004,0

Under both D1 and a novel refinement, the informed player has nondecreasing value functions and her strategy has the following structure: for high states, both types enter with certainty; for a possibly empty interval of intermediate states, no type enters; and for low states, the high type enters while the low type mixes. I obtain closed form solutions and analyze comparative statics for such equilibria.

For decades, the transformative potential of this enormous resource has prompted interest in technologies for recovering uranium from seawater. Since the 1960s, though, cost analyses of such technologies have failed to convincingly demonstrate a cost-competitive alternative to conventional uranium recovery from terrestrial mining. Hence, uranium from seawater has come to be considered as a backstopping technology that has the potential to establish a price ceiling for the uranium resource. Such an upper bound is valuable because it removes uncertainty surrounding uranium prices when developing and deploying nuclear power systems. This paper reviews cost estimates as the technology has evolved over the past five decades. During this time, systems that actively moved seawater gave way to those where the adsorbent sits passively in seawater. The adsorbent material changed from hydrous titanium oxide to the higher-capacity amidoxime ligand. Early efforts used amidoxime grafted onto an acrylic substrate, which was later replaced by polyethylene because of its increased durability and lower cost. The review shows that capacity, in grams of U per kilogram of adsorbent, is a strong driver of cost along with reusability of the adsorbent. The most recent estimates reviewed are seen to place the U production cost at $400-$1000/kg of U, several times higher than the 2014 spot market price, which has remained near or below $100/kg of U.

J,"Orlov, A",,,,"Orlov, Anton",,,An assessment of optimal gas pricing in Russia: A CGE approach,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Russia; CGE model; Administrative price regulation; Optimal gas pricing,EUROPEAN SECURITY; MARKET; MODEL,"Domestic gas prices in Russia are administratively regulated, and they are substantially lower than export netback prices. The administrative price regulation operates as an implicit subsidy on domestic gas consumption. The Russian government aims to liberalise domestic wholesale gas prices in the long term. While the export netback parity is defined as a political objective, it seems not to be a necessary target anymore. The export netback parity is not economically rational for Russia because the average export netback price of gas is higher than the marginal cost due to Gazprom's market power in export gas markets. An optimal domestic gas price is still not well-defined. This paper addresses this question by employing a comparative static, single-country, multi-sector Computable Generation Equilibrium model (CGE). The administrative regulation of domestic gas prices is explicitly modelled. The main findings are as follows. An increase in the domestic gas price provides economic efficiency gains: the more elastic the export and domestic demand for gas, the larger the welfare gains. The optimal domestic gas price should be approximately 55% of the export netback price. Increasing the domestic gas price provides additional government revenues, which can be used to reduce distortionary taxes. On sectoral effects, the structure of the Russian economy shifts from energy toward non-energy intensive sectors in response to an increase in the domestic gas price. There is an increase in the export supply of gas. Furthermore, an increase in the domestic gas price leads to a reduction in total CO2 emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper focuses on analyzing the sources-of production inefficiency and productivity growth in China. Here, a developed slacks-based measure is utilized to decompose production inefficiency into three components: input inefficiency, economic output inefficiency, and environmental inefficiency. Furthermore, by applying a method based on global data envelopment analysis, we take a further step to analyze the key factors responsible for the change of environmental productivity during 2003-2011 from the point of view of technical progress, productive scale, and management level. The results show that, redundancy in energy and labor inputs, and excessive emission of sulfur dioxide, chemical oxygen demand, and ammonia nitrogen, are the main sources of production inefficiency in China. During the sample period, the efficiency in all inputs and environmental emissions has improved (except for capital input efficiency, which had a decreasing trend). Further analysis shows that the overall environmental productivity in China has begun to follow an ascending path. Technical progress is the most powerful contributor to China's productivity growth, while the decreases in scale and management efficiency are the two main obstacles preventing productivity improvement.

The income-expenditure equilibrium takes both the behavioural relationships of the saving and investment into consideration. The empirical results of cointegration tests show that the US fiscal balance, current account balance, real income and interest rates (short- and long-run) are co-movement for the observed periods between 1970Q2 and 2011Q4. Also, the causality tests suggest that budget deficit does indirectly Granger-cause current account deficit via short-run interest rate and real income. The real income and interest rates variables determining the behavioural relationships are important in understanding the US twin deficit slogan. In short, the empirical results validate the twin deficits hypothesis in the USA. Some policy implications have been drawn, especially on the implementation of the fiscal cliff policy. This study also recommends portfolio balance approach for future twin deficits research.","Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tang, TC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",tangtuckcheong@um.edu.my,"Tang, Tuck Cheong/H-6636-2014","Tang, Tuck Cheong/0000-0001-7978-0684",,,,,39,6,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

We build a general equilibrium model, endogenizing bilateral migration and income disparities between and within countries. Our calibration strategy uses data on effective and potential migration to identify total migration costs and visa costs by education level. Data on potential migration reveal that the number of people in the world who have a desire to migrate is around 400 million. This number is much smaller than that predicted in previous studies, and reflects the existence of high incompressible migration costs. In our benchmark framework, liberalizing migration increases the world GDP by 11.5-12.5 percent in the medium term.

However, our iterative procedure points out that the cause of this result has to be ascribed to small firms which are characterized by thin cash money holdings and a consequent very modest opportunity cost.","[Ganugi, Piero] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Piacenza, Italy; [Grossi, Luigi] Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Ianulardo, Giancarlo] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Exeter, Devon, England",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Verona; University of Exeter,"Grossi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Artigliere 19, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",luigi.grossi@univr.it,"GROSSI, Luigi/HOH-7776-2023","GROSSI, Luigi/0000-0003-3671-7348; Ianulardo, Giancarlo/0000-0002-2286-4817; Ganugi, Piero/0000-0002-5425-0342",,,,,27,0,0,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The assessment is based on a statistical analysis of videotaped classroom observations of 51,329 teachers. The classroom environment was found to have a significant influence on students' performance. More specifically, the teacher's ability to handle the class as a group is consistently more significant than other measures of class environment. It was also founds that the overall school environment is a better predictor of students' test results than the environment in the classrooms of the students whose test results are being reported. This suggests that the most effective course of action would be to improve the overall school environment, although individual teachers have less control over this factor.","[Gazmuri, Carolina] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Manzi, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Paredes, Ricardo D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Gazmuri, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cgazmurib@gmail.com; jmanzi@uc.cl; rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Paredes, Ricardo D/M-1653-2013",,National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) [CIE-01]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) [1140980],National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),The authors are grateful for the comments provided by an anonymous referee and for the funding provided by the CIE-01 Project of the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) and Project 1140980 of the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT).,,35,1,2,0,9,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2015,,115,,,,,101,114,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CO9NA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359501300006,0

In particular, the low level of investment, the reduction in public spending in the 1980s and its partial recovery along with private investment between 2003 and 2010 are explored. It is found that the increase in national income-on the back of rising terms of trade-made it possible to increase national saving and its contribution to financing investment between 2004 and 2008.

The adopted bootstrap approach enables us to conduct statistical inferences regarding scale efficiency estimates of individual banks. We visualize bootstrapped results using an efficiency matrix to present the results of confidence intervals of pure technical and scale efficiency estimates. This novel approach facilitates efficiency comparison across the chosen sample banks for which consistent input and output data were available. This paper provides a useful benchmarking framework for individual banks to assess and identify their likely sources of technical inefficiency. The empirical results reveal that the global financial crisis had an adverse effect on the pure technical efficiency of Australian banks. In addition, the bootstrapped results indicate that small banks mostly operate in the region of increasing returns to scale while medium-sized banks are scale efficient. The results support the view that only smaller banks can enhance their efficiency from possible future mergers with other smaller-medium size banks. Any mergers involving the Big 4 banks are likely to lower the overall efficiency of the banking system and lead to anti-competitive behavior. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although R&D efficiency is often considered a key factor to improve the performance of firms in an industry, we demonstrate that this standard view does not always hold in a trade model involving a monopoly transporter. In a one-way duopoly case, an exporter competes with a local firm in the local market but must pay a transport charge to the monopoly transporter to carry its product. We show that higher R&D efficiency may reduce the investments of an exporter. We further investigate a case of two-way trade comprising two symmetric countries.

Yet it is generally taken for granted that ratings play a significant role in the transnationalization of financial relations. This paper tests that hypothesis with data on sovereign credit ratings and foreign portfolio investment. A rating-related gravity model of finance is derived from the choice-theoretical framework of Okawa and van Wincoop (Gravity in International Finance, 2012) and estimated in three stages. At the first stage, the authors find that the introduction and evolution of sovereign ratings since the 1970s has affected inward portfolio investment in host countries. At the second stage, they examine to which extent sovereign ratings help to predict the degree of investors' home bias, and whether they can account for the divergent dynamics before and after the global financial crisis. At the third stage, the authors look at the explanatory content of ratings for the determination of the size of bilateral portfolio investment. Evidence for a significant role of sovereign ratings is found at all three stages.","[Koerner, Finn Marten] FSI Assurance, Deloitte, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Koerner, Finn Marten; Trautwein, Hans-Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, ZenTra Ctr Transnatl Studies, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Körner, FM (通讯作者)，FSI Assurance, Deloitte, Dusseldorf, Germany.",koerner@zen-tra.de; trautwein@zen-tra.de,"Körner, Finn Marten/D-3335-2015","Körner, Finn Marten/0000-0003-3889-265X",,,,,39,2,2,0,12,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 25,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,20159.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-9,0.0,,,54,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4BM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356897600001,0

The transmission of shocks is analysed for each risk-neutral moment using a vector autoregression model where each market is represented by one equation. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions are recovered and analysed. Our contribution is to document the transmission of shocks measured through investor anticipations in both markets. Our results suggest the transmission of shocks measured through investor anticipations is different under the risk-neutral measure than under the physical measure previously studied in the literature. Shocks to equity market RNV and skewness are transmitted to oil RNVand skewness while the reverse is not observed. However, shocks to risk-neutral kurtosis in one market do not affect the other market.

Using annual data for 34 countries from 1961 to 2009, we find a negative impact of climate change on economic growth. Our results show that a 1 degrees C increase in temperature reduces gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 0.67 percentage point. Evidence from sensitivity analysis shows the two largest economies in the Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria and South Africa) play a significant role in ameliorating the negative economic impact of climate change in the region. In addition to impact on Africa, this article provides estimates of the impact of climate change on GDP growth of these 34 countries, which can be valuable in appraising national adaptation plans.

To gain entry, a firm must pay a bribe-maximizing official a fixed percentage of anticipated profit, in addition to the usual set-up cost. This would lead to a monopoly, but only in markets without pre-existing or shadow-economy firms. A benevolent social planner may preempt the harmful effects of corruption by either manipulating the number of pre-existing firms in the market, or by setting up two independent (corrupt) licensing authorities. A socially optimal number of firms in the market may be reached by choosing the right number of pre-existing firms or by having exactly two licensing authorities. These mechanisms may be seen as restoring second-best efficiency in settings characterized by two major sources of distortion: Imperfect competition and corruption. We also show in an extension that the basic insights carry over in a qualitative sense to a model with quadratic costs and first best entry regulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

People segregate along the lines of income, religion, ethnicity, language, and other characteristics. This study provides the first experimental examination of decentralized matching with search frictions and institutionalized segregation. The findings indicate that, without a segregation institution, high types over-segregate relative to the equilibrium prediction. We observe segregation attempts even when equilibrium suggests that everyone should accept everyone else. In the presence of a segregation institution, we find that, while the symmetric segregation institution increases matching success rate and efficiency in one environment, it has weak or no effect in a steep-incentive environment. By adding an entry cost to a flat-incentive market however, the asymmetric segregation institution leads to an increased matching success rate and efficiency in both environments, which underscores the importance of a coordination device.

Since Veblen's era, the capitalist social provisioning process has evolved toward money manager capitalism in a dialectical fashion. At the heart of the transformation are changes in the behavior of the business enterprise. In this paper, we make a threefold argument. First, while the going concern theory of the business enterprise is still important in the account of the economy as a continuing process of social provisioning, since a viable economy requires continuing business over historical time, more and more of the economy is being directed toward financial concerns. Second, as a consequence, the social provisioning process becomes more unstable and people's welfare becomes more vulnerable. Third, the concept of a going concern is, therefore, to be modified in order to put the business enterprise in the context of money manager capitalism.","[Jo, Tae-Hee] SUNY Buffalo, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Henry, John F.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Econ, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Jo, TH (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Econ & Finance Dept, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,"Jo, Tae-Hee/A-7828-2018","Jo, Tae-Hee/0000-0002-0242-024X",,,,,58,24,27,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Frequently the analysis is done for settings in which the number of commodities, countries, and/or factors of production is assumed to be rather small. For example, the classic Ricardian model making use of the concept of comparative advantage based on comparisons of efficient ratios of country productivities has solutions that hold for any number of countries or commodities. A number of different issues, such as stability conditions and the transfer problem, are discussed in which surprising equilibrium outcomes possible in a general situation can be understood more easily in a small-scale setting.","Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Jones, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",ronald.jones@rochester.edu,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We reconsider the issue here in the context of an exogenous money supply rule, documenting the role of nominal and real frictions in determining these results. A general conclusion is that frictions matter for stability insofar as they redistribute income between Ricardian and non-Ricardian households when shocks hit the economy. Finally, we extend the model to allow for the possibility that consumers who do not participate in the market for interest-bearing securities hold money. In this case, endogenous monetary transfers between the two groups make it possible to smooth consumption differences, and the model is determinate, provided that the non-negativity constraint on individual money holdings is satisfied.","[Motta, Giorgio] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Tirelli, Patrizio] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",Lancaster University; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Motta, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",g.motta@lancaster.ac.uk,"Tirelli, Patrizio/AAM-3422-2020","Motta, Giorgio/0000-0002-7518-5252; tirelli, patrizio/0000-0002-0171-8861",,,,,23,6,7,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

I argue that Boulding has undersold his true contributions to evolutionary economics by trying to embed them into the ecological approach. I endeavor to overcome this discrepancy by differentiating between two types of evolutionary change analyzed in Boulding's writings: ecological change and civilizational change. In contrast to ecological change, civilizational change entails the possibility for the evolving system to overstrain the carrying capacity of the environment, thus suggesting the precarious relationship between civilizational complexity and sustainability. This argument sheds new light on Boulding's theory of social organizers, such as exchange, threat, and the integrative system. Boulding's understanding of civilizational change envisages the key role of threat and exchange in enabling civilizational complexity, while the integrative system is called upon to make this complexity sustainable.",,,,,"Valentinov, Vladislav/V-2932-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),This research is supported by the Volkswagen Foundation.,,58,16,20,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We find that remittances significantly increase the probability that families enroll their children in primary and secondary schools, suggesting that remittances increase education human capital formation. The impact of remittances on the probability of primary and secondary school enrollment is particularly strong for international remittance.

Two models with and without default option in sovereign borrowings replicate the contrasting cyclical behaviors indicating that the default option is responsible for procyclical fiscal policy. Further, augmented model with third-party bailouts, together with the stochastic trend income process, successfully predicts high volatilities of fiscal expenditures. These imply that procyclical fiscal policy, entailed by default option, may exacerbate the business cycle in emerging market countries.","Seton Hall Univ, Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA",Seton Hall University,"Suzuki, Y (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",yui.suzuki@shu.edu,,,,,,,24,3,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Because of the complexity of economic data, econometricians heavily rely on asymptotic theory when making statistical inferences. However, the use of asymptotic approximations to the distributions of test statistics and estimators is not always successful. This paper illustrates the use of the Kullback-Leibler information (KLI) measure to assess the relative quality of two asymptotic approximations to an unknown distribution from which we can obtain simple random drawings. The illustration involves comparing the large-sample and small-disturbance asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis of at statistic from the dynamic linear regression model. We find convincing evidence in favour of the use of p values and critical values from the small-disturbance Student's t distribution, rather than from the large-sample standard normal distribution, in this case. This simple KLI measure has considerable potential. For example, it can guide us to conditions under which asymptotic approximations are reasonable and to circumstances when it may be inappropriate to rely totally on asymptotic approximations.

Our model matches the main stylized facts on informality for developing countries and appears to be a good candidate for policy analysis. In this framework, we study the impact on informality, wages and unemployment of policies that may be used to reduce informality. We consider changes in product market regulation (PMR) and in two types of fiscal policies, labor taxes and formality enforcement. We find that lessening PMR decreases informality and unemployment simultaneously, indicating that there is not necessarily a tradeoff between informality and unemployment. The tradeoff appears when fiscal policies are used, though. Moreover, the impacts of PMR on unemployment and on wages are larger under collective than individual bargaining. With respect to wage inequality, lessening PMR reduces it, while lower taxes tend to increase the formal sector wage premium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Existence of multiple self-fulfilling stereotypes, which can generate statistical discrimination, is more likely if there is less variance in the ability distribution. A low endogenously correct stereotype about a group forces higher-ability group members to choose a higher-productivity and a higher separating signal, thereby engaging in counter-stereotypical behaviour. This counter-stereotypical behaviour causes the remaining partially pooling group to have lower average productivity, reinforcing the negative stereotype. The co-existence of stereotype threat and counter-stereotypical behaviour can explain the simultaneity of lower wages and higher education attainment in a group facing labour-market discrimination.","Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Chisik, R (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",rchisik@ryerson.ca,,,Office of the Dean of Arts at Ryerson University,Office of the Dean of Arts at Ryerson University,"I am grateful to several anonymous referees and the many helpful seminar participants at Ryerson University, the Canadian Economic Association 2012 meetings and the Atlantic Canada Economic Association 2013 meetings for their useful comments and suggestions.

Empirical results from Bayesian estimation show that, the degree of China's monetary policy transparency is quite low. This conclusion is further confirmed by the actual practice of China's monetary policy in many aspects. From a policy perspective, a two-step monetary policy reform should be adopted by China while it moves toward a market-based macroeconomic framework. First, the independence of the central bank should be strengthened and an explicit inflation targeting regime should be adopted to make inflation under control. Second, a series of institutional arrangements should be established to increase monetary policy transparency in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We test the forecasting ability of the proposed model against a Random Walk (RW), a Bayesian Autoregressive and a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive model. The proposed methodology outperforms all the competing models with half the error of the RW model with and without drift in out-of-sample forecasting. Finally, we argue that this new methodology can be used as an early warning system for forecasting sudden house price drops with direct policy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It explores two competing hypotheses derived from international economics and business studies that (i) it is beneficial to be a specialist supplier and focus on a related set of competencies and (ii) it is beneficial to be a system integrator and assemble a broad set of competencies. It makes use of a unique and especially rich data set that includes close to 250 competency variables. These competency variables are used to compute entropy scores for the defence contractors, which again are used in in a fractional logit model to test the two hypotheses. The article concludes that the data only support the second hypothesis - that it is favourable to be a systems integrator.","[Fevolden, Arne Martin; Herstad, Sverre J.; Sandven, Tore] Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ NIFU, NO-0302 Oslo, Norway",,"Fevolden, AM (通讯作者)，Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ NIFU, NO-0302 Oslo, Norway.",arne.fevolden@nifu.no,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Simulation results provide evidence that this ratio depends inversely on the level of data aggregation and can therefore not be a good indicator of the speed of convergence of an economy to its equilibrium path. We show that this is consistent with findings based on actual input-output tables of EU member states.

First, the concept of similarity degree (SD) for two intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy decision matrixes is defined, which measures the level of consensus between individual decision opinion and group decision opinion. Next, we develop some IITFOWA operators to aggregate intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy decision matrixes in MAGDM problems. In particular, we present the SD induced IITFOWA (SD-IITFOWA) operator, which induces the order of argument values by utilizing the similarity degree of decision makers. This operator aggregates individual opinion in such a way that more importance is placed on the most similarity one. Then, a SD-IITFOWA operator and TOPSIS method based approach is developed to solve the MAGDM problems with intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.

We conjecture in this paper that the weak IPR-growth evidence in previous studies may be due to a neglect of the role of finance markets and private property rights. Our conjecture is motivated by the recent law-and-finance literature. We test our conjecture with a cross-section of 98 countries and find that once we modify our measure of IPRs to take into account general property rights, there is stronger evidence for a positive relationship between IPRs and economic growth. Our findings not only help explain the IPR-innovation puzzle but also have significant theoretical as well as policy implications.","[Zhang, Jihong] Taiyuan Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Intellectual Property Law, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [Du, Ding] No Arizona Univ, WA Franke Coll Business, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Park, Walter G.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Taiyuan University of Science & Technology; Northern Arizona University; American University,"Du, D (通讯作者)，No Arizona Univ, WA Franke Coll Business, POB 15066, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",ding.du@nau.edu,,,ShanXi Science and Technology Department [2013041028-02]; Taiyuan University of Science and Technology [W20122002]; ShanXi Law Society [SXLS(2013)B19],ShanXi Science and Technology Department; Taiyuan University of Science and Technology; ShanXi Law Society,"The authors sincerely thank Editor in Chief Kap-Young Jeong and two anonymous referees for their valuable and insightful comments.

Shortly after, the US began to experience its most severe recession in seventy years, and while personal bankruptcy rates rose, they rose only modestly given the severity of the rise in unemployment. By contrast, informal default through delinquency rose sharply. In the subsequent recovery, households have been widely viewed as deleveraging (Mian and Sufi, 2010; Eggertson and Krugman, 2012) via the largest reduction of unsecured debt seen in the past three decades. We measure the relative roles of recent bankruptcy reform and labor market risk in accounting for consumer debt and default over the Great Recession. Our results suggest that bankruptcy reform likely prevented a substantial increase in formal bankruptcy filings, but had only limited effect on informal default from delinquencies, and that changes in job-finding rates were central to both.

Discretionary policy should respond to information available to the policy maker at the time (real-time data), whereas automatic fiscal policy should respond to the true state of the economy at the time (proxied by the final data). We find that the intended discretionary response of fiscal policy to the cycle is counter-cyclical. Our estimates suggest that the automatic stabilizers are at the lower end of the range found in the related literature. This new methodology reduces the risk present in the conventional CAB approach that part of the discretionary actions may be wrongly attributed to automatic stabilizers. In that sense, automatic stabilizers are typically not as strong as usually claimed.

In an introductive and theoretical part, attention is devoted to analysing opinions on motivation, motivating, and decision making. The motivation is understood as a dynamic phenomenon, full of many facts, positive and negative, subjective and objective, constant (static, invariable) and variable (changing dynamically). The decision making is understood as a process of postulating decision-making premises, conditions, restrictions and defining criteria, non-compromising consideration of positives, negatives, possibilities and impossibilities, chances and obstacles of every accepted solution, and determining the `best' methods of achieving the `best' solution. In the methodology part of paper, the most interesting result of testing assumption about the multi-criteria content and multiplicative effect in decision making, applied in motivating employees, are presented. This searching is done on the basis of our questionnaire survey performed on the sample of 1,946 respondents in the turn of 2012/2013. The assumption about the multi-criteria content and multiplicative effect in decision making applied in motivating employees was confirmed. In the application part, acquired results and used inspirational opinions of several other authors formed the basis for creation of verbal and graphical model of motivational decision making, or the model of motivating perceived with regard to the decision making process. The model characterises motivational decision-making as multi-content and multi-criteria process able to bring qualitative multiplications and synergies.","[Blaskova, Martina; Bizik, Michal; Jankal, Radoslav] Univ Zilina, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Blaskova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",blaskova@fri.uniza.sk,"Blašková, Martina/ABF-3732-2021; Blaskova, Martina/AAH-6338-2020; Jankal, Radoslav/P-1044-2016; Blaskova, Martina/I-4527-2018","Jankal, Radoslav/0000-0001-6447-1651; Blaskova, Martina/0000-0003-2760-9724","Scientific Grant Agency of Education Ministry of Slovak Republic, grant VEGA [1/0890/14]","Scientific Grant Agency of Education Ministry of Slovak Republic, grant VEGA","Paper is a result and it has been supported by Scientific Grant Agency of Education Ministry of Slovak Republic, grant VEGA No 1/0890/14 Stochastic Modelling of Decision Making Processes in Motivating Human Potential.",,81,11,14,2,35,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We review the economic arguments for restructuring and the resulting effects in subsequent years. Weargue that the greatest political motivation for restructuring was rent shifting, not efficiency improvements. Although electricity restructuring has brought efficiency improvements, it has generally been viewed as a disappointment because the price-reduction promises made by some advocates were based on politically unsustainable rent transfers. In reality, electricity rate changes since restructuring have been driven more by exogenous factors, such as generation technology advances and natural gas price fluctuations, than by restructuring. We argue that a similar dynamic underpins the current political momentum behind distributed generation, primarily rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, which remains costly from a societal viewpoint, but privately economic owing to the rent transfers it enables.","[Borenstein, Severin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Borenstein, Severin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy Inst Haas, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bushnell, James] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Borenstein, Severin; Bushnell, James] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Borenstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",severinborenstein@berkeley.edu; jbbushnell@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,55,138,167,2,33,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4607-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The connection between real exchange rates and growth remains, however, an unsettled question in the academic literature. We fill this gap by providing an empirical assessment based on a broad sample of emerging and advanced economies. We assess the impact of appreciations, productivity booms and capital inflows surges using a propensity score matching approach to address causality issues. Appreciations associated with higher productivity have a larger impact on growth than those associated with capital inflows. Furthermore, appreciations per se tend to have a negative impact on growth. We provide a simple theoretical model that delivers a contrasted growth-appreciation pattern depending on the underlying shock. The model also implies adverse effects of shocks to international capital flows, so concerns about an appreciation are not inconsistent with concerns about a depreciation. While the presence of an externality through firms' destruction leads to inefficient allocations, addressing the inefficiency does not dampen exchange rate movements.","[Bussiere, Matthieu; Lopez, Claude; Tille, Cedric] Banque France, Paris, France; [Bussiere, Matthieu; Lopez, Claude; Tille, Cedric] Milken Inst, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Bussiere, Matthieu; Lopez, Claude; Tille, Cedric] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Bussière, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,27,20,21,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Neither then nor up to now has there been sufficient recognition of the key role played by military expenditures in this dynamic process. These enormous outlays at times accounted for as much as 25 percent of gross domestic productincluding their induced multiplier effects. This article examines the origins of what has been termed military Keynesianism during the Golden Age, emphasizing the little-known leading role played by Leon Keyserling. Keyserling exercised behind-the-scenes power in order to convert Keynesian theory into a macroeconomic policy that would be both consistent with the U.S. institutional context and sufficiently large to promote long-term conditions for full employment. With a degree of audacity, at a historically opportune moment given the socioeconomic resonance of the foundational document known as NSC-68 promulgated by the state within the statethe National Security StateKeyserling successfully challenged the fallacious neoclassical law of guns or butter.","[Cypher, James M.] Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, PhD Program Dev Studies UAED, Zacatecas, Mexico; [Cypher, James M.] Binzagr Inst, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas,"Cypher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, PhD Program Dev Studies UAED, Zacatecas, Mexico.",,,,,,,,77,10,11,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We take comprehensive population census data to construct birth cohorts of individuals and compare those born and living in the years and villages affected by locust plagues with other cohorts. We find a clear, strong impact on the educational outcomes of children living in rural areas, but no impact at all on children living in urban areas. School enrolment by boys born or less than four at the time of shock is found to be affected. School enrolment by boys born in 1987-88, the main infestation years, is found to be hardest hit by the plagues. However, although the impact on school enrolment figures is greater for boys than girls, the educational attainments of girls attending school and living in rural areas are harder hit than the boys. Our controls for individuals' potentially selective migration behaviour and for differences in school infrastructures do nothing to change our results. Our findings are also robust to controls for age misreporting and variations in the cohort cut-off point.","[De Vreyer, Philippe; Guilbert, Nathalie; Mesple-Somps, Sandrine] Univ Paris 09, PSL, LEDa, DIAL UMR 225, F-75016 Paris, France; [De Vreyer, Philippe; Guilbert, Nathalie; Mesple-Somps, Sandrine] IRD, LEDa, DIAL UMR 225, F-75010 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Guilbert, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Econ, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France.",nathalie_guilbert@hotmail.com,"De Vreyer, Philippe/GVT-5605-2022",,,,,,34,23,26,4,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We find that men exhibit not only more trusting behaviour, but also more reciprocating behaviour than women. Moreover, our results are indicative of age-dependent gender differences.

The model shows that the impact of any skill-biased technical change on wage inequality is tightly related to the distribution of skills in the population. When the supply of skills is endogenous, productivity effects can be overestimated or underestimated by wage data, and Johnson's () distinction between intensive and extensive technical change is impossible.","[Dupuy, Arnaud] Maastricht Sch Management, CEPS, INSTEAD, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Dupuy, Arnaud] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Dupuy, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Sch Management, CEPS, INSTEAD, Maastricht, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2015,82.0,325,,,,,24,45,,10.1111/ecca.12071,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AX1IN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346701100002,0

However, many organizations face significant challenges in promoting effective information and knowledge sharing among employees and there is little evidence-based guidance from empirical research studies. Information and knowledge-sharing interactions are embedded in multifaceted social contexts, influenced by several different social and cognitive (human) factors. A better grasp of these complex factors is needed to help organizations build on past experiences, respond more efficiently to emerging problems, develop new ideas and insights, and avoid reinventing solutions or repeating prior mistakes. This paper extends the findings of a large empirical study of organizational knowledge sharing, which examined the interplay of several notable social and cognitive factors, including trust, shared language, shared vision, tie strength, homophily, and relationship length. Initial data analysis examined the direct, relative, and collective effects of social and cognitive factors on organizational knowledge sharing factors (Evans, 2012). The results showed co-worker trust as having the strongest statistical influence on each factor used to operationalize organizational knowledge sharing: willingness to share knowledge, willingness to use knowledge, and perceived receipt of useful information/knowledge (Evans, 2013). This paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis, which examines whether perceived trustworthiness in co-workers acts as a mediating variable between the previously mentioned social/cognitive variables and knowledge sharing factors. Data were collected from 275 knowledge workers (legal professionals and paralegals) engaged in shared legal project work, at one of Canada's largest multijurisdictional law firms. The nature of their work required a significant reliance on co-workers, across offices nationwide, for both explicit and tacit knowledge. The nature of projects allowed respondents to objectively evaluate the outcomes, gaining a better sense of the perceived effects of knowledge shared. A method outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986), which includes hierarchical multiple regression analysis, was used to test for the mediating effect of trust. This study is one of only few to measure the role trust plays in mediating the relationship between different social/cognitive factors and knowledge sharing. Previous studies have examined this effect with far fewer factors, or with a much less inclusive conceptualization of knowledge sharing. The results show that, when perceived trustworthiness was high in the referent co-worker, there was less need for the respondent and the co-worker to have a shared vision. Alternatively, when there was less trust between co-workers, shared vision was required for them to participate in effective knowledge sharing.

On average, economists report to be highly happy with life. Satisfaction is positively related to spending more time on doing research. The lack of a tenured position decreases satisfaction. However, the extent to which the uncertainty created by the tenure system affects satisfaction varies with the contract terms. The effect is stronger if the contract expires in the near future or cannot be extended. Publication success has no effect if it is controlled for academic rank and the contract duration. The finding suggests that publications are rather a means to an end, for example, to acquire a tenured position. While the perceived level of external pressure also has no impact, the perceived change of pressure in recent years is positively related to economists' life satisfaction. An explanation is that economists have accepted a high level of pressure when entering academia but are not willing to cope with the recent increase.","[Feld, Lars P.; Necker, Sarah] Walter Eucken Inst, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany; [Feld, Lars P.; Necker, Sarah] Univ Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Frey, Bruno S.] Zeppelin Univ, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Frey, Bruno S.] CREMA, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Freiburg; Zeppelin University,"Necker, S (通讯作者)，Walter Eucken Inst, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",sarah.necker@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,"Frey, Bruno/AAW-9103-2021",,,,,,44,4,4,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, research in the field of knowledge management and intellectual capital exclusively focuses on intra-firm processes. This sets the background of previous literature, from which emerges a lack of integrative research examining the creation and management of intangible assets both within and beyond a firm's boundaries. This paper responds to calls for the development of academic contributions adopting micro-foundations perspectives. Its purpose is twofold: first, it aims to provide a first representation of the extent and level to which a firm's intangible knowledge assets are grounded in micro-foundational phenomena. Based on the knowledge-based view of the firm and existing research on firm level capabilities emerging from routines, a new framework is proposed, encompassing individuals' interactions, behaviors, skills and abilities. Second, it proposes to use organizational routines as well as strategic management research literature to explore, review, and develop micro-foundational opportunities and application perspectives for current and future intellectual capital management research. Empirical observations in a case company are used to illustrate the expression of routines in relation to organizational processes and individual level mechanisms. This article embraces micro-level challenges and issues, thus attempting to advance knowledge management research through a new theoretical lens. In this regard, the development of a conceptual framework encompassing micro-level dynamics, routines and knowledge processes allows to address operational implications for human capital researchers and practitioners. The analysis of the role of individuals in a micro-foundational perspective, enables to enhance and enrich current understanding of routines related knowledge mechanisms (i.e. knowledge acquisition and management), and, more specifically, aims to enhance professionals' ability to shape, adopt, and adapt relevant managerial practices.","[Frances, Johanna] Telecom Ecole Management, Grenoble, France; [Sindakis, Stavros; Depeige, Audrey] Bangkok Univ, IKI SEA, Bangkok, Thailand",Bangkok University,"Frances, J (通讯作者)，Telecom Ecole Management, Grenoble, France.",johanna.frances@yahoo.fr; audrey.depe@bumail.net; stavros.s@bu.ac.th,"D., Audrey/K-4859-2013; Sindakis, Stavros/GYV-0981-2022; Sindakis, Stavros/D-2296-2012","D., Audrey/0000-0002-7469-2551; Sindakis, Stavros/0000-0002-3542-364X",,,,,36,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,106,113,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600013,0

Our working hypothesis is that the Fed's movement toward greater transparency starting in the mid-1990s likely affected both the distribution of forecast errors and the location of the Fed's staff forecasts within that distribution. This paper builds on earlier work which compared Fed forecasts to the mean or median of private sector forecasts by examining the entire distribution of forecasts. By examining the entire distribution we are able to compare the forecasting record of particular forecasters against a record comprised of randomly assigned forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Since the Fed's move toward greater transparency beginning in 1994, its forecasting record is no longer significantly better than the forecasting record comprised of randomly assigned forecasts.

I apply these results to determine the optimal size of a self-organized partnership, and to study the manager's problem who recruits agents to carry out a project, and must determine the team size and its members' incentive contracts.

While the approach has been almost completely replaced in contemporary industrial economics by the so-called Post-Chicago view, Chicago arguments still permeate antitrust case law at all judicial levels. Chicago's rise to dominance was allegedly due to the superiority of its economic analysis. Why did the Post-Chicago approach, which is supposed to have a clear analytical edge, fail to do the same? The paper offers a series of explanations: though none is completely exhaustive, each may account for a bit of the story. More generally, the current situation of antitrust case law offers valuable methodological insight on themes such as how economists persuade (i.e., how economic arguments come to be accepted and applied by policy- or law-makers) or the impact of the different professional practices in the diffusion of economic ideas.","[Giocoli, Nicola] Univ Pisa, Dept Law, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Giocoli, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Law, Pisa, Italy.",nicola.giocoli@unipi.it,"Giocoli, Nicola/ABB-5506-2020","Giocoli, Nicola/0000-0002-0655-7884",INET - Institute for New Economic [INO1200015/033],INET - Institute for New Economic,The financial support of INET - Institute for New Economic Thinking Grant 'Free from what?

Under this framework we can disentangle the reaction of foreign exchange market to bad or good news and small or large news of stock returns. Our comprehensive daily data-set spans the period from January 1990 to June 2014. Using a cointegration and error correction model, we document the existence of a causal relationship between stock market and foreign exchange markets. Most interestingly, our results derived from the asymmetric threshold model confirm that the relationship between stock and foreign exchange markets is sensitive to short-term good or bad news and short-term small or large news. Our findings entail significant implications for policymakers, governments, risk managers and international investors.","[Koulakiotis, Athanasios; Kiohos, Apostolis] Univ Macedonia, Dept Int & European Studies, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Babalos, Vassilios] Technol Educ Inst Peloponnese, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kalamata, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Babalos, V (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Peloponnese, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kalamata, Greece.",vbabalos@teikal.gr,,"BABALOS, VASSILIOS/0000-0002-2633-7985",,,,,37,19,20,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article examines the spillover effects of television advertising on brand-level consumer demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), including private labels, using a random coefficients logit model with household purchasing and advertising viewing Nielsen data. As in previous work, we find that although brand spillover effects significantly increase demand for CSD brands in the same company and undermine demand facing other manufacturers' CSD brands, surprisingly, there are positive spillover effects on the demand for private label brands. This indicates that brand advertising is persuasive with respect to manufacturers' brands but complementary with respect to private labels. Further results show that eliminating television advertising for CSDs would lower aggregate CSD sales as consumers migrate to other beverages, although private labels stand to gain, particularly Wal-Mart brands.","[Lopez, Rigoberto A.; Liu, Yizao] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Zhu, Chen] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",University of Connecticut; China Agricultural University,"Lopez, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Rigoberto.Lopez@uconn.edu,"Zhu, Chen/IUQ-1037-2023","Zhu, Chen/0000-0003-3582-9022","USDA-NIFA [2010-34178-20766]; Zwick Center for Food and Resource Policy; National Social Science Fund of China [14CjY018]; NIFA [2010-34178-20766, 580836] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Zwick Center for Food and Resource Policy; National Social Science Fund of China; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"We acknowledge funding from USDA-NIFA [grant number 2010-34178-20766], the Zwick Center for Food and Resource Policy and the National Social Science Fund of China [grant number 14CjY018].",,39,13,18,3,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The issue that certain mobility factors might be substitutes was first raised by economists Heckscher and Ohlin and was later picked up several times by other authors in the literature. We assumed that such a debate should be revived and addressed again, especially having in mind growing importance of mobility factors in contemporary economies. Using modern and sophisticated econometric technique such as Granger-causality analysis we studied the case of Spain taking yearly data from 1975 till 2013. The autoregression vector model was used as well as Granger-causality test was employed to provide evidence that such a reciprocal type of relationships between the economic factors subject of our study in reality exist. The results of Granger-causality test have led us to the conclusion that export causes migration and also migration causes export. Results also showed that net migration and international trade are treated as substitutes. Further, we found that not only migration causes higher remittances, which is consistent with an intuitive feel, but also past remittances draw further migration. In terms of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, the enormous growth of migration flows in the contemporary time is explained partly because progressive reduction of costs has increased remittances and has also encouraged the international trade.","[Metelski, Dominik; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Metelski, D (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",dmetelski@correo.ugr.es; amihi@ugr.es,"Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017; Metelski, Dominik/JEZ-3170-2023","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906;",,,,,54,11,11,1,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using a structural demand, we account for home bias in the European car market and compute the counterfactual market shares in the absence of home bias.

This article focuses on the evolution of productivity of Vietnamese banks over the period 2008 to 2012, and on the evolution of the different components of this productivity: technical change, pure technical efficiency and mix and scale efficiency. The methodology draws from very recent developments in index theory in the design of multiplicative-complete economically ideal indexes, using Fare-Primont productivity indexes to measure productivity. This methodology is applied to a balanced panel of Vietnamese banks. The results complement observations usually made on the recent development of the Vietnamese banking system. They show that the State Bank of Vietnam's restructuring policy cannot focus only on either the insufficient size of banks or a better management of these banks in terms of the mix of outputs. Both must be considered simultaneously, not only through bank mergers but also in setting management criteria in line with criteria defined internationally.","[Phuong Anh Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Int Univ, Sch Business, Dept Finance & Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Simioni, Michel] INRA GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Simioni, M (通讯作者)，INRA GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",michel.simioni@tse-fr.eu,"Simioni, Michel/AAQ-4574-2020; Dương (Elyanah), Nguyễn/JEO-4973-2023; Nguyen, Anh/HTO-8740-2023","Anh Thu, Nguyen/0000-0002-1187-0795; Nguyen, Phuong Anh/0000-0002-4260-828X",Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [II 2.2-2012-18]; Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics; Toulouse School of Economics,Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)); Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics; Toulouse School of Economics,"This research was funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [grant number II 2.2-2012-18], and supported by Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics.

Workers are risk averse, so that there exists an incentive for firms to smooth wages.

In this context, it should be noted that extensive support for the processes of a regional innovation system (or strategy) is frequently associated with the use of public funds. To ensure maximum efficiency for the allocation of resources, it is necessary to have a method that is able to analyze regional innovation systems and their level of development. Such a method has not yet been published. The aim of this paper is to use the weighted sum method to evaluate the effects arising from the existence of regional innovation systems as well as to determine their level of development. This is a completely new approach for determining how developed a regional innovation system is in practice. This case study applies this method using four Czech regions.","[Stejskal, Jan; Nekolova, Katerina; Rouag, Abdelwalid] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Stejskal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",jan.stejskal@upce.cz; Abdelwalid.Rouag@upce.cz,"Stejskal, Jan/S-7591-2017","Stejskal, Jan/0000-0003-3015-8274",Czech Science Foundation [13-02836S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The authors thank the anonymous reviewers whose comments and suggestions helped to significantly improve the quality of this resulting paper.

It is shown that long-run growth is not necessarily lower under present-biased preferences. In fact, a strong equivalence result holds. If hyperbolic discounting provides the same present value of a constant infinite income stream as standard exponential discounting, then the equilibrium rate of economic growth is also the same under both discounting methods. In this sense present-bias preferences are harmless for economic growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For fractional cointegrations, asymptotic theories have been extensively studied, and numerous empirical studies have been conducted in finance and economics. But as far as testing for fractional cointegration is concerned, most of the testing procedures have restrictions on the integration orders of observed time series or integrating error and some tests involve determination of bandwidth. In this paper, a general fractional cointegration model with the observed series and the cointegrating error being fractional processes is considered, and a residual-based testing procedure for fractional cointegration is proposed. Under some regularity conditions, the test statistic has an asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no fractional cointegration and diverges under the alternatives. This test procedure is easy to implement and works well in finite samples, as reported in a Monte Carlo experiment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from publicly listed companies in the UAE,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,cost stickiness; employment protection legislation; United Arab Emirates; expatriates,ADJUSTMENT COSTS; BEHAVIOR,"This article measures the degree of adjustment between operating revenues and costs for publicly listed companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Traditional cost models assume that variable costs change proportionally in response to an upward or downward fluctuation in demand. However, in recent years, such an assumption has been questioned by a variety of papers from the economics and accounting fields. Typically, cost stickiness is defined as costs decreasing by less than 1% when sales decrease by 1%, while reacting closer to the proportion of change when sales increase. This study, unlike the vast majority of the literature, did not find cost stickiness in the UAE after using panel data regression analysis. The main explanation is that UAE has mostly expatriate labour force that does not have the typical benefits of employment protection legislation (EPL) available in other national jurisdictions. EPL is a main reason that costs adjustments during decreasing sales is curbed due to the associated costs of firing employees.","[Zanella, Fernando] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Oyelere, Peter] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Accounting, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Hossain, Shahadut] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Stat, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University,"Zanella, F (通讯作者)，United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",f.zanella@uaeu.ac.ae,"Hossain, Shahadut/AAF-1556-2020; Zanella, Fernando/L-7548-2019; Oyelere, Peter/AAZ-4663-2021","Zanella, Fernando/0000-0002-5054-3375; Hossain, Shahadut/0000-0003-3514-4883",,,,,31,15,16,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The estimation results suggest that while the short-term interest rate and the slope of the yield curve have a negative and significant impact on profits in the short run, the effects of these variables turn out to be positive in the long run, as expected. Hence, our findings indicate that monetary policy significantly influences bank profits in Turkey.

The characteristic non-linear price behavior of integrate-and-fire oscillators is supported by empirical data and has a behavioral origin called change-blindness. One advantage of the integrate-and-fire dynamics is that it enables a direct identification of cause and effect in price movements, without the need for statistical tests such as Granger causality tests, often used in the identification of causes of contagion. Our methodology can thereby identify the most relevant nodes with respect to onset of contagion in the network of stock exchanges, as well as identify potential periods of high vulnerability of the network. Over the time period of study, our method is able to identify the importance of the U.K. and U.S. markets as sources for propagation of positive returns, whereas, more surprisingly, the Swiss and some Asian markets (China, South Korea) seem to play a particular role with respect to propagation of downturns across markets. The model is characterized by a separation of time scales, brought about by a slow build-up of stresses, for example, due to (say monthly/yearly) macroeconomic factors, and then a fast (say hourly/daily) release of stresses through price-quakes in price movements across the world's network of stock exchanges.

Based on the derived equilibrium price, this study then proposes formulas to calculate the cost-effective carbon subsidy for HEVs using the Chinese market as the case study. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of gasoline price, vehicle price, interest rate, fuel efficiency and vehicle miles traveled on the equilibrium carbon price and the cost-effective carbon subsidy. The findings show that the PCT scheme reduces Volatility in driving cost and an equilibrium carbon prim determined by the market could be more favorable to achieve total carbon emission control than existing policy instruments, such as carbon tax. Moreover, consumers can be motivated to adopt HEVs once the market price for carbon allowances rises beyond the critical value. In particular, the critical carbon price for an over-emitter to choose a HEV is smaller than that for an under-emitter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a unique data set from a Chinese middle school (grades 7-9), this paper uses a student fixed-effects model to estimate peer effects for four core subjects (Chinese, Math, English, and Science) at the level of the class cohorts studying each subject. We find negative peer effects that are significant from both an economic and a statistical perspective. However, in the subjects taught by head teachers, who have more tools to manage students than do regular teachers, such negative peer effects disappear. Further investigation suggests that head teachers generate positive peer effects that override the negative ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Given the piece rate nature of bonuses in the institute and one's tendency to invest more time in areas where one has comparative advantages to maximize the total income, the study results lead to the conclusion that male professors displayed comparative advantage in research while female professors exhibited comparative advantage in teaching.

It shows that competition for a primary input in short supply changes the mechanism of adaptation and its consequences: If surplus labour exists, differential capacity accumulation effectuates adaptation and leads to a logistic replacement pattern; but if labour is in short supply, 'growth predation' undermines the former mechanism and leads to an exponential replacement pattern. The consequences of the quantitative adjustment mechanisms for aggregate growth are discussed by means of a 'causal analysis', which focuses on the properties of the traverse between two full-employment steady states. The analysis reveals that different types of new methods lead to different adaptation paths and results. Overall, adaptation entails unsteady growth and it is not always the case that the diffusion of a new method boosts aggregate growth.","[Haas, David] Graz Univ, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Univ Str 15 FE, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Haas, D (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Univ Str 15 FE, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",david.haas@uni-graz.at,,,Austrian Science Fund [P24915-G11]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 24915] Funding Source: researchfish; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P24915] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This study was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (P24915-G11).,,28,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Following Imre Lakatos's concept of scientific research programs (SRP), we examine some classifications of economics, specifying the understanding of diversity in light of the axiomatic variations of mainstream economics. This forms the basis for our subsequent description of the development of heterodoxy in Germany, with special reference to the founding of new universities and the reform movements in the 1970s. We show that the heterodox scene flourished in this period, but that this pluralization remained fragmented and short-lived, so that by the 1980s heterodoxy was on its way to becoming marginalized again. The history of heterodoxy in Germany thus presents itself as an unequal battle of the paradigms, and can only be told as a story of failure.","[Heise, Arne] Univ Hamburg, Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Thieme, Sebastian] Cathol Social Acad Austria, Vienna, Austria",University of Hamburg,"Heise, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",,"Heise, Arne/B-7871-2018; Heise, Arne/AAI-4235-2021","Thieme, Sebastian/0009-0007-8795-4315",,,,,85,24,24,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Moreover, the initially strong positive relationship becomes less pronounced with increasing time horizon, thereby indicating that the over- or undervaluation in the short run is gradually corrected in the long run.","[Marczak, Martyna; Beissinger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Schloss 1 C, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Beissinger, Thomas] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University Hohenheim; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Marczak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Schloss 1 C, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",marczak@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Beissinger, Thomas/0000-0002-4126-1624; Marczak, Martyna/0000-0001-9397-2666",,,,,25,8,9,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

It argues that the relation between distribution of income and growth changes over time and proposes an endogenous mechanism that leads to fluctuations between wage- and profit-led periods. The ephemeral character of distribution-led regimes needs to be taken into account when someone estimates empirically the effect of a change in distribution on utilization and growth. The model is a linear version of Good win's predator prey model, but with a reversal of the roles for predator and prey; this is another way to conceptualize the symbiosis between the two classes within a capitalist economy. The aforementioned argument is also examined in relation to the double movement of Karl Polanyi and the inverse U-shaped curve proposed by Simon Kuznets.","[Nikiforos, Michalis] Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, New York, NY 10024 USA",,"Nikiforos, M (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, New York, NY 10024 USA.",,,"Nikiforos, Michalis/0000-0003-1477-7593",,,,,64,14,15,1,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

First, employment of the middle-skill occupation group is negatively affected by a technology shock, while those of high-skill and low-skill groups are positively correlated with it. Second, it is the middle-skill group that experiences the largest decline in employment volatility after the mid-1980s. Last, recessions since the 1980s have heterogeneous impacts on different occupations, defining the characteristics of each recession.

We derive results for alternative specifications of monetary policy rules and alternative values of hiring costs as a percentage of gross domestic product. We find that in general the region of indeterminacy and E-instability in the policy space increases with hiring costs. Thus, higher hiring costs - consistent with European and South African sclerotic labour market institutions - seem to play an important part in explaining inflation and unemployment instability. Moreover, under lagged data-based rules, the area where monetary policy delivers both determinacy and E-stability shrinks. These rules also perform worse according to these two dimensions when hiring costs go up. Finally, under expectations-based rules an additional explosive region is introduced. For South Africa, a rule based on current data - not unlike the original Taylor rule - works better than a forward-looking rule.","[Tesfaselassie, Mewael F.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Schaling, Eric] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Witwatersrand,"Tesfaselassie, MF (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",mewael.tesfaselassie@ifw-kiel.de,"Tesfaselassie, Mewael/AAA-5091-2022",,,,,,14,2,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

I address the importance of generalizability for LFEs that are intended to inform policymaking and in the process, emphasize the complementary role between LFEs and other empirical methods, in particular other experiments.

Key findings are as follows: within the Koizumi cabinet period, a relatively low-income position is negatively related to happiness for non-LDP supporters but not for LDP supporters. However, under the period of the first Abe cabinet, the difference in the effect of relative income for LDP supporters and others disappears.

Despite the known public health hazards of secondhand smoking, smoking bans in casinos remain controversial due to concerns over the potential economic harm to casino firms. Applying an event study, the authors examine the abnormal returns of casino stocks in response to three unexpected smoking ban announcements from 2011 to 2015 in Macao. Their analysis reveals that these announcements were associated with differentiated abnormal returns of casino stocks. Stocks of traditional casinos suffered abnormal losses of 0.58-3%, while the Las Vegas themed casinos enjoyed positive abnormal returns of up to 3%. Furthermore, the authors find that low air quality in gaming venues and high dependence on gaming revenues are associated with abnormal losses, while positive management initiatives are significantly correlated with positive abnormal returns. The findings of this study provide a full picture of the impacts of smoking bans on casinos and thus will be a useful policy references for the Macao government, as well as for the rapidly growing gaming industry in Asia and developing economies elsewhere.","[Zhang, Jing Hua; Tam, Kwo Ping; Zhou, Nan] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, JH (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",jhuzhang@must.edu.mo,"Zhang, Jing Hua/AAJ-1914-2021; Tam, Kwo Ping/ADV-3924-2022","Zhang, Jing Hua/0000-0001-8213-4536; Tam, Kwo Ping/0000-0002-0121-8082",Macao Foundation [0398j],Macao Foundation,"The authors are very grateful to Keith Morrison and Mary E.

Several types of evidence-including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles-indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.","[Baker, Scott R.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Stanford Inst Econ Policy, Kellogg Sch Management, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Chicago Booth Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, Chicago, IL USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Stanford University; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Baker, SR (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Ctr Econ & Policy Res, Stanford Inst Econ Policy, Kellogg Sch Management, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019; Baker, Scott R/HTT-3439-2023","Baker, Scott R/0000-0002-6276-3244",National Science Foundation; MacArthur Foundation; Sloan Foundation; Becker Friedman Institute; Initiative on Global Markets; Stigler Center at the University of Chicago; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MacArthur Foundation; Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Cointegration and Granger causality tests suggest that there are long run relations between these two variables among the OECD economies. While rates of unemployment vary significantly among these economies, rates of inflation have stabilised at lower rates as a result of inflation targeting policies adopted in them during the last two decades. The Phillips curve phenomena are still empirically significant for 28 out of 35 of these OECD economies in country specific regressions; in fixed and random effect panel data models and in a panel VAR model for 1990:1 to 2014:4. Country specific supply curves and Okun curves are consistent to thin Phillips curve relations. Leftward shifts in the Beveridge and Phillips curves require labour market reforms balancing between job creations and destructions. Complementing macro stimulations by microeconomic structural and institutional reforms can bring efficiency in bargaining for wages and employment among firms and workers to make unemployment-inflation trade-offs more significant and relevant in these economies.

A capital good's service can thus be measured directly by the energy consumed in production. We show important empirical advantages of this approximation over traditional measures. The empirical application reveals that this approach avoids a number of conceptual problems of the latter. Furthermore, this measure captures the utilization of the capital stock more accurately as it is more sensitive to fluctuations in economic activity. With a growth accounting exercise, it is shown that the differences between the new and the traditional measures are important for empirical work. Using the new measure yields significantly different results. Especially in times of global recession it provides higher and more feasible total factor productivity growth rates.","[Bitzer, Juergen; Goeren, Erkan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Econ, Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Gören, E (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Campus Haarentor,Bldg A5, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",erkan.goeren@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,28,1,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is empirically investigated how policy funds redistribute their effects among regions with different levels of rurality and economic development according to their degree and form of integration. This analysis is performed by constructing and applying a multiregional Input-Output model at a very high level of geographical disaggregation (NUTS 3 level). Alternative allocation of funds across regions (policy scenarios) are considered in order to assess redistributive impacts of possible CAP reforms. Results show that the impacts generated by the CAP across space do not only depend on the initial allocation of funds but also on intersectoral and interregional linkages. This evidence implies that even a radical reallocation of funds, though it may contribute to reducing regional imbalances, is less redistributive than expected.","[Bonfiglio, A.] CREA Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal, Ctr Polit & Bioecon, Osimo, Italy; [Camaioni, B.] CREA Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal, Ctr Polit & Bioecon, Pescara, Italy; [Coderoni, S.; Esposti, R.; Sotte, F.] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Pagliacci, F.] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ Marco Biagi, Modena, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Marche Polytechnic University; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Esposti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",r.esposti@univpm.it,"Coderoni, Silvia/C-4740-2016; Pagliacci, Francesco/IUO-6756-2023","Coderoni, Silvia/0000-0001-8751-7376; Pagliacci, Francesco/0000-0002-3667-7115; ESPOSTI, Roberto/0000-0002-1656-0331; Bonfiglio, Andrea/0000-0001-5249-1217",European Community [290647],European Community,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no 290647 (Project: WWWforEurope).

J,"Broll, M",,,,"Broll, Michael",,,The skewness risk premium in currency markets,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exchange rates; Skewness; FX risk premium; Sharpe ratio; Currency strategy,HEDGING PRESSURE; CROSS-SECTION; OPTION; PRICES,"This paper examines the relationship between currency option's implied skewness and its future realized skewness, where the difference is known as the skewness risk premium (SRP). The SRP indicates whether investors pay a premium to be insured against future crash risk. Past investigations about implied and realized skewness within currency markets showed that both measures are loosely connected or even exhibit a negative relationship that cannot be rationalized by no-arbitrage arguments. Therefore, this paper studies time-series of future and option contract positions data in order to explain the disconnection in terms of investor's position-induced demand pressure. While demand pressures on options do not sufficiently contribute to the disconnection, there is evidence that, surprisingly, demand pressure in currency future markets have the power to explain this market anomaly. Furthermore, currency momentum also plays an important role, which leads to a strong cyclical demand for OTM calls in rising or OTM puts in declining markets. In order to exploit the disconnection of skewness, a simple skew swap trading strategy proposed by Schneider (2012) has been set up. The resulting skew swap returns are relatively high, but the return distribution is extremely fat-tailed. To appropriately compare different skew swap strategy returns, this paper proposes a Higher Moment Sharpe Ratio that also takes higher moments into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on the role of business cycle conditions and external constraints at the time of reform implementation (or of a credible commitment to it) in shaping the dynamic effects of such policies. Product market reform is modeled as a reduction in entry costs and takes place in a non-traded sector that produces services used as input in manufacturing production. Labor market reform is modeled as a reduction in firing costs and/or unemployment benefits. We find that business cycle conditions at the time of deregulation significantly affect adjustment. A reduction of firing costs entails larger and more persistent adverse short-run effects on employment and output when implemented in a recession. By contrast, a reduction in unemployment benefits boosts employment and output by more in a recession compared to normal times. The impact of product market reforms is less sensitive to business cycle conditions. Credible announcements about future reforms induce sizable short-run dynamics, regardless of whether the announcement takes place in normal times or during an economic downturn. Whether the immediate effect is expansionary or contractionary varies across reforms. Finally, lack of access to international lending in the wake of reform can amplify the costs of adjustment.

We consider a continuous-time multifactor model via a continuous-time multivariate regression model incorporating realistic empirical features, such as persistent stochastic volatilities with leverage effects. We find that the conventional regression approach often leads to misleading and inconsistent test results when applied to high-frequency data. We overcome this by using samples collected at random intervals, which are set by the clock running inversely proportional to the market volatility. Our results show that the conventional pricing factors have difficulty in explaining the cross section of stock returns. In particular, we find that the size factor performs poorly in fitting the size-based portfolios, and the returns on the consumer industry have some explanatory power on the small growth stocks.","[Chang, Yoosoon; Park, Joon Y.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Choi, Yongok] Korea Dev Inst, Dept Financial Policy, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Hwagyun] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Finance, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Park, Joon Y.] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Korea Development Institute (KDI); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Chang, Y (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",yoosoon@indiana.edu; choiyongok@kdi.re.kr; hkim@mays.tamu.edu; joon@indiana.edu,,,NSF [SES-0453069/0730152],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to a co-editor and two anonymous referees for many useful comments.

Our findings show that higher levels of education lead to a more positive reported attitude toward immigrants. We also investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of education on reported attitudes by evaluating both economic and noneconomic channels. We find that higher levels of education place individuals in occupations that are less exposed to the negative effects of migration, although not in sectors/occupations where the share of migrants is necessarily smaller, suggesting that migrants and low-educated natives may be complementary rather than substitutes in the labour market In addition, education alters values and the cognitive assessment of the role of immigration in host societies, with a positive effect on reported attitude toward diversity and on the assessment of immigration's role in host countries. Our findings suggest that education as a policy instrument can increase social cohesion in societies that are subject to large immigration flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We confront the identification problem involved by setting up the FTPL as a structural model for the episode and pitting it against an alternative Orthodox model; the models have a reduced form that is common in form but, because each model is over-identified, numerically distinct. We use indirect inference to test which model could be generating the VECM approximation to the reduced form that we estimate on the data for the episode. Neither model is rejected, though the FTPL model substantially outperforms the Orthodox. But by far the best account of the period assumes that expectations were a probability-weighted combination of the two regimes. Fiscal policy has a substantial role in this weighted model in determining inflation. A similar model accounts for the 1980s but this role of fiscal policy is much diminished. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This robust empirical pattern is confined to the initial years after entry; in line with previous studies, we find that growth rates become independent of size as a cohort matures. Both the initial pattern and the subsequent convergence are consistent with the framework of the passive learning model if young firms adjust their size only slowly to new information, for example due to financing or hiring frictions. Importantly, we focus our analysis on firms that enter de novo, i.e. newly registered firms that start new operations and hire their first employee. Using two state-of-the-art record linking methods, we distinguish them from pre-existing companies that merely re-register as a new firm, for example following an ID change or merger. The extremely narrow size distribution that we observe for de novo entrants provides further support for the passive learning model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use the model to obtain projections of the interindustry linkages of sectors in the Polish economy over the next 50 years. The results of this simulation suggest an ongoing change of the composition of the set of key sectors of the Polish economy.

Our findings confirm the existence of international transmissions of policy uncertainty, while the patterns differ markedly. The US EPU appears to be the most significant cause of the fall of export, industrial production, equity price and exchange rate, meanwhile, the EU EPU is also to be blamed for the depreciation of RMB. In contrast to industrial production, which shows the largest negative impact, Chinese inflation increases to a relatively smaller extent with the EPU shocks ranking as the US, Japanese and the EU. Regardless of the minor impact on a long-term interest rate, the short-term interest rate in China reacts positively to the European and US EPU shocks. Despite the independent national monetary policies, EPUs from the EU, Japan and the UK can decrease the Chinese monetary aggregate. In summary, the Chinese economy responds the most to the US EPU, especially to its inflation expectation disagreement component, whereas it responds the least to the UK EPU.","[Han, Liyan; Qi, Mengchao] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Libo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yin, LB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yinlibowsxbb@126.com,"Yin, Libo/Q-7525-2017; Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401193, 71371022, 71173008]; Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education [14JZD016]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [projects number 71401193, 71371022, and 71173008]; Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education [project number 14JZD016]; and the Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.",,38,47,51,3,79,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, Prebisch was critical of some aspects of Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, in particular on the theory of interest and the multiplier. His attitude can be explained by a difference in the object and method of analysis. Prebisch's interests focussed on dynamics and the cycle, themes that were peripheral to Keynes's central message. Prebisch's Keynesian influence and his rejection of some aspects of Keynes's magnum opus explains why at the same time that Prebisch is often described as the Latin American Keynes, he is portrayed as concerned mainly with the long-run development problem of Latin America and without proper consideration to demand factors as fundamental determinants of output and employment.","[Perez Caldentey, Esteban] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile; [Vernengo, Matias] Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Caribe CEPAL, Financing Dev Unit, Econ Dev Div, Off T 423, Ave Dag Hammarskjold 3477, Santiago 7630412, Chile.",esteban.perez@eclac.org,,,,,,,66,9,10,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We set up a model to simultaneously determine the provision of human smuggling services and the demand from would-be migrants. A visa-selling policy may be successful in eliminating smugglers by eroding their profits, but it also increases immigration. In contrast, repression decreases migration but fuels cartelized smugglers. To overcome this trade-off we show that legalization through selling visas in combination with repression can be used to weaken human smuggling while controlling migration flows.

We apply our framework to evaluate an HIV treatment breakthrough known as HAART. The model captures how, in lowering both the expected cost and likelihood of HIV infection, HAART reduced the implicit price of risky sex. Forward-looking agents responded by optimally shifting their behaviour. The model also imposes equilibrium constraints, explicitly capturing how optimal shifts in behaviour affect equilibrium choices by changing both infection probabilities and the ease of finding partners willing to engage in risky sex. Using the estimated model, we conduct counterfactual simulations to compute the value of HAART from the perspective of uninfected agents. This includes the option value of the innovation along with value accruing from changes in sex behaviour in response to HAART introduction. We also calculate the added value of a fully functional vaccine from the perspective of both infected and uninfected agents, where infected agents benefit from a vaccine due to resulting shifts in market equilibrium.","[Chan, Tat Y.; Hamilton, Barton H.] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Papageorge, Nicholas W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Johns Hopkins University,"Chan, TY (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,"Hamilton, Barton H/P-5187-2015",,,,,,32,21,29,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Applying the model to OECD foreign aid (ODA) data we find the signal present in approximately one-sixth of a large set of donor-recipient pairs. We then undertake two out-of-model exercises to validate the signal: a logit regression of signal determinants and the growth effects of ODA from signal-positive pairs are compared to non-signal bearers. The logit indicates our signal meaningfully distinguishes donor-recipient pairs by characteristics typically associated with altruism. The growth exercise shows ODA from signal bearers displays stronger reverse causation and more positive long-run effects.

We build a structural model for an equilibrium analysis of debt-portfolio choices over the life cycle. Our analysis captures key patterns from the observed cross-sectional distributions of secured debt, unsecured debt, and of home equity. The model predicts that harmonizing the amount of home equity exempt in bankruptcy procedures has quantitatively negligible effects on the interest rate of unsecured debt and on welfare, unless the exemption is eliminated.

By considering R&D behaviour of the foreign firm, this paper shows contrarily that trade liberalization has a positive effect on the foreign firm's R&D, resulting in a better technology to be transferred to the domestic firm and enhancing both the domestic and the world welfare. This result holds even if trade liberalization originates from non-tariff barriers such as quotas. Moreover, by comparing the levels of technology transfer between the two regimes, we find that if the trade barrier is high (low), the technology transferred from the foreign firm under the equivalent quota regime is superior (inferior) to that under the tariff regime. Finally, a ban on technology export by the foreign country may surprisingly induce the foreign firm to invest more in its R&D.","[Hwang, Hong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Acad Sinica, RCHSS, Taipei, Taiwan; [Marjit, Sugata] Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Peng, Cheng-Hau] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 24205, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Peng, CH (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 24205, Taiwan.",chpon@fju.edu.tw,,"Hwang, Hong/0000-0001-5103-8947; Peng, Cheng-Hau/0000-0002-7522-7002",,,,,17,6,7,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The system consists of a translog production function and the first-order conditions (FOC) of profit maximization. Each coefficient of the production function is an unknown function of some exogenous environmental variables. This makes the production function observation-specific so long as the environmental variables are observation-specific. The estimation of the system involves applying the functional coefficient instrumental variable method (Cai et al., 2006) for the endogeneity of inputs in the first step, and the semiparametric smooth coefficient seemingly unrelated regression method (Henderson et al., 2015) in the second step. Using a Chinese food industry data set, we show that the semiparametric system approach gives the most economically meaningful input elasticity estimates compared with alternative models.

We evaluate the impact of biometrically authenticated payments infrastructure (Smartcards) on beneficiaries of employment (NREGS) and pension (SSP) programs in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, using a large-scale experiment that randomized the rollout of Smartcards over 157 subdistricts and 19 million people. We find that, while incompletely implemented, the new system delivered a faster, more predictable, and less corrupt NREGS payments process without adversely affecting program access. For each of these outcomes, treatment group distributions first-order stochastically dominated those of the control group. The investment was cost-effective, as time savings to NREGS beneficiaries alone were equal to the cost of the intervention, and there was also a significant reduction in the leakage of funds between the government and beneficiaries in both NREGS and SSP programs. Beneficiaries overwhelmingly preferred the new system for both programs. Overall, our results suggest that investing in secure payments infrastructure can significantly enhance state capacity to implement welfare programs in developing countries.","[Muralidharan, Karthik; Niehaus, Paul] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sukhtankar, Sandip] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Monroe Hall,248 McCormick Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Virginia,"Muralidharan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kamurali@ucsd.edu; pniehaus@ucsd.edu; sandip.sukhtankar@virginia.edu,,,"IPA, Yale University; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","IPA, Yale University; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)","We thank Santosh Anagol, Abhijit Banerjee, Julie Cullen, Gordon Dahl, Roger Gordon, Rema Hanna, Gordon Hanson, Erzo Luttmer, Santhosh Mathew, Simone Schaner, Monica Singhal, Anh Tran, and several seminar participants for comments.

Workers belonging to the same industry, establishment or job share common factors which cannot be observed and these factors affect wages. If these unobservable variables are correlated with the explanatory variables, their estimated effects will be biased. For this reason, we estimate the effects of each type of gender segregation on the wage gap using a robust specification to these possible correlations.

The main novelty of this paper is the use, on the revenue side, of a dataset of fiscal measures based on the yield of actual legislative and budgetary measures, rather than approximations, such as changes in cyclically adjusted variables. Using static and dynamic panel data techniques, we find that fiscal consolidation generally has a negative impact on growth in the short run, although some specific budget categories are not found to be statistically significant. In general, expenditure based measures are found to have a slightly lower detrimental effect on growth compared to revenue measures, although the difference is not statistically significant. Among expenditure cuts, reductions in government investment and consumption are found to be growth reducing. Among revenues, indirect tax increases are found to have a particularly strong negative impact. Dynamic specifications suggest that consolidation reduces growth mainly in the year of fiscal adjustment, while future growth rates are affected only through the usual time persistence. Non-linear specifications indicate that spreading out consolidation may reduce the negative impact on growth slightly, and there is weak evidence that this is especially the case for revenue-based adjustment.

Instead of assuming quasilinearity, I assume that bidders have weakly positive wealth effects, i.e. the goods are normal goods. My setting nests quasilinearity, but also allows for budget constraints, financial constraints, and risk aversion. I show that without the quasilinearity restriction, truthful reporting is not a dominant strategy in the Vickrey auction. Instead, bidders truthfully demand for their first unit and weakly overreport their demand for later units. The incentive to overreport demand means that the Vickrey auction is generally inefficient. This mirrors the well-known demand reduction results in uniform-price auctions. Moreover, the efficiency ranking of the two auctions is ambiguous. In fact, there are cases where the uniform-price auction is Pareto efficient and the Vickrey auction is Pareto inefficient, even if only one bidder has non-quasilinear preferences.

This paper explores the concept of externalities from a philosophical perspective. It criticizes the utilitarian nature of economic analyses of externalities, showing how they cannot take into account values like freedom and justice. It then develops the analogy between the concept of externalities and the harm principle' in political philosophy. It argues that the harm principle points to the need for a theory of basic interests to judge when a harm is imposed. Similarly, externality analyses should use such a theory of basic interests as the basis for judgments about legitimate state intervention. This proposal is defended against objections, and illustrated with a case study of the US Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act, which shows how the judicial reasoning implicitly interprets externalities in terms of basic interests.","[Claassen, Rutger] Univ Utrecht, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Claassen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.j.g.claassen@uu.nl,,,VENI-grant of the Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO) [275-20031],VENI-grant of the Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO),"The author thanks Geoffrey Hodgson and three reviewers of this journal for their comments and suggestions.

SOME EVIDENCE FROM AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INCOME MOBILITY; UNITED-STATES; SWEDEN; SONS,"This paper analyses the intergenerational earnings mobility in Australia for all combinations of mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. We find that mobility is highest between parents and children of the opposite sex. Daughters are more mobile than sons with respect to fathers' earnings, but there is no statistical difference between the sexes' mobility with respect to mothers' earnings. We also consider how differing levels of mobility between the sexes may be related to the education level of the children. It was found that the father-son elasticity increases with son's education level and that the difference between son-father and daughter-father mobility may be associated with the higher levels of education obtained by females from less affluent backgrounds.","[Fairbrother, David] PricewaterhouseCoopers, Plymouth, New Zealand; [Mahadevan, Renuka] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Mahadevan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.mahadevan@uq.edu.au,"Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019","Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993",,,,,29,5,5,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Relatively closed economies may benefit from R&D subsidization while relatively open economies may not.

In this paper, through an analytical survey of 137 preceding studies, we present an overall picture of the debate and examine the relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes in related studies. We found that the radicalists maintain a consistent debate attitude from the viewpoints of time speed and policy sequence of economic transition, while the debate attitude of the gradualists is more diversified. We also found that there is another group of researchers that stays within the framework of the radicalism-versus-gradualism debate while at the same time keeping at arm's length from both the radicalists and the gradualists. In addition, our regression estimation of qualitative selection models provides interesting findings on the relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes.","[Iwasaki, Ichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Suzuki, Taku] Teikyo Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Teikyo University,"Iwasaki, I (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan.",iiwasaki@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education and Sciences in Japan [23243032]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243032, 26245034] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education and Sciences in Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was financially supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Education and Sciences in Japan (No. 23243032).

Dependent on China's continued growth, we explore how China will impact many other economies through trade and investment, creating winners and losers in the world economy.

As a result, technological knowledge base has become more complex. However, innovation and management studies have been ambivalent about this process. Part of the literature suggested that technological activity is highly industry-specific and accumulative. On the other hand, literature at the firm level has recognized that there has been corporate diversification. Such ambivalence reflects the tension between both micro process of technological diversification and technology convergence. One of the main empirical results of this paper is that inter-industrial convergence is localized covering some subsets of industrial biotechnology products. Secondly, patent data enable to distinguish between different kinds of corporate technology coherence: whereas health industry adopt conglomerate biotechnological diversification, industrial biotechnology corporations adopt a more coherent technology diversification enabling innovation and (dynamic) efficient growth.

We explicitly model asset purchases by the central bank and their impact on the central bank's balance sheet. In particular, QE is captured by central bank purchases of long-term government bonds financed by enhanced liquidity provision to the private sector. With imperfect substitutability between asset classes, QE affects the term premium, stock prices, the exchange rate and the private sector's saving decision. We use the model to simulate the European Central Bank's (ECB's) QE path as announced in early 2015. With six basis points term-premium reduction the model generates 0.9 per cent effective euro depreciation and raises real GDP in the euro area by 0.3 per cent and prices by 0.5 per cent by 2016. Enduring periods of low interest rates strengthen the expansionary effect of QE in the short and medium term. Frontloading of asset purchases has little impact on output and inflation effects as long as the duration of the balance sheet expansion remains unchanged. Expansionary effects of QE are reduced if the central bank purchases eligible assets from foreign rather than domestic counterparties.","[Priftis, Romanos; Vogel, Lukas] European Commiss, DG ECFIN, Brussels, Belgium",,"Priftis, R (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG ECFIN, Brussels, Belgium.",,,"Vogel, Lukas/0000-0002-8106-2750",,,,,33,12,12,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

J,"Watts, A",,,,"Watts, Alison",,,Two ways to auction off an uncertain good,JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Auctions; Uncertainty; Good availability,COGNITIVE RADIO NETWORKS; SEQUENTIAL AUCTIONS; ALLOCATION,"An auction framework is examined where each seller is uncertain about whether or not he will have a good available to sell. A timely example includes the auctioning off of radio spectrum by licensed primary users to unlicensed secondary users. A licensed primary user may not use the spectrum all of the time, but may not know in advance whether or not he will need the spectrum himself and thus whether or not he will have spectrum bandwidth available to rent out. We consider two types of auctions: an ex-post auction which takes place after each seller learns about the availability of the good and an ex-ante auction which takes place before each seller learns about availability. The expected payoffs to buyers, sellers, and to society are then compared. The ex-ante auction can cause buyers to bid on multiple expected units to ensure that they end up with at least one actual unit. Such over purchasing can create a loss to society. Sellers will prefer the ex-post auction since if fewer units are actually available to sell, then they can be sold at a higher price. Whereas in the ex-ante auction all sellers have one expected unit available to sell which results in a lower price. However, if high value buyers are common, then a buyer may prefer the ex-ante auction as it can be easier to win an expected unit than an ex-post actual unit. In contrast, if a buyer has a high valuation and if high value buyers are uncommon, then he may prefer the ex-post auction since he has a strong chance to win an actual unit.","[Watts, Alison] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Watts, A (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",wattsa@siu.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1343380]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1560437] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Financial support from the NSF under Grant SES-1343380 is gratefully acknowledged.

Additionally, the historical realized volatility, continuous sample path variation, negative realized semivariance, signed jump, signed semi jump and leverage components contain substantial and salient information for forecasting the volatility of crude oil futures. Then, we use loss functions to assess the forecasting performance of these sixteen new models, and finally, rank these models using the PROMETHEE II method. Our results indicate that different models exhibit different predictive power in forecasting the 1-day, 1-week and 1-month volatility of crude oil futures.

Using models based on vector autoregression and generalized method of moments, we show, in particular, that futures trading activity has a strong impact on both spot and futures price volatility in copper and aluminium markets. Futures trading activity leads spot market volatility in copper and aluminium markets which suggests that futures markets have a destabilizing effect. In order to disentangle the effect of different traders' types on asset price movements, we decompose futures trading into speculators' and hedgers' trading and investigate their contributions to volatility. As a robustness check, we investigate the impact of endogenous structural breaks on the interactional relationship between price volatility and futures trading.","[Zhang, Ren; Polanski, Arnold] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Zhang, R (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",A.Polanski@uea.ac.uk,,"Polanski, Arnold/0000-0001-9146-6364",,,,,43,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The energy sector (the locomotora minero-energetica, to use the rhetorical expression of President Juan Manuel Santos) grew much faster than the rest of the economy, while the manufacturing sector registered a negative rate of growth. These are classic symptoms of the well-known 'Dutch disease', but our purpose here is not to establish whether the Dutch disease exists or not, but rather to shed some light on the financial viability of several, simultaneous dynamics: (1) the existence of a traditional Dutch Disease being due to a large increase in mining exports and a significant exchange rate appreciation, (2) a massive increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the mining sector, (3) a rather passive monetary policy, aimed at increasing purchasing power via exchange rate appreciation, (4) more recently, a large distribution of dividends from Colombia to the rest of the world and the accumulation of mounting financial liabilities. The paper will show that these dynamics constitute a potential danger for the stability of the Colombian economy.

The analysis aims to provide a data-founded explanation of what is behind the decrease observed in 2011 by testing two alternative hypotheses. At the same time, we discuss how that decrease might have endangered the sustainability of public debt and study the empirical relevance of the most important of those processes. The topics presented refer to any advanced economy, but we check the hypotheses discussed by taking Italy as a case study because of data constraints. Italy is an interesting country to consider since it is a very large debt issuer. Our results point towards the importance of market volatility to explain variations of NRH, but those holdings do not seem to influence debt sustainability.","[Cafiso, Gianluca] Univ Catania, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy; [Cafiso, Gianluca] CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany",University of Catania; Ifo Institut,"Cafiso, G (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",gcafiso@unict.it,,"Cafiso, Gianluca/0000-0002-9853-4750",,,,,55,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The Affordable Care Act coupled with an ageing population, are increasing demand for health care and, in turn, RNs. Numbering 3 million, RNs comprise the largest professional occupation in health care. Therefore, the labour force participation and hours worked are of keen interest to stakeholders and policymakers. Rising demand may exacerbate nursing shortages and have important effects on costs. We estimate the impact of wages on participation and hours worked as a possible policy tool to increase nursing supply. In 2008, the RN wage had a positive and significant effect on participation and a small positive but only marginally significant effect on hours worked given participation. The latter elasticity for married females (single females) was 0.11 (0.33). Therefore, the elasticity of hours worked with respect to the nurse wage is and unlikely to have an important effect on the participation rates or hours worked of currently trained female RNs. Consequently, wage increases are unlikely to be an effective policy to increase the labour supply among the currently licensed RNs and will not relieve any short-term nursing shortage.","[Condliffe, Simon] West Chester Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, W Chester, PA 19382 USA; [Link, Charles R.] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); West Chester University of Pennsylvania; University of Delaware,"Condliffe, S (通讯作者)，West Chester Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, W Chester, PA 19382 USA.",scondliffe@wcupa.edu,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

New evidence on the risk-taking channel,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial regulation; Monetary policy; Risk-taking channel,GENERALIZED-METHOD; MARKET,"Before the subprime crisis, financial stability was a microprudential issue addressed by capital regulation and unrelated to monetary policy. The financial crisis put this paradigm to the test and turned the spotlight on the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy. Hence, the following question arises: how does capital regulation react to monetary policy? This article seeks to answer this question. We analyze the link involving monetary policy and capital regulation through the risk-taking channel in Brazil. The findings suggest that banks react to monetary policy by changing the amount of loan provisions as well as the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). An important novelty of the study is the evidence that there is no trade-off between provisions and CAR, which are important tools used by banking supervisors. The key result of the article is that banks react to the macroeconomic environment differently from what is expected by banking supervision, i.e., there exists a paradox between the microprudential view and the macroprudential view. Thus, in terms of practical implication, a banking supervision strategy for financial stability must take into account the effects of monetary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Rather, many - if not most - migrations appear to be temporary. In this paper, therefore, we illustrate the estimation challenges when migrations are temporary. As in an overwhelming share of the selective out-migration literature, our basic structure assumes that the process that determines out-migration is unrelated to other choices that affect wage growth, such as human capital investment or labour supply decisions, which greatly simplifies the analysis. When the choice of whether and when to out-migrate also affects decisions that determine wage growth, the problem becomes inherently dynamic and requires a more structural approach to estimation, which we briefly discuss.

Electricity prices have idiosyncratic patterns not addressed by the usual commodity pricing literature. This paper develops an electricity market model that allows for oligopoly, vertical integration, and a uniform-price auction mechanism. It derives a linear equilibrium relationship between spot prices and state variables affecting firms' costs and demand. It then applies a two factor forward pricing model over the equilibrium spot price process, and shows that forward prices can be positively affected by spot market power. An empirical estimation of the model follows, using NZEM data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In China, these flows are not explicitly considered when setting energy and environmental targets for provinces, and their potential impact on the effectiveness of policy alternatives is ignored. We analyze how migration affects outcomes under energy intensity targets and energy caps. While both policies are part of the nation's Twelfth Five Year Plan (2011-2015) and imposed at the provincial level, only the intensity targets are binding at present. We estimate a migration model, integrate it into a general equilibrium model that resolves each province in China, and simulate the effect of migration on energy use and economic activity. We find that although both types of policies are affected by uncertain migration flows, energy intensity targets (energy use indexed to economic output) are more robust than absolute caps. They are also more cost effective, placing less burden on the relatively clean in migration provinces. Our findings also underscore the value of moving from provincial targets to an integrated national trading system targeting emissions of energy-related CO2, given that the choice of abatement strategies will adjust endogenously to labor relocation.

For this purpose we estimate different gravity models to control for trade creation and diversion, export diversification and intra-industry trade using OLS log-linearized gravity model and Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood panel data estimators that allow controlling for zero-value trade flows. We find trade creation for ANCOM, MERCOSUR and CACM and trade diversion for NAFTA and MERCOSUR countries. Export diversification negatively affects bilateral trade in all American agreements, while intra-industry trade has contributed to trade expansion in ANCOM and the opposite for NAFTA, MERCOSUR and CACM. Global supply chains may help us explain these results. Finally, we find anticipatory effects on trade several years before the signing of the agreements, but only NAFTA countries seem to be natural trading partners in the region while the rest of Latin American regional agreements have not resulted in a comprehensive, profound and consolidated common market.","[Martin-Mayoral, Fernando; Moran Carofilis, Gabriela; Cajas Guijarro, John] FLACSO Ecuador, Dept Dev Environm & Terr, Quito, Ecuador",,"Martin-Mayoral, F (通讯作者)，FLACSO Ecuador, Dept Dev Environm & Terr, Quito, Ecuador.",fmartin@flacso.edu.ec,"Guijarro, John Cajas/AAO-3023-2020","Guijarro, John Cajas/0000-0002-5753-0315",,,,,106,6,7,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Using three laboratory experiments on tax avoidance and evasion, we study how legality affects individuals' decisions. We find that, without any risk of negative financial consequences, the qualification of tax minimization as illegal versus legal reduces tax minimization considerably. Legislators can thus, in principle, affect subjects' decisions by defining the line between legality and illegality. However, once we introduce potential negative financial consequences, we observe no difference between legal and illegal tax minimization behavior. Only if we use moral priming to increase subjects' moral cost do we again find a legality effect on tax minimization. Overall, this demonstrates the limitations of the expressive function of the law. Legality might be an important determinant of behavior only if we consider activities with little or no risk of negative financial consequences or if subjects are morally primed.

At the same time, as part of the same process and as part of the structural transformation that underlies most economic development, the share of services in Asia's trade has risen. Policies that support the development of regional infrastructure and the flow of goods and services, as well as factors of production, can increase the benefits from connectivity.

Evaluation studies of such programmes commonly rely on the conditional independence assumption (CIA), allowing a causal interpretation of the results only if all relevant variables affecting participation and success are accounted for. While the entrepreneurship literature has emphasised the important role of personality traits as predictors for start-up decisions and business success, these variables were neglected in evaluation studies so far due to data limitations. In this paper, we evaluate a new start-up subsidy for unemployed individuals in Germany using pro pensity score matching under the CIA. Having access to rich administrative-survey data allows us to incorporate usually unobserved personality measures in the evaluation and investigate their impact on the estimated effects. We find strong positive effects on labour market reintegration and earned income for the new programme. Most importantly, results including and excluding individuals' personalities do not differ significantly, implying that concerns about potential overestimation of programme effects in the absence of personality measures might be less justified if the set of other control variables is rich enough.

This study proposes a solution method and derives very tractable sufficient conditions for determinacy and indeterminacy in the mean-square stability sense in general MSRE models with lagged endogenous variables. These tasks are accomplished by extending the forward method of Cho and Moreno (2011) developed for linear rational expectations models to MSRE models.

We show that the character of that decline changed around 2000. Since 2000 the decline in dynamism and entrepreneurship has been accompanied by a decline in high growth young firms. Prior research has shown that the sustained contribution of business startups to job creation stems from a relatively small fraction of high-growth young firms. The presence of these high-growth young firms contributes to a highly (positively) skewed firm growth rate distribution. In 1999, a firm at the 90th percentile of the employment growth rate distribution grew about 31 percent faster than the median firm. Moreover, the 90 - 50 differential was 16 percent larger than the 50 - 10 differential reflecting the positive skewness of the employment growth rate distribution. We show that the shape of the firm employment growth distribution changes substantially in the post-2000 period. By 2007, the 90 - 50 differential was only 4 percent larger than the 50 - 10, and it continued to exhibit a trend decline through 2011. The overall decline reflects a sharp drop in the 90th percentile of the growth rate distribution accounted for by the declining share of young firms and the declining propensity for young firms to be high-growth firms.

Moreover, a panel structural equation modelling (SEM) is applied in order to capture the causal effect of permanent income on life satisfaction. Swiss Household Panel (SHP) Survey (2000-2013), which is a detailed micro level survey, is used for the analysis controlling for personal and household characteristics. Five air pollutants are examined in the entire analysis; ozone (O-3), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Furthermore, the marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) values for reducing air pollution are calculated. For the robustness checks, the SEM estimates are compared with those derived by the adapted Probit Fixed Effects (FE) model. Overall results show that MWTP values are higher for SO2 followed by O-3 and NO2, while the lowest values are reported for CO and PM10. Moreover, it is found that the permanent income has a positive significant effect on life satisfaction. However, considering the SEM estimations, findings for the income effects on life satisfaction are stronger than those found from the adapted Probit FE estimates that lead to lower MWTP values.","[Giovanis, Eleftherios] Univ Verona, I-37100 Verona, Italy; [Ozdamar, Oznur] Adnan Menderes Univ, Aydin, Turkey; [Ozdamar, Oznur] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Verona; Adnan Menderes University; University of Bologna,"Giovanis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, I-37100 Verona, Italy.",giovanis95@gmail.com,"Giovanis, Eleftherios/AAX-5634-2020; OZDAMAR, OZNUR/AAX-3029-2021","Giovanis, Eleftherios/0000-0002-7492-7461; OZDAMAR, OZNUR/0000-0002-2188-3733",,,,,93,15,15,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In this paper we present a new and opposite perspective. We construct a model of endogenous fiscal decentralization that builds on two key notions: a trade-off between risk sharing and heterogeneity, and a positive association between resource booms and risk. The model shows that a resource windfall causes the nation to centralize as a mechanism to either share risk and/or prevent local capture, depending on the relative bargaining power of the central and regional governments. We provide cross country empirical evidence for the main hypotheses, finding that resource booms: (i) decrease the level of fiscal decentralization with no U-shaped patterns, (ii) cause the former due to risk sharing incentives primarily when regional governments are relatively strong, and (iii) have no effect on political decentralization.

The elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption determines the size of public debt and could explain differences of debt across countries. I compare the optimal policies under commitment and in a political equilibrium without commitment. Public debt can be higher or lower when commitment is absent, depending on the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption.

In contrast to its complete-markets limit, the equilibrium real exchange rate is irreducible from the incomplete-markets equilibrium. Market incompleteness exacerbates the domestic-inflation and output-gap monetary-policy trade-off in two ways: its steepness and its resulting endogenous cost-push to the trade-off. The latter depends on an equilibrium combination of structural shocks and on agents' beliefs of future events. Thus, in comparison to its complete-markets and closed-economy limits, standard Taylor-type rules are less capable of inducing determinate rational expectations equilibrium in our environment. Despite the larger policy trade-off under incomplete markets, simple policies that also respond to exchange-rate growth are able to manage expectations that drive the endogenous cost-push term. However, policies that respond directly to expectations may turn out to exacerbate the cost-push trade-off further, and thus, to be more likely to fuel self-fulfilling multiple or unstable equilibria.","[Alonso-Carrera, Jaime] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain; [Kam, Timothy] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Universidade de Vigo; Australian National University,"Kam, T (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25a, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",timothy.kam@anu.edu.au,"Alonso-Carrera, Jaime/M-3877-2019","Alonso-Carrera, Jaime/0000-0001-8525-7769; Kam, Timothy/0000-0002-3938-609X",Spanish Ministry of Science; FEDER [ECO2011-23959]; Spanish Ministry of Education [PR2009-0162]; Xunta de Galicia [10PXIB30001777PR]; Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR2009-1051]; EDN program - Australian Research Council; CAMA at Australian National University; RGEA at Universidade de Vigo,Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); EDN program - Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); CAMA at Australian National University; RGEA at Universidade de Vigo,"J.

We provide new insights into the oil curse phenomenon in Malaysia that challenges the conventional argument that Malaysia is a counter-example of an oil curse country. We do not find any significant evidence of direct effects of financial development on TFP. However, there are direct and positive effects on the level of investment due to financial development and oil dependence. While we do not find statistical evidence of a direct negative impact of oil rent on economic growth, our results reveal that the symptoms of an oil curse exist. Specifically, we find that oil rent has a weak, indirect, impact on the finance-growth nexus through the quantitative channel or investment quantity. The policy implications of our findings are that the financial sector should be more involved in productive investment activities that can strengthen its role in economic growth and that policymakers should reduce dependence on oil and promote economic diversification.

This underlines the need for designing food security interventions customised for household-specific needs and behaviours. This study estimates Ugandan household demand behaviour with a focus on food consumption paying particular attention to household-specific characteristics. The results show that preferences to increase calorie-dense staple consumption, likely associated with food energy deficiency, extend far beyond the percentage of rural Ugandans officially deemed poor. Price elasticities indicate that poor rural households are largely well positioned to compensate staple price increases by substitution as long as they are not already concentrated on the cheapest foods. This flexibility applies less to urban households. The estimated demand elasticities generally vary widely between rural and urban households and depend on expenditure levels. Household-specific characteristics have significant, sometimes pronounced, influences on demand, as do seasons and regions. The results reflect highly differentiated demand behaviour, which can be utilised to improve the design and evaluation of food security interventions.","[Boysen, Ole] Univ Hohenheim, Agr & Food Policy, Stuttgart, Germany; [Boysen, Ole] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Dublin 2, Ireland",University Hohenheim; Trinity College Dublin,"Boysen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Agr & Food Policy, Stuttgart, Germany.;Boysen, O (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Inst Int Integrat Studies, Dublin 2, Ireland.",boyseno@tcd.ie,"Boysen, Ole/S-9441-2019","Boysen, Ole/0000-0003-2459-4715","New Issues in Agricultural, Food and Bio-energy Trade (AGFOODTRADE) (Small and Medium-Scale Focused Research Project) - European Commission [212036]","New Issues in Agricultural, Food and Bio-energy Trade (AGFOODTRADE) (Small and Medium-Scale Focused Research Project) - European Commission","The author would like to acknowledge financial support received under the New Issues in Agricultural, Food and Bio-energy Trade (AGFOODTRADE) (Small and Medium-Scale Focused Research Project, Grant Agreement no. 212036) research project funded by the European Commission.

In the postwar period, there is evidence of a phase shift between the price level and output. Such a phase shift is manifested in the price level being countercyclical and the inflation rate being procyclical or acyclical, depending on the detrending method used. Our examination takes three approaches. First, we apply bootstrapping methods to characterize the two correlations, though the methodology could easily be extended to any set of facts. Second, we specify a model economy with forecast heterogeneity, showing numerically that this model economy can match the observed pair of correlations. Third, we apply robust control theory, deriving conditions in which the price level is countercyclical and the inflation rate is procyclical. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that on an annual basis the incidence of price adjustment is three times higher than in developed countries. The remaining price rigidity is explained by the existence of firms' interactions with the informal sector, strategic interactions with other firms and the uncertainty about temporariness of shocks. The exchange rate and cost-push shocks matter more and are incorporated faster into prices than financial cost and demand-pull shocks. The roughly bimodal nature of price reviewing strategies together with a high frequency of price adjustment imply that monetary policy will carry low potency. Time-dependent price reviewing strategies tend to dominate state-dependent strategies, but the ratio of price reviews to actual adjustment is too high and inconsistent with the moderate levels of inflation experienced by Pakistan.

Because this parity need only hold in a risk-neutral world, a risk adjustment term is missing from the equation if speculation in foreign exchange markets is risky. We deal with this issue following the literature which assumes that discounted returns on foreign government bonds are log-normal, so we can linearize the Euler pricing equations (in level) and obtain a modified UIP system for which the risk adjustment term is obtained by applying to the pricing kernel-based relations a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity-in-mean model. However, here we innovate by adopting a methodology which differs from all these related works. We construct and use a stochastic discount factor that does not depend on a specific model, by residing in the space of returns which we extract from the data by simply imposing the orthogonality restrictions represented by the Euler equations. So, we devise a purely statistical pricing kernel that performs well in in-sample level equations. Somewhat disappointingly, the risk premium inclusion in the conventional regression changes neither the significance nor the magnitude of the forecasting power of the forward premium for most currencies we study. The contrasting performance of the tests in level and in logs suggests that linearization may be to blame.","[da Costa, Carlos E.] FGV EPGE, Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Jesus Filho, Jaime] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Matos, Paulo] UFC CAEN, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); University of Chicago,"Matos, P (通讯作者)，UFC CAEN, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",paulomatos@caen.ufc.br,,,CNPq-Brazil; FAPERJ; FUNCAP,CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); FUNCAP(Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (FUNCAP)),"da Costa gratefully acknowledges financial support from CNPq-Brazil and FAPERJ, Filho from CNPQ-Brazil and Matos from FUNCAP and CNPq-Brazil.",,47,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that the CEECs have been an area for the relocation of business services since the 2000s. The CEECs do specialize in services, but not all CEECs had a comparative advantage in the same type of services. As regards business services trade, the EU-15 countries are favored partners of the CEECs and a growing share of EU-15 business services imports comes from the CEECs even if it remains moderate. The provision of business services from the CEECs in order to supply EU-15 companies appears as a steady trend, extending the provision of manufactured goods from those places and contributing to further develop the integration of production processes within Europe without disrupting other more global trends.","[Duboz, Marie-Line] UBFC, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Rodet-Kroichvili, Nathalie] Univ Technol Belfort Montbeliard, UBFC, RECITS, Belfort, France; [Slim, Assen] Essca, CREE Inalco, CEMI Ehess, Angers, France",Universite de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard (UTBM); ESSCA School of Management,"Duboz, ML (通讯作者)，UBFC, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.",,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,2,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We show that for a large class of commodity spaces, which might be infinite-dimensional and even non-separable, core equivalence is indeed equivalent to the presence of many more agents than commodities when allocations are Bochner integrable. By contrast, we show that in a classical model of an atomless economy with an infinite-dimensional commodity space, the model where the commodity space is with the Mackey topology and allocations are Gelfand integrable, core equivalence holds in full generality, even when there are many more commodities than agents. The assumptions we make on economies are much weaker than what is commonly used in core equivalence results for infinite-dimensional commodity spaces and reduce to Aumann's original assumptions when there are finitely many commodities.","[Greinecker, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie, SOWI Gebaude, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Podczeck, Konrad] Univ Vienna, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Innsbruck; University of Vienna,"Greinecker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie, SOWI Gebaude, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",michael.greinecker@uibk.ac.at; konrad.podczeck@univie.ac.at,"Podczeck, Konrad/D-9281-2017","Podczeck, Konrad/0000-0003-2734-2206",,,,,25,4,4,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Whereas in standard economics the concept of the decision-maker is the rational actor, and in early work in behavioral economics it is the quasi-rational actor influenced by the context of the moment of decision, in some recent work in behavioral economics, the decision-maker could be called the enculturated actor. This actor's preferences, perception, and cognition are subject to two deep social influences: (a) the social contexts to which he has become exposed and, especially, accustomed; and (b) the cultural mental models including categories, identities, narratives, and woridviews that he uses to process information. The paper traces how these factors shape behavior through the endogenous determination of preferences and the lenses through which individuals see the world their perception and interpretation of situations. The paper offers a tentative taxonomy of the social determinants of behavior and describes the results of controlled and natural experiments that only a broader view of these determinants can plausibly explain. The perspective suggests more realistic models of human behavior for explaining outcomes and designing policies.

To get a comprehensive picture about the role of experience we implement two asset market designs. One is prone to inefficient pricing, exhibiting bubble and crash patterns, while the other exhibits efficient pricing. We find that (i) both, positive and negative, experience gained in the investment game lead to efficient pricing in both market settings.

The model is extended by specifying a small open economy with tradable and nontradable goods sectors to characterize the Korean labor market empirically. Results of empirical analyses based on the estimated model can be summarized as follows. First, the sectoral reallocation of labor plays an important role in the adjustment of the Korean labor market, which responds to macroeconomic shocks, particularly foreign shocks. Second, the historical decomposition analysis demonstrates that the cyclical fluctuations of unemployment in Korea are explained by key domestic shocks, such as domestic productivity shocks and preference shocks. A relatively small contribution of foreign shocks to aggregate labor market variables is partly caused by the sectoral shift of employment rather than extensive changes in aggregate employment and labor force.","[Kim, Tae Bong] Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Hangyu] Dongduk Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Ajou University; Dongduk Women's University,"Kim, TB (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",tbk@ajou.ac.kr; hglee@dongduk.ac.kr,"Lee, Hangyu/HRC-8881-2023","Kim, Tae Bong/0000-0002-0744-9535",Bank of Korea,Bank of Korea,"The authors are grateful to all seminar participants at the Bank of Korea, 2016 Korea's Allied Economic Association Annual Meeting, Yonsei University, Sungkyunkwan University, and Kyung Hee University for their insightful comments.

In the first part of the paper, we argue that the ensuing drop in the price of natural gas has an ambiguous effect on global carbon emissions because of three countervailing effects: coal-to-gas switching in the US electric power sector, an increase in the relative cost of US renewable energy sources, and an increase in US coal exports. Our position is that without a meaningful cap, the shale gas boom is likely to increase global emissions and the period during which natural gas is used as a bridge fuel to clean energy should be limited. In the second part of the paper, we review recent environmental policies for the US electric power sector that have contributed to reducing carbon emissions, and discuss the complex economics of the newly introduced Clean Power Plan. Although the availability of cheap natural gas has been factored in US environmental policy and has helped electricity generators to achieve compliance with various rules and regulations, it should not derail policy from its long-run objective, which is the transition to a less fossil-fuel dependent economy.","[Knittel, Christopher] Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA USA; [Knittel, Christopher] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Knittel, Christopher] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Metaxoglou, Konstantinos] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Trindade, Andre] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Grad Sch Econ, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Carleton University,"Knittel, C (通讯作者)，Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA USA.;Knittel, C (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Knittel, C (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Metaxoglou, K (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.;Trindade, A (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Grad Sch Econ, Cambridge, MA USA.",knittel@mit.edu; konstantinos.metaxoglou@carleton.ca; andre.trindade@fgv.br,,"Trindade, Andre/0000-0003-0446-3320",,,,,39,15,23,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Both alternative measurements somewhat downplay the role investment played relative to growth in multifactor productivity in the U.K. and the U.S. during 1995-2000.

Under the ETI, firms are eligible to claim a deduction from their taxes due, for the portion of their wage bill that is paid to certain groups of youth employees. We utilise several waves of nationally representative data and implement a difference-in-differences methodology at the individual level, in order to identify the effects of the ETI on youth employment probabilities in the short run. Our primary finding is that the ETI did not have any statistically significant and positive effects on youth employment probabilities. The point estimate from our preferred regression is -0.005 and the 95% confidence interval is from -0.017 to 0.006. We also find no evidence that the ETI has resulted in an increase in the level of churning in the labour market for youth. Thus, any decrease in tax revenues that arise from the ETI are effectively accruing to firms which, collectively, would have employed as many youth even in the absence of the ETI.","[Ranchhod, Vimal] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, SALDRU, Chief Res Off,Econ, Room 7-61,PD Hahn Bldg,Upper Campus, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, Western Cape, South Africa; [Finn, Arden] Univ Cape Town, Southern Africa Labour & Dev Res Unit, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, Western Cape, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Ranchhod, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, SALDRU, Chief Res Off,Econ, Room 7-61,PD Hahn Bldg,Upper Campus, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, Western Cape, South Africa.",Vimal.ranchhod@uct.ac.za,,,National Research Foundation's Human and Social Dynamics in Development Grand Challenge,National Research Foundation's Human and Social Dynamics in Development Grand Challenge,"The authors wish to thank Ihsaan Bassier for excellent research assistance, and participants in the SALDRU seminar series for very useful comments and suggestions.

Faced with this dilemma, bank managers are hesitant to engage in CSR. This study pursues this issue by examining whether or not banks engaging in CSR can bring profits and reduce non-performing loans. We apply three novel estimation methods to obtain the unbiased and full-blown CSR effect. The first two methods are matching methods, namely, conventional propensity score matching method and nearest neighbor variance bias-corrected matching method (nn-VBC). The third method is Heckman's two-step method in switching regression.

In this paper, we study historical situations in which such an order is absent and violent conflict namely duel of honor is an institution. Anarchy or the absence of state rules in managing violence does not imply the absence of private rules and arrangements (such as codes of dueling). Our focus is on the possible ways that a Weberian order can emerge from anarchy. We endeavor to capture this transition by introducing a computational model in which a simulated agent represents a social individual who considers both economic and political factors and interacts with other individuals as well as institutions to make a decision. We then use the trajectory of dueling in England, France, and Germany to validate our approach. The paper demonstrates how a complex, aggregative historical process over three centuries may be consistently explained on the basis of rational choices among heterogeneous agents conditioned by their group identity and State authority.

According to this model, the objectives to be achieved include the maximum gross domestic product and employment, and the minimum energy consumption, where the constraints are the sectoral dynamic input-output balance, labour and energy supply, and sectoral production capacity. The four best solutions are screened from the Pareto-optimal front. The study findings show that the energy intensities in 2020 would decrease by 42.8%, 43.5%, 42.9%, and 43.4% in the four scenarios when compared to their 2002 levels. This means that China can fully achieve its planned energy-savings target for 2020. In order to ensure that the industrial structure is optimised for the future, sectoral capital investments should be regulated by China's government and efforts to improve energy efficiency should be maintained.","[Yu, Shiwei; Zheng, Shuhong; Ba, Guizhi] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shiwei] Univ Delaware, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy, Newark, DE USA; [Yu, Shiwei] Ctr China Mineral Resources Strategy & Policy, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Wuhan; University of Delaware; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Yu, SW (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Yu, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy, Newark, DE USA.;Yu, SW (通讯作者)，Ctr China Mineral Resources Strategy & Policy, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",swyu@udel.edu,"Yu, Shiwei/ABD-4060-2021","Yu, Shiwei/0000-0002-3927-0943","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103016, 71573236]; New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-12-0952]; Humanities and Social Sciences Fund, Ministry of Education of China [15YJA630092]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Humanities and Social Sciences Fund, Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71103016 and 71573236), the New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-12-0952), and the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund, Ministry of Education of China (15YJA630092).",,34,42,43,3,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Our results indicate that Spain's membership of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is the most likely source of time variation in the fiscal outcomes. Accordingly, increases in the primary deficit-to-GDP ratio do not succeed in stimulating economic activity in the first regime; rather, unexpected upsurges in the primary deficit harm economic activity (non-Keynesian effect) in the second regime, which prevails since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.","[Ricci-Risquete, Alejandro; Ramajo, Julian] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain; [De Castro, Francisco] European Commiss, DG EFIN, Brussels, Belgium",Universidad de Extremadura,"Ricci-Risquete, A (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain.",alericci@unex.es,"RAMAJO, JULIAN/M-5515-2013; de castro, francisco/JHU-5465-2023","RAMAJO, JULIAN/0000-0002-3156-8315; Ricci-Risquete, Alejandro/0000-0001-6435-6688",,,,,9,5,6,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A combined criterion for determining the modes to be included into the trend component is introduced. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the ordinary empirical mode decomposition (EMD), as well as with the method of wavelet-decomposition well-known in the energy economics literature. We test it on four day-ahead electricity markets: the Europe-Ural and the Siberia price zones of the Russian ATS exchange, the PJM exchange of the USA and the APX exchange of the United Kingdom. Our results show that the proposed approach based on CEEMDAN and the combined criterion outperforms the standard EMD on all the four electricity markets, and on two of the studied markets (PJM, APX) it outperforms the wavelet-smoothing, while on the other two (ATS Europe-Ural and Siberia) it performs at least not worse than the wavelet-smoothing. At the same time, the proposed approach does not require a prior choice of the smoothing parameter, as in the case of the wavelet-decomposition, and demonstrates a certain degree of versatility on the studied markets.

For 2009, this implies (sic)28.2 billion of unreported income, implying forgone tax revenues of over (sic)11 billion or 30% of the deficit. Our method innovation allows for estimating the industry distribution of tax evasion in settings where uncovering the incidence of hidden cash transactions is difficult using other methods.

Employing this indicator we show that increasing effective conservatism tends to lower inflation without increasing the output gap.

Nowadays, the main concern in the euro area (E.A.) is its deflationary effect. In this paper we propose a method to evaluate the effect of oil price changes on inflation as well as an indicator of inflation adjusted for the short-term effect of oil prices, which is aimed to assess the risk of deflation in real time. We illustrate the practical applications of these tools by predicting the evolution of inflation in the E.A., conditional to different scenarios of oil price deflation. Our main finding is that no deflationary scenario for oil prices results in a negative inflation rate forecast for December 2016, despite oil price variation accounting for 25% of the variance of changes in inflation.

People work for a guaranteed wage or operate a firm whose risky return depends on business expertise. The latter is culturally acquired, within the family or outside, and people may choose an occupation different from the one they were socialized into. A cultural bias towards safer occupations from colonial and post-colonial policies leads to stagnation where entrepreneurs do not upgrade technology because of their proficiency with existing methods. An aggregate productivity shock can tip this economy towards growth led by established businesses. A human capital shock where existing business expertise is less useful is more disruptive; growth occurs through the emergence of a new class of entrepreneurs.

In line with evolutionary theory, demand-driven entry in the market was first associated with product innovations and a rapid increase in the number of painters. After reaching a peak, the number of painters started to decrease in parallel with a price decline and the introduction of process innovations. To test for the role of profitability in the art market as a determinant of endogenous entry of painters, we build a price index for the representative painting inventoried in Dutch houses. This is based on hedonic regressions controlling for characteristics of the paintings (size, genre, placement in the house), the owners (job, religion, value of the collection, size of the house) and the painters. After a peak at the beginning of the century, the real price of paintings decreased until the end of the century. We provide anecdotal evidence for which high initial prices attracted entry of innovators, and econometric evidence on the causal relation between price movements and entry.","[Etro, Federico] Univ Venice Ca Foscari, Dept Econ, Fond Ta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Stepanova, Elena] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Lab Econ & Management, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Etro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Venice Ca Foscari, Dept Econ, Fond Ta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",federicoetro@yahoo.it; e.stepanova@sssup.it,"Stepanova, Elena/AAF-7111-2020","Stepanova, Elena/0000-0002-2924-4565",,,,,52,8,9,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We relate the difference in export ratios to firm-level differences in transport costs. In accordance with the data, we assume that freight rates are a function of firm-level export volumes. We test our model using Japanese manufacturing firm-level data. We first estimate the elasticity of the freight rate with respect to firm-level export volumes at the sector level. When feeding these estimates back into the model, it can explain more than 50% of the variation in firm-level export ratios.","[Forslid, Rikard] Univ Stockholm, Dept Econ, Univ 10A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Forslid, Rikard] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London SW1Y 6LA, England",Stockholm University; Keio University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Forslid, R (通讯作者)，Univ Stockholm, Dept Econ, Univ 10A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",rf@ne.su.se,,,"Kakenhi project [22330087]; Jan Wallander Research Foundation; Tom Hedelius' Research Foundation; Swedish Research Council; JSPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503, 26285058, 25285080, 15H03348] Funding Source: KAKEN","Kakenhi project; Jan Wallander Research Foundation; Tom Hedelius' Research Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors appreciate that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) has granted them access to Japanese micro-data (Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities).

Support is found for the hypothesis that there were two distinct developmental phases: before and after World War II. The evidence suggests that, in each phase, growth followed an innovation diffusion trajectory made possible by a growing capital stock. In the first phase, capital equipment seems to have augmented labour while, in the second, it reduced labour inputs, replaced by cheap fossil fuel inputs. This allowed significant transfers of labour into an expanding service sector. Strong economies of scale were operative in both phases, with labour hour inputs dominating in the first phase and fossil fuel consumption in the second. The results indicate that the Australian economy currently has very strong growth potential over the coming decade, although its heavy reliance on fossil fuels is viewed as a threat in the medium term.","[Foster, John] Univ Queensland, Brisbane St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Foster, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.foster@uq.edu.au,,"Foster, John/0000-0002-2601-1539",,,,,22,2,2,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper finds that cross-country heterogeneity leads to different efficiency rankings than previously thought, and that the hyperbolic order-a estimator leads to more robust efficiency scores when looking across different output measures, only looking at the more homogeneous OECD countries. It finds that the United States, if excluding the percent of healthcare expenditures that are publicly financed, is one of the more inefficient healthcare delivery systems in the world. What are commonly thought of as well-run healthcare systems (Austria and France) are either inefficient themselves or have variation in their efficiency rankings, showcasing difficulties in using other countries' healthcare systems as models for reform. It also finds that there has been productivity regression in all countries except the United States. These highlight the difficulties in cross-country efficiency comparisons.","[Gearhart, Richard] Calif State Univ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, Dept Econ, Econ, 20 BDC,9001 Stockdale Highway, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA",California State University System; California State University Bakersfield,"Gearhart, R (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, Dept Econ, Econ, 20 BDC,9001 Stockdale Highway, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",rgearhart1@csub.edu,,,,,,,33,17,17,0,11,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Based on critical assumptions of discourse theory developed by Laclau and Mouffe, the analysis explores assessments, reports, policy papers, and other central documents from three influential international organizationsthe International Energy Agency, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organizationthat provide an entry point to the global debate on biofuels. We show that the bioenergy concept occupies specific positions and conveys different meanings within the three overlapping discourses of energy, climate, and agriculture. These three discursive areas are further sutured around the notion of biofuel production, where a hegemonic thread of the capitalist market economics, fixated on economic growth and presupposing the necessity of cost-effectiveness, results in internal contradictions and dislocations within the win-win-win conceptualization, emptying bioenergy of any content.","[Kuchler, Magdalena] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Hedren, Johan] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Kuchler, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",magdalena.kuchler@liu.se,,"Kuchler, Magdalena/0000-0001-8110-4538",,,,,112,0,0,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The role of unemployment benefit reduction explains just about 5% of the observed decline.

Extending previous work by Wei et al., (2010) and Wang et al., (2016), we evaluate the forecasting performance of all these models via a superior predictive ability (SPA) test. We go beyond previous research by (i) considering oil price volatility in the nineteenth century along with recent data, (ii) applying different types of MSM models and (iii) considering value-at-risk predictions besides our forecasting of volatility. Confirming its successful performance in other studies, the new MSM model comes out as the model that most often across forecasting horizons and subsamples cannot be outperformed by other models. This superiority also applies to forecasting of value-at-risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that Brazil's commitments will be met through reduced deforestation, and at no additional cost; however, Mexico's pledges will cost 4 billion US dollars in terms of reduced GDP in 2020. We explore short and long-term implications of several policy scenarios after 2020, considering current policy debates in both countries. The comparative analysis of these two economies underscores the need for climate policy designed for the specific characteristics of each country, accounting for variables such as natural resources and current economic structure. Our results also suggest that both Brazil and Mexico may face other environmental and economic impacts from stringent global climate policies, affecting variables such as the value of energy resources in international trade.

Instead of estimating the latent factors from the data on corporate bonds, we use market proxies of level, slope and curvature of the corporate yield curve and credit spread. The results demonstrate that while monetary policy has the dominant impact among macroeconomic variables on the entire term structure, it is particularly strong at the short end and on credit spreads. Changes in credit spreads, in turn, also influence monetary policy.

Over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, the courts then developed an alternate, private-law set of rules on the basis of the old English trust and the Composition agreement, which belonged of the medieval cross European Law Merchant. The main advantage of this little-known institution was its perpetual character and the flexibility of its governance, and its main drawback was obviously the requirement of voluntary initial adhesion. Symmetrically, under the Continental model, collective action was easier to obtain but it did not extend beyond the doors of the court. The discussion brings forward two further themes: the symmetry between adjudication and voluntary adhesion to a collective contract; and the capacity of judges to invent new legal concepts out of diverse set of existing rules, rather than through the simple, bottom up approach usually emphasised by the literature on the Common Law tradition.

Specifically, after introducing migration in an augmented Solow-Swan model, we estimate a dynamic panel model using a system of generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) to address the risk of endogeneity bias in the migration variables. Two important findings emerge from our analysis. First, there exists a positive impact of migrants' human capital on GDP per capita, and second, a permanent increase in migration flows has a positive effect on GDP per worker. Moreover, the growth impact of immigration is high even in countries that have non-selective migration policies.","[Boubtane, Ekrame] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Bd F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Boubtane, Ekrame] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Dumont, Jean-Christophe] OECD, Int Migrat Div, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris, France; [Rault, Christophe] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO UMR 7322, Rue Blois,BP 26739, F-45067 Orleans, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans,"Boubtane, E (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Bd F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.;Boubtane, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",ekrame.boubtane@gmail.com,,"Boubtane, Ekrame/0000-0001-9258-6835",Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the Investissements d'avenir programme [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI),Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the Investissements d'avenir programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI),"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01] programme, and the Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI) to [E.B].",,52,56,62,5,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper examines the role of time-varying payroll taxes and the social safety net for cyclical fluctuations in a nonmonetary economy with labor market frictions and unemployment insurance, when the latter is only imperfectly related to search effort. A balanced social insurance budget induces countercyclical payroll taxation, renders gross wages more rigid over the cycle and strengthens the model's endogenous propagation mechanism. For conventional calibrations, the model generates a negatively sloped Beveridge curve and countercyclical unemployment as well as substantial volatility and persistence of vacancies and unemployment.","[Burda, Michael C.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Weder, Mark] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Adelaide,"Burda, MC (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.;Weder, M (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",burda@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; mark.weder@adelaide.edu.au,,"Weder, Mark/0000-0001-8633-8499",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation [AUS/1132996]; Australian Research Council [DP1096358]; Netherlands Institute of Advanced Study; Collaborative Research Center 649 of the German Science Foundation; Australian Research Council [DP1096358] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Netherlands Institute of Advanced Study; Collaborative Research Center 649 of the German Science Foundation; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We are grateful to the editor Marios Angeletos and four referees of this journal, Katherine Abraham, Robert Barro, Monique Ebell, Chris Edmond, Francisco Gonzalez, Bob Gregory, Dan Hamermesh, Tom Krebs, Nir Jaimovich, Francois Langot, Ian McLean, Christian Merkl, Alex Meyer-Gohde, Javier Perez, Bruce Preston, Dennis Snower, Lutz Weinke, Jake Wong, Randall Wright as well as seminar participants at Adelaide, ANU, Barcelona GSE 2014, Bonn, CEMFI, Cologne, CBS, Deakin, Humboldt, Kiel, Leipzig, Mannheim, Maryland, McGill, Melbourne, Milwaukee, QUT, SED, Tubingen, Tulane, Utrecht, EEA, EALE/SOLE, MMF, Glasgow S&M Network Conference, SWIM, and Texas for useful comments and discussions.

Controlling for demographic characteristics and state and year fixed effects, changes in these economic variables collectively explain 37% of the rise in body mass index (BMI), 43% of the rise in obesity, and 59% of the rise in Class II/III obesity. Quantile regressions also point to large effects among the heaviest individuals, with half the rise in the 90th percentile of BMI explained by economic factors.

We show that fast-growing provinces experienced less capital inflows before the large-scale market reform, contrary to the prediction of the neoclassical growth theory. As China transitioned from the central-planning economy to the market economy, the negative correlation between productivity growth and capital inflows became much less pronounced.

That is, does the Coase theorem hold? We study this classic question through the lens of a non-cooperative model of contract negotiations, considering both compulsory and voluntary participation in negotiations. In either case, we find that all consistent equilibria of the contracting game are efficient in the case of two players. But if participation is voluntary, and there are more than two players, there are situations in which all consistent equilibria are inefficient. Specifically, the provision of public goods tends to be inefficiently low due to strategic abstention from contracting. Free-riding on others' agreements can be avoided if individuals do not own all their actions. When actions involve the use of assets, efficient action ownership may correspond to collective rather than individual asset ownership.","[Ellingsen, Tore; Paltseva, Elena] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ellingsen, Tore] Norwegian Sch Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Paltseva, Elena] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",Stockholm School of Economics; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); New Economic School,,,"Ellingsen, Tore/E-9356-2011",,Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Finansmarkedsfondet,Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Finansmarkedsfondet,"A previous version of this article was circulated under the title Non-cooperative Contracting.

(b) The time horizon (time scale) is relevant not only for the intensity but for the structure of price co-movement as well; in the long-run, there is an asymmetry in price dependence in the sense that strong positive shocks are transmitted with a higher intensity compared to strong negative ones.

We show that a non-selective immigration policy choice affects and is affected by the migratory decisions of skilled and unskilled foreign workers. From this interaction multiple equilibria may arise, which are driven by the natives' expectations on the skill composition of migrants. In particular, pessimistic (optimistic) beliefs induce a country to impose higher (lower) barriers to immigration, which worsen (improve) the skill composition of immigrants and thus confirm initial beliefs. This mechanism induces immigration policy to be self-confirming.

However, in addition to a positive impact on product availability and sale, higher inventory levels may cause problems in performing in-store activities. As poor backroom-to-shelf replenishment process emerges as one of the most common causes of stock-out situations, this article compares store and on-shelf FMCG product availability at SKU level in different stores of a single retailer. In relation to this, besides direct, we have also investigated the indirect effect of inventory level on sale, by using store and shelf out-of-stocks as mediators. The results of the research showing much higher level of shelf- compared to store stock-out rate confirmed the existence of the problem in the realization of internal product flows within retail stores. However, despite the occurrence of this problem, besides direct positive effect of inventory level on sale, its indirect effect was positive as well. Therefore, these results were analysed in the context of other similar studies.

In general, rent-seeking models assume that the number of contenders in a rent-seeking contest is known with certainty but, given the hidden nature of rent seeking, participants in rent seeking more usually can be expected to face an uncertain number of rivals. We show that, in a Tullock contest with a stochastic number of participants, complete ex-ante rent dissipation is consistent with a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. This contrasts with but complements previous results of under-dissipation when the number of rent seekers is uncertain.

I argue that Schneider's (2016) analysis and data confirm and complement the main findings in Malmendier and Lee (2011), but neither his nor our data permit us to quantitatively assess the relative importance of these determinants.

The results of the country-specific unbiasedness tests are mixed. However, the panel-based unbiasedness test results show that forecasts are biased. The efficiency test results indicate that forecasters do not incorporate all available information into their forecasts. We also find that emerging markets' interest rates are more predictable than the developed markets' interest rates at the shorter horizon due mainly to high inflation in the emerging markets. We also check for the robustness of our findings by dividing the sample period into two sub-periods, before and after the global financial crisis of 2007. We did not find any significant difference in the sub-period results compared to the full period. By considering a new group of countries (emerging economies), a new data source, and a new estimation approach, our study contributes to the financial market efficiency literature, especially on emerging markets. Investors and monetary policy makers should use these data cautiously as forecasts are not efficient. The study also has implications for monetary policy transparency and independence.

We show that tagging by occupation is preferable to testing when the audit technology is relatively expensive and/or the proportion of disabled workers differs markedly across occupations.

When contracts are long-term and inflexible, such naive consumers would increase the costs of insurance for low risk consumers. The competitive insurance market therefore offers flexible contracts that allow for switching between different tariffs. Sophisticated consumers choose a partial insurance tariff and remain low-risks. Naive consumers choose the same tariff, but later switch to full insurance, and become high-risks. If there are sufficiently many naive consumers, they pay a transfer to sophisticated consumers (so that high-risks subsidize low-risks). In contrast, there are no such transfers when contracts are short-term. The model generates novel implications for the time frame of insurance contracts and insurance requirements.

The rent deregulation process in the Czech Republic started in 2006, two years after joining the European Union. By design, the maximum regulated rent appreciation depended explicitly on real estate prices, which accelerated the pace of deregulation due to rapidly rising prices at the time. A unique dataset enables us to track the tenure choice of households from consumption surveys for subsequent years. The proportion of households that switched from renting to owning sharply increased among renters of regulated apartments. We show that this change was caused by the deregulation process.

After documenting both how tax policy has changed since 1980 and the impact of these changes on the cost of capital, this paper investigates that question using a UK dataset. The paper shows that tax changes have had large impacts on the user cost of capital, but that estimates of the user cost elasticity imply quite small impacts on the long-run capital stock. Adopting an alternative experimental approach for the first time using UK data shows large impacts of taxation on investment in periods following the announcement of major reforms.","[Wallis, Gavin] UCL, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England; [Wallis, Gavin] Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England",University of London; University College London; Bank of England,"Wallis, G (通讯作者)，UCL, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.;Wallis, G (通讯作者)，Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",gavin.wallis@bankofengland.co.uk,,,Her Majesty's Treasury,Her Majesty's Treasury,This work was supported by Her Majesty's Treasury.,,39,5,6,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper builds an integrated framework that incorporates the impact of those firm's internal factors and their interactions with external drivers on the development and adoption of eco-innovations.

We use a unique dataset of electricity consumption by public housing residents in Singapore measured at the building level and merge it with the dataset of construction sites for the periods from 2009 to 2011. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that electricity consumption by the households living close to the construction sites increases by 6% compared to the households who are not affected by noises from construction sites during the construction periods, after controlling for building and month of the year fixed effects. The results remain robust after controlling for spatial autocorrelated lag and error terms. The economic cost of the construction externalities for each household amounts to approximately S$98 per annum. We also find that the increases in electricity consumption of the affected households were persistent, and the electricity consumption of the affected households did not revert to the pre-construction levels, after the removal of the negative externality.

The private and social costs from such events run into millions of dollars. In this paper, we use a unique dataset to examine the impact on residential house prices affected by natural disasters using a hedonic property (HP) values approach. For this purpose, we use data before and after a wildfire and floods from Rockhampton in central Queensland, Australia. The data is unique because one suburb was affected by wildfires and another was affected by floods. For the analysis, three suburbs namely Frenchville, Park Avenue and Norman Gardens are used. Frenchville was significantly affected by wildfires in the latter part of 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2012, while Park Avenue was affected by floods at the end of 2010, January 2011-2013. Norman Gardens, which was relatively unaffected, is used as a control site. This enables us to examine the before and after effects on property values in the three suburbs. The results confirm that soon after a natural disaster property prices in affected areas decrease even though the large majority of individual houses remain unaffected. Furthermore, the results indicate that the largely unaffected suburb may gain immediately after a natural disaster but this gain may disappear if natural disasters continue to occur in the area/region due to the stigma created. The results have several important policy decision and welfare implications which are briefly discussed in the paper.","[Athukorala, Wasantha] Univ Peradeniya, Fac Arts, Dept Econ & Stat, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; [Martin, Wade] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, MS 4607, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Neelawala, Prasad; Rajapaksa, Darshana; Wilson, Clevo] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",University of Peradeniya; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Wilson, C (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au,"Athukorala, Wasantha/ABC-6674-2021; Athukorala, Wasantha/CAJ-5658-2022; Rajapaksa, Darshana/AGQ-8557-2022","Rajapaksa, Darshana/0000-0002-8161-7963; Athukorala, Wasantha/0000-0003-3757-4780; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",,,,,46,11,12,1,43,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We document and test the implications of self-selection in the context of randomised policy experiment we conducted in primary schools in the UK. The main questions we ask are (1) is there evidence of selection on key observable characteristics likely to matter for the outcome of interest and (2) to what extent does selection matter. The experimental work consists in testing the effects of an intervention aimed at encouraging children to make more healthy choices at lunch. We recruited schools through local authorities and randomised schools across two incentive treatments and a control group. We document the selection-taking place both at the level of local authorities and at the school level. Overall we find mild evidence of selection on key observables such as obesity levels and socio-economic characteristics. We find evidence of selection along indicators of involvement in healthy lifestyle programmes at the school level, but the magnitude is small. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, we undertake for the first time an interdisciplinary review of economic and political studies on the size and determinants of the shadow economy, tax evasion, undeclared work and, moreover, of their relation with corruption in Greece in order to reveal the extent and complexity of these phenomena. We estimate the size and determinants of the shadow economy via a multiple-indicators-multiple-causes (MIMIC) approach. Our findings indicate that the important determinants are factors related to macroeconomic conditions, such as unemployment and GDP growth, and institutional factors, such as tax morale and the rule of law. We also indicate that the shadow economy and corruption are complementary and that the official and the shadow economy substitute each other over the business cycle. An adoption of policy based on these findings would lead to a successful transfer of part of the shadow economy to the official economy, would boost government revenue, and would eventually lead the Greek economy out of the depression that emerged as a result of the sovereign debt crisis.","[Bitzenis, Aristidis] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Bitzenis, Aristidis; Vlachos, Vasileios] TALIS, Raleigh, NC USA; [Schneider, Friedrich] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria",University of Macedonia; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Bitzenis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece.",,"Vlachos, Vasileios/AAV-1220-2021; Bitzenis, Aristidis/AAM-1294-2021; Vlachos, Vasileios/AEL-9747-2022",,European Union (European Social Fund); Greek national funds,European Union (European Social Fund)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT),The above-mentioned research is implemented through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning and co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national funds.

While we find this behavior in times of generally rising crude oil prices, we find the opposite to be true during times of generally falling crude oil prices, a phenomenon we call balloons and rocks behavior. This result was obtained by testing for parameter stability in error-correction models which were estimated for periods of significant variability in both crude oil and gasoline prices. The data used to estimate these results is unique in the literature as it is comprised of daily U.S. retail gasoline prices and daily crude oil prices. The sample was taken during the Great Recession, an exceptional period of time that saw both sharp increases and decreases in gasoline and crude oil prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This effect exists in the absence of a lending boom and is found in both net and gross inflows bonanzas. This effect is driven by portfolio-equity and debt flows.

For a regulatory race to occur, firms must migrate across state or country borders in response to geographic differences in the costs and benefits of regulation, and governments must shape their regulatory policies with the aim of affecting those migration flows. We find that both these conditions hold only in rare circumstances. Instead, the much more common outcome is for political pressures within jurisdictions to produce a heterogeneous pattern resembling Tiebout sorting.

There is a relatively new strand of literature that focuses on comparing income-expenditure patterns of households to calculate the degree of underreporting of income levels by self-employed and privately employed individuals, as compared with public servants. We use the 2008 Household Budget Survey of North Cyprus and analyze the differences in food consumption patterns among three kinds of employees: self-employed, privately employed, and public. We found that self-employed and privately employed individuals underreport their income levels by 20 percent and 13 percent, respectively, compared with publicly employed individuals. This has important implications for the aggregate economy in North Cyprus, where we estimate that the shadow economy created by underreporting is as much as 8.6 percent of GNP and 11.1 percent of total tax revenue.","[Ekici, Tufan] Middle E Tech Univ, Northern Cyprus Campus, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Besim, Mustafa] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Via Mersin 10 Turkey, Gazimagusa, Cyprus",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Besim, M (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Via Mersin 10 Turkey, Gazimagusa, Cyprus.",mustafa.besim@emu.edu.tr,,"Besim, Mustafa/0000-0003-0749-1861",,,,,30,17,17,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Larger countries and more developed countries have more exporters, larger exporters, and a greater share of exports controlled by the top 5%. The extensive margin (more firms) plays a greater role than the intensive margin (average size) in supporting exports of larger countries. In contrast, the intensive margin is relatively more important in explaining the exports of richer countries. Exporter entry and exit rates are higher and entrant survival is lower at an early stage of development. We discuss the results in light of trade theories with heterogeneous firms and the empirical literature on resource allocation, firm size, and development. An implication from our findings is that developing countries export less because the top of the firm-size distribution is truncated. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Weights are given by the individual occupational probability distribution. Under this measure, a worker is more employable than another if she has a greater chance to obtain a better paid occupation. After normalization, expected employability corresponds to the population correlation between occupational predicted wages and the chance to obtain employment in these occupations and serves as a measure of the allocative efficiency of labor market. We apply the methodology to Brazil and found that employability increased and became less unequally distributed from 2002 to 2011. We used a decomposition method to investigate the causes of these changes. Although average normalized employability is weakly positive, it has increased for the period, which suggests that there is room for efficiency gains in the allocation of workers to occupations in the Brazilian labor market.","[Firpo, Sergio; Pieri, Renan] Sao Paulo Sch Econ, FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Firpo, Sergio] IZA, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Carvalho, Sandro] IPEA DF, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA),"Firpo, S (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ, FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Firpo, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",sergio.firpo@fgv.br,,"Firpo, Sergio/0000-0003-2545-7536",CNPq,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Part of this work was produced under two World Bank projects: Job Quality and Employability in Brazilian Labor Markets: Methodology and Definitions and Enhancing Employability of the Poor.

In this paper, we address the question on which subsets of plays the condition of payoff continuity can be dropped without losing existence. Our main result is that if payoff continuity only fails on a sigma-discrete set (a countable union of discrete sets) of plays, then a subgame-perfect epsilon-equilibrium, for every epsilon > 0, still exists. For a partial converse, given any subset of plays that is not sigma-discrete, we construct a game in which the payoff functions are continuous outside this set but the game admits no subgame-perfect epsilon-equilibrium for small epsilon > 0.","[Flesch, Janos] Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Predtetchinski, Arkadi] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Predtetchinski, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",j.flesch@maastrichtuniversity.nl; a.predtetchinski@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Predtetchinski, Arkadi/0000-0002-6658-303X",,,,,11,6,6,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In this study, we seek to provide new insights on this key-question using a network approach. We study how the resilience of a banking network evolves as we shock an initially homogenous competitive market with a sequence of M&A activities that significantly alter the topology of the network. We study how different M&A treatments impact the structural vulnerabilities that can propagate through the system and we show that the severity of contagion and default dynamics depends on the chosen treatment. The desirability of alternative competitive settings (such as a hub-centered market or a more concentrated and yet symmetric market) are assessed against a homogenous benchmark case. We show that the choice depends crucially on the size of the interbank market and the level of bank capitalization. The existence of a large highly connected hub is beneficial in a capitalized network with a well-developed interbank market, but it can significantly weaken the system's resilience in a poorly capitalized market. Antitrust and competition authorities should adopt a state-contingent approach to M&A activities according to the market conditions in which banks operate.","[Gaffeo, E.] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Trento, Italy; [Molinari, M.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",University of Trento; Sapienza University Rome,"Molinari, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",edoardo.gaffeo@unitn.it; massimo.molinari@uniroma1.it,"Gaffeo, Edoardo/C-8634-2011","MOLINARI, MASSIMO/0000-0001-8635-5053; Gaffeo, Edoardo/0000-0002-2236-2104",Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) grant on Financial fragility and systemic risk,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) grant on Financial fragility and systemic risk,Edoardo Gaffeo and Massimo Molinari gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) grant on Financial fragility and systemic risk.

When constrained households engage in deleveraging, the interest rate needs to fall to induce unconstrained households to pick up the decline in aggregate demand. If the fall in the interest rate is limited by the zero lower bound, aggregate demand is insufficient and the economy enters a liquidity trap. In this environment, households' ex ante leverage and insurance decisions are associated with aggregate demand externalities. Welfare can be improved with macroprudential policies targeted toward reducing leverage. Interest rate policy is inferior to macroprudential policies in dealing with excessive leverage.","[Korinek, Anton] Johns Hopkins Univ, 3400 North Charles St,456 Mergenthaler Hall, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Korinek, Anton; Simsek, Alp] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Simsek, Alp] MIT, 400 Main St,Bldg E17,Room 244, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Simsek, Alp] CEPR, London, England",Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Korinek, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, 3400 North Charles St,456 Mergenthaler Hall, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Korinek, A; Simsek, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Simsek, A (通讯作者)，MIT, 400 Main St,Bldg E17,Room 244, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;Simsek, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",akorinek@jhu.edu; asimsek@mit.edu,,"Simsek, Alp/0009-0005-9128-3249","INET/CIGI; IMF Research Fellowship; NSF [SES-1455319]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1455319] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","INET/CIGI; IMF Research Fellowship; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Korinek: Johns Hopkins University, 3400 North Charles Street, 456 Mergenthaler Hall, Baltimore, MD 21218, and NBER (e-mail: akorinek@jhu.edu); Simsek: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 400 Main Street, Building E17, Room 244, Cambridge, MA 02142, NBER, and CEPR (e-mail: asimsek@mit.edu).

We first identify whether corporate governance can still be an influential factor or has been largely captured by the traditional Fama-French three-factor model. More importantly, our study adds a financial distress factor to the Fama-French three-factor model to form a four-factor pricing model (labelled as the financial distress four-factor model'). We find that for the US Russell 1000 firms, the financial distress four-factor model is the better model of the two models considered. We further find that the financial distress four-factor model has a higher explanatory power in capturing the return variation. We find that the differences between the return of firms with good (weak) corporate governance and the expected return are insignificantly different from zero for most portfolios in all the two models. The financial distress four-factor model, however, has the fewer portfolios with return difference being significantly different from zero, implying that corporate governance has been better priced in the financial distress factor.","[Lai, Syouching] Chang Jung Christian Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Tainan, Taiwan; [Li, Hungchih] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accounting, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Li, Bin] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Chang Jung Christian University; National Cheng Kung University; Griffith University,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accounting, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",hcli@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,1,2,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Prison and jail incarceration rates as well as community correctional populations have increased greatly since the mid-1970s. Both of these developments have disproportionately impacted poor and minority communities. In this paper, we document these trends. We then assess whether the crime declines can be attributed to the massive expansion of the US criminal justice system. We argue that the crime rate is certainly lower as a result of this expansion and in the early 1990s was likely a third lower than what it would have been absent changes in sentencing practices in the 1980s. However, there is little evidence that further stiffening of sentences during the 1990s-a period when prison and other correctional populations expanded rapidly-have had an impact. Hence, the growth in criminal justice populations since 1990s has exacerbated socioeconomic inequality in the United States without generating much benefit in terms of lower crime rates.","[Lofstrom, Magnus] Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA USA; [Raphael, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lofstrom, M (通讯作者)，Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA USA.",lofstrom@ppic.org; stevenraphael@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,68,31,50,3,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

A total of 109 tourism students were surveyed to find the key factors affecting their entrepreneurial intention by factor analysis. The six hypotheses were then tested in a sample of 267 Chinese tourism students. According to structural equation modelling (SEM), it was found that there are statistically significant relationships between personal attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and entrepreneurial intention. Multi-group analysis further showed that there are differences between personal attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control according to different personal variables. The results highlight the importance of taking a subdividing approach when researching the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention. Thus, we believe a number of implications about the most effective role of creating entrepreneurial atmosphere from universities, enhancing tourism students' self-efficacy, and setting student-centred policies in promoting and developing entrepreneurial intention.","[Mei, Hu; Ma, Zicheng] S China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Sci Lab Econ Behav, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zehui] S China Normal Univ, Ctr Educ Informat Technol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zehui; Fong, Patrick S.

Without any knowledge of how agents revise their beliefs this impossibility result extends to dynamic mechanisms. In contrast, we show that if the agents revise their beliefs according to the forward-induction logic embedded in strong rationalizability, admitting dynamic mechanisms leads to considerable gains. We show that all ex-post incentive compatible social choice functions are robustly virtually implementable in private consumption environments satisfying a weak sufficient condition, regardless of the level of preference interdependence. This result derives from the key insight that in such environments, in every belief-complete type space under common strong belief in rationality (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002), dynamic mechanisms can distinguish all payoff type profiles by their strategic choices. Notably, dynamic mechanisms can robustly virtually implement the efficient allocation of an object in cases that static mechanisms cannot. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We compare a formal Baron-Ferejohn bargaining procedure to an informal procedure where players make and accept proposals in continuous time. Both constitute non-cooperative games corresponding to the same bargaining problem: a three-player median voter setting with an external disagreement point. This allows us to study formality in the presence and absence of a core and provides a natural explanation for the effects of preference polarization. Our results show that polarization hurts the median player and that formality matters. The median player is significantly better off under informal bargaining. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, collective disaster mitigation measures are urgent, and it is important to understand people's pro-social attitude toward such countermeasures. However, few studies on this issue have been conducted in the context of developing countries, such as Bangladesh, and we therefore address this issue. We made a questionnaire survey of 1,000 respondents and elicited (i) a willingness to donate their labor (WDL) and (ii) a willingness to pay (WTP) to collective countermeasures for avoiding the damages from cyclones and associated disasters. With this data, we examine WDL and WTP in relation to respondents' occupation, education and income. The novelty lies in offering respondents an option of choosing WDL and/or WTP in the questionnaire. The study finds that the poor and less educated people are likely to choose WDL and willing to donate more labor, while rich and educated people are likely to choose WTP and willing to donate more money. However, we also find that voluntary labor donation from poor and less educated people is significant in that donation from poor and less educated people exceeds that from rich and educated people on per-household basis. Poor and less educated people may be more pro-social and WDL is an important source of contribution to be utilized in natural disaster mitigation of developing countries. This finding can be considered a useful guidance for future policies in more general cases, since it is consistent with observed labor donations for the recovery in the 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan.","[Shahrier, Shibly; Kotani, Koji] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 2-22 Eikokuji Cho, Kochi, Kochi 7800844, Japan",Kochi University Technology,"Kotani, K (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 2-22 Eikokuji Cho, Kochi, Kochi 7800844, Japan.",kotani.koji@kochi-tech.ac.jp,"Kotani, Koji/X-7947-2019; Kotani, Koji/C-6896-2011; Shahirier, Shibly/AAD-3234-2022","Kotani, Koji/0000-0003-0667-1895; Kotani, Koji/0000-0003-0667-1895; Shahirier, Shibly/0000-0003-4096-5424",Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science; Promotion Mutual Aid Cooperation for Private Schools of Japan; Kochi University of Technology,"Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Promotion Mutual Aid Cooperation for Private Schools of Japan; Kochi University of Technology","The authors thank anonymous referees, Hiroaki Miyamoto and Makoto Kakinaka for their helpful comments, advice and supports.

Buyers face different levels of uncertainty about their valuations in the advance selling period: one group of buyers (called informed buyers) know their individual valuations while the other group (called uninformed buyers) only know the distribution of their valuations. We find that the seller's optimal pricing strategy depends on his capacity size as well as the size of informed buyers. For a small capacity size, the Constant Price strategy with the highest possible price is adopted. For sufficiently large capacity sizes, both Advance Purchase Discount and Advance Purchase Premium strategies may be optimal. In general, the larger the size of informed buyers the more likely an Advance Purchase Premium strategy is adopted.","[Wang, X.

We examine the relationship between real per capita GDP growth, exchange rate regimes, and the incidence of crises. Asymmetries are also explored. While exchange rate regimes of all types can promote positive economic growth, disaggregation by region or country type yields significantly different results. Pegged regimes work best for emerging market economies while crawling regimes deliver the greatest boost to economic growth in the G20. However, unlike the extant literature, the foregoing positive influences are offset when economies are in a downturn. An important finding is that exchange rate regimes and financial crises interact. In almost all cases and types of financial crises, pegged regimes exert a negative impact on economic growth even after controlling for several economic factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When the bank acts as a beneficiary in CRT, an increase in the CRT transaction increases the optimal bank interest margin and decreases the default risk in the bank's equity return. When the bank acts as a guarantor, CRT is found to increase the bank interest margin and default risk in a more sensitive way, compared to a situation where government capital injection is increased. Government capital injection is found to increase the bank interest margin and reduce default risk in a more sensitive way, compared to a situation where CRT is increased regardless of whether the bank is a protection buyer or seller.

In the modeling process, calculating score of the distribution is a key part. When selecting scale or variance to calculate the score, two subclasses of DCS models with skew Student distribution are derived. We study them separately in detail, and the models with leverage have been presented too. For estimating one-day-ahead VaR and ES, we combine these models with AR(1) into new ones.

Electricity prices are modelled as a regime switching stochastic process. The optimal control is determined by solving the HJB equation numerically using a fully implicit finite difference approach with semi-Lagrangian time stepping. The paper focuses on the effect of ramping restrictions on a hydro plant's value and optimal operations, and provides an analysis of which factors cause ramping restrictions to have a greater or lesser impact on profitability. It is shown that hydro plant value is negatively affected by ramping restrictions, but the extent of the impact depends on key parameters which determine the desirability of frequent changes in water release rates. Interestingly for the case considered, value is not sensitive to ramping restrictions over a large range of restrictions. The results point to the importance of accurately modelling electricity prices in gauging the trade offs involved in imposing restrictions on hydro operators which may hinder their ability to respond to volatile electricity prices and meet peak demands.

If countries maximize welfare, a negative slope (reflecting strategic substitutability) occurs under relatively mild conditions. The strategic tax response is crucial for understanding tax competition games, as well as the welfare effects of partial tax unions (whereby a subset of countries coordinate their tax rates). Indeed, contrary to earlier findings that have assumed strategic complementarity in tax rates, we show that partial tax unions might reduce welfare under strategic substitutability.","[Vrijburg, Hendrik] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Mooij, Ruud A.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; International Monetary Fund,"Vrijburg, H (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vrijburg@ese.eur.nl; RDeMooij@imf.org,,,,,,,44,18,18,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In contrast to previous literature, we split the effects of volatility on growth into direct and indirect effects using partial derivative impacts approach. We found that both the direct and indirect effects of volatility on growth are negative; the latter effect suggesting the transmission of volatility shocks to neighbouring countries.

We employ 7829 firm-year observations from the 2007 to 2011 years of the Kauffman Firm Survey microdata sample in our analysis. A stochastic frontier model empirically supports the result that technical productive efficiency is positively related to the foreign sales ratio.

This methodology consists of creation and consequent application of methods and the model for the quality-in-use of LORs. LOR The model of the quality-in-use of LORs is presented in this paper. The methodology for evaluating the quality-in-use of LORs is based on the general MCEQLS (Multiple Criteria Evaluation of the Quality of Learning Software) approach to evaluate the quality of learning software. The essential part of the novel methodology is the application of improved Fuzzy AHP method to establish criteria weights of the quality-in-use of LORs. It is shown that the created methodology is suitable and stable for evaluating the quality of LOR features and its functionality. A more detail presentation is given on the results of the expert evaluation of the quality-in-use of three LORs that are most popular in Lithuania against the proposed methodology.

On the contrary, internal institutional arrangements - payroll taxation, the minimum wage or the price wedge between manufacturing and consumption prices - together with a higher exposure to international trade - connected to the increasing globalization of the Colombian economy - appear as the crucial drivers. These findings lead us to question the political strategy followed to attain cost competitiveness in a context of growing exposure to international trade.

The first one leads to the uniformity of higher education. Unification in the frame of Bologna Process has forced the EU to build an education system on the Anglo-American model, which violates the sovereignty and traditions. Proposed here another type of globalization, the sameness of rules, does not violate the sovereignty, preserving the features of shape, but offers a universal adherence to the rules, filling the old form by different content. The article examines the 4 rules of the globalization of higher education: academic freedom, employment security (tenure), university autonomy and internal democracy. We have got a global principals and a variety of forms from country to country. These rules are functionally interrelated principles of education management. Academic freedom without reliable procedures of selective screening of persons that able to engage in scientific work, will lead to the stagnation of the scientific process. But once granted academic freedom needs to be protected by employment security (tenure). Tenure, in turn, is a condition of the formation of scientific schools, ensuring the continuity of cooperation of scientific work that is not possible with short-tern employment contracts and the constant movement of scientists between universities. Internal democracy and appointment by-election allow controlling the university administration. We need to return to four interrelated concepts to be successful in concurrence. Compliance with the rules while maintaining the traditions and cultural features ofuniversity management allows us to maintain the process of reproduction the diversity as a basis for true unity.","[Alpatov, Gennady E.; Bortnikova, Helena G.] St Petersburg State Univ, Tchaikovsky St 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191123, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Bortnikova, HG (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Tchaikovsky St 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191123, Russia.",g.alpatov@spbu.ru.mail; bbortnik_78@mail.ru,"alpatov, gennady/M-2379-2015",,,,,,16,5,5,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,25,32,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800004,0

The most common factor that encourages the initiation of the business transfer process is company owner's age, that is, retirement. It is estimated that each year in the European Union around 450,000 companies with around 2 million employees go through the business transfer process, and that the issue of business transfer is not adequately approached in approximately 150,000 companies, which jeopardizes around 600,000 jobs (European Commission, 2011). Underestimating the complexity and longevity of the business transfer process can have significant negative implications for companies, their owners, as well as for a wide network of stakeholders-company owner's family members, employees, suppliers, buyers, banks, local self-government and the national economy in general. Business transfer is an especially important topic for the economy of Eastern Croatia, because of the significant number of owners of small and medium enterprises who are older than 55 years who will in the near future have to deal with the issue of the sustainability of the company after their withdrawal from the business. Previous studies have identified the key components of business transfer ecosystems on which it is necessary to build a support system for the owners of small and medium enterprises, which are in the phase of preparation or implementation of these processes (Van Teeffelen, 2012, European Commission, 2013). The aim of this paper is to analyse the quality of the business transfer ecosystem in Eastern Croatia and the readiness of individual actors and components of the ecosystem to provide support to owners of small and medium businesses in the business transfer process. In the conclusion of the paper, policy recommendations for improving the quality of the business transfer ecosystemin Eastern Croatia are identified.","[Alpeza, Mirela; Juric, Petra Mezulic; Peterka, Suncica Oberman] Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Alpeza, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",malpeza@efos.hr; pmezulic@efos.hr; suncica@efos.hr,"Juric, Petra Mezulić/AAU-6276-2020","Juric, Petra Mezulić/0000-0003-3660-5215",,,,,24,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,80,90,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600007,0

Three areas of factors were evaluated in the context of research which may affect the attractiveness of the region and thereby induce population movements in the region. Factors were purposefully selected from areas that are relatively vulnerable residents. This is an area of environmental issues relating to employment and the safety (crime). In the first phase of research purposely chosen different factors were compared, which were evaluated separately and partly through multi-criteria analysis-method of determining the order. Subsequently, the data were transformed into the interval from 0 to 255 for each region and visualized using the RGB method. To complement the data compares well with the combinations of pairs of areas. The results are displayed using a color scale, each of the selected area is represented by the appropriate shade of red, green and blue components of the color spectrum. The resulting models were compared with the movement (increase, decrease) of population in districts.

To do so we construct and quantitatively assess an equilibrium search model with on-the-job search, general human capital accumulation and two sided heterogeneity. In the model workers differ in abilities and firms differ in their productivities. The model generates a simple (log) wage variance decomposition that is used to measure the importance of firm and worker productivity differentials, frictional wage dispersion and workers' sorting dynamics. We calibrate the model using a sample of young workers from the UK. We show that heterogeneity among firms generates great deal of wage inequality. Among low skilled workers job ladder effects are small, most of the impact of experience on wages is due to learning-by-doing. High skilled workers are much more mobile. Job ladder effects have sizeable impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

For men, there is on average no evidence of a significant change, which differs from the results of studies in other countries. However, estimates are heterogeneous by marital status, suggesting that married men do not increase their effort on household production because they can rely on their spouses. I also discuss other possible explanations, in particular men dedicating their time to semi-leisure chores that do not fall under the definition of housework used in SILC.

The stability of the relationship between export (inflows) and import (outflows) is assessed using the tests proposed by Mohitosh Kejriwal and Pierre Perron (2010). In particular, the nature of the long-run relationship, when multiple regime shifts are identified endogenously, is analyzed using the residual-based test of the null hypothesis of cointegration with multiple breaks proposed by Kejriwal (2008). The results clearly indicate that, for all countries, (i) the stability tests reject the null of coefficient stability of the long-run relationship between exports and imports; (ii) the cointegration tests that correspond to the number of breaks selected reject the null of cointegration (weak form of sustainability); and (iii) the strong form of sustainability hypothesis is not supported by the data for all countries in most regimes but not for 20 of 28 countries especially in the last regime (the post 2000 era).

The evaluation is considered an important aspect in developing countries, such as the distinction between formal and informal workers. The estimates show that, in general, the elasticity of market potential on wages is 0.082, which is robust to different measures related to the theories of agglomeration and endogeneity problems and spatial autocorrelation. It is also found that wages of informal workers are less sensitive to changes in market potential compared to the wages of formal employees and benefit from externalities generated by the presence of foreign firms. A simulation suggests that up to 10.7% of the wage gap between workers in states bordering North America and located in southern Mexico can be attributed to economic geography; this effect is smaller for informal workers and for the case of formal doubles.","[Enrique Cardoso-Vargas, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Cardoso-Vargas, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",CarlosEnrique.Cardoso@uab.cat,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,11,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Innovation policy therefore becomes one of the most important public policies and a great emphasis is paid on its effective implementation, both on the national and the European level. One of the most discussed approaches to implementation of innovation policy is the concept of regional innovation systems. This concept lays stress on connections between actors and mutual learning. In the concept of regional innovation systems innovation policy is implemented through policy mixes which react to specific regional needs. The choice of instruments is a complicated process requiring careful analysis of regional strength and weaknesses and also a very good knowledge of existing innovation instruments and their characteristics. The aim of the paper is to classify innovation instruments from several viewpoints and to outline steps which should be followed while creating policy mix.

In this paper, we show how the design of environmental policy in a federal system has implications for the effects of trade reform. Trade liberalization leads to a decline in pollution taxes, regardless of whether pollution taxes are set at the federal (centralized) or local (decentralized) level, and it increases social welfare. The effect under a decentralized system is smaller than if these taxes are set by the federal government, and pollution emissions therefore decline in this case. Moreover, majority bias interacts with trade liberalization if federal taxes are used.","[Fredriksson, Per G.] Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Matschke, Xenia] Univ Trier, DE-54286 Trier, Germany",University of Louisville; Universitat Trier,"Fredriksson, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.;Matschke, X (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, DE-54286 Trier, Germany.",per.fredriksson@louisville.edu; matschke@uni-trier.de,,,,,,,41,2,2,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

The efforts, which are made by various countries (especially the countries of the EU) in order to fight against tax avoidance or aggressive schemas of planning, are accentuated. The international business often uses such instrument as offshore companies for this purpose. Since the performance of the companies, which belong to this category, is treated as breaking the law, they are perceived as illegal automatically. In juridical sense it would be difficult to qualify all the companies which are registered in offshore centers as illegal ones because in this case the companies which are registered in more than fifty offshore centers would be regarded as illegal and any business and financial transactions with these companies are against the law. Another aspect is as follows: in the taxing schemes at the international level the companies, which perform in such centers, help to reduce corporation tax, which makes up 15% in Lithuania. Therefore, if the companies are taxed according to the tariff which is twice as more as potential profit, the withdrawal of the capital from the country can be the only result. Also the fact that the neighbouring countries do not take analogous measures should be taken into account.","[Gaidelys, Vaidas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Econ, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gaidelys, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Econ, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vaidas.gaidelys@ktu.lt,,,,,,,37,0,0,1,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The research was conducted on the branches (subsectors) of the food industry in Poland in 2005-2010. The research is based on the econometric analysis of the influence of the length of inventory cycles (in total, materials, production in progress, finished goods, commodities) on financial performance of branches measured with return on sales, assets and equity. The research proved that the effectiveness of inventory management measured with the length of inventory cycles is strongly diversified in the system of branches of the food industry. However, in general in 2005-2010 the inventory cycles were significantly reduced, which points to higher effectiveness of management of those assets. Moreover, on the basis of regression models the improvement in the effectiveness of inventory management measured with the length of total inventory cycles and discrete cycles was found to be positively correlated with profitability. The presented results are the first systematised analysis of the correlations between the results of inventory management and financial performance in the food industry in Poland.","[Golas, Zbigniew; Bieniasz, Anna] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Golas, Z (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",zbyszekg@up.poznan.pl; bieniasz@up.poznan.pl,,"Bieniasz, Anna/0000-0003-4854-7577",,,,,26,3,4,1,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Based on the integrated use of cognitive mapping techniques and the Interactive Multiple Criteria Decision Making (TODIM) approach, this study aims to create an idiosyncratic decision support system for the identification of multiple criteria and the calculation of their respective weights (i.e. the trade-offs) in the evaluation of SME credit risk. The results show that the model created in this study allows for simple and straightforward credit concession decisions, facilitating the evaluation of SME credit applications through more informed and transparent risk assessments.

In order to capture further time-variation in contagion effects and dynamic linkages between stock markets, our paper makes use of a DCC-MGARH model. Our findings make two interesting contributions to the field. First, we highlighted an increase in dynamic correlations following the subprime crisis for most markets under consideration with regard to the U.S. market. Second, with respect to the contagion test by Forbes and Rigobon (2002) that associates pure contagion with a significantly higher correlation between markets during the crisis, our results showed that the pure contagion hypothesis is not rejected for France, Italy, the UK or Mexico at the level of 1%, and for Argentina at 10%. Simple interdependence with the US market characterizes the other markets. Our findings thus offer interesting insights in terms of investment and diversification, and offer further insights into systemic risk in these regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The progressing of European monetary integration and the forming of monetary union spurred the interest of researchers to assess the relevance of the PPP theory in the case of the single European currency. Our paper therefore examines this exchange rate theory by testing a dataset of monthly real exchange rates for a sample of 11 eurozone members with respect to different benchmark currencies. Because of the documented drawbacks of linear specifications in examining this exchange rate theory, we utilise a nonlinear unit root test based on the ESTAR model proposed by Kapetanios, Shin, and Snell (2003). The results of unit root tests for the US dollar-based real exchange rate series as well as for Japanese yen-based series suggest that the PPP proposition does not hold in the case of eurozone countries. The absence of real exchange rates' nonlinear reversion reported in this study thus confirms the thesis of Wu and Lin (2011) regarding the PPP relationship since the inception of the euro.","[Kavkler, Alenka; Borsic, Darja; Beko, Jani] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Beko, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",jani.beko@um.si,,"Beko, Jani/0000-0002-7778-5745",,,,,30,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The aim of the article is to contribute to the discussion about the role of innovation agencies in development of regional innovation systems and to compare the Czech regions with respect to involvement of these subjects in the implementation of regional innovation policy. Based on several criteria the Czech regional innovation agencies were identified and their roles were analysed consequently. The analysis shows that the Czech regions can be divided into three groups. The first group (six regions) has some specialized innovation agency. The second group (three regions) has no specialized innovation agency, but innovation tasks were delegated to some organization with wider function. The third group (five regions) has no organization that plays the role of innovation agency. The individual innovation agencies differ significantly in scope of their performed activities.","[Klimova, Viktorie] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Klímová, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",klimova@econ.muni.cz,"Klimova, Viktorie/I-4345-2015","Klimova, Viktorie/0000-0002-2880-0371",,,,,23,1,1,2,17,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,309,317,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-39,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500040,0

Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines the prior decisions of the WTO panels and the Appellate Body relating to the zeroing practice. It categorizes the key elements of these prior decisions where the zeroing practice has been found WTO-inconsistent. While there has been no specific dispute addressing targeted dumping per se, this paper proves that core elements of the zeroing practice have been anatomized and dissected by the panels and the Appellate Body in prior proceedings. The paper then analyzes whether these key elements still exist in the specific context of targeted dumping and thus whether application of zeroing is still prohibited in targeted dumping situations. Findings - The existing jurisprudence on zeroing from previous WTO disputes should apply to targeted dumping situations as well. Unbridled application of zeroing in the targeted dumping situations will effectively nullify the existing zeroing jurisprudence accumulated through a decade of WTO disputes. If unchecked, this calculation methodology in the context of targeted dumping may open the back door wide open for zeroing negative anti-dumping margins. The paper concludes that the existing jurisprudence on zeroing stands for the proposition that zeroing in targeted dumping should also be prohibited. Originality/value - This paper examines the legality of the zeroing practice in targeted dumping situations, which has been one of the most controversial issues among WTO members for the past several years. The analyses and discussions contained in this paper will provide legal guideline to evaluate zeroing in targeted dumping within the WTO framework. The outcome of the research will provide a platform for continued research and discussion in this area.","[Lee, Jaemin] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Youngjeen] Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Ewha Womans University,"Cho, Y (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",ycho@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The goal of this paper is finding out if a greater degree of innovation in a country has a positive impact on the arrival of highly skilled immigrants. In order to achieve the aforementioned goal and following existing literature on the subject, an analysis on an international level was made regarding the effect of relevant innovation factors (number of patents; research and development funding (as % of GDP) and number of articles in scientific and technical journals) on immigration of highly skilled employees. The results of a regression analysis confirmed a significant relation between the number of patents, articles in scientific and technical journals and number of highly skilled immigrants (HQI). This means that countries with a relatively larger amount of the innovation factors have a great incentive that attracts talented people on an international scale, although in order to achieve this there is the need to promote and maintain a favourable institutional, economic and technological environment.","[Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 20, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Garcia-Rodriguez, Yolanda; Cuenca, Eduardo] Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Kaunas University of Technology; University of Granada,"Mihi-Ramirez, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 20, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",a.mihi@ktu.edu; ygarcia@ugr.es; ecuenca@ugr.es,", Eduardo/HIK-2340-2022; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; Garcia Rodriguez, Yolanda/0000-0003-3250-4708",,,,,46,11,11,1,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We also found that the relationship between real exchange rates and stock prices in these countries may be induced by the monetary policy decisions of the Fed and other domestic and foreign factors. Our results stress the importance of the derivation of the optimal economic policy framework to analyze the interaction between exchange rates and stock prices.

In the study we have applied selected statistic tools: descriptive statistic measures, measures of the relationship between phenomena and dynamic indicators. We have also used trend models and elementary prognostic tools. On the base of the conducted analyses we have made forecasts of the considered variable for two subsequent periods and assessed their admissibility. Moreover, using selected tools of spatial econometrics, we have examined the existence of spatial autocorrelation.","[Pospiech, Ewa; Mastalerz-Kodzis, Adrianna] Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40278 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Pospiech, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40278 Katowice, Poland.",ewa.pospiech@ue.katowice.pl; adrianna.mastalerz-kodzis@ue.katowice.pl,,"Pospiech, Ewa/0000-0001-5015-8875",,,,,21,2,2,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1791,1798,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800222,0

After estimating a system of equations developed from a model of a profit-maximizing club owner, it was found that fighting had a small negative effect on attendance implying that encouraging fighting on the ice is not a profit-maximizing strategy. The results are quite robust when incorporating capacity constraints on attendance and exogenous ticket pricing. Other factors that determine club performance and market size were found to significantly affect attendance. The empirical results also suggest that NHL club owners are maximizing profit.","[Rockerbie, Duane W.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Rockerbie, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",rockerbie@uleth.ca,,,,,,,16,13,16,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the first place we attempt to examine how the firm's R&D decision and export decision are determined based on the firm's specific characteristics, namely labor productivity, firm size, age, skill, capital intensity, and foreign ownership of the company. Secondly, we consider the interaction between R&D and export decisions for Turkish manufacturing firms, using World Bank Enterprise Survey, conducted in a cross-section study of 2013 through face to face interviews. To test the aforementioned relationships, we utilize Bivariate Probit estimation approach. This method is particularly useful for taking the consideration of two-dimensional nature of the data. Our main findings present that R&D and the firm's export decision are positively correlated in Turkey. Besides government subsidies increase the probability of firm's export decision as expected.
