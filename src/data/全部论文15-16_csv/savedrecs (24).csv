Given this fact, many educators have started questioning whether the new digital tools could be an alternative to formal education. Our objective in this paper is, therefore, to investigate the usefulness as well as the impact of these online tools on classroom-based learning/teaching. In this context, based on studies we conducted among higher education students and teachers, it was found out that the majority of the informants claimed that social media improve students' learning and enhance teaching methodologies. Despite these educational advantages, only 19% of the surveyed students and 31.1% of the faculty members believe that these online platforms could replace formal education. Given the benefits of these web-based applications and their wide use amongst students, we strongly believe that teachers who are reluctant in effectively incorporating social media in education settings will be left behind sooner or later.","[Faizi, Rdouan; El Fkihi, Sanaa] Mohammed V Univ, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco",Mohammed V University in Rabat,"Faizi, R (通讯作者)，Mohammed V Univ, ENSIAS, Rabat, Morocco.",r.faizi@um5s.net.ma; s.elfkihi@um5s.net.ma,"EL FKIHI, Sanaa/KBQ-2521-2024; Faizi, Rdouan/V-8655-2019; Faizi, Rdouan/GLV-1575-2022",,,,,,17,3,3,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3380,3384,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700341,0

The focus is on the description of its fundamental characteristics and on its socio-economic implications for both the sending and the receiving regions. In this context, we aim to raise awareness among policy makers in relation with the magnitude and complexity of the phenomenon, for its proper management. Statistical and econometrical analysis were developed in order to process the information gathered through the quantitative research, while the inductive approach was used in order to analyze the information obtained from the qualitative pieces of research. The scarce financial conditions in Romania determined many people to search for job opportunities in particular in agriculture, child or elderly care, or housekeeping in Andalusia, especially in the provinces of Seville and Huelva. However, during the past period, the economic crisis was strongly putting a mark on the Spanish economy and many of the investigated immigrants were unemployed. Even though, in general, their coming back intentions were not very clear. Socio-economic implications both positive and negative arise from the migration process of Romanians to Andalusia, for both the sending and the receiving countries. Remittances, solving shortages on the labor market, or increase in regional and national incomes may fit in the first category, while the second category may be composed of examples such as families left behind, school dropouts, children involvement in dangerous entourages and/or in illegal activities, tensions on the labor market etc.","[Grosu, Raluca Mariana; Dinu, Vasile] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business & Tourism, Dept Business Consumer Sci & Qual Management, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Grosu, RM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business & Tourism, Dept Business Consumer Sci & Qual Management, Bucharest, Romania.",raluca.petrescu@com.ase.ro; dinu_cbz@yahoo.com,"Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548",,,,,41,4,5,2,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

For different innovation management methods, the ordering of the factors which influence the organisation of IT projects was further elaborated upon in this research. In the observation of 11 target organisations, it was found that there were no two identical innovation management implementations and each organisation provided a different experience. Data sources for the interviews were limited because the preliminary review of opportunities to study innovation management in the Sri Lankan context revealed that only a selected set of organisations would be relevant to the research.

In order to introduce or improve innovation management in an organisation, the budget, needs of the organisation, how to introduce the implementation and investment evaluations need to be considered.","[Ibrahim, Tasha; Gamage, Chandana] Univ Moratuwa, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka",University Moratuwa,"Ibrahim, T (通讯作者)，Univ Moratuwa, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.",tasha.ibrahim@gmail.com; chandag@cse.mrt.ac.lk,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,285,294,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400047,0

For the past 25 years significant transformation processes have been identified in the retailing of post-communist countries that have both an economic and also spatial character. The aim of this paper is to analyze retailing in Slovakia and its development in the period of 25 years with specific attention paid to the transformation process. In the paper these processes are classified and defined in the time and space context. The conclusions of the study show that in Slovakia some trends in globalization processes can be identified, which are typical in other developed countries. These changes become evident particularly after 1989. The process of atomization of the retail is the first analysed process and it is typical for the transition period from the centrally-planned economy to the market economy. The further processes are related to manifestations of globalization in the Slovakian retail. Those are the processes of internationalization, cooperation, and concentration in the retail. By analyzing all of the changes in the Slovak retail it is then possible to identify several stages of transformation. The characteristics of the globalization processes in the retail sector are more intense in urban areas than in rural. For Slovakia, there is a delayed transition in the processes in comparison with neighbouring countries. The size of the market determines the intensity of the manifestations of the globalization processes. The ultimate consolidation of retailers in Slovakia can be categorized as transformation process in the initial stage of development.","[Krizan, Frantisek; Bilkova, Kristina] Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Reg Geog Planning & Environm, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Kita, Pavol] Univ Econ, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Sivicek, Tomas] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Comenius University Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Krizan, F; Bilková, K (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Reg Geog Planning & Environm, Bratislava, Slovakia.;Kita, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia.;Sivicek, T (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",krizan@fns.uniba.sk; bilkova@fns.uniba.sk; pavol.kita@euba.sk; tomas.sivicek@ujep.cz,"Križan, František/AAJ-2563-2021","Križan, František/0000-0003-4969-4587; Sivicek, Tomas/0000-0003-2365-7243; Bilkova, Kristina/0000-0002-8912-4450","VEGA project [1/1143/12, 1/0082/15]",VEGA project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This work was supported by the VEGA project named Regions: development, transformation and regional differentiation (contracts No. 1/1143/12), the VEGA project named Specifics of time-space human behaviour under the impact of socio-economic changes (No. 1/0082/15).",,70,24,24,1,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The entire route lies in Arctic waters, which due to global warming, has become ice free during summer and autumn. The route goes from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean along the Russian Arctic coast and reduces voyage distance by 40% between Northern Europe and Japan. Traditionally, comparisons of the climate impact of transport solutions have been based on fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2), while other trace emissions in the exhaust gas have been ignored. It is becoming increasingly well-known however, that aerosols, and their precursors emitted from shipping are strong climate forcers, with a magnitude that is intimately connected to the specific region of emission. Taking into account these considerations, we apply region-specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) characterization factors to estimate the relative magnitude of the short-lived climate forcers in the Arctic compared to traditional shipping regions and to the impact of CO2 emissions in light of reduced overall fuel consumption. The results indicate that there are no general climate benefits of utilizing the Northern Sea Route, even with cleaner fuels, since the additional impact of emissions in the Arctic more than offsets the effect of shorter voyages. In terms of climate change mitigation, managing this trade-off will be challenging, as the Northern Sea Route offers cost savings per ton of freight transported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research study Drummond's methodology is used for the specification of costs. The costs are divided into two categories. The first category consists of the costs of creation and running of health care program and these costs are perceived as the used sources. The costs are calculated on the basis of the reviews of the studies from the European countries, but also on the basis of authors' own survey in the University Hospital of Hradec Kralove conducted among 510 patients in the period of 2011-to the third quarter of 2015. Within this study the direct costs among 510 patients at the University Hospital of Hradec Kralove were explored in the period of 2011-to the third quarter of 2015. These costs included neurological examination, CT screening, blood collection, hospitalization, and drugs. The total direct costs of patient per year reached 2,032 EUR. The survey showed that the underpinning of patients with PD was beneficial from the costs point of view because the costs on the outpatient care were much lower in comparison with the inpatient care. In addition, patients released from the hospital are usually transferred to the establishments with subsequent care, for example into hospices, because family care due to its complexity is impossible.","[Maresova, Petra] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Klimova, Blanka] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Linguist, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Valis, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Valis, Martin] Univ Hosp Hradec Kralove, Dept Neurol, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Kuca, Kamil] Univ Hradec Kralove, Univ Hosp Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Biomed Res Ctr,Ctr Basic & Appl Res, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Mohelska, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove; University Hospital Hradec Kralove; Charles University Prague; University Hospital Hradec Kralove; University Hospital Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove,"Maresová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",petra.maresova@uhk.cz; blanka.klimova@uhk.cz; valismar@seznam.cz; kamil.kuca@fnhk.cz; hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Kuca, Kamil/D-1396-2011; Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019; Maresova, Petra/L-1743-2017","Kuca, Kamil/0000-0001-9664-1109; Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712; Maresova, Petra/0000-0002-1218-501X","University of Hradec Kralove, Faculty of Informatics and Management; Ministry of Health, Czech Republic [FNHK00179906, PRVOUK P37/08]","University of Hradec Kralove, Faculty of Informatics and Management; Ministry of Health, Czech Republic(Ministry of Health, Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)","This study was supported by the project Excellence 2016 (University of Hradec Kralove, Faculty of Informatics and Management) and by the grant No. FNHK00179906 (Ministry of Health, Czech Republic) and program PRVOUK P37/08.",,21,3,3,0,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Over-forecasting can lead to an unresponsiveness to advice and feedback. In group forecasting, under-forecasting may lead individuals to discount valuable inputs that they could contribute. Research shows that those who perform relatively poorly in tasks tend to make predictions that are too high, while high performers tend to under-forecast their performances. Several explanations have been put forward for this 'regressive forecasting', such as a lack of metacognitive skills in poor performers and a false-consensus bias in high performers. Others claim that the bias is simply an artefact of regression. In this study, people were asked to forecast their performances on six multiple-choice tests. The results suggest that a simple explanation based on the anchoring and adjustment heuristic would account for the phenomenon, at least in part. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters.

Hence, the satisfaction initially derives from employees and thereafter transferred to customers gain and loyalty. This comes in line with intense competition in the era of technology. As many organizations are competing with each other and want to become the most preferred choice for customers. Moreover, cost of operating a business has also in a rise.

Particularly in connection with the European Capital of Culture, various studies examining economic impacts or methodologies for their monitoring are annually processed and the results are often part of evaluation reports related to the individual European Capital of Culture projects. Given the fact that in 2015 the European Capital of Culture is Plzen in the Czech Republic, it has been appropriate to determine what multiplier effects can be expected in connection with this event. Therefore, the focus was not only on the sector called Arts, entertainment and recreation, but also on the other related industries that can be affected by the increase of tourists (i.e. Wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, Transportation and storage and Accommodation and food service activities). Therefore, the regional input-output model has been calculated and then multipliers of production, gross value added, income and employment have been derived for the sectors related to culture, wholesale and retail, transport, accommodation and food. The results have showed that these industries have the potential to affect the economy of the region and it can therefore be assumed that the aforementioned events, which take place within the Pilsen European Capital of Culture 2015, will bring considerable financial resources to the region, mainly through attracting foreign tourists and tourists from other regions of the country. The derived multipliers are computed from data for 2010 (more recent are not available) and, of course, they can also be used to determine economic effects of other events.","[Noskova, Marta] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Geog, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Nosková, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Geog, Plzen, Czech Republic.",mnosk@kpm.zcu.cz,"Noskova, Marta/ABB-6527-2020","Noskova, Marta/0000-0003-2890-555X",University of West Bohemia [SGS 2015-004],University of West Bohemia,This work was supported by the research project SGS 2015-004 entitled Research impact of the flagship projects on the economic development of cities and regions on the example of the European capitals of culture at the University of West Bohemia.,,40,5,5,3,20,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The article deals with the preparation and implementation of simulated exercise of crisis management entities at the municipal level. The topic of the exercise was the activity of municipal crisis management authorities dealing with the impacts of natural disaster the gale. Created scenario was based on real situations of the intervention of the Integrated Rescue System (IRS) during the gale. Activities implemented by IRS components on the place of action were modelled using the WASP-C simulator. Students had to practice the tasks and activities of crisis management authorities and other entities involved in the elimination of the consequences of the disaster. The whole course of the exercise was being monitored by means of a simulator, which significantly contributed to evaluation of the exercise.

Methodology of the article includes scientific methods: system approach, analysis, synthesis, comparative approach, statistical method, cause-and-effect analysis, deduction. The paper provides the mechanism of interaction between NIS institutions with the central role of technology parks and regional venture capital funds at the stage of prototyping and testing of innovation. Within the mechanism the services of technology park are not limited to business incubation, but include technical and technological expertise and receiving a prototype in laboratory conditions. Another feature of the mechanism is the financing of the innovation project not at the expense of state development institutions, but through the regional venture fund.

It is commonly accepted that (i) innovations are brought forward through an interactive process of knowledge generation, diffusion, and application; (ii) innovations are increasingly seen as fundamental to the competitiveness of enterprises and economies; and (iii) knowledge is critical to the process of innovation. The relative importance of cooperation on innovative activity varies and depends upon a number of factors, i.e. the number of cooperative ties and the context in which network relations exist. The determinants of R&D cooperation differ depending on the types of cooperation: (i) the positive impact of enterprise size, R&D intensity, and incoming source-specific spillovers is weaker for competitor cooperation, reflecting greater concerns about appropriability and (ii) institutional spillovers are more generic in nature and positively impact all types of cooperation. The question is the effectiveness of different types and subjects of cooperation. This article aims to analyze the impact of (i) the cooperation and participation in the group of enterprises; (ii) cooperation with universities; (iii) the provision of state aid; on overall enterprises' performance. Analysis was performed on data from Community Innovation Survey (CIS) carried out in the Czech Republic between the period 2010-2012 by using own multiple linear regression models. The results confirm the importance of cooperation between enterprises and the positive impact of participation of enterprises in the enterprise groups. Cooperation with universities and research organizations also has a positive impact on the performance of enterprises in the machinery industry in the Czech Republic. We also show that there were inefficient provisions of public aid in machinery industry in the Czech Republic.","[Stejskal, Jan; Prokop, Viktor] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Merickova, Beata Mikusova] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",University of Pardubice; Matej Bel University,"Stejskal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",jan.stejskal@upce.cz; beata.mikusovamerickova@umb.sk; viktor.prokop@upce.cz,"Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/AAN-7235-2021; Stejskal, Jan/S-7591-2017; Prokop, Viktor/ABG-1835-2022","Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/0000-0002-3187-9201; Stejskal, Jan/0000-0003-3015-8274; Prokop, Viktor/0000-0001-6313-395X","Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-02836S, 16-13119S]",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This paper was created as a part of the solution of the research task No. 14-02836S entitled Modeling of knowledge spill-over effects in the context of regional and local development and No. 16-13119S entitled Performance management in public administration - theory vs. practices in the Czech Republic and other CEE countries, financially supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.",,69,38,39,3,37,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Even Hannah Arendt concluded that in modern society women are the biggest minority there is. In the domain of rights (in subjective and objective sense of the notion) women of the 20th century have reached an equal status with men in principle, but in the 21st century between formal and actual right there is considerable discrepancy. Her right to work is obstructed, in political, economic or cultural level as well as in any given professional activity, regardles formally and legally ensured equality and basically accepted reality of the need for an enhanced participation of less represented gender on decision-making positions. Printed media in Serbia makes clear they are marginalized, since they appear as expert collocutors almost nine times fewer than men (89.2 : 10.8 percent in favor of men experts). The effect of glass ceiling implies invisible yet efficacious obstacle in advancement to the highest organizational positions of women. Statistical data clearly shows that there are still no women in places of actual decision-making, and that they are less paid for the same work in comparison to men, her unequal position is evident from the insight to the company ownership structure, as well as remarkably lower representation on leading positions. Moreover, women have fewer possibilities of advancement in career, and get dismissed more often than men in the process of transition. A woman is sometimes in an inequitable position when it comes to earning income for the exact same work carried out by a man, and she is actually not granted access to all positions and functions in the organization of a society. Therefore it is often a case of using woman-alibi in practice, that is directing certain women to high and influential public positions in order to prove there is no discrimination towards women by the society. Nevertheless, without equal, better and more active participation of women, there shall be no faster or advantageous social and economic development.","[Torlak, Nada] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Culture & Media, Belgrade, Serbia; [Torlak, Petar] East Carolina Univ, Business Adm, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Torlak, N (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Culture & Media, Belgrade, Serbia.",ntorlak@nezbit.edu.rs,"Torlak, Nada/C-4971-2017",,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,95,102,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700011,0

The EFQM Excellence Model allows people to understand the relation between what their organization does and the results it achieves. This paper presents the results of an empirical study conducted in enterprises which are immersed in the implementation process of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) excellence model. The aim is to find out what kind of factors impacts both positively and negatively the EFQM Business Excellence Model implementation. To achieve the objective, were raised the following tasks: 1) to describe the EFQM model, 2) on the basis of theorical knowledge, to develop a questionnaire on the factors and their impacts on the EFQM Business Excellence Model use of enterprises, 3) based on the survey results, to draw conclusions and make proposals to reduce the barriers to the model implementation in Latvian enterprises. The research is based on the following hypothesis: The Latvian executives' choice to use EFQM Business Excellence model to measure the business performance is influenced by many supporting and delaying factors. The methodology consists of a descriptive analysis in order to determine the importance of motivation and barriers. In the research were also used focus groups and interviews with experts. In the focus groups participated 20 representants of various areas of business. Ten experts were from the Quality area: the Prezident of Lavtia's quality association, evaluators of EFQM model etc. The survey results show that the most important motivations that drive Latvian firms to implement the EFQM are internal motivations, and that the most important barriers are related to the lack of physical and financial resources and the lack of time. The structure of barriers is made up of more groups: resource barriers, organizational barriers, behavioral and cultural barriers. In the research was noticeable the coincidence of both expert and focus group results, pointing out the fundamental importance of the support of top management to EFQM use in the organization - this factor was evaluated with 4,9 points out of 5. Referring to possible delaying factors, the opinions did differ. Consequently, the lack of support of top management was recognized as the most meaningful delaying factor.","[Veselova, Andzela] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Veselova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",andzela.veselova@lu.lv,,,,,,,9,0,1,0,6,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,891,900,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200076,0

We find that the traffic congestion cannot be avoided but that accessibility can be improved by providing a large-volume time-space tunnel.

A measure of distance based on the L-infinity -norm is applied to a learning sample of multivariate time trajectories, which can be mean- and/or variance-nonstationary. Based on the ranking of distances to the centre of the sample, a subsample of the most central multivariate trajectories is selected. A prediction box is constructed by circumscribing the subsample with a hyperrectangle. The fraction of central trajectories selected into the subsample can be calibrated by bootstrap such that the expected coverage of the box equals a prescribed nominal level. The method is related to the concept of data depth, and thence modified to increase coverage. Applications to simulated and empirical data illustrate the method, which is also compared to several other methods in the literature adapted to the multivariate setting.

It is frequently claimed that concurrency is a unique aspect of U.K. competition policy. However, this article argues that it arose during the 1980s as one aspect of an almost uniquely procompetitive regulatory framework for privatized telecommunications and other U.K. infrastructure industries. The article discusses the origins of these formal concurrency arrangements and their use in the U.K. since the 1980s. It also compares the U.K. with other EU and OECD countries over the role of ex post competition policy relative to ex ante regulation and the interactions between sector regulators and competition authorities.

In doing so, we combine a novel smoothing technique (initially applied in signal processing) with a variable selection methodology and two regression estimation methodologies from the field of machine learning (ML). After the decomposition of the original exchange rate series using an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method into a smoothed and a fluctuation component, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) are used to select the most appropriate variable set from a large set of explanatory variables that we collected. The selected variables are then fed into two distinctive support vector machines (SVR) models that produce one-period-ahead forecasts for the two components. Neural networks (NN) are also considered as an alternative to SVR. The sum of the two forecast components is the final forecast of the proposed scheme. We show that the above implementation exhibits a superior in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting ability when compared to alternative forecasting models. The empirical results provide evidence against the efficient market hypothesis for the selected foreign exchange markets.

In recent years these converging interests, which involve academics, politicians and planners, private sector actors and citizens as individuals and as organized groups (civil society), have stimulated a growing body of experience and substantial evidence on what measures may contribute the most to progress. Today, we know a great deal about the elements that make a city more sustainable. We know less, however, about the processes whereby cities, regions and countries move forward effectively. Applying specific measures often involves contextual factors that are less understood, particularly those arising from local cultures that reflect professional skills and user behaviour, and the institutional arrangements that define their interactions. In this paper, we examine the experience and results from a project conducted by a university team that partnered with an advanced citizen group in Santiago, Chile, as part of a key phase in a multi-year process of change. Interest arose in response to local advocacy and was significantly mobilized through a three-year collaborative planning process led by the regional government and citizens' groups, with technical assistance from Dutch experts. The experience discussed here reveals that it was the ongoing iterations between different kinds of technical and non-technical actors and the resulting blend of urban expertise that drove the process forward, leading to systemic changes in both planning and city spheres.

We control for self-selection bias due to differences in observed characteristics of the respondents using propensity-score based matching. We find that vehicle holdings of carsharing members are substantially and significantly lower than for non-members with similar characteristics in terms of individual and household demographics and built environment features of both residential and job location. These differences increase as the propensity to enroll in carsharing programs increases. A latent construct, which measures the propensity to own or utility from owning vehicles and rises with numbers of vehicles owned, is lower for members by 0.3-1.3 standard deviations relative to non-members. Members are also likely to walk, bike, and use transit more frequently than non-members. However, these differences are relatively minor and tend to be statistically non-significant. Future research should control for self-selection bias arising from differences in unobserved characteristics of respondents, as well as simultaneity bias whereby decisions concerning vehicle ownership both influence and are influenced by the decision to join carsharing programs.

A significant stated motivation for these regulations was the protection and promotion of the quality of Internet service. This article provides information about the evolution of the quality of Internet service, providing context for this central stated motivation of Internet regulation, including the merits of rules restricting payments by content providers for priority treatment of certain Internet traffic. The history of the FCC's Internet regulations (or lack thereof) is reviewed, the main arguments for and against imposing ex ante price regulation on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are outlined, and data on industry performance, particularly subscribership levels in general and at substantially increasing speeds, are described. This experience indicates that apparent insufficiencies in competitive alternatives at the fastest available speeds have been ameliorated in fairly short order by new offerings by multiple ISPs. These findings strongly suggest that basing new restrictions on a putative dearth of competition for recently available service levels and transmission speeds is likely to be overtaken by technological and market developments, rendering such ex ante rules at best superfluous and at worst counterproductive to competition and innovation.","Adv Analyt Consulting Grp, Boston, MA 02110 USA",,"Tardiff, TJ (通讯作者)，Adv Analyt Consulting Grp, Boston, MA 02110 USA.",timtardiff@aacg.com,,,,,,,23,3,3,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This approach posits that diffusion patterns can be modeled through two mechanisms: Innovators adopt the new product and imitators purchase the new product when getting in contact with existing users. Crucial for the implementation of the method are the values assigned to the two parameters, usually referred to as p and q, which mathematically describe innovation and imitation mechanisms. The present paper is based on the findings of a research project about policy measures to promote the diffusion of Electric Vehicles in Germany. It investigates how practitioners could choose adequate values for the Bass model parameters to forecast new automotive technologies diffusion with a focus on Electric Vehicles. It considers parameters provided by the literature as well as ad hoc parameter estimations based on real market data for Germany. Our investigation suggests that researchers may be in trouble in electing adequate parameter values since the different eligible parameter values exhibit dramatic variations. Literature values appear discussible and widely variable while ad hoc estimates appear poorly conclusive. A serious problem is that ad-hoc estimates-of the Bass p value are highly sensitive to the assumed market potential M. So for plausible values of M, p varies on a high scale. Unless more consolidation takes place in this area, or more confidence can be placed on ad hoc estimates, these findings issue a warning for the users of such approaches and on the policy recommendations that would derive from their use.

The number of creditor lawsuits against foreign governments has strongly increased over the past decades, but there is a large variation across crisis events. Why are some defaults followed by litigation and others not? What explains the general increase in lawsuits? We address these questions using an economic model of litigation and a new data set capturing the near universe of cases filed against defaulting sovereigns. We find that creditors are more likely to litigate when debt restructurings are large, when governments impose high losses (haircuts), and when the defaulting country is more vulnerable to litigation (open economies and those with a low legal capacity). We conclude that sovereign debt lawsuits can be predicted reasonably well with a simple framework from the law and economics literature.","[Schumacher, Julian] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Trebesch, Christoph] Univ Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Enderlein, Henrik] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Munich; Hertie School,"Schumacher, J (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany.",,,,German Research Foundation under Collaborative Research Centre [700],German Research Foundation under Collaborative Research Centre,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the German Research Foundation under the Collaborative Research Centre 700.

Following this approach, forecasters predict the winning party to be the one which most citizens have said will win. This approach predicts winners and vote shares well, but related research has shown that some citizens forecast better than others. Extensions of Condorcet's jury theorem suggest that naive citizen forecasting can be improved by delegating the forecasting to the most competent citizens and by weighting their forecasts by their level of competence. Indeed, doing so increases both the accuracy of vote share predictions and the number of states forecast correctly. Allocating the state's electoral votes to the candidate who the most weighted delegates say will win yields a simple but successful forecasting model of the US Presidency. The 'wisdom of crowds' model predicts eight presidential elections out of nine correctly. The results suggest that delegating and weighting provide easy ways to improve citizen forecasting.

This has led the European Commission to develop the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). Under the MIP, the potential vulnerabilities of EU countries are assessed using standard indicators relating to internal and external macroeconomic imbalances. These indicators, however, assume cross-country data are comparable, despite economic and financial structures being very heterogeneous. This is not the case. This paper finds that for countries with substantial international investment, such as Ireland, five of the eleven indicators are materially distorted by financial and non-financial multinational activities. This paper disaggregates these five affected indicators into multinational and indigenous Irish components, insofar as the existing data allows. It finds that for Ireland the MIP indicators underestimate some external imbalances, significantly overestimate private sector credit imbalances and underestimate the deleveraging of the financial sector. Adjusting the indicators to allow for country-specific factors can help diagnose the underlying imbalance, while reducing instances of the MIP highlighting false positives.","Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Cussen, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",mary.cussen@centralbank.ie,"cussen, mary/GWN-0533-2022",,,,,,30,0,0,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

This paper addresses these points drawing on a study of 52 civic events in Milan between 2006 and 2010, which were set up by 10 nonprofit organizations within a shared local field. In order to assess if and how the observed events relate to a number of transformations that the local field underwent during the research period, an analytical typology of events' development is proposed. The results suggest that patterns of events' development are not neutral with respect to the production of field-relevant implications and that the triggering of social innovation processes by events requires pro-active public participation in their development processes.","Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Citroni, S (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Milan, Italy.",sebastiano.citroni@unimib.it,,,,,,,42,8,11,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We then select a small set of financial indicators to aggregate into a single composite index of financial indicators, which we name the Leading Credit Index (LCI). Our approach differs from others in the literature in that we follow the composite index approach of the Leading Economic Index (LEI) of the United States and focus on a small, carefully selected set of indicators as index components, and, in addition, our selection criteria target business cycle turning points rather than financial stress or instability. We show that this leading credit index, either alone or as a component of the LEI, can be helpful in estimating recession probabilities, which it does better than the individual indicators, including some of the existing components of the LEI, especially real money supply.

To assess new planning practices one has to estimate the drivers' reaction to proposed spatial-temporal parking limitations. The paper applies a high-resolution spatially explicit agent-based model termed PARICAGENT as a tool for this assessment. The model is used for evaluation of parking demand in the Diamond Exchange area in Ramat Gan, a city in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, for estimating the effectiveness of planned parking facilities for different development scenarios in the area and assessing electronic signage system that directs drivers to vacant parking lots. The results strongly indicate the advantages of agent-based modeling over the current dominant engineering approach and show the potential benefits of using an intelligent parking guidance system.

The dominant form of hunting leases is time limited contract transferring the hunting rights on a piece of land to one or more persons. We analyze this market for hunting leases using the hedonic method on a rich set of data obtained from Danish hunters. We hypothesize and show that the price of a hunting lease reflects that hunting is a composite experience; and also reflects aspects relating to the landowners cost of leasing out hunting. Thus, the value of a lease is determined by the location and size of the hunting area, the game harvest and hunting activity itself, several landscape qualities affecting the recreational nature experience, several social aspects of hunting and the relation between the landowner, the hunters and their activities.

We distinguish between a scenario in which the median-voter victim influences public safety and one in which the injurer lobbies the public agent, analyzing both negligence and strict liability with a defense of contributory negligence for each scenario. We establish that the levels of injurer and victim care are always socially optimal for the equilibrium level of public safety. However, the equilibrium level of public safety differs from its first-best level and drastically depends on both the specifics of the political process and the liability rule applied. This implies that, in contrast to results from the classic literature, the level of social costs is critically determined by the choice between liability rules (for a given political process).

These units were repeatedly deployed during the Iraq War, which allows us to measure the effect of arguably exogenous changes in troop levels on violent crime in El Paso County, where Fort Carson is located. We find that never-deployed units contributed to community violence in the form of assaults, murders, rapes, and robberies. In contrast, estimates of the relationship between previously deployed units and violent crime are generally small and statistically insignificant at conventional levels. We interpret this pattern of results as evidence that never-deployed units represent a greater threat to public safety than units recently returned from combat.","[Anderson, D.

Understanding the motivation for joint household travel and its effect on an individual's mode choices is critical to the formulation of transport policies and planning practices for sustainable transport choices. This paper examines individuals' mode choices with joint household travel being explicitly incorporated within a nested logit model using the Sydney Household Travel Survey data and a typology of tours that captures various patterns of household interactions. The results indicate that joint travel is influenced by household resources, social and mobility constraints, activity types, and the land use patterns at both origin and destination. Also, mode choices differ significantly across joint tour patterns with public transport being less likely to be used for joint travel. Scenario analysis shows that individual tours contribute the most while complex joint tours contribute least to modal shifts from car to public transport which results from changes to transport policies and the level of services. Contrary to suggestions in the literature, a joint household (as compared to individual) travel analysis does not necessarily identify a lower modal shift for policy outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Such aspects of social capital as social relations, usage of human capital in innovation processes, expertise in market analysis are often ignored by entrepreneurs. The research purpose is to analyse the relation between social capital and transformation from efficiency to innovation-driven business. Main aspects of this relation are revealed by interpreting findings of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), which is to examine how different factors encourage economic development globally via entrepreneurship. Relying on a solid GEM methodology, which combines quantitative adult survey and qualitative expert interviews, various transformation problems of catching-up countries are analysed while paying a special attention to effects of social capital and illustrating them by the case of Lithuania. The role of human capital is measured by such factors as anticipated growth of headcount within respondents' firms; social relations refer to social image of entrepreneurs (as it is impossible to have a strong social image without good social relations with stakeholders), while information/ knowledge diffusion is analysed via such effects as a number of companies that deliver innovative products and/or services, a number of customers who appreciate and want to try innovative products and/or services as well as a number of expected competitors in the market (it is impossible to be innovative and competitive in the market without information/ feedback collection system established).","[Lauzikas, Mindaugas; Dailydaite, Simona] Inst Super Commerce Paris, ISC Paris Business Sch, F-75017 Paris, France",,"Lauzikas, M (通讯作者)，Inst Super Commerce Paris, ISC Paris Business Sch, 22 Bd Ft Vaux, F-75017 Paris, France.",mindaugas.lauzikas@gmail.com; simona.dailydaite@gmail.com,,"Lauzikas, Mindaugas/0000-0002-6113-7794",,,,,24,19,23,1,105,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In accordance with the objective, motivational factors, status in the society, levels of corruption, current business risks, approaches to loan financing, the ability to manage financial risks and business optimism in the business environment have been examined. In 2013, research into entrepreneurs' opinions in the Czech Republic (Zlin Region) and Slovakia (Zilina and Trencin Regions) was conducted. These neighbouring regions have similar economic parameters. According to our findings, the most important motive for starting a business in the Czech Republic was to have a job. In Slovakia, the most important motive for starting a business was money. The results of our research confirmed that the societies in both countries perceived the position of entrepreneurs relatively negatively In both countries, entrepreneurs negatively noted the approach of the state to their needs and relatively high levels of corruption. Nowadays, the most important business risk was the market risk followed by financial and personal risks. Due to a deterioration of the business environment, the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises has declined by at least 15% in both countries. In the Czech Republic, approximately 43% of entrepreneurs stated that banks accept their needs and behave appropriately to them. The positive perception of banks was significantly lower in Slovakia: 23% of entrepreneurs in the Zilina Region and 35% in the Trencin Region. Many Czech and Slovak entrepreneurs indicated that they are able to manage financial risks in their companies. Despite the significant deterioration in the business environment, SMEs demonstrate business optimism, with about 90% of the entrepreneurs in both countries believing that their company will survive the next five years.","[Belas, Jaroslav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Demjan, Valer] Banking Inst Prague, Dept Banking, Prague, Czech Republic; [Habanik, Jozef] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social Econ Relationship, Trencin, Slovakia; [Hudakova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Special Engn, Zilina, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; University of Zilina,"Belás, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",belas111@gmail.com; valer@valer.sk; jozef.habanik@tnuni.sk; Maria.Hudakova@fsi.uniza.sk; jurajsipko@gmail.com,"Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022; Hudakova, Maria/S-6206-2017","Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X; Hudakova, Maria/0000-0002-0756-0962",[FaME/2013/MSPRISK]; [IGA/FaME/2013/010],;,This paper was supported by Project No. FaME/2013/MSPRISK: Current trends in the area of business risks of small and medium-sized enterprises in selected regions of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.r This paper was created at Tomas Bata University in Zlin and was supported by Project No. IGA/FaME/2013/010: Satisfaction mirror effect and bank financial performance.,,41,69,70,8,103,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This can be seen in the both the development of industries as well as the expansion of the Arctic Council's membership. Countries with at least some part located above the Arctic Circle are; Norway, Greenland, Canada, United States, Russia, Finland, and Sweden. The focus on the indigenous people, specifically the Sami of Lapland, presents a good case for assessing impacts of development on northern, Arctic, communities. In Sweden the population density is recorded as 21.4 people per square kilometer, with a higher population density in southern Sweden. The majority of the Sami people live in small to medium-sized communities, in remote regions, often resulting in a disconnect with the modern world. One industry that is already present in the Swedish Arctic is mining, especially for ore and carbon. However, now other industries, including multinational enterprises (MNE's), such as Facebook, which recently built a new five acre data center near the Arctic Circle, are beginning to realize the opportunities the Arctic region and its environment have to offer. Many are asking how sustainable is business development in the Arctic which can be answered by analyzing the impacts on the Sami communities and how people react and should react to these changes within their communities. This study analyzed current events through literature review and interviews of representatives from the impacted Arctic regions. The increased development has resulted in both negative and positive impacts such as reduction of land use, but increased employment opportunities.","[Bickford, Sonja H.; Bickford, Nate] Univ Nebraska Kearney, Kearney, NE 68849 USA; [Krans, Jon-Eric] Univ Great Falls, Great Falls, MT USA",University of Nebraska System; University Nebraska Kearney; University of Great Falls,"Bickford, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska Kearney, Kearney, NE 68849 USA.",bickfordsh@unk.edu; jkrans14@ugf.edu; bickfordna@unk.edu,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,21,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,287,296,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700030,0

Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability, because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, Shrinkage estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on forecasting accuracy (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were able to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those of Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code, as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its approach to the reproduction of forecasting research.

In this paper, we identify and investigate, in the Finnish context, the elements of the urban structure around homes and en route to school that promote children's ability to walk or cycle to school, using the conceptual domains proposed by Mitra (2013) to frame the work. The associations discovered can, to a large extent however, be viewed as contrasting significantly with those identified in previous research, as an increase in the variables, essentially indicating urbanity, decreased the likelihood of the children walking or cycling to school. This is due to the existence of a well-functioning public transportation network in the Helsinki region. The associations were more significantly associated with the environment en route to school than with the environment around homes.

The first is the confrontation between different discourses of rurality. This section of the paper is based on the concept of contesting development in rural areas by Michael Woods. The second perspective focuses on the role of agriculture in rural development. Is rural development possible without farm subsidies? How is the topic of rural development and farm subsidies reflected in the political programmes of Czech parliamentary parties? The low administrative capacity of Czech rural municipalities represents the third face of the sustainability of rural areas. Small rural municipalities have no chance of venturing into major economic projects; they can improve the appearance of municipalities and the level of social services, but the basic issues of the economic development of the locality are beyond their real horizon. Rural municipalities must face a high risk of indebtedness, which can result in a loss of their basic self-governing functions.","[Cmejrek, Jaroslav] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Cmejrek, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",cmejrek@ef.jcu.cz,"Čmejrek, Jaroslav/H-7710-2018",,,,,,7,1,1,0,2,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,27,30,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800004,0

Based on the recognition that organizational culture is considered important to an organization's results, and social economy organizations are concerned with improving managerial practices and results, our objective is to study organizational culture in cooperatives: identifying their organizational culture as a specific type of organization of the social economy, recognized as increasingly important economic agents; and in doing so, explore the usage of a widely known model, the Competing Values Framework (Quinn & Rohrbaugh 1983). Three cooperatives were studied. Their presidents were interviewed, and a questionnaire was applied to cooperative members to obtain demographic and organizational culture data. Differences between the cooperatives' cultural profiles seem to be consistent with both the circumstances of Portuguese social economy organizations (SEOs), and to the organizations' uniqueness regarding their trade, focuses, and history. International firm trends were compared with this study's results, and also appear to be explained by the SEO's management practices evolution standpoint: lack of structured way of working, and the need to improvise and innovate in order to get things done. The importance of our research is held in the fact that social economy, and the cooperative movement in particular, has a developing importance in the expansion of many economies, the lack of literature on culture in SEOs, and the exploratory usage of a well-known model of management literature in cooperatives.","[Ferreira, Marisa R.] Porto Polytech Inst, CIICESI, Sch Management & Technol Felgueiras, Felgueiras, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Ana C.] Porto Polytech Inst, NID RH, Super Sch Ind & Management Studies, Oporto, Portugal; [Marques, Cristina P.] Porto Polytech Inst, Super Sch Ind & Management Studies, Oporto, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Ferreira, MR (通讯作者)，Porto Polytech Inst, CIICESI, Sch Management & Technol Felgueiras, Felgueiras, Portugal.",mjf@estgf.ipp.pt; anarodrigues@eseig.ipp.pt; cristinapmarques@gmail.com,"de Almeida Marques, Paula Cristina/GYA-2422-2022; Rodrigues, Ana Cláudia/HSI-4115-2023; Ferreira, Marisa R./AAD-5901-2022; Rodrigues, Ana C./AAY-1203-2020","de Almeida Marques, Paula Cristina/0000-0001-5372-6815; Ferreira, Marisa R./0000-0003-4194-9127; Rodrigues, Ana C./0000-0002-6238-1385",,,,,19,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2622,2627,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700271,0

The analysis proved that the tendency of shifting towards the newest technologies is much accentuated in Nordic countries, but there is a general trend in the entire Europe of reshaping the banking activity by using these technologies, banks integrating them in a multi-channel approach of the customers, demanded more and more by the latter. Also, we note that Internet banking, mobile banking and social media banking are bringing banks lots of advantages in satisfying their clients, contributing to their retention and become the main tools of attracting new ones, within the competition with the other banks or non-bank financial institutions. It results that the costs for the needed reshaping of the banking activity by using the newest technologies are exceeded by the benefits obtained by banks, in terms of market share and revenues.","[Filip, Bogdan Florin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Filip, BF (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",bogdan.filip@feaa.uaic.ro,"Filip, Bogdan Florin/AAG-6091-2021",,,,,,15,0,0,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1044,1053,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700101,0

By analyzing the relationship between brand type and the sales impact of different merchandising and promotion tools, we aim to obtain a better insight into which types of in-store stimuli are more appropriate to stimulate private label sales. Results confirm that (1) in-store stimuli have a differential effect on sales of private labels and national brands, and (2) merchandising and promotion tools that trigger a more cognitive and reasoned decision process are more effective in stimulating private label sales.","[Garrido-Morgado, Alvaro; Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar; Martos-Partal, Mercedes] Univ Salamanca, Dept Adm & Econ Empresa, Salamanca, Spain; [Campo, Katia] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mkt Management, Leuven, Belgium",University of Salamanca; KU Leuven,"Garrido-Morgado, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Adm & Econ Empresa, Salamanca, Spain.",algamo@usal.es; oscargb@usal.es; Katia.Campo@kuleuben.be; mmartos@usal.es,"Martos-Partal, Mercedes/W-4166-2019; González-Benito, Óscar/K-4673-2014; Campo, Katia/C-4863-2013","Martos-Partal, Mercedes/0000-0002-0390-3358;",,,,,20,5,5,2,26,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-20182-5; 978-3-319-20181-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,3,7,,10.1007/978-3-319-20182-5_1,0.0,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1YX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380446600001,0

Contrary to expectations, the Marikana incident does not appear to have had a widespread and prolonged effect on the South African mining sector. This may be the result of the strike action already having been discounted into the price of mining shares, implying that the market was only reacting to the unusually violent (but short-lived) protest. Alternately, the results could be indicative of investor confidence in the corporate social responsibility initiatives of the South African mining industry as a whole. This paper is the first to examine the potential impact of the Marikana incident on the share prices of mining companies listed on the JSE. It should be of interest to both academics and practitioners wanting to understand how share prices react to exogenous events. It is also relevant for corporate-governance researchers concerned with the relevance of social and governance practices in a South African setting. This research is faced with the limitations associated with most statistical research: that causality cannot be ascribed to tested relationships. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is argued that these findings are important, given the significant coverage of the Marikana incident and the ongoing debate on the need for corporate social responsibility.","[Hill, Nicholas; Maroun, Warren] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Hill, N (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Accountancy, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Maroun, Warren/AAA-7338-2021","Maroun, Warren/0000-0001-7448-1220",,,,,100,10,15,1,11,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Some economic geographers argue that the peculiarities of resource peripheries cannot be understood with the help of economic theories designed in economic cores. The contested periphery approach was developed specifically for resource economies and stresses the importance of geographically variable interactions of stakeholder groups that channel broad institutional values (industrialism, regulationism, environmentalism, and aboriginalism) into peripheries. Along with local features, they create local models, and changes in relations occasionally remap the conditions for resource utilization. The contested periphery approach is based on comparisons between large territorial regions, but we argue that this does not provide sufficient tools to recognize the relationally formed heterogeneity of peripheries. Instead, this article focuses on the changing positionalities of local communities. We introduce the concept of positionality switch to highlight the ways abrupt shifts in the direction of relations alter local positionalities. Empirically, we explore two Russian forestry communities in the Finnish-Russian borderland. Cross-border trade connections and the shifting semipermeability of the boundary have greatly influenced the local model and remapped borderland communities. Reestablished timber export in the 1990s began to create a local model shaped by imported forestry technologies and work organization systems. In the 2000s, higher customs duties for wood and deteriorating transportation links cut off both the cross-border and domestic connections leaving the settlements in limbo. The article concludes by arguing that the contested periphery approach and local models should be localized and supplemented with the concepts of positionality and positionality switch as well as contextually relevant concepts because they help to better understand the particularities and specific relations of each local model.","[Kortelainen, Jarmo; Rannikko, Pertti] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, Joensuu 80101, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Kortelainen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, Joensuu Campus,POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland.",jarmo.kortelainen@uef.fi; pertti.rannikko@uef.fi,,,,,,,81,8,9,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The research sample includes Lithuanian companies, listed at the NASDAQ OMX Vilnius Stock Exchange, which acquired at least one company during the period of 2008 - 2010. The impact of acquisitions is estimated by profitability ratios and economic value added. The research results evidence that both profitability ratios and economic value added decrease during short-term after an acquisition in majority cases. However the recovery can be observed during the last quarter, indicating that acquisitions are beneficial during the economic slowdown.

Despite that a high number of specific procedures exist nowadays. A common feature of these methods is however that they focus on the corruption rate at the level of countries. Quantification of the corruption rate in smaller regional areas is still a considerably unexplored territory not only in the Czech Republic but also all over the world. Also the definition of the potential impacts of corruption or their precise quantification is an area that was investigated only in general level of state. Detailed analysis of corruption still lacks regional dimension. Subnational distinction of a territory in terms of the corruption rate could provide a completely new extension of theories of reasons and consequences of regional disparities. There are several reasons why to focus on this issue. Perhaps the strongest reason is that if corruption is one of the variables that have an effect of reducing economic performance, the elimination of corruption in certain regions may be the key to the elimination of regional economic disparities and thus increase the economic performance of the state. The main goal of the presented article is formulated in this connection. It consists of a proposal of a methodology for quantifying the corruption rate in individual regions of the Czech Republic. It will be possible to mutually compare individual regions and at the same time define the rate of deviation of a region from surface corruption rate in a country. Definition of these regional disparities in corruption will be a benefit mainly for anti-corruption policies of a country.","[Linhartova, Veronika; Volejnikova, Jolana] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Linhartová, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",veronika.linhartova@upce.cz; jolana.volejnikova@upce.cz,,,SGSFES Scientific Research in Economic Policy and Administration [2014002],SGSFES Scientific Research in Economic Policy and Administration,This paper was created within the project SGSFES Scientific Research in Economic Policy and Administration.

These are recognized to be defective in many poor countries, and are missing at the regional level for large parts of the world. Using updated luminosity (or nighttime lights) data, the present study examines whether such data contain useful information for estimating national and regional incomes and output. The bootstrap method is used for estimating the statistical precision of the estimates of the contribution of the lights proxy. We conclude that there may be substantial cross-sectional information in lights data for countries with low-quality statistical systems. However, lights data provide very little additional information for countries with high-quality data wherever standard data are available.

In last two decades, managers and academics observed the growing dissatisfaction with these traditional budgeting concepts, which are based on annual bases and control functions. Traditional budgeting methods are very often criticized for the inflexibility and strong focus on resource allocation. Criticism was focused as well on the problems related with the use of tradition budgets as a tool of management control. Many research studies points at the necessity of adopting more sophisticated budgeting methods, which could contribute to better performance management and control of business organizations. Current trends lie in adopting flexible, decentralized budgeting systems that are focused on the use of key performance indicators (KPI). The paper presents the results of the survey of Czech enterprise budgeting practices. The objective of the study was to analyse the current budgeting practices of the Czech firms and analyse the importance of the budgeting systems for company management. The first part of the paper presents the analysis of the trends in budgeting practices worldwide, which are based on the shift from traditional budgeting methods and an increasing use of alternative methods based on the performance measurement. The main part of the study presents the results of the questionnaire survey of the Czech enterprises' budgeting practices performed by the authors with the focus on the approach to the used budgeting system and its quality perception. The main objective of the survey is to find if the Czech budgeting practices are featured with similar discontent, which can be observed in literature and some foreign studies.","[Popesko, Boris; Novak, Petr; Papadaki, Sarka; Hrabec, Dusan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Popesko, B (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",popesko@fame.utb.cz; pnovak@fame.utb.cz; papadaki@fame.utb.cz; hrabec@fame.utb.cz,"Hrabec, Dušan/E-7008-2019; Novak, Petr/AAM-7284-2020","Hrabec, Dušan/0000-0002-6300-9200; Novak, Petr/0000-0003-4701-5755; Popesko, Boris/0000-0002-3590-7070",[GA 14-21654P/P403],,This paper is one of the research outputs of the project GA 14-21654P/P403 Variability of Cost Groups and its Projections in the Costing System in Manufacturing Enterprises registered at Czech Science Foundation.,,36,13,14,1,29,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This study examines the effects of extrinsic cues (packaging and naming strategies) on determining consumers' perception of private labels' product quality and purchase intention in an experiment using a sample of 357 management students. Using observation method, the category of rice was selected for this study. Hypotheses are derived from previous literature positing the effects of these two extrinsic cues on perceived quality and purchase intentions. MANOVA results indicate that similarity in private label packaging with national brand has a significant effect on perceived quality and purchase intention. However, the effect of naming strategies is not statistically significant on perceived quality and purchase intention. The interaction effect of packaging and naming strategies, in turn, positively influences perceived quality.","[Sarkar, Siddhartha; Sharma, Dinesh; Kalro, Arti D.] Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Sarkar, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Shailesh J Mehta Sch Management, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",siddhartha.sarkar@iitb.ac.in; dineshsharma@iitb.ac.in; kalro.arti@iitb.ac.in,,,,,,,21,5,5,6,18,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-20182-5; 978-3-319-20181-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,103,111,,10.1007/978-3-319-20182-5_11,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1YX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380446600011,0

The results of the research carried out showed that one of most complex stages of the expatriation process is the adjustment of expatriates during the international assignment which has significant impact on the international assignment success and satisfaction of individual expectations or various failures and emergence of individual problems. It has been proved that the success of the adjustment stage and the entire expatriation process is mostly influenced by the personal strengths of employees, their professional, social, adjustment skills, international experience, and a favourable situation of their families.","[Sarkiunaite, Ingrida; Rocke, Dovile] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Sarkiunaite, I (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ingrida.sarkiunaite@khf.vu.lt; dovile.rocke@khf.vu.lt,,"Sarkiunaite, Ingrida/0000-0002-8786-8157",,,,,40,8,17,0,34,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Although the research related to project CSF is quite comprehensive, there is so far no integrating paradigm that would be accepted by both academics and practitioners. Despite the lack of uniformity in conducted studies, the authors usually agree on some basic factors that are common for all types of projects. Apart from the iron triangle (times, costs, quality), people and organizational support represent the two other most frequently mentioned variables. In this respect, the authors often stress the need for good leadership from the part of the project managers and emphasize the importance of having managers with a high level of hard and soft skills. However, a frequently discussed issue is whether these skills must be acquired through specialized education programs or whether it is possible to replace this education by experience. In this paper we examine the relationships between the following variables - project oriented education, experience and project success. The main objective of our analysis lies in determining the approximated ratio of influence of each of these elements on the whole project performance. As a test sample we use the data collected during national survey including all regions of the Czech Republic that was carried out in the period from January to June 2015.

For the analysis, the concept has been used as a method of regression based on a convergence test that supposes an innovative decomposition of the GDP per capita and enables the endogenous determination of convergence clubs. In order to achieve the objective, the paper undertakes an empirical analysis of GDP per capita convergence for EU-28 members and for 272 regions corresponding to NUTS2 level. The results of the analysis show that at national level, during 1995 - 2012 there are significant differences between foundation members and CEEC economies, while at regional level five convergence clubs were identified. The basic conclusion is that in the conditions of lack of convergence between EU-28 countries, the identification of convergence clubs helps the European Union in reducing the economic disparities across European regions.","Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Acad Romana, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",mihaela_mb1@yahoo.com,"Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016","Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172",,,,,25,4,4,1,13,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The concept of equity presupposes fair treatment, while discrimination implies unfair treatment. The perceptions of discrimination, or being treated unfairly, may result from psycho-social processes, or from data that justifies discrimination and is quantifiable. Objectives: To assess whether differences in post grading and remuneration for males and females are based on gender, rather than on quantifiable variables that could justify these differences. Method: Biographical information was gathered from 1740 employees representing 29 organisations. The data collected included self-reported post grading (dependent variable) and 14 independent variables, which may predict the employees' post gradings. The independent variables related primarily to education, tenure and family responsibility. Results: Males reported higher post gradings and higher salaries than those of females, but the difference was not statistically significant and the practical significance of this difference was slight. Qualification types, job specific training, and membership of professional bodies did not affect post grading along gender lines. The ways in which work experience was measured had no influence on post grading or salary for either males or females. Furthermore, family responsibility, union membership and the type of work the employees performed did not influence the employees' post grading. The only difference found concerned the unfair treatment of males, particularly those who were well-qualified. Conclusions: Objective evidence of unfair gender-based discrimination affecting post grading and salary is scarce, and the few differences that do occur have little statistical and practical significance. Perceptions of being discriminated against may therefore more often be seen as the result of psycho-social processes and are not necessarily the result of justifiable differences in education, tenure and family responsibility.","[Steyn, Renier] UNISA, Grad Sch Business, Midrand, South Africa; [Jackson, Leon] Potchefstroom Business Sch, Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Steyn, R (通讯作者)，UNISA, Grad Sch Business, Midrand, South Africa.",,"Steyn, Renier/ABA-2208-2020; Steyn, Renier/M-4675-2017; Jackson, Leon/D-3348-2018","Steyn, Renier/0000-0002-2446-3662; Steyn, Renier/0000-0002-2446-3662; Jackson, Leon/0000-0001-5859-7581",,,,,48,7,15,1,21,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The qualitative research focused on internal and external company communication on social networks. The results of the thorough interviews were subjected to a group evaluation, which yielded important information related to the use of social networks for HR purposes. The final phases of the research involved uncovering latent information presented in the concluding synthesis. The aim of this contribution is to present the results of this qualitative research regarding the use of social networks in personnel marketing and based on the obtained information to predict the future of use of social networks in HR. In the Czech Republic, social networks are very popular across all age groups. Social networks used in the Czech Republic can be divided into two groups. The first consists of global networks, such as Facebook LinkedIn and Google+. Twitter can also be included in this list of social networks, even though its use method is ranked among micro blogs. The second group consists of Czech platforms with a local presence, such as Libimseti.cz, Lide.cz and Spoluzaci.cz. There is not enough current information about the use of social networks for HR purposes in the Czech environment. The missing information was the main reason for conducting the survey presented in this Article.

We propose and estimate a hedonic cost function which allows us to incorporate measures of train operator heterogeneity, which are central to evaluating the cost effect of merging heterogeneous train operators, and thus informing policy. We illustrate our model via three rail franchise mergers/remappings in Britain, and show that the wrong policy conclusion result could be obtained by only considering the scale and density properties, in isolation from heterogeneity.","[Smith, Andrew S.

In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.","[Xie, Xuanli] Peking Univ, Strateg Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Reuer, Jeffrey J.] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Klijn, Elko] Univ Leeds, Ctr Int Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Peking University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Leeds,"Xie, XL (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Strateg Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,108,0,0,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,235,265,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028012,0.0,,,31,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300011,0

The consumption of energy (per meter square) in large public buildings is accounted for about 70-300 kwh, in which the consumption rate is 10-20 times higher than of the residential buildings. One of the reasons of such high energy consumption pattern is due to lack of energy awareness and pro-environmental behaviour among government office building users. Such non-structural problems can be solved through research agenda by focusing on fostering energy conservation behaviour among government building users. Choong (2009) propose the use of Conceptual Model of Energy Awareness Development Process (CMEADP) in raising energy awareness and to improve energy-use behaviour. According to the model, the first step to create awareness is through presenting appropriate stimulus. By considering the importance of stimulation in raising energy awareness and fostering energy conservation behaviour, this paper explore and suggest the usage of visual communication on how to use image to stimulate energy conservation behaviour among government office building users.

The contingent perspective in supply chain management maintains that it is necessary to observe the interaction between SCI practices and supply chain justice. A critical issue to be resolved is whether this fit leads to synergistic and complementary effects on supply chain performance. In order to contribute to this research problem, we analysed supply chain justice instances in order to determine the importance of supply chain justice, as well as highlights complementary role in SCI and its influences on supply chain performance. A conceptual framework has been developed and five propositions established to verify the contents of a theoretical study. Accordingly, balancing the adoption of SCI practices and supply chain justice will lead to the generation of greater benefits relative to the effect of both independent driving forces on supply chain performance. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been analysed in order to examine its applicability in the South African context. The study thereby suggests the empirical research guidelines and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research.","[Ziaullah, Muhammad; Feng, Yi; Akhter, Shumaila Naz] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan; [Ziaullah, Muhammad] Ghazi Univ, Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan",,"Ziaullah, M (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71432003, 71271044]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors wish to thank anonymous referees for their thoughtful consideration and comments.

Economic theory shows that RPSs are not first-best policy measures for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or solving other environmental problems. Nevertheless, they have been politically popular, in part because states hope they will help create new jobs in what the states expect will be a growth industry. Research suggests that RPSs are supported by Democratic legislatures in states with good solar and wind potential, are more likely in states with restructured electricity markets, and are less likely in states heavily dependent on natural gas for electricity generation. Research also suggests that RPSs have been successful at increasing renewable generation capacity, have increased the cost of electricity modestly where they have been implemented, and reduce carbon emissions at a cost roughly consistent with estimates of the social cost of carbon.","[Lyon, Thomas P.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lyon, TP (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tplyon@umich.edu,,,,,,,46,19,21,0,8,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Governments are therefore willing to draft legislation incentivizing forest activities that sequester carbon to combat climate change. In this review, we examine issues related to the creation of carbon offset credits through forest conservation, burning of wood biomass in lieu of fossil fuels, and intensive commercial management that accounts for all carbon fluxes, including postharvest. In doing so, we study the costs of monitoring, measuring, and contracting; the principal-agent problem; and questions related to life cycle analyses of CO2. We can only conclude that greater care is likely needed in the future to identify carbon offsets from forestry activities if these are to be traded in emissions markets.","[van Kooten, G.

We find sufficient evidence to support the poverty traps hypothesis, suggesting that policies designed to interrupt those self-perpetuating mechanisms merit serious attention.","[Barrett, Christopher B.; McBride, Linden] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Garg, Teevrat] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Garg, Teevrat] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Cornell University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Barrett, CB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cbb2@cornell.edu; teevrat@gmail.com; lem247@cornell.edu,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,148,66,82,2,65,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

These linkages range from formal agreements, such as patent licenses and research alliances, to informal collaborations, such as joint research, copublication, and consulting. Because biotechnology involves a new research method, the tacit knowledge embedded in it became critical to its commercialization. Specifically, it requires the direct involvement of star scientists who have this tacit knowledge and are well remunerated for it. This process is facilitated by the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which allows universities to retain ownership of crucial patents and provides incentives to the star scientists to cooperate in development and commercialization. Over time, a complex web of collaborations and alliances has evolved in therapeutic, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical biotechnology, whereas extensive consolidation has occurred in agricultural biotechnology.","[Jensen, Richard A.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Jensen, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",rjensen1@nd.edu,"Jensen, Richard/R-7238-2019",,,,,,81,2,3,4,34,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

This paper reviews the literature and analyzes why different authors often reach different conclusions regarding the welfare impacts of food price changes. We first show that systematic measurement errors in household surveys may seriously affect estimates of the poor's dependence on food purchases at any given point in time. We then turn to the theoretical case for why the rural poor might ultimately benefit from higher food prices, with a particular focus on agricultural supply responses and resultant increases in demand for unskilled farm labor, which raise the wages of the poor. Consistent with these predictions, more sophisticated simulation models and new econometric evidence suggest that sustained increases in food prices have often benefited the poor and likely contributed to faster global poverty reduction from the mid-2000s onward. Conversely, the recent decline in agricultural prices could retard global poverty reduction.","[Headey, Derek D.; Martin, William J.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Headey, DD (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",d.headey@cgiar.org; w.martin@cgiar.org,"Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,60,43,49,0,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

After ten years of litigation that divided circuit courts, the Supreme Court decreed that payments to generic drug sellers by the patent holders of the brand equivalent that are aimed at delaying entry are illegal, but did so under a structured rule-of-reason approach. EU competition authorities treat such payments as per se civil infractions. Second, until court decisions made in 2011-2014, the reach of the Capper-Volstead Act and the legality of pay-for-delay conduct in the drug industry were in doubt.

The minimum condition is ensuring that any depletion of natural capital is compensated by reproducible and human capital, so that the value of the aggregate stock does not decrease. Meeting this condition is problematic if natural capital includes ecosystems, which not only provide unique goods and services but are also prone to irreversible conversion and abrupt collapse. Net domestic product accounting rules for the depreciation of the total stock of reproducible, human, and natural capital of an economy can be extended to incorporate the direct benefits provided by ecosystems. They also can integrate any capital revaluation that occurs through ecosystem restoration and conversion and the threat of irreversible collapse. These approaches confirm the economic interpretation of sustainability as nondeclining welfare.

The models divide crop response into higher yield-the intensive margin-or more land-the extensive margin. Input adjustments are assumed to drive yield response. But most yield changes result from adoption of technology. Regulators and modelers assume that increased harvested area implies conversion of land from forest or pasture to crops. With the notable exception of African countries, recent expansion of harvested area is due to more intensive use of existing agricultural land through multiple cropping and technology improvement. A lack of response at the extensive margin is consistent with inelastic estimates of land use change estimated by using time-series data. Option value is one reason for this inelastic response.

Many factors have contributed to the epidemic, including changes in technology (e.g., innovations on farms and in food processing and products), lifestyles, and women's wages and employment. Public health insurance externalities might justify government intervention, but the policy record is mixed, with no great success stories to date. Well-directed taxes on calories, sugar, or fat might be economically efficient ways of reducing obesity, as might regulation of television advertising, food labeling policies, or other nutrition education programs. Policies that induce the food industry to redesign foods may be more effective than policies that rely on inducing response by consumers. Farm subsidies and nutrition policies are largely irrelevant to the issue and modifying agricultural R&D policy is not an economical way to curb obesity. However, preventive approaches directed at children show some promise.","[Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst, Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [MacEwan, Joanna P.] Precis Hlth Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [Okrent, Abigail M.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Alston, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Alston, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst, Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",julian@primal.ucdavis.edu; Joanna.MacEwan@pheconomics.com; aokrent@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,163,14,14,4,55,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

We review the history of such projections and the different models and assumptions used in these exercises. We then introduce an analytical partial equilibrium model of the global crops sector, which provides a lens through which we can evaluate this previous work. The resulting decomposition of model responses into demand, extensive supply, and intensive supply elasticities offers important insights into the diversity of model parameterizations being employed by the existing models. Along with the methodology for implementing productivity growth, this helps explain some of the divergences in results. We employ a numerical version of the analytical model, which serves as an emulator of this entire class of models, to explore how uncertainties in the common underlying drivers and economic responses contribute to uncertain projections of output, prices, and land use in 2050. We place each of the published estimates reviewed here into the resulting empirical distribution of outcomes at mid-century. In addition, we quantify the sensitivity of these projections to model inputs. Our findings suggest that the top priority for future research should be improved estimation of agricultural factor supply elasticities, a topic that has been largely neglected in recent decades.","[Hertel, Thomas W.; Baldos, Uris Lantz C.; van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Hertel, TW (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",hertel@purdue.edu,,,,,,,63,31,33,1,23,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Economists have developed rigorous approaches to conceptualizing sustainability based on the paradigm of weak sustainability, which relies on extensive substitution among reproducible capital, renewable resources, and exhaustible natural resources. In contrast, strong sustainability emphasizes physical limits to this substitution and the importance of maintaining the resilience of normally functioning biophysical processes. Recent progress in resource and environmental economics has demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating strong sustainability features, including tipping points, uncertainties, and resilience, to assess efficiency and optimal policies. Given that weak sustainability and intertemporal efficiency share a welfare theoretic foundation, we ask: To what extent can these approaches be applied to evaluate sustainability? We highlight recent work on assessing sustainability in imperfect economies and dynamic models of intertemporal welfare that embed strong sustainability features.","[Irwin, Elena G.; Gopalakrishnan, Sathya; Randall, Alan] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Randall, Alan] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Randall, Alan] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Irwin, EG (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",irwin.78@osu.edu; gopalakrishnan.27@osu.edu; randall.3@osu.edu,"Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/K-4079-2012; Randall, Alan/N-4153-2019","Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/0000-0002-3593-0297; Randall, Alan/0000-0003-1028-5903; Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964",,,,,103,18,22,3,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Looking ahead, a nontraditional econometric approach is outlined. This method recognizes that our knowledge regarding the underlying behavioral system and observed data process is complex, partial, and incomplete.

As shown in this review, the benefits and costs of integrating electricity from an intermittent wind source into a preexisting electricity grid depend on the operating protocols of the electricity system, the preexisting generation mix, wind profiles, and the nature of economic incentives. Electricity systems are discussed from generation through transmission and distribution to retail demand, including how wind energy impacts investment in marginal (peak time) generating assets. The discussion also examines issues that could limit the usefulness of wind power at the high penetration rates now envisioned: the inability to store electricity, the need for fast-responding backup-generating capacity, network instability, low-capacity factors, and inappropriate incentives. Overall, this review finds that the costs of wind power likely exceed the benefits and that there may be limits to the proportion of electricity that can be generated by wind.","[van Kooten, G.

Finally, why is there greater political acceptance of agricultural biotechnology in some countries versus others, for some crops versus others, and for some crop traits versus others? Explanation requires an extended theoretical framework of regulation that goes beyond a vector sum of weighted material interests. Consideration must also be given to the social construction of risk, political structure, and social psychology.

Their contributions include recognizing natural resources as renewable capital, thereby altering the important dynamic dimensions of an efficient allocation. The introduction of irreversibility was a key element for decisions involving unique natural assets. Introducing uncertainty into these choices required consideration of appropriate public attitudes toward risk that led to the concept of a safe minimum standard. Identifying and emphasizing the salience of nonmarket values, particularly existence and bequest benefits, gave rise to the contingent valuation and the development of stated preference methods as a cottage industry. Setting forth and evaluating alternative management policies for open access resources in a dynamic context were other achievements. The backgrounds of these four scholars shaped their professional orientation; their contributions, in turn, have shaped the evolutionary path of resource economics research.","[Brown, Gardner M.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Smith, V.

In this article, we review behavioral and other explanations of the disparity, with a focus on their connections to neoclassical welfare theory, and evaluate the empirical evidence of these explanations through the same lens. Some explanations of the disparity are consistent with neoclassical models, and some are not. Likewise, some imply that the divergences are attributed to underlying preferences (neoclassical or not), whereas others suggest that the divergences are due to elicitation methods, cognitive limitations, or other non-preference-related reasons.

A consensus seems to emerge that there is little likelihood of large increases in international migration flows due to climate variability. The evidence to date shows that regional migration will be affected, however, either on the African continent or internally, within country borders. Theoretically, environmentally induced migration can be analyzed using different frameworks: the classical Harris-Todaro model of rural-urban migration, new economic geography models, models grounded in environmental economics of pollution externalities with free factor mobility, and the new economics of labor migration.

Drawing on the theory of household production, we illustrate the ambiguous relationship between household well-being and adoption of behaviors and technologies that reduce air pollution. We then review how the theory relates to the seemingly contradictory findings emerging from the literature on developing country household demand for clean fuels and stoves. In conclusion, we describe an economics research agenda to close the knowledge gaps so that policies and programs can be designed and evaluated to solve the global household air pollution problem.","[Jeuland, Marc; Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27517 USA; [Jeuland, Marc; Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27517 USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27517 USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27517 USA; [Bluffstone, Randall] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Portland State University,"Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27517 USA.",marc.jeuland@duke.edu; subhrendu.pattanayak@duke.edu; bluffsto@pdx.edu,,,,,,,150,57,73,3,53,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4707-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Integration of these land-use and biophysical models allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the consequences of future land-use change and the use of land-use policies to avoid undesirable outcomes. I provide a conceptual framework for the modeling approach, describing the individual components of an analysis as well as how they are linked together.

This article argues that quantity surcharges can be explained by the fact that different sizes of the same product are imperfect substitutes and thus are differentiated products. To test this hypothesis, we utilize grocery store scanner data to estimate a demand system and the associated cross-price elasticities. We focus our empirical investigation on canned tuna, which often exhibits quantity surcharges. A random coefficients logit demand approach is used to calculate elasticities. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that quantity surcharges in canned tuna are driven by firms catering to heterogeneous consumer preferences.

We examine whether the wholesale market dominates the retail marketin terms of price discovery and price leadershipor vice versa. Finally, we analyze whether the wholesale-retail price relationship is asymmetric with respect to price increases and price decreases. To test the asymmetric price transmission we used the asymmetric error correction-EG approach. Our results show that wholesale and retail prices are cointegrated, and wholesale market plays a leadership role in determining retail prices, which is in line with industrial organization theory.

Cognizant of market access, farm produce value, sustainable production, and reduction of postharvest losses, this paper investigated whether farm size, schooling, producer price, farm visits, and social capital networks condition these strategies. The results show that use of written contracts is conditioned by farm sizes, more extension, and number of producer groups (PGs) while farm certification is positively predicted by farm sizes, more extension, number of sellers in the village and seasons with the same buyer. However, certification is less responsive to producer prices. Crop rejections are predicted to be less depending on a farmer's education, number of PGs, and the producer price but are more likely to increase the more the number of sellers. Further, the results show that a forward pricing incentive is highly correlated with higher producer prices, more extension, and number of seasons with the same buyer. Finally, uncollected produce at harvest is likely to decrease with farm sizes, more education and extension, higher producer price, number of PGs, and seasons with the same buyer but is more likely to increase the higher the number of sellers.

Wine production is an excellent model for examining this type of impact, because suitable climate is central to product quality and production is centered in Mediterranean climate regions that are all global biodiversity hotspots. Adaptation to climate change in existing vineyards may involve water use to ameliorate heat stress or drought, resulting in additional conservation issues. Global studies of wine, climate, and conservation have highlighted the need for more detailed regional analyses to better understand these complex multiple issues. Here we examine impacts of climate change on winegrape suitability in California and its possible implications for nature conservation and water use. Under two global climate models and two emissions scenarios, winegrape suitability in California is projected to decline overall and to move into undeveloped areas that provide important habitats for native species. Coastal and upslope areas retain and improve in suitability, respectively, while inland areas see the largest losses in suitability. Areas of declining suitability are regions in which heightened water use for vineyard adaptation may lead to declines in stream flow or conflicts with other water uses. Continued growth in global demand for wine and reduced production in areas of declining suitability will drive expansion into newly suitable areas, potentially impacting important species native to California. Existing vineyards in areas of declining suitability will likely need to adapt to remain viable. Advance planning for a changing climate and adaptation options that are not water intensive (e. g. vine orientation, trellising, or varietal switch) will help reduce potential water conservation issues in those areas.

In this article, we estimate the seasonal pattern of wheat price premiums on the German market using a vector error correction approach, which accounts for multivariate autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity of the error terms. Our results indicate a significant downward trend for the premium during the marketing season, with the trend's magnitude depending on the average quality of harvested wheat. If farmers separately store both bread and feed wheat, they should tend to sell bread wheat before they sell feed wheat, particularly in years of low average wheat qualities. Further, the volatility of the price premium significantly decreases over the season, indicating higher risks at the beginning and lower risks towards the end.

We adopted an exploratory mixed-method approach, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative investigations undertaken in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Our results suggest that organic food consumption is mainly motivated by personal well-being and less by social or environmental concerns. Most participants perceive organic food as higher quality products, based upon which they show an acceptance of a price premium for organic food. The group of organic food consumers in our study relies on organic agriculture as one possible strategy to cope with food safety problems. The presence of strict standards for organic food, the trustworthiness of foreign certifications and the perceived higher quality of foreign products (especially from Europe) are perceived together as a safety guarantee. Our results further indicate that the widespread confusion regarding product recognition represents an important obstacle for organic food consumption growth. Implementing a coherent legislative framework to allow product labeling is apparently crucial yet not sufficient for developing the organic sector in Russia; moreover, trust in food labeling and control systems as well as awareness about organic standards is also required.","[Bruschi, Viola; Dolgopolova, Irina; Teuber, Ramona] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Agr Markets, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Shershneva, Ksenia] Univ Hohenheim, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Canavari, Maurizio] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Alma Mater Studiorum, I-40127 Bologna, Italy",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); University Hohenheim; University of Bologna,"Bruschi, V (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Agr Markets, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",bruschi.viola@gmail.com; ksenya1987@list.ru; Dolgopolova@iamo.de; maurizio.canavari@unibo.it; Teuber@iamo.de,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Dolgopolova, Irina/AAA-6849-2019; Teuber, Ramona/AAE-1925-2019","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880; Teuber, Ramona/0000-0001-6283-0438",,,,,70,49,56,1,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SUM,2015,31,3,,,,,414,432,,10.1002/agr.21414,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,CM9FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358013000008,0

Forward pricing is often extended to end-users by soybean oil processors where the forward price quote is a function of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) futures price and the cash-futures basis. Upon entering a forward pricing agreement, the processor (seller) assumes the risk associated with basis fluctuations. This research examines if soybean oil processors extract a market premium for assuming this risk. Using forward basis quotes and subsequent realized basis values for soybean oil, it is found that soybean oil processors do not charge an embedded cost for their forward pricing services. Furthermore, the results suggest that the absence of a statistically significant embedded cost may be due to the lack of predictability in the basis or the inability of soybean oil processors to adequately forecast soybean oil basis levels.","[Lewis, Karen E.] Univ Tennessee, Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Altman, Ira J.; Sanders, Dwight R.] So Illinois Univ, Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Manfredo, Mark R.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Lewis, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Agr & Resource Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",klewis39@utk.edu; IAltman@siu.edu; manfredo@asu.edu; DwightS@siu.edu,,"DeLong, Karen/0000-0002-6352-7171",,,,,17,2,3,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SUM,2015,31,3,,,,,388,398,,10.1002/agr.21410,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,CM9FO,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358013000006,0

We examine these relationships empirically in two studies. In study 1, using data from 114 agribusiness cooperatives, we demonstrate that strategic attributes have a greater influence on organizational performance than organizational attributes. In study 2, we replicate the design from study 1, i.e., tracking attribute scores over time, with a subsample of 25 cooperatives 4 years later. This second study generally confirms the findings of study 1.

Information sources include a thorough review of the literature, a statistical survey of farmers in the major maize-producing areas of the country, and key informant interviews conducted with seed company representatives. We discuss the merits of two strategies: (1) liberalizing the provision of original orange maize planting material to all seed companies with the aim of maximizing the impact of this public health intervention, and (2) exclusive rights granted to companies with the goals of preserving differentiated products and ensuring standard seed quality to protect the brand. We find that, exclusive or not, risk-sharing contracts with any company that takes up this product, as well as building and maintaining a unique brand for orange maize would be essential for the success of this product.

Although deterministic trend and seasonal price movements are present, a stochastic large-amplitude cycle with a period of 3.3 years is the predominant source of variation in the U.S. all-milk price during the period analyzed. These cycles are consistent with the hypothesis that supply chain managers make decisions based on bounded rationality, with limited supply chain coordination. The presence of price cycles in the U.S. dairy industry has management implications for dairy farmers, dairy processors, exporters, and food retailers. Forecasting and analytical models of U.S. farm milk prices should be designed to account for cyclical farm milk price behavior. [EconLit Classifications: Q11; Q13].

The applied model follows the principle of aggregating all the costs of producing, transporting, and processing food crops on the different levels of the supply chains and increasing the non-GM price premium of the final product for each level. Results indicate that ensuring coexistence results in a price some 7.4% to 13.8% higher for non-GM food products depending on assumed segregation strategies in the two agri-food supply chains analyzed. Altogether this study substantiates the suggestion that costs of GMO-related coexistence in the food sector can only be traced by a case-by-case analysis and are influenced by multiple, dynamically changing factors [EconLit Subject Descriptors: L660, Q180].

In each case, we find strong organic premiums of about 30% for bagged carrots, over 40% for canned soup, over 50% for coffee, and over 70% for milk. Using the estimated results from the hedonic price model, we pool the results across products, markets, and years, and then estimate a novel second-stage model where we uncover retail-level market factors associated with higher or lower premiums. For example, we find that category-level organic sales are associated with higher organic price premiums, whereas category-level nonorganic sales are associated with lower premiums. Taken collectively, our results suggest that organic price premiums are not threatened in the near term, but that several competing factors help moderate the size of the premiums.

We found that participants were willing to pay a premium for local or domestically produced apple juice. Organic production methods positively impacted participants' WTP for both products. Additionally, results suggest that consumer visual attention increases for important product attributes that positively or negatively impact their WTP bids. Supply chain members (producers, processors, and retailers) can promote important product attributes using labels and in-store promotions to give consumers additional information and influence their food selection preferences.

Nevertheless, these studies either focus on entire manufacturing sectors or on the U.S. food sector. This article, therefore, aims to determine the sources of firm profitability variation for EU food processors using the classical approaches of hierarchical ANOVA and COV. The paper also highlights a lack of the hierarchical ANOVA effect introduction pattern that occurs throughout previous literature.

Specifically, the mid-term reform, implemented in 2005, represented a deep change in the tools applied in the CAP, with a change from coupled income support to a single decoupled aid where farmers' incomes are directly supported and are no longer linked to levels or types of production. We hypothesize that price transmission along the wheat-pasta supply chain has been affected by CAP reform and other events through greater price volatility for durum wheat and market power exerted by some firms along the supply chain. For the present study, we are particularly interested in examining whether and how CAP reform has altered price transmission in the Italian wheat-pasta chain, from farmer to retailer, including the wholesale stage. We employ the Kinnucan and Forker model, which provides a convenient instrument for analyzing the impact of policy intervention, and adapted its structure to the characteristics and the composition of the pasta supply chain by introducing an intermediate level (wholesale price), represented by semolina producers. The results suggest that pricing behavior has changed after CAP Reform introduction.

Property rights on these marks are allocated, by a public authority, to a specific area. However, the size of the protected area is hardly defined solely on technical characteristics, rather it is often an issue of political debate among different stakeholders (producers and consumers). This paper aims at investigating the bargaining process leading to the definition of a Geographical Indication area. Drawing on historical evidence from three cases, we build a three-stage Political Economy Model in which the size of the protected area is endogenously determined. The resulting politically optimal area is compared to the social optimum. Results show that lobbying strength, quantity supplied, and market potential play an important role in explaining deviations from the social optimum.[EconLit citations: D72; I18; Q18].

As symmetry of pass-through has been questioned in new pricing-to-market (PTM) studies, we argue that this asymmetric impact of the exchange rate on trade should be explicitly modeled within the gravity framework. This consideration of asymmetric effects of exchange rate appreciations and depreciations on export values and quantities might provide insights into the driving forces of PTM in a particular market (or group of markets) given that the existing literature emphasizes two main hypotheses that explain the occurrence of an asymmetric PTM (market share hypothesis and marketing bottleneck hypothesis). In this paper, we propose a way to integrate individual (asymmetric) long-run effects of currency appreciations and depreciations on trade flows into the gravity model and empirically investigate which of the driving forces is relevant for the case of German beer exports. PTM studies often argue that the market share protection is a reason for local currency price stabilization mechanisms applied in the most important markets. Yet, the results of our analysis reveal that this might no longer be the case when all trading partners are considered. [EconLit citations: C33; F14; L66].

The selected loglog fractional regression model revealed that mean technical efficiency (MTE) increased over time with a mean value of 62%. MTEs of geographical sections of Ghana are also similar. Time series models possess higher MTE than panel data MTEs. In line with theory, models without functional forms and distance functions elicited higher MTE than Cobb-Douglas and translog functions. Nontraditional agricultural production showed higher MTE than traditional agriculture. MTEs in the production subsector do not differ from those in the manufacturing subsector. While this indifference suggests that value adding manufacturing subsector is as efficient as the primary production agriculture, and the increasing MTE notwithstanding, efficiency improving measures including training in farm management are required to make up for the mean difference of 38% found.

The results show that imported rice is largely preferred to local rice, especially in urban areas. Cleanness and whiteness appear to be the most preferred attributes, especially for imported rice. Togolese consumers are willing to pay a premium of up to 46% of the actual price for cleanness and 53% for whiteness in locally produced rice.

This paper examines the diversities in the magnitude of the geographic distance effects on primary agricultural trade and on processed food trade between OECD countries. The empirical results from different specifications of the gravity model reveal the existence of significant variations in the magnitude of the distance effects on primary agricultural trade and on processed food trade over time and through economic, geo-economic, and socio-economic characteristics of the exporting and importing countries. These findings imply that disregarding the variations through the distance effect by relying on overall estimates would adversely affect the design of trade policies, and would limit the understanding of trade patterns.","Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge,"Ghazalian, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",pascal.ghazalian@uleth.ca,,"Ghazalian, Pascal/0000-0002-6230-6879",,,,,48,4,5,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2015,31,2,,,,,148,170,,10.1002/agr.21397,0.0,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,CF8FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352791600001,0

Technical efficiency scores for the industry are estimated using the data envelopment analysis approach. Moreover, bootstrapped truncated regressions and OLS regressions are applied in order to investigate the factors affecting technical efficiency. The empirical results indicate that there is a fluctuation of technical efficiency scores among the sectors of the food and beverages industry. Furthermore, the findings obtained from both the Tobit and the OLS regressions support that the factors affecting positively the level of technical efficiency are sector size, capital productivity, labor productivity, and labor intensity. The results also show that the technical efficiency of the whole industry tended to decrease during the period 1984-2007. Moreover, the present paper provides some policy recommendations that may be useful for the industry to overcome the present economic crisis. Finally, in future research, the technical efficiency of the Greek food industry will be analyzed based on the meta-analysis approach.

We provide a theoretical model of veterinarian market supply and demand with particular emphasis on rurality, gender, and demand side change. We also estimate bivariate Tobit models of location choice for 1990, 2000, and 2010. Results suggest that female veterinarians are less responsive to the presence of food animals than their male counterparts. For both genders, veterinarians are more responsive to animals of higher value. Using animal caretakers as a proxy for companion animals, we find that female veterinarians have become more responsive to this indicator over the 20 years. All else equal, female and male veterinarians tend not to locate in rural areas. Aversion to rural areas has remained fixed over time among males but has strengthened among females.

Temperatures are increasing worldwide, and most regions are exposed to water deficits more frequently. Higher temperatures trigger advanced phenology. This shifts the ripening phase to warmer periods in the summer, which will affect grape composition, in particular with respect to aroma compounds. Increased water stress reduces yields and modifies fruit composition. The frequency of extreme climatic events ( hail, flooding) is likely to increase. Depending on the region and the amount of change, this may have positive or negative implications on wine quality.

The expert opinions examined are the wine quality ratings provided by two of the world's foremost wine experts, Robert Parker and Jancis Robinson, for more than 1,700 red Bordeaux wines over the period 2004-2012. The results show that the experts' ratings have both a statistically and practically significant impact on prices after controlling for the effects of other known determinants of price. Thus, expert opinion has significant value in this setting. The results further show that although Parker's impact on prices is significantly greater than Robinson's, combining the quality ratings of both experts has a significantly greater impact than Parker's ratings alone. As hypothesized, the strength of the results differs for wines produced in different regions of Bordeaux because of differences in the availability of other quality-related information.

We found one consumer segment with opposing preferences for GM and organic products and a second one exhibiting positive preferences for GMand organic products.

The analysis allows for asymmetric adjustment among food prices when the wholesale or retail stages exert oligopoly power. The study provides a theoretical underpinning of the relationship between domestic and international prices. Asymmetries in price transmission are examined using the Houck as well as the error-correction approaches. The impulse response analyses show that red pepper prices return to their long-term equilibria relatively quickly, whereas onion prices settle at a new equilibrium after a price shock. Market power in the wholesale sector affects the responses of onion prices but has little or no effect on the responses of red pepper prices. Market power in the retail sector does not affect the onion prices or the red pepper prices. Analysis of weekly price data over the period from 2005 to 2008 suggests asymmetric adjustment in producer-wholesale and international-producer prices in the Dutch onion supply chain. The results also show asymmetric transmission between producer and retail prices for red pepper. [EconLit Classifications: L130; C320; Q110]. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","[Verreth, Daphne M.

Food retailers may have reacted by adjusting prices to reintroduce psychological prices as before the Euro changeover. We employ a detailed data set of German food retail prices before and after the Euro changeover to test three different benchmarks indicating potential adjustments of prices. However, none of these benchmarks do adequately reflect the actual distribution of prices. We find that prices of signpost items follow best a conversion at the official rate. Also, signpost items show a slower price adjustment. Occasional goods' prices indicate a reestablishment of psychological price patterns, in particular for the ending digits; price distributions are adjusted faster. Further, price inflation is about zero for both goods, but prices in particular for signpost items have been significantly raised just before the Euro changeover. These different pricing patterns may be explained by consumer behavior. Consumers react more sensitive to price changes of frequently purchased goods (signpost items), and thus, retailers convert prices at the official rate and postpone price adjustments for these items after the Euro changeover.

However, after an intense lobbying campaign, the liberalization of the planting rights system was overturned in 2013, and new regulations could create an even more restrictive system. European wine associations have complained about the detrimental effects of the new regulations. There is a precedent in history. In 1726, the French political philosopher and landowner Montesquieu complained to the French king about the prohibition on planting new vines. Montesquieu was not successful in his demands to remove the system of planting rights. Old and recent history suggests that political forces against liberalization of planting rights are very strong. Only the French Revolution in 1789 led to a fundamental liberalization of planting rights. The liberal period of the nineteenth century was sustained by the combination of the French Revolution's liberal ideology, the thirst of Napoleon's armies for wine, and diseases that wiped out most of the French vineyards. That said, in the past and the present, enforcement of planting rights is a major problem. In fact, despite the official restrictions, Montesquieu managed to plant his vines, allowing him to become a successful wine producer and merchant, to travel, and to spend time thinking, discussing, and ultimately writing up his ideas that influenced much of the Western world's constitutions.

Little research has examined differences in cultural preferences for these vegetables. Using conjoint analysis within an online survey of Canada and key export markets in the U.S., we examine consumer preference for external attributes of several (okra, yardlong bean, and Asian long purple eggplant) ethno-cultural vegetables. Further, we examine how wide-scale introduction of U.S., Ontario, and Quebec vegetables into Ontario impacts the market. Our results indicate differences between ethnic heritage group preferences. We find home country bias as most ethnic groups positively value product from their home country. Results also indicate that the value of external quality, such as freshness, appearance, size, and firmness, on the purchase decision is different across ethnic heritage groups. We also find that the introduction of Ontario product competes well with U.S. product in Ontario, however, Quebec product could be the biggest competitor to Ontario production.

The results revealed that the marketing, network, and innovation capabilities directly and positively affect performance. SMEs benefit from selling their products in the national market. The network capability plays a dual role: It has a direct positive influence on performance as well as an indirect effect on the capability to acquire information about market and supply chain agents. The acquired market- and consumer-related information is extremely valuable in enhancing the marketing capability and improving performance.

Wine quality will also be affected, which will raise economic issues. Possible adaptations may result from changes in plant material, viticultural techniques, and the wine-making process. Relocation of vineyards to cooler areas and increased irrigation are other options, but they may result in potential conflicts for land and water use. Grapes are currently grown in many regions around the world, and growers have adapted their practices to the wide range of climatic conditions that can be found among or inside these areas. This knowledge is precious for identifying potential adaptations to climate change. Because climate change affects all activities linked to wine production (grape growing, wine making, wine economics, and environmental issues), multidisciplinary research is needed to guide growers to continue to produce high-quality wines in an economical and environmentally sustainable way. An example of such an interdisciplinary study is the French LACCAVE (long-term adaptation to climate change in viticulture and enology) project, in which researchers from 23 institutes work together on all issues related to the impact of climate change on wine production.

Both corn and soybeans exhibited a downward trend in the cost of forward contracting for January delivery, in contrast to previous pre-harvest results, and the March delivery cost of forward contracting is slightly downward sloped. The cost of post-harvest forward contracting corn and soybeans averaged 2 cents and 6 cents respectively; this was much less than the cost of pre-harvest forward contracting in recent years. We did not find an increase in cost associated with income shifting associated with January delivery. We conclude that January forward contracts offer a relatively inexpensive means of smoothing income across years.

Motivation for this study is the declining market share of the domestic early potato, considered an important crop in both countries, due to the competition from abroad. A focal aspect of this research is the recent public interest for social justice, traditionally reserved for products imported from developing countries, with respect to ethical products made in developed countries.

We find that the calorie content posting lead to the highest calorie reduction, but it was also the only treatment associated with a significant reduction in the fiber content of the meal. The complete nutrition-facts panel treatment resulted in most sizable decreases in problematic nutrient content such as empty calories and calories from fat and added sugar. The health-related claims treatment led to a reduction in carbohydrates and calories from fat.

We choose a flexible Markov-switching error-correction model as the framework for our price transmission analysis. The results show that the price transmission regime was not changed by the export ban. Thus, the export controls were not successful in dampening the domestic wheat price level. We make evident that the expected price decreasing effects of the export ban were offset by inconsistent additional policy measures and their faulty sequencing. Further, the governmental market interventions had even long-lasting destabilizing market effects. Market instability was increased particularly after the cancellation of the export ban.

This is due to the spread of the Mediterranean diet and increasing consumer awareness about the health benefits of olive oil. We investigated the role of the main extrinsic quality cues (size of container, product category, organic certification, geographical indications, country of origin, and brand) in affecting the price of olive oil sold in the U.S. e-commerce retail market. Using data from amazon.com, the leading e-retailer in the United States, a hedonic price model was estimated. Results show that all the considered extrinsic quality cues have a significant impact on the price of olive oil, with interesting implications for both practitioners and policy makers.

Spillover effects are modeled using the conventional linear and constant elasticity of substitution (CES) advertising production functions. The latter allows for imperfect substitution between brand advertising and spillovers from advertising all other brands belonging to the same company as well as relaxes the assumption of constant returns to scale. Empirical results confirm strong and positive brand advertising spillover effects across brands belonging to the same company as well as negative spillover effects from advertising by competitors. Empirical results also indicate that the CES advertising production function outperforms the linear function, providing strong support for decreasing returns to scale in advertising and imperfect substitution between brand advertising and advertising of other brands in the same company. Finally, the CES function results in significantly higher estimates of the price elasticities of demand as well as lower estimated markups.

We also describe what has been learned so far about possible adaptation strategies for grape growers that would allow them to mitigate the economic effects of climate change. We conclude that climate change is likely to produce winners and losers, with the winners being those closer to theNorth and South Poles. There are also likely to be some substantial short-run costs as growers adapt to climate change.

RCM outputs were used to feed a grapevine growth simulation model, which was developed, tested, and calibrated for the Sangiovese variety. The study area was identified by implementing a bioclimatic classification of the regions based on the Winkler Index (ranging from 1,700 to 1,900 thermal units). The results indicated that the projected increasing temperatures will result in a general acceleration and shortening of the phenological stages compared to the present period. Accordingly, the reduction in time for biomass accumulation negatively affected the final yield. Few exceptions were found in the northern and central regions of the study area (southern France and western Balkans) for which changes in climatic conditions were not limiting and the crop benefited from the enhanced atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide.

Given the numerous attributes that can be present in a product, characterizing those leading to a higher premium can help manufacturers to engage in profitable product formulation. This paper investigates the role played by health and nonhealth-related attributes on yogurt prices in the United States, both at the national level and in different geographic markets, by means of a large scanner database of yogurt sales and a hedonic price model. The findings indicate that health-related attributes more commonly associated with yogurts such as the presence of probiotics, specific health claims, and other credence attributes (i.e., organic and natural) are valued positively while others, which may lead to lower product acceptance (e.g., fibers, Omega-3) are not. Nonhealth-related features, such as for kids and Greek-style, show a positive market value, thus helping in product differentiation. The magnitude of the implicit price of most product attributes is found to vary across markets, hinting that food manufacturers should consider market-specific product formulation strategies to achieve product differentiation more effectively.

Accordingly, the range and magnitude of environmental factors differ considerably from region to region and so do the principal environmental constraints for grape production. The type, number, and magnitude of environmental constraints are currently undergoing changes due to shifts in climate patterns already observed for the past and predicted for the future. These changes are already affecting grape composition with observed changes in sugar and acidity concentrations. As with other components such as polyphenols or aroma compounds, their relationships to environmental changes are more difficult to quantify. In general, one can divide the expected climatic changes during the grape-ripening period into two scenarios: warmer and dryer and warmer and moister, with different responses for red and white grape varieties. The production challenges within this broad separation are vastly different, and the strategies to ensure a sustainable product need to be adapted accordingly. The economic impact of these changes is difficult to assess. An in-depth analysis is necessary to construct relevant scenarios and risk analysis for individual regions and to quantify the costs and/or benefits of regional climate developments.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) generic producer support estimate methodology has been able to capture some of the supports, but it excludes such measures as subsidized distillation of low-quality wine, grants to promote wine generically, protection via import tariffs, and grubbing- up premiums. Nor does the OECD disaggregate EU supports to individual member countries. This article provides a new set of more complete estimates of support to EU wine producers. It also reveals how unevenly those supports are spread across EU member countries.

Although functional foods exhibit a significant level of information asymmetry, consumers appear to be increasingly appreciative, recognizing their role in preventing or reducing health risks and/or improving other physiological functions. This paper quantifies the willingness to pay of a representative sample of 600 Italian consumers for a hypothetical yogurt using a web-based stated choice experiment. The willingness to pay for two functional attributes (probiotics and catechin enrichment) was measured using the panel data version of a Random Parameters Logit model. The results show that respondents are willing to pay a premium for a catechin-enriched yogurt (0.38 Euro/jar), which is well above their willingness to pay for the probiotic attribute (0.21 Euro/jar). Averaging the individual values across sample sub-groups indicates that the willingness to pay for catechin enrichment may be related to age, income, health status, lifestyle and education.

Motivated by a recognition of consumers' accessed information sets, the impact of temperature and rainfall on retail wine prices is assessed through their relation with quality ratings from a high-profile wine guide and then on prices. For a broad spectrum of different quality wines from a cross section of wines available in 2014 and a separate analysis of eight wine varieties, the indirect approach to modeling weather effects through wine quality is found to be superior than assuming weather impacts directly on retail prices. The results also demonstrate the importance of regional variations in weather conditions in influencing prices and identify the optimal season growing temperatures for different grape varieties.

This paper analyzes simultaneously the impact of human values and personality on the demand for organic tomatoes applying open-ended choice experiments. Results show that consumers make a distinction between conventional and organic tomatoes, such that human values have a differential impact with regard to predicting demand for products associated with organic labels. Consumers with strong individualistic domains of hedonism and stimulation are more likely to have a higher demand for organic, the same holds for consumers with the strong collectivist domain conformity, and those values that regard both (security and universalism). Also, consumers distinguish between conventional and organic tomatoes, such that personality has a differential impact with regard to predicting demand for organic products. The more agreeable the consumer, the higher the demand for organic tomatoes. In addition, results indicate that when modeled simultaneously, values are more stable in affecting demand compared to effects resulting from personality. Overall, results indicate that human values and personality are able to explain a portion of the variability of demand.

One of the key features of this spatial producer price transmission is the very important role Hungary plays in supplying wheat to Slovenia. Using monthly data from January 2000 to April 2011, spatial price transmission is analyzed from a number of perspectives, using a wealth of econometric techniques in order to shed light upon the degree of integration, adjustment asymmetries and the role of market share upon price transmission. Empirical results rejected the validity of the Law of One Price, identified Hungary as the price-leading market, confirmed competitive symmetric price adjustment, and emphasized the role of Hungarian market share in total Slovenian imports with respect to wheat price transmission elasticity. The results imply that wheat producer prices in both of the analyzed countries tend to be internationally determined.

This relationship is stronger for smaller firms and is robust to alternative explanations based on regulatory differences.","[Dardati, Evangelina] ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Econ, Erasmo Escala 1835,Off 11, Santiago 8340539, Chile; [Riutort, Julio] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago 7941169, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Dardati, E (通讯作者)，ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Econ, Erasmo Escala 1835,Off 11, Santiago 8340539, Chile.",edardati@uahurtado.cl; julio.riutort@uai.cl,,"Riutort, Julio/0000-0002-6350-9395",CONICYT; FONDECYT Iniciacion [11130278],CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); FONDECYT Iniciacion(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"Evangelina Dardati acknowledges financial support from CONICYT, FONDECYT Iniciacion 11130278.",,39,4,4,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In India, for example, subsidized, nonvolumetric pricing of the electricity used to pump groundwater is politically entrenched and often blamed for groundwater depletion. Are there politically feasible ways to introduce incentives for conservation? We worked with a state government to design and test an alternative, voluntary approach, that invites farmers to install electricity meters and receive compensation for every unit they save. Interest in participation was high, leading to an unprecedented voluntary shift to meter-based billing, but we found no impacts on water usage. These results provide some of the first empirical evidence on the effect of incentives on water use in India, and we discuss the extent to which they are informative about other policy tools, such as full pricing.","[Fishman, Ram] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fishman, Ram] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Modi, Vijay] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Parekh, Nikunj] Columbia Water Ctr, New Delhi, India",Tel Aviv University; George Washington University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Fishman, R (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Tel Aviv, Israel.;Fishman, R (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",ramf@post.tau.ac.il,"Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009","Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128",,,,,57,29,34,1,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The minimum commute distance (MCD) and excess rate (ER) are used to compare observed home-to-work trip lengths with an optimal alternative commuter pattern in which the sum of the distance traveled by the working population is minimized. The MCD is a proximity indicator that measures the spatial match between the labor market and the housing stock, which can also be regarded as an interesting indicator of potential border effects on travel behavior, especially in the inter-regional context of Belgium. An MCD calculation requires an origin-destination (OD) matrix and a distance matrix. In our Belgian case study, we employ a recent OD matrix (2010) originating from Social Security (ONSS) data. We compare this matrix with data from the 2001 and 1991 census surveys. In addition to identifying trends in jobs-housing proximity, the article assesses methodological implications regarding geographical scale arising from the use of the two data sources mentioned. Based on the available data, it was found that average actual commuting distance increased over both periods studied, while in general, growth rates of MCD are considerably lower than growth rates of the actual commuting distance. This indicates that the spatial proximity between the labor market and the housing stock in Belgium has declined over all periods studied, although this loss of spatial proximity only explains a small part of the increase of the actual commuting distance. Furthermore, we found that the comparison of excess commuting metrics between regions and time periods sets high standards on data requirements, in which uniformity in data collection and spatial level of aggregation is of great importance. Finally, as the main contribution of this study, the results demonstrate, through a statistical approach, that municipalities that are experiencing a higher than-average increase in MCD and ER in one of the considered time frames are more likely to continue to exhibit a higher-than-average increase in the subsequent period. Therefore, the observed trends appear to be consistent over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the resources of the Romanian tourist patrimony, mineral and thermal waters, mofettes, salt mines, muds and the climate build up a valuable portfolio of the wellness tourism offer. These resources are used to recover and reacquire the strength to work, but also for minimizing the effects of degenerative diseases commonly affecting senior citizens. The aging of the population of the European Union is one of the challenges affecting this block on a macroeconomic level increasingly more visibly. A solution for minimizing the effects of the rising number of senior citizens might be the integration of the Romanian wellness offer in the European tourist offer. Our country is also affected by this phenomenon and the existing wellness resources are useful in diminishing the negative effects of the aging process. The research began by analyzing the specialized literature, which confirmed the phenomenon of aging among the Europe's population. This was followed by a pilot study (287 respondents) which was undertaken from June to December 2015 on representatives of the Romanian population. Romania's tourist heritage, represented by its wellness tourism resources, may represent an important tourist product on the European market which can help senior citizens benefit from treatments of degenerative illnesses.","[Aluculesei, Alina-Cerasela; Nistoreanu, Puiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Aluculesei, AC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alina_cerasella@yahoo.com,"Avram, Alina-Cerasela/AAM-1619-2021; Aluculesei (Avram), Alina-Cerasela/T-2567-2018; Puiu, Nistoreanu/C-1021-2009","Avram, Alina-Cerasela/0000-0002-3825-4300; Aluculesei (Avram), Alina-Cerasela/0000-0002-3825-4300; Puiu, Nistoreanu/0000-0002-8369-7899",,,,,48,5,5,3,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18,,,,10,,767,780,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700004,0

Despite a large literature examining subsidies' effects on output and welfare, little is known about their political effects. This paper examines Malawi's Agricultural Input Subsidy Programme, one of the largest and most expensive programs implemented, which was launched by the government in 2005. We examine whether the incumbent party, the Democratic Progressive Party headed by president Bingu wa Mutharika, benefited from Malawi's subsidy program by examining a longitudinal dataset of 1,846 rural Malawians interviewed in 2008 and again in 2010. The individual-level data show no evidence that the subsidy program was targeted to Mutharika's co-ethnics or co-partisans. Our analysis further demonstrates that the subsidy program increased support for the incumbent party. These results suggest that even when parties are unable or unwilling to target distributional programs at the local level, they may nonetheless derive political benefits. As anti-poverty programs including agricultural subsidies to small-scale farmers become increasingly common across the continent, our results suggest that they may help to explain patterns of party affiliation and vote choice, particularly where traditional patterns of partisan affiliation related to ethnic or regional identities are weak.

It outperforms substantially the well-known short-term reversal, momentum, and long-term reversal factors, which are based on the three price trends separately, by more than doubling their Sharpe ratios. During the recent financial crisis, the trend factor earns 0.75% per month, while the market loses -2.03% per month, the shortterm reversal factor loses -0.82%, the momentum factor loses -3.88%, and the long-term reversal factor barely gains 0.03%. The performance of the trend factor is robust to alternative formations and to a variety of control variables.

In order to research the impact of natural resources on tourism activity, on the one hand, and the influences of tourism on the environment, on the other hand, statistical and mathematical methods of analysis and forecast were used, namely, the analysis of the dynamics of significant indicators of the natural environment and of tourist activity, the correlation method, the Markov chains method. The analyses made lead us to the conclusion of the existence of a positive evolution of significant indicators of the natural environment, with an impact on tourist activity, such as natural parks. It has been emphasized; also, that this positive evolution has a direct influence on the attraction of visitors, specifically, foreign ones, but the intensity of this influence is average. The intensification of the actions of promotion of natural parks and, generally, of protected areas in Romania, would be a direction for attracting an increased number of visitors, with all the favourable economic consequences. On the other hand, the research has outlined the fact that, as far as the means of transportation used by tourists to visit Romania are concerned, on the first places we can see road and air transport, means of transportation which, aside from the obvious advantages for tourists, have a strong negative impact on the environment. The forecast made with the help of the Markov chains method has shown a negative trend, from the point of view of the impact on the environment, namely an increase in the share of road and air transport in the preference of foreign visitors to Romania. The current research represents a contribution to the efforts of measuring, through statistical and mathematical models, of the complex influences, in both senses, between the environment and tourist activity. Thus, an objective radiography has been made of these influences, for significant indicators of the natural environment and of tourism activity, with the aim of formulating directions of action for the increase of the positive impact and the diminishing of the negative effects.","[Ioncica, Diana; Ioncica, Maria; Petrescu, Eva-Cristina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ioncica, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",maria.ioncica@gmail.com,"PETRESCU, EVA-CRISTINA/IQT-9854-2023","Petrescu, Eva-Cristina/0009-0004-5365-1082; Ioncica, Diana/0000-0002-6522-3948",European Commission [308438],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),Some of the information presented is part of research in the ENHANCE - Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Disasters project in Europe (Grant Agreement number 308438) financed by the European Commission.

Diversifying maize monocrop with legumes has been proposed as one solution to declining soil fertility. Adoption of legumes in Africa remains low despite the much needed soil fertility and nutrition benefits provided by the crops. We employ choice experiments to examine farmers' preferences for groundnut, soybean, and pigeon pea inter cropped with maize and explore barriers and drivers to adoption in Central and Southern Malawi. Overall, farmers significantly discount legume yields in favor of maize yields despite the additional benefits provided by legumes. Labor constraints and market access are potentially more important barriers to legume adoption than previously thought. Results identified three types of farmers with varying preferences for grain yields, the largest group (48%) associated with strongly positive preference for both legume and maize grain yield, a medium-sized group (35%) that values only maize yield, and the smallest group (17%) having preferences only for legume yield. The medium group may be growing legumes for other benefits such as enhanced maize productivity, and the smallest group may be primarily subsistence producers. These findings suggest that uptake of legume maize intercrop systems might be improved if practitioners focus on legumes that have lower labor requirements and better marketability.

Semi-structured interviews conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand, with 51 drivers and nondrivers, aged 18-35 years old, form the empirical material. The findings build upon previous research and extend understandings of how seven explanatory factors; perceptual, value and preference, social, built environment, economic, legal/policy and technological, work both to continue the current automobility paradigm, and to challenge it by adopting alternative mobilities. We use the Energy Cultures Framework as an analytical tool to explore the ways through which materialites, norms, practices, and external context can replicate or reduce participation in the hegemonic mobility paradigm. This approach offers useful insights into the interactions between what the research participants think, have and do, and how this is resulting in a reduction in automobility norms amongst some younger people. It also identifies and highlights potential opportunities to leverage upon current change trends to assist a systemic transition away from automobility towards a culture of multi-mobilities.

These services may increase access to transportation for some individuals, but it is unclear whether these benefits are equitably distributed across different neighborhoods. In this paper, we explore the spatial variability in wait times for a TNC vehicle throughout the Seattle, WA region, testing whether areas with lower average income or a greater percentage of minorities experience different waiting times than other areas. We collected approximately 1 million observations of estimated waiting times, quasi-randomly sampled over approximately two months in 2015. We analyzed spatial and temporal patterns using local regression, which suggested lower wait times in densely populated areas of the Seattle region, and the lowest wait times during midday hours. We developed a spatial error regression model to investigate relationships between wait times and socioeconomic indicators at the census block group (CBG) level. We find that conditional on other covariates, expected waiting times are longer in CBGs with higher average income, and shorter in CBGs with greater population density and employment density. After adjusting for differences in density and income, a higher percentage of minorities in a CBG is associated with longer waiting times late at night and shorter waiting times during the day, with an average effect of close to zero. Geographically weighted regression indicates that the strength, and in some cases the sign, of these relationships varies throughout the Seattle region. Overall, the results suggests that transportation network companies offer higher performance in dense urban areas, and that adequate access to TNC services is not necessarily restricted to areas that are white and wealthy.

Employing a unique cross-sectional data set of 413 adults, we examine the relationship of the antecedents of happiness on its outcomes via mediation analysis. We show that the web of relations in this domain is more complicated than it is commonly understood. We provide empirical evidence that income enhances individuals' life satisfaction. We also find a non-linearity in the relation of age to frugality and to attitude towards debt. Whereas a positive relationship exists between employment and frugality, income negatively affects frugality. We find strong evidence to suggest that life satisfaction reverses the relationships of employment and income to frugality. Additionally, we obtained empirical evidence to suggest that employment, income and sex positively affect attitude towards debt. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that the relationships of age and. income to attitude towards debt are complementarily mediated by frugality while frugality competitively mediates the relationship of employment to attitude towards debt. Finally, the results reveal that there exists an indirect-only effect of life satisfaction to attitudes towards debt through frugality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In 2 surveys, subjects were asked to assess the fairness of 3 hypothetical distributions of resources between 2 agents, who differed in their ability to convert these resources into final goods. Even though the relative popularity of alternative distributions is similar among religious and nonreligious people, some significant differences emerged between these 2 groups. With minimal information about the abilities of the agents, less religious people were more likely to prefer the egalitarian distribution and less likely to prefer the Rawlsian distribution. When differences in abilities were explained to be due to external factors, we observed a similar pattern. However, when the differences in abilities were due to voluntary choices of the agents, utilitarian distribution was the most popular choice by both religious and nonreligious people. These results remained robust when we controlled for other relevant factors. Religious and nonreligious people also disagreed on the issues around working toward making everyone equal, and insuring people who make unlucky economic choices.","[Elgin, Ceyhun; Gurdal, Mehmet Y.; Yilmaz, Murat] Bogazici Univ, TR-80815 Bebek, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Elgin, C (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Natuk Birkan Bldg, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",ceyhun.elgin@boun.edu.tr,"Gurdal, Mehmet/AAS-2374-2020; Yilmaz, Murat/M-3046-2013; Elgin, Ceyhun/D-3123-2014","Elgin, Ceyhun/0000-0001-8796-2429; Gurdal, Mehmet/0000-0002-5692-3846",,,,,38,1,1,0,12,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

By using the French Labor Force Survey and the ILO's standards, I construct gross worker flows and transition rates between the three main labor market states: employment, unemployment and inactivity. The cyclical properties of the series suggest that flows jointly involving employment and unemployment are the most sensitive to economic conditions. Flows between participation and non-participation exhibit less cyclical patterns over the business cycle. I then decompose unemployment rate variations by applying a steady state and a non-steady state decomposition. With a three state view of the labor market, I find that the job finding rate is the first driver of unemployment fluctuations in France, while the job separation rate is the second. Furthermore, the role of inactivity in shaping unemployment is not negligible since it explains one quarter of its variations. This empirical finding justifies a complete analysis of the labor market with three labor market states. Finally, I propose an analysis based on three partitions of the French population: gender, age and education level. This indicates that the sources of unemployment are different among these sub-groups.","[Fontaine, Idriss] Univ La Reunion, St Clotilde, Reunion, France",University of La Reunion,"Fontaine, I (通讯作者)，Univ La Reunion, St Clotilde, Reunion, France.",idriss.fontaine@univ-reunion.fr,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The asymptotic null distributions of these tests are standard and free of nuisance parameters. The finite-sample validity of the approach is established through Monte Carlo simulations, which also provides evidence of power gains over least-squares-based procedures under non-Gaussian errors. An empirical application on daily realized volatility computed for a cross-section of individual stocks, on realized volatility of the S&P 500 index, and on option-based implied volatility is presented. The main finding is that the suitability of a fractionally integrated model with a constant order of integration around 0.4 cannot be rejected along the different percentiles of the distribution, providing in this way strong support for the existence of long memory in realized volatility from a completely new perspective.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Banco De Portugal, Germany; Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVASBE, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rubia, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Campus San Vicente Raspeig, Alicante 03008, Spain",Goethe University Frankfurt; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universitat d'Alacant,"Rubia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Campus San Vicente Raspeig, Alicante 03008, Spain.",antonio.rubia@ua.es,"Rodrigues, Paulo M.

Agents are homogeneous in their preferences, but heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding the drift rate of the aggregate endowment process. Given a competitive equilibrium in this economy, we construct a tractable representative agent model that would approximate asset prices in the original multiple agents economy.

It is consistent with the facts that RMB is often said to be undervalued and there are political conflicts between China and its largest trade partner, the US.

While most papers within this framework consider a fiscal deficit that occurs with certainty, in reality an increase in the government's fiscal burden may be an uncertain outcome. This paper introduces a model where there is uncertainty about the occurrence of a fiscal deficit for a finite number of periods, and studies the effects of such uncertainty on the evolution of currency crises. If the fiscal deficit materializes, the government has to abandon the fixed exchange rate regime, as in the standard case. However, the paper shows that the peg becomes unsustainable even if the fiscal deficit never materializes. Therefore, a speculative attack occurs and the fixed exchange rate regime collapses with the mere possibility of a deficit, independently of whether this outcome actually occurs or not.","[Gumus, Inci] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Gumus, I (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",incigumus@sabanciuniv.edu,"Gumus, Inci/AAY-8597-2020","Gumus, Inci/0000-0003-4667-0109",,,,,12,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This result is consistent with an upward-sloping equity yield curve.","[Schroder, David] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Esterer, Florian] Bank J Safra Sarasin AG, Basel, Switzerland",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Schröder, D (通讯作者)，Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HU, England.",d.schroeder@bbk.ac.uk; Florian.Esterer@jsafrasarasin.com,,,,,,,88,4,5,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The correlations between investors' confidence in the markets, money growth and economic growth are analyzed along with the correlations within their volatilities. Specifically, the heteroskedasticity of the errors is exploited in a Multivariate GARCH framework to obtain endogenously estimated measures of uncertainty. By a two-step estimator, the indirect interplay of money growth and financial markets is highlighted at different time horizons. The results contrast previous literature supportive of the Great Moderation as causing the recent financial crisis. Effectively, by accounting for the breaks in volatility series due to structural shifts in monetary policy, a low period of macroeconomic volatility is found not to drive directly low financial stability.

Mobile phones' independence of landline telecommunication networks qualifies them for information exchange even in remote rural areas. Whereas technology spillovers via international trade and foreign direct investment have been widely explored by the literature, international migration and rural urban migration have hardly been explored as vehicles for technology diffusion. Motivated by the current extent of national and international migration, this paper addresses this lacuna. It draws upon data from rural households in Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and uses households' mobile phone ownership as an indicator for rural technology diffusion. Migration is modeled via an endogenous treatment regression approach. In a number of robustness checks, the variables, the sample, and the estimation technique are varied. The results provide empirical evidence for rural technology diffusion. In the survey areas, poverty-driven rural urban migration and related technology diffusion play a more important role than technology spillovers via international migration. The results show that total emigration as well as immigration can support technology diffusion, i.e., the dispersion of mobile phones, beyond monetary remittances. When controlling for education and household age (in a squared fashion) in the main regressions and in several robustness checks, emigration as well as immigration, however, exhibit a negative effect on households' mobile phone ownership (technology drain or technology impair effect). For development policy, the results suggest investments in education and the creation of financial opportunities to support rural technology diffusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It measures the effectiveness of the existing 'Most Favored Nations' (MFN) tariff rates applicable to lower-middle income countries and for countries sorted on the basis of manufacturing-to-trade shares, in lowering carbon emission. By applying a fixed effects panel regression method over 16 years, it is found that the MFN tariff rate helps these economies to reduce carbon emission substantially. In addition, the role of foreign direct investment as purveyor of clean products is explored at the cross-country level. The results, at least on the ground of better environmental standards, indicate the need to re-evaluate the choice for protection under the domain of multilateral trade negotiations.","[Kar, Saibal; Majumdar, Devleena] Ctr Studies Social Sci, R1 BP Township, Kolkata 700094, India; [Kar, Saibal] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Majumdar, Devleena] Jadavpur Univ, Kolkata, India",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Jadavpur University,"Kar, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Studies Social Sci, R1 BP Township, Kolkata 700094, India.;Kar, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",saibal@cssscal.org,"Bhowal, Devleena/JXN-3141-2024; Kar, Saibal/AAC-8174-2019","Bhowal, Devleena/0000-0002-6447-5684; Kar, Saibal/0000-0001-8134-1517",,,,,40,7,7,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The model demonstrates that reducing credit constraints increases the scale of production (scale effect) and increases the number of firms taking up production (market-size effect), while it also reduces emissions per unit of output (technique effect) and increases the share of firms investing in the technology upgrade (upgrading-composition effect). Because the former and latter effects are plausibly confounding in nature, the net effect of credit constraints on pollution emissions is an empirical question. This paper demonstrates, using variation in the timing of credit market reforms, that reducing credit constraints significantly improves air pollution. The results are robust using various approaches, including difference in differences (DID) with a rich set of controls, and an alternative DID approach, wherein the time series data are collapsed around credit reforms into a pre- and post-period.","[Andersen, Dana C.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, 9-23 HM Tory, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Andersen, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, 9-23 HM Tory, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W1, Canada.",dca@ualberta.ca,,"Andersen, Dana/0000-0002-7734-6646",,,,,57,35,37,0,42,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The evidence suggests that independent directors have a positive effect because of their role in controlling both shareholder-manager conflicts (monitoring the use of funds) and current-new shareholder conflicts (certification of the issue's value).","[Ferreira, Miguel] Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Laux, Paul] Univ Delaware, Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Delaware,"Laux, P (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",miguel.ferreira@novasbe.pt; laux@udel.edu,"Ferreira, Miguel/HHZ-6251-2022; Ferreira, Miguel/B-7931-2009","Ferreira, Miguel/0000-0003-0537-2703",European Research Council; FCT Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-GES/119274/2010]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-GES/119274/2010] Funding Source: FCT,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); FCT Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank Anup Agrawal, Aydogan Alti, David Cicero, Espen Eckbo, Alberta Di Giuli, Denis Gromb, Xiaoxia Lou, Clara Raposo; participants at the 2008 European Finance Association Meetings; and seminar participants at IE Business School (Madrid), Lisbon University Institute, and the University of Padova for helpful comments.

A rapidly growing literature has been attempting to measure the strength of inequity aversion preferences as accurately as possible. We vary two factors that might affect the accuracy of the measurement of inequity aversion preference, i.e., choice sets with different underlying inequity aversion strength ranges and with different relative income inequities while absolute income inequities remain fixed. We find that unidirectional changes in the choice sets for disadvantageous and advantageous inequity aversion preferences significantly bias the measured strength of both preferences in the same directions of the changes and that the variance in inequity aversion increases with the range of choice sets. Moreover, a decrease in relative income inequity raises the measured strength of advantageous inequity aversion but does not affect disadvantageous inequity aversion preference. Our results suggest controlling for choice sets and relative income inequity between players to improve the measurement accuracy of inequity aversion preference. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To account for this, we analyze the principal-agent relationship within the fishing firm. In the case where the firm directly benefits from illegal fishing, the firm must induce its crew to violate regulations through the incentive scheme. Within this framework, we analyze how the allocation of liability between fishing firms and crew affects quota violations and the ability to design a socially efficient fisheries policy. We show that without wage frictions, it does not matter who is held liable. However, under the commonly used share systems of remuneration, crew liability generally yields a more efficient outcome than firm liability. Furthermore, asset restrictions may affect the outcome under various liability rules.","[Jensen, Frank] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark; [Nostbakken, Linda] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway",University of Copenhagen; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Jensen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark.;Nostbakken, L (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway.",fje@ifro.ku.dk; Linda.Nostbakken@nhh.no,,/0000-0002-4339-5095,,,,,34,2,3,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Conventional wisdom suggests that, by lowering the budgetary cost of the military, a draft reduces distortionary taxation, especially when military needs are large. We find that this intuition is misguided. When income taxes are set optimally, voluntary enlistments lead to less distortionary taxation than a draft, because the tax base left behind by a volunteer army tends to be more productive than that after a draft. For reasonable parameter values, drafts are more distortionary (and less socially desirable) when military needs are large.","[Koch, Thomas] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA; [Birchenall, Javier] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Koch, T (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",tkoch@ftc.gov,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,65,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2016,167,3-4,,,,,177,199,,10.1007/s11127-016-0334-7,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DQ4LB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379174300001,0

We use almost 20 years of British individual-level panel data to explore the impact on self-reported psychological well-being of two policy interventions: large increases in tobacco excise taxes and bans on smoking in public places. We use a difference-in-differences approach to compare the effects on well-being for likely smokers and non-smokers. We find robust evidence that increases in tobacco taxes raise the relative well-being of likely smokers. Exploiting regional variation in the timing of the smoking ban across Britain, we find no evidence that it raised smoker well-being.

Beyond providing a basic discussion of wealth inequality in Canada, this study also highlights wealth disparities by Aboriginal identity, immigrant status, education, and disability status. My findings show that although aggregate wealth inequality has remained stable over this period, disparities have continued to grow for certain disadvantaged groups. Family households with adult immigrants, people with disabilities, and those with less education held less in net worth even after accounting for differences in age, earnings, and inheritance. In addition, mediation models that demonstrate the indirect effects of group membership on net worth also show larger disparities over time.","[Maroto, Michelle] Univ Alberta, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Maroto, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant [430-2014-00092],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was partially supported by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Development Grant (#430-2014-00092).

Yet, such assessments are relevant both to public policies providing support to family caregivers and to private insurance markets for long-term care. This descriptive study presents a new method to address this problem: the construction of a crosswalk between time-use diaries and other types of surveys using lists of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) for which assistance is required. Analysis of pooled data from American time use survey 2003-2012 provides some quantitative indicators, but understates the temporal burden of care and fails to distinguish types of care that involve personal interaction from those that do not. A crosswalk of time-use survey categories with the list-based approach typically applied in public health surveys clearly demonstrates the importance of clear definitions and also offers more precise measures. Depending on how sandwich caregiving was defined, the temporal burden for caregiving ranged from 11.2 to 60 h per week, clustering at around 20 h per week for most cases. This result demonstrates the magnitude of sandwich care demands and also underscores the need for improved care survey design. As shown in this study, such efforts should take into account the implications of disaggregating data by gender and age, and definitional variations that characterize existing datasets.","[Suh, Jooyeoun] Univ Oxford, Ctr Time Use Res, 74 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6HP, England",University of Oxford,"Suh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Time Use Res, 74 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6HP, England.",jooyeoun.suh@sociology.ox.ac.uk,,"Gershuny, Jonathan/0000-0001-5011-0257","ESRC [ES/F037937/1, ES/L011662/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,17,24,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

This paper critically examines the rise of Chinese and Brazilian technical and economic cooperation in African agriculture with two cases drawn from Ghana and Mozambique. Using a historical framework, policy documents, case studies, and an analysis of the political economy of agrarian development, we trace the role of agricultural development in the relations of China and Brazil in Africa, and the extents to which recent developments in agribusiness and structural neoliberal reforms of African economies have influenced Brazilian and Chinese contemporary engagements with African agriculture. We examine the extent to which the different policy frameworks, political interests in agriculture, and institutional frameworks influence and impede the outcomes of Chinese and Brazilian development intents. We find that China and Brazil have different histories of experience within African agriculture, which influences the nature of their technical and development cooperation. Although they have distinct agrarian structures, the development of agribusiness and commercial seed, input and machinery sectors in China and Brazil influence engagements within Africa. These are often variants of the same interests that underlie the programs of northern donors, and frequently the two rising powers engage in trilateral arrangements with other donors and international agencies, particularly in the case of Brazil.

The banking system is not an exception being probably one of the pillars of the economic and financial integration of a state in a union. Banking integration may be considered the process leading to a convergence towards a single market for all products, processes, procedures, standards, transactions from the banking field. All sets of standards, mechanisms and procedures should be observed both by banks, regulation and control bodies, but also by customers. Only in this way one can create the premises for the most favourable banking transactions. The integration of the banking system in a union is determined, conditioned and influenced by a series of factors. Based on the data published by the Bank for International Settlements, the authors carry out a close and pertinent empirical analysis of the banking assets flows between the Eurozone countries in the period 2000-2014. The paper also deals with the commitments that the recent economic-financial crisis created on the banking assets flows. The authors resort to regression equations in order to demonstrate the connection between the effects of banking integration and various factors involved (the relative dimension of the country, the significance of the banks in the financial system, the Herfindhal index, the degree of concentration or dispersion of the property on banks, the degree of independence, the tradition of law). In order to measure the level of banking integration of the national bank systems, the indices we used are the degree of openness towards the exterior, the degree of internationalization of the national bank systems in the Eurozone. The results of this research point out a whole series of commitments from a scientific point of view, but also regarding a good practices model which should enhance the synergic integration of the different national banking systems. A part of the outlined conclusions may be oriented towards specific directions and levers in order to modify the national strategy for the adaptation of a candidate state to the Aquis communautaire.","[Badircea, Roxana; Manta, Alina; Pirvu, Ramona; Florea, Nicoleta] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Badîrcea, R (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",roxanamariapirvu@yahoo.com,"PIRVU, RAMONA/K-2221-2019; Florea, Nicoleta Mihaela/AAE-8226-2022; Doran, Nicoleta Mihaela/ADH-9887-2022; Manta, Alina Georgiana/AAV-3174-2021; Bădîrcea, Roxana/IZE-4389-2023; Bădîrcea, Roxana/AAK-4487-2021","PIRVU, RAMONA/0000-0002-6973-6521; Florea, Nicoleta Mihaela/0000-0003-3417-751X; Doran, Nicoleta Mihaela/0000-0003-3417-751X; Manta, Alina Georgiana/0000-0002-3558-7310;",,,,,44,4,4,0,22,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2016,18,42,,,,,317,334,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP1SW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378270700006,0

The stagnation of financial integration will therefore increase the cost of sustaining a monetary union, which in turn slows EMU enlargement and ruins the reputation of the euro. This paper aims to measure the damage to financial integration and to provide a more precise answer on real interest rate parity (RIP) convergence. Our estimation indicates that RIP between the EMU and some accession candidates is still valid after the interruptions of the financial crises. However, convergence of real interest rates cannot be achieved until 2030. This implies the EMU authority must strengthen regional financial integration to solidify the EMU and then be able to re-start enlargement.","[Yeh, Kuo-Chun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Ya-Chi] Taiwan Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Yeh, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei, Taiwan.",kuochunyeh@ntu.edu.tw,"Yeh, Kuo-chun/L-8588-2018; Lin, Ya-chi/ACA-8474-2022","Yeh, Kuo-chun/0000-0002-2430-3802; Lin, Ya-chi/0000-0003-3085-7614","National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC99-2410-H-194-025, NSC100-2811-H-194-002]","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Yeh (Corresponding author): Graduate Institute of National Development, National Taiwan University, Taiwan.

This is especially true in developing countries, where rates of deforestation are highest and cost-effective expansion of safe water supplies is needed the most. We present the first econometric study to estimate directly the effect of tropical forests on water treatment cost. We exploit a rich panel dataset from Malaysia, which enables us to control for a wide range of potentially confounding factors. We find significant, robust evidence that protecting both virgin and logged forests against conversion to nonforest land uses reduced water treatment costs, with protection of virgin forests reducing costs more. The marginal value of this water purification service varied greatly across treatment plants, thus implying that the service offered a stronger rationale for forest protection in some locations than others. On average, the service value was large relative to treatment plants' expenditures on priced inputs, but it was very small compared to producer surpluses for competing land uses. For various reasons, however, the latter comparison exaggerates the shortfall between the benefits and the costs of enhancing water purification by protecting forests. Moreover, forest protection decisions that appear to be economically unjustified when only water purification is considered might be justified when a broader range of services is taken into account.","[Vincent, Jeffrey R.; Burwell, Walter B., III; Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.; Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng; Thomas, Kyle] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Ahmad, Ismariah; Adnan, Norliyana] Forest Res Inst Malaysia, Kepong 52109, Selangor, Malaysia",Duke University; Institute Penyelidikan Perhutanan Malaysia,"Vincent, JR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Jeff.Vincent@duke.edu,"Vincent, Jeffrey/JZU-1149-2024","Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng/0000-0003-1804-9462",Global Environment Facility through the United Nations Development Programme [MAL/04/G31]; Government of Malaysia (through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment); Government of Malaysia (through Forest Research Institute Malaysia); Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),Global Environment Facility through the United Nations Development Programme; Government of Malaysia (through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment); Government of Malaysia (through Forest Research Institute Malaysia); Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)(CGIAR),"This study was funded by the Global Environment Facility through the United Nations Development Programme (MAL/04/G31), with additional support from the Government of Malaysia (through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Forest Research Institute Malaysia) and the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).

We estimate the likelihood of engaging in R&D as a function of a firm's distance from the relevant technological frontier and of the country's IPRs system. In line with previous literature, we find that (i) firms closer to the technological frontier are more likely to engage in formal R&D activities and (ii) stronger IPRs systems, because they protect returns from R&D activities from imitation, are more effective in promoting investment in R&D. Moreover, when the strength of an IPRs system interacts with the distance to the technological frontier, its effect is no longer significant, ceteris paribus. This is the most striking result of our study. When we examine the semi-elasticity of the strength of IPRs with respect to a firm's distance from the technological frontier, a weak yet positive impact on the firm's likelihood to engage in R&D is observed for very inefficient ones, whereas this becomes negative and weakly significant when firms are on the technological frontier.","[Della Malva, Antonio] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Appl Econ Sci, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",KU Leuven; University of Bologna,"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",antonio.dellamalva@kuleuven.be; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it,,"SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755",,,,,55,9,9,3,73,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

We introduce a new statistical arbitrage strategy based on dynamic factor models of prices. Our objective in this paper is to exploit the mean-reverting properties of prices reported in the literature. We do so because, to capture the same information using a return-based factor model, a much larger number of lags would be needed, leading to inaccurate parameter estimation. To empirically test the relative performance of return-based and price based models, we construct portfolios (long -short, long-only, and equally weighted) based on the forecasts generated by two dynamic factor models. Using the stock of companies included in the S&P 500 index for constructing portfolios, the empirical analysis statistically tests the relative forecasting performance using the Diebold-Mariano framework and performing the test for statistical arbitrage proposed by Hogan et al. (2004). Our results show that prices allow for significantly more accurate forecasts than returns and pass the test for statistical arbitrage. We attribute this finding to the mean-reverting properties of stock prices. The high level of forecasting accuracy using price-based factor models has important theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries' contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Uniform Crime Reports from 1960 to 1985, the results show that there is a short-run increase of 7% in crimes reported and a 16% increase in crimes cleared by arrest. Results show an increase in the staffing of police officers in cities that received legal services. These cities are also associated with having higher median property values 10 years later. This supports the narrative that legal services changed police behavior through litigation or threats of litigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This question is important because banking union is a cornerstone of the European integration process. We estimated the evolution of cost and profit efficiency in the enlarged EU during the period from 2000 to 2013 using Bayesian frontier stochastic models (SFA), and analysed the convergence among countries using the beta and sigma convergence tests. Our results show that the outbreak of the financial crisis interrupted the convergence and gave rise to a new divergence process.

To do this, we estimate a model that accounts for the influence of private information about legislation quality on voting patterns in the House and Senate. We find that minority party members are more likely to evaluate proposals on their merits than majority members, but institutional and electoral considerations significantly attenuate these partisan differences. In particular, seniority, electoral safety, and constituents' political knowledge have a balancing effect on partisan predispositions to rely on policy-relevant information, making minority (majority) members less (more) likely to vote informatively.","[Iaryczower, Matias] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Katz, Gabriel] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",Princeton University; University of Exeter,"Iaryczower, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, 037 Corwin Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",miaryc@princeton.edu,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,2,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

This paper illustrates, however, how elite constructions of the uplands as being idle and unproductive precipitate low-carbon, agro-industrial.crop production in the Philippine frontier. Based on field research from 2010 to 2012 (i.e., in-depth interviews with policy and market elites, participant observation, and archival document analysis), we argue that elites constructions of and discourses on the uplands as idle and unproductive have been carried over from the colonial period, albeit in more complex ways, to inform and legitimize agro-industrial policies and programs couched in the green economy vision of the country. Such discourses simplify green economy policies and undermine upland dwellers' constructions of place. Our findings raise critical questions about the realization of the vision of the green economy in the Philippines and much of the Global South. Regardless of the inclusive growth discourse in the green economy program, elite constructions of the idle and unproductive uplands pose serious risks to upland environments and populations.

Our results, both statistical and trading strategy-based, suggest that the portfolios of companies that sponsor cricket in India are efficient.

In particular, a framework is developed in which it is possible to test the trade execution quality efficiency of a roll strategy against a mean variance optimal roll strategy characterized by multiple-day roll. Applying this framework to five leading US grain futures markets (corn, wheat, soybean, soybean meal and soybean oil) demonstrates that commonly used single-day and multiple-day roll strategies (including the Goldman roll strategy) exhibit considerable inefficiencies. These are consistent over the markets and over the time of the day in which trading occurs, and vary with execution quality risk-aversion in a predictable way. A practical multiple-day roll strategy is proposed that reduces these inefficiencies.

Using an economic justice framework, we evaluate (1) how informal water markets operate, (2) differences in client and vendor perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional (in)justice, and (3) how cooperation among water vendors impedes or assists in achieving justice in water delivery. The research includes a comparative institutional analysis of three key data sets: long-term participant-observation in water-scarce squatter settlements; interviews with 12 water vendors; and interviews with 41 clients from 23 squatter settlements. We find that informal water vendors organize themselves to safeguard distributive justice (e.g., fair pricing, good water quality), but clients are distressed by procedural and interactional injustices (e.g., unreliable and inequitable service). Our research also shows that unionized vendors are more effective than non-unionized vendors in creating and enforcing rules that advance distributive, procedural, and interactional justice. We make concrete recommendations for improving justice in informal water markets, including a larger role for unions and community consultation. We conclude that, despite challenges, the informal economy may play an important role in advancing the human right to water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, growing procedural inefficiencies and limitations to substantive coverage have made the IPCC an increasingly unattractive forum for the most qualified climate economists. Drawing on our observations and personal experience working on the most recent IPCC report, published last year, we propose four reforms to the IPCC's process that we believe will lower the cost for volunteering as an IPCC author: improving interactions between governments and academics, making IPCC operations more efficient, clarifying and strengthening conflict of interest rules, and expanding outreach. We also propose three reforms to the IPCC's substantive coverage to clarify the IPCC's role and to make participation as an author more intellectually rewarding: complementing the IPCC with other initiatives, improving the integration of economics with other disciplines, and providing complete data for policymakers to make decisions. Despite the distinct characteristics of the IPCC that create challenges for authors unlike those in any other review body, we continue to believe in the importance of the IPCC for providing the most visible line of public communication between the scholarly community and policymakers.","[Chan, Gabriel] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Carraro, Carlo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Isola San Giorgio Maggiore 8, I-30124 Venice, Italy; [Carraro, Carlo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, San Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Postbox 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17,Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Kolstad, Charles] Stanford Univ, 366 Galvez St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Stavins, Robert] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Fondazione Mattei; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin; Stanford University; Harvard University,"Chan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Carraro, C (通讯作者)，Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Isola San Giorgio Maggiore 8, I-30124 Venice, Italy.;Carraro, C (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, San Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.;Edenhofer, O (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Edenhofer, O (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Postbox 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Edenhofer, O (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17,Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.;Kolstad, C (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, 366 Galvez St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Stavins, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gabechan@umn.edu; carraro@feem.it; ottmar.edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de; ckolstad@stanford.edu; robert_stavins@harvard.edu,"Carraro, Carlo/A-7071-2014; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,22,21,21,8,62,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

While developing countries saw this as a positive development, many economists and policy makers in developed countries have raised concerns regarding the institutional effects of developing country investments in other developing countries. In this paper we explore the effects of bilateral FDI flows on institutional development gaps between countries and whether such effects are conditional on the direction of flows including South-South, South-North, North-South, and North-North directions. The empirical results using bilateral flows between 134 countries and a variety of institutional development measures during 1990-2009 suggest that the institutional development effects of FDI flows in any direction including the North-South or South-South directions are not significant. In any case we do not find any significant convergence or divergence effect of FDI flows on the institutional distance between host and home countries. We also fail to find any significant effect of aggregate North South FDI flows on host country institutions. In contrast, we find that aggregate South South FDI flows have a significantly negative effect on host country institutions. Furthermore, we find some evidence that South South FDI flows may be harmful to institutional development in natural resource-rich countries while the opposite is true for North South flows. Overall, the results suggest that there is no strong evidence of any benevolent or malevolent effects of bilateral FDI flows from developed or developing countries to developing countries.

Using a panel data covering 287 Chinese prefecture-cities during 2004-2011, we investigate the role of personnel turnover and institutions in water pollution. We show that water pollution deteriorates with the tenure of incumbent mayors. Mayor turnover and institutional quality are associated with lower pollution. Furthermore, personnel turnover and institutions complement each other in mitigating pollution: the influence of mayor turnover on pollution reduction is larger in the cities endowed with stronger executive constraints. We also suggest some channels through which personnel turnover affects water pollution. In general, we illustrate that the turnover of cadres has only limited and temporary effects in mitigating pollution.","[Liang, Pinghan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China; [Gao, Nan] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Liang, PH (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China.",liangph@swufe.edu.cn,,"Liang, Pinghan/0000-0003-4741-3083",China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503208],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The financial support from the China Scholarship Council and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 71503208) is acknowledged.,,19,19,20,2,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Our model ranks lotteries according to their complexity and makes different-at times contrasting-predictions than most models of ambiguity in response to manipulations of prizes.

How Congolese Refugees Affect the Ugandan Population",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,refugees and host population; local integration; Uganda; Democratic Republic of the Congo,WARS,"This paper analyzes the impact of both the long-term presence and additional influxes of refugees on the local population in Uganda. Uganda has a unique legal framework of local integration which makes it an interesting case study. Refugees are allowed to work and move freely. The political aim is to integrate them economically and socially into the host communities. The impact of this approach on Ugandan households' objective and subjective welfare as well as their access to public services is the focus of this study. Two different household surveys covering the years 2002-10 are used in order to employ a difference-in-differences approach. In doing so, the natural experiment of two sudden inflows is exploited, while simultaneously controlling for the long-term trends in refugee numbers. The findings presented here suggest that the Ugandan population living near refugee settlements benefits both in terms of consumption and public service provisions. However, their negative perceptions regarding their own economic situation and their alienation from their national state in favor of their ethnic identity contradict this objective improvement of livelihoods. This is the first study to empirically analyze the effect of a long-term presence of displaced populations on local communities. With refugee situations becoming increasingly protracted, the findings offer important policy insights and point toward an interesting new field of research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, differences in firms' capabilities to use this newly available knowledge could create a new digital divide instead. Using 50,013 firm observations covering 117 developing and emerging countries over the 2006-11 period, this paper tests for knowledge spillover effects from industries' adoption of the Internet on firms' productivity and innovation performance. We test for heterogeneous spillover impacts on groups of firms that are commonly less engaged in innovation and on films with different productivity levels. Our specification regresses firm productivity and innovation performance - i.e., their investment in equipment and ownership of quality certificates and patents on industries' use of the Internet. Spillover effects are identified by controlling for firms' own investment in Internet technology, industry and country-year fixed effects as well as extensive firm-level controls. Our results show that industries' use of the Internet positively affects the average firm's productivity and its investment in equipment. We also identify modest impacts of industries' use of the Internet on the likelihood that firms obtain quality certificates and patents. On average, we find that the returns to productivity are larger for firms that commonly engage less in innovation, including single-plant establishments, non-exporters, and firms located in small agglomerations. However, results from quantile regressions show that only the most productive firms reap productivity gains from Internet-enabled knowledge access. Firms with productivity levels below the 50th percentile do not benefit much. The spillover effects from industries' adoption of the Internet identified in our work justify public policies aimed at fostering industries' use of the Internet. However, since we show that only firms with adequate absorptive capabilities benefit from the widespread Internet adoption, policy support should also focus on facilitating firms' access to networks and strengthening their capacities to use them.

Using panel regression, the presented research brings clear evidence that the main characteristics of the field (KIBS sector): number of companies, total turnover and number of employees can be used, as independent variables, in econometric models designed to estimate the size of the economy of the Romanian counties.","[Strat, Vasile Alecsandru; Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria; Grosu, Raluca Mariana; Zgura, Ion-Daniel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Strat, VA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",strat_vasile@yahoo.com,"Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Strat, Vasile/AAS-3578-2021; Zgura, Daniel ion/Q-1685-2016; Strat, Vasile A/J-5917-2016; Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria/D-2755-2015","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Strat, Vasile/0000-0002-5074-1419; Zgura, Daniel ion/0000-0002-5780-4590; Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria/0000-0002-9847-1200",,,,,13,4,4,0,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2016,18,41,,,,,55,72,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF9WN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371713100005,0

First, using 2,298 U.S. IPOs from 1996-2008, we find that an IPO document's strategic tone correlates positively with the stock's first-day return; more frequent usage of positive and/or less frequent usage of negative strategic words leads to more IPO underpricing. Second, we find that an IPO document's strategic tone is negatively correlated with the stock's long-run return. Together, these findings imply that investors initially misprice soft information in registration statements, which mispricing is eventually corrected. Additionally, we create new content-analysis libraries for strategic words and introduce a survey-based library creation method and word-weighting system.","[Brau, James C.; McQueen, Grant] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Cicon, James] Univ Cent Missouri, Warrensburg, MO USA",Brigham Young University; University Central Missouri,"McQueen, G (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Management, Finance, 636 TNRB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",mcqueen@byu.edu,,,Marriott School research grant; BYU Silver Fund,Marriott School research grant; BYU Silver Fund,Brau recognizes funding from a Marriott School research grant.

We use cumulative future returns of long-short portfolios, which are formed using prior returns as benchmarks, after portfolio formation to analyze the well-documented momentum-reversal pattern. Contrary to many previous studies our results demonstrate that there is no momentum-reversal anomaly. We show that size (market capitalization), which is often considered a proxy for risk, eventually dominates momentum's initial effect, causing stock prices and, hence, returns to move in the opposite direction. We demonstrate that this latter price movement is likely to be related to institutional trading. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Booth, G.

Main goal of the paper is to reveal an evidence of social responsibility as specific marketing tool of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in agricultural sector. Partial goals are: to identify key areas of social responsibility with regard to key stakeholders; to identify tools of social responsibility used in Czech agricultural firms. Primary data are collected via a qualitative exploratory research which is based on structured interview with representatives of SMEs. Preliminary outcomes shows that often manifestations of social responsibility belong to economic and social areas. Activities in environmental area do not exceed legal framework. Many of them emerge from nature of agricultural production. Social responsibility at SMEs is applied mostly as not actively planned activities. Moreover it was fined that these activities are not communicated to key stakeholders at all. As part of dealing with these issues, the following areas of research have been identified: 1. The expectations of stakeholders in agricultural firms; 2. Feasible approaches to Corporate Social Responsibility in the resort of agriculture, including methods of assessing social responsibility of agricultural firms; 3. The tools of social responsibility deployed by firms as a function of the firm's size, its production orientation and used farming method; 4.

In Italy, food companies collaborate with other firms in open and cross-industry innovation (CII) projects to achieve a competitive advantage. The paper aims to shed lights on eventual drivers for CII in the food sector in a twofold manner: (i) exploring to what extent external knowledge sourcing affects innovation and (ii) seeking to understand to what extent different means of external knowledge sourcing might differ according to the company size. To this end, probit models have been run on a sample of 703 Italian food companies from the CIS 2010 and 2012. Empirical evidence shows that in the Italian food industry innovation relies on different external knowledge sources. Acquisition of machinery and equipment allows food companies to transfer external know-how inside the firm boundaries. Product innovation benefits of external R&D activities as well as of information provided by competitors and consultants. Process innovation relies mostly on acquisition of technology (machinery and equipment) as well as on information provided by input suppliers.","[Ciliberti, Stefano] Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Environm & Food Sci, Via Borgo XX Giugno 74, I-06121 Perugi, Italy; [Carraresi, Laura; Broering, Stefanie] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Perugia; University of Bonn,"Ciliberti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Environm & Food Sci, Via Borgo XX Giugno 74, I-06121 Perugi, Italy.",stefano.ciliberti@unipg.it; l.carraresi@ilr.uni-bonn.de; s.broering@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Carraresi, Laura/AAG-1718-2019; Ciliberti, Stefano/AAF-9751-2020; Broering, Stefanie/AAC-9457-2020; Ciliberti, Stefano/N-1619-2015","Carraresi, Laura/0000-0003-0081-6651; Broering, Stefanie/0000-0003-2014-2586; Ciliberti, Stefano/0000-0001-7833-9547",,,,,70,13,13,0,26,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The EU made an enormous effort to reduce its GHGs. The relations between the Carbon Footprint and the Resource Productivity as a main indicator of the Sustainable Consumption and Production in the EU countries are not straightforward.

Panel regressions reveal that the fall in investment across OECD economies was generally in line with fundamentals GDP growth, interest rates, and profits though in some countries the weakness was more pronounced. We find little evidence that firms were reducing investment to strengthen their balance sheets, as payments to shareholders remained strong and were uncorrelated with investment.

The paper analyses the impact of parametric and system changes introduced in family and social benefits and tax reliefs in 2006-2015 on the income level of families with different demographic characteristics, and evaluates the potential of those changes to influence reproductive and partnership behaviour. The analytical part takes selected instruments of financial support to the family and shows the size of the financial provision families can claim depending on their previous earned income, to what extent that income is being compensated (family benefits), and how the net income is influenced (tax reliefs). Effects of the studied changes vary for different income categories and are more pronounced in the case of low-income families. This differentiation corresponds to the fertility by mother's education, which is tightly linked to the family's income. The analysis has shown that certain instruments have the potential to influence family behaviour, however in diverse ways.","[Hoehne, Sylva; Kucharova, Vera] Vvi, Vyzkumny Ustav Prace Socialnich Veci, Prague, Czech Republic",Research Institute for Labour & Social Affairs,"Höhne, S (通讯作者)，Vvi, Vyzkumny Ustav Prace Socialnich Veci, Prague, Czech Republic.",sylva.hohne@vupsv.cz; vera.kucharova@vupsv.cz,,,,,,,63,6,6,2,23,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The model is built upon the data of the Slovak economy and tax collection, where particular tax categories were chosen as endogenous variables and indicators of macro environment as exogenous variables. In our opinion, the main contribution of this paper is in tax collection stress testing, where we predict potential tax incomes in worsening economic environment. Methodology/methods Tax forecasting model using the Seemingly Unrelated Regression approach with the goal to predict tax collection income in different macroeconomic scenarios, using a baseline scenario and a severe depression scenario. Scientific aim Tax income prediction and forecast modeling. Findings The outcome of modeling process are four tax collection models joined together in SUR model based on which we have forecasted possible evolution of tax income in perspective of three years. In general all examined tax types depend on main economic indicators such as GDP, Unemployment, Real Wage, HICP etc., wheres changes in tax legislation had also a significant effect. In baseline scenario is our forecast rather optimistic taking into the consideration optimism concerning economic growth with low unemployment and stable inflation. In case that recession would occur the tax income would decrease significantly comparable to situation in 2007-2009. Conclusions Tax income forecasting is an essential part of state budget preparation. By construction of the forecasting regression model based on macro environment in different macroeconomic scenarios we have estimated the impact of changes in macro environment on tax collection in conditions of Slovak economy. The main contribution of this paper is a proposal of tax collection stress testing framework where we predict possible tax incomes under worsening economic conditions. The principles applied in regression analysis have its limits and restrictions such as linearity assumption or assumptions of future macro environment evolution in conditions of uncertainty. However we believe that the outcomes of our analysis provided possible directions and volumes in which could tax income collection evolve in different scenarios. A robust budgeting process should in our opinion take into an account not just the current expectation of economic growth, but it should take into an account possible stress situation, since last crisis proved that recession can occur suddenly at any time.","[Majer, Lukas] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia; Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Majer, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",hofer.pavol@gmail.com; majer.lukas@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,647,656,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200080,0

Such approach is employed in various industries and may also be applied on crowdfunding. The environment crowdfunding operates in is complex as it is an IT-based global phenomenon, includes unexperienced backers (investors), businessmen, and mainly deals with early stage companies. The application of the ecosystem approach on crowdfunding is also grounded by the novelty of phenomenon -gaining a deep understanding of it is crucial for proper functioning and achievement of related benefits, such as job creation and economic recovery. Methodology/methods A scientific literature review on business ecosystems is performed in order to clarify the definition of business ecosystems and name their main features. The theory on business ecosystems is applied on the phenomenon of crowdfunding in order to take a look at the phenomenon from a novel perspective. Scientific aim to provide a view on crowdfunding as an ecosystem. Findings The paper describes ecosystem of crowdfunding as a constantly evolving system of structural elements working together due to existing mutually beneficial relationships in the context of complex business environment. The latter analysis of the crowdfunding ecosystem is based on naming (a) the structural elements, (b) mutually beneficial relationships (value-based links), and describing (c) the environment (enablers, drivers, barriers). The characteristics of crowdfunding ecosystem are presented in the table format as well as mapped in the picture. Conclusions The research provides a theoretical view on crowdfunding ecosystem. Consequently, limitations apply in case of adapting it for a certain country or specific industry. The structural elements and value-based links should be reconsidered and adjusted.

In the realm of knowledge-based management, we have developed a methodological framework to generate explicit knowledge about human needs in organizations, which we call Bewextra. Combined with the organization's expertise, explicit need knowledge fosters the reinforcement of IC which in turn allows for developing need-based transformation strategies. Over the past few years, we conducted several successful organizational learning processes where we used human needs to develop IC. These projects covered a variety of organizational domains regarding organizational scope, business environments and size. Thus, we gained vast experience and rich empirical data. In this paper, we reflect on factors, which we found to be decisive for organizational learning processes to develop sustainable IC. Accordingly, the research question is the following: Reflecting on case studies from diverse organizational domains and contexts, what are methodological key factors for enabling sustainable IC in need-based organizational learning processes? To answer this question, we employ a multi case study about projects we conducted over the past few years to then discuss methodological key factors to enable sustainable IC.","[Kaiser, Alexander; Kragulj, Florian; Grisold, Thomas] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Kaiser, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",alexander.kaiser@wu.ac.at; florian.kragulj@wu.ac.at; thomas.grisold@wu.ac.at,"Kragulj, Florian/IAN-9013-2023; Kragulj, Florian/Z-5577-2019","Kragulj, Florian/0000-0002-3849-7978; Kragulj, Florian/0000-0002-3849-7978",,,,,36,0,0,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,129,136,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300016,0

However, other trade and regulatory measures have increased and thus restricted potential trade to some extent. These measures, non-tariff measures (NTMs), have also affected intra-SADC trade as there was no evidence of growth in the trade that needed to accompany the decline in tariffs. The extent of the impact of NTMs on SADC trade is still not fully understood due to lack of such data, which has effectively affected the quality of research in this area. In this article, data on NTMs related to SADC agricultural products for ten countries was compiled to shed some light on these measures, as well as to make them transparent. The results confirm that these countries have increased their use of NTMs over the period 2000 to 2010. As a result, on average one product was subjected to 17 NTMs in 2010. The Southern African Customs Union is the leader in the use of NTMs, while Malawi had the least incidences of NTMs. Most of the NTMs are applied on fruits, meat, dairy, vegetables and cereal products. The use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) and of export measures was increasing faster than other categories were. Finally, there is an indication that NTMs are used as substitutes for the declining tariffs. NTMs are trade restricting, and if they are not addressed, they will continue to reverse the gains of the SADC free trade area, as well as other initiatives of trade liberalisation.","[Kalaba, M.; Sacolo, T.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kirsten, J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Africultural Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Kalaba, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Mmatlou.kalaba@up.ac.za; johann.kirsten@up.ac.za; sacolo.sacolo72@gmail.com,"Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019; Kalaba, Mmatlou/AAJ-7648-2021","KALABA, Mmatlou/0000-0002-9501-8128; Kirsten, Johann/0000-0003-0770-9648",,,,,83,1,4,3,12,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55,4,,,,,377,410,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1243059,0.0,,,34,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EI7SI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392703200004,0

Using the cross-industry and cross-country data, it finds that industries dominated by small firms grow faster in a country with a more bank-based financial system. It also finds that the effect of financial structure on industry growth runs mostly through growth in the number of establishments rather than through growth in the average size of establishments. The evidence is robust to a battery of sensitivity tests. Our research thus provides complementary information on whether financial structure fosters economic growth by disproportionately facilitating the growth of small-firm industry and new firm formation in these industries. Given the importance of small firms for private sector-led growth and limited access to credit of these firms in developing countries, policy toward strengthening bank-oriented financial systems is crucial for their economic growth.

Methodology/methods The study is based on the original dataset of price information from 82 banking units operating in Nordic and Baltic countries. Methodologically, the paper is based on simple comparison of relative prices set by the different units. The units are compared by the criteria of belonging to the banking group or to the country. Scientific aim The aim of this exploratory paper is to start filling the research gap evident from the fact that only few papers exist that study pricing of banking services in international setting in Nordic and Baltic region. Findings Main findings based on simple comparison of relative prices are that the prices tend to be lower in banking units operating in Baltic countries in contrary to some opinions presented in public discussion. However, the pattern is not absolute and the ranking of prices is sometimes reversed. Conclusions The topic of the paper belongs to the promising research area and preliminary results suggests that further research. The results seem to suggest that strategic differences exist in pricing of services in banks. Patterns in the pricing remain to be studied further adding to the existing dataset the variables connecting it to the context economic environment.","[Listra, Enn; Kulla, Gert] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Listra, E (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",enn.listra@ttu.ee,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,40,46,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200004,0

The TRMI derived from equity specific digital news are better predictors than similar sentiment from social media. In the two-regime setting, there is evidence supporting the hypothesis of emotions playing a more important role during stressed markets compared to calm periods.

The farmers' share as a percentage of the money spent on food, calculated together with other margins, provides a useful starting point in the analysis of the price formation process of food as well as the position of agriculture in the value chain. This contribution aims to examine the development of the farmers' shares in the price of food for human consumption in Austria and Switzerland over the period from 1995 to 2013. Austria uses the Swiss method for calculation. In the long-term, the farmers' share in consumer expenditure for food is declining for example with increases in the division of labour, increased demand for additional goods and services and more specific consumer preferences. Accordingly the development of farmers' shares in Austria and Switzerland for the period of 1995 to 2013 displays a continuous growth in the marketing margins. For the most part, this growth has been progressive. In Austria, the farmers' share declined continuously from 29.5% in the year 1995 to 22.2% in the year 2013 whereas in Switzerland the farmers' share dropped from 36.3% to 32.1%. When interpreting the results, one has to bear in mind that the calculations show developments and not their causes. The results give insight into the formation of marketing margins, the farmers' share and their development over time and thus contribute to more objectivity in discussing the agricultural and food price formation process. However, as calculations are based on estimates, additional information is needed to draw conclusions about the efficiency and performance of markets in the price building process.","[Quendler, Erika] Fed Inst Agr Econ, Marxergasse 2, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Quendler, E (通讯作者)，Fed Inst Agr Econ, Marxergasse 2, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",erika.quendler@awi.bmlfuw.gv.at,"Quendler, Erika/JWP-5012-2024","Quendler, Erika/0000-0002-3573-2266",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,291,297,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000037,0

The dynamic capabilities are related to exogenous changes: competitive, technological, and financial and for the emergence of new economies. Every company is involved in building great capabilities: gaining competitive advantage from the things it does exceptionally well, creating new business models. The companies in a context of change have to innovate faster, to minimize labor, raw materials, production and logistics costs, in order to reduce the inefficiency. The entrance of low-cost high-value companies into the market has created a new competitive landscape: the low-cost high value production philosophy, based on a set of behaviors designed to offer goods and services at low cost respecting the quality, implementing innovative distribution processes and modern management policies. Encouraging a consumer style, it can generate high benefits for consumers, for businesses and for the country's system. The healthcare sector today is at a crossroads and every nation in the world faces healthcare challenges Low cost-high value healthcare companies are new entries in those areas of the competitive system left vacant by the welfare state and meet the consumer/patient's new needs to safeguard health with out of pocket payment. The study analyzes the dynamic capabilities implemented in three low-cost high-value companies: Centro Medico Santagostino, Odontosalute and Naill allocated in northern Italy. They signed the ethical code of Assolowcost and are engaged to increase their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Whether and how can Low-Cost - High-Value healthcare companies follow a standard management process to cope with emerging CSR challenges? With dynamic capability, they can follow the rapidly evolving CSR expectations of stakeholders. Drawing on the dynamic capabilities perspective can help firms to meet emerging CSR requirements by following a set of common management processes. Our research findings contribute to understanding better the capabilities of low-costs high-value companies and their CSR values.","[Querci, Elena; Gazzola, Patrizia] Univ Insubria, 71 Via Monte Generoso, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Querci, E (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, 71 Via Monte Generoso, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",equerci@libero.it; patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,9,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,918,927,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300076,0

This is done through employee engagement in individual innovative behaviour. To obtain innovative behaviour as working outcome from human capital in the organization, the management should provide a variety of organisational climate. Organisational climate can be defined as the shared perceptions, feelings and attitudes that organisational members have about the fundamental elements of the organisation, which reflect the established norms, values and attitudes of the organisation's culture and influences individuals' behaviour positively or negatively. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of organisational climate on innovative behaviour of human capital in academic libraries. By using a literature review, purposive sampling, multiple case studies and interviews we discovered the antecedents of organisational climate which are namely: work groups and teams, resources, recognition and rewards, psychological safety and support for risk taking influence academic librarians' innovative behaviour which were evaluated based on idea generation, idea championing and idea implementation. In sum, the conclusions to be drawn from the data analysis are that academic libraries are valuing library's human capital by providing a contributively organizational climate in order encouraging librarians' innovative behaviour. The gap to be closed by further work and development is to correlate the state of comparison between academic libraries in public universities and academic libraries in private sector with similar organizational climate to determine if there are differences in innovative behaviour of human capital within both libraries and to the transcendent value and contribution which these libraries provide to their parent institutions and to broader societal benefit.","[Sa'ari, Haziah; Idrus, Marlia] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Informat Management, Selangor, Malaysia; [Jaafar, Faridah] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Acad Language Studies, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Sa'ari, H (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Informat Management, Selangor, Malaysia.",azie.crystal2@gmail.com; marlia945@kedah.uitm.edu,"Sa'ari, Haziah/Q-8001-2019",,Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) [600-RMI/RAGS 5/3 (3/2015)],Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)(Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)),We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) under Research Acculturation Grant Scheme (600-RMI/RAGS 5/3 (3/2015) for funding this research project.,,28,3,4,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,400,406,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300048,0

The government may choose different policies: to borrow more during recession period to compensate for the low GDP growth rate, or borrow during intensive growth to stimulate accumulation of wealth and creation of the safety cushion for the future recession. The aim of the present research is to explore how the borrowing policy affects long-term GDP growth. Methodology/methods The research used World Bank statistical data over the period of 2003 - 2012. Time series of GDP and government debt data were analysed to correlate annual debt increment with the GDP growth rate. The value of the correlation coefficient was used to group countries following their borrowing policies. Further, the indicator of long - term GDP growth was analysed for each group. Scientific aim of the paper was 1) to explore borrowing policies of the world countries and 2) to demonstrate, that long - term GDP growth of countries that borrows more in recession, differs from one of countries that borrows in the growth periods. Findings Among 176 world countries, 42 countries' debt tends to increase more at the periods of weak GDP growth. For 12 countries, the debt grows faster at the periods of intensive economic growth. Other 122 countries does not demonstrated any correlation between GDP growth rate and debt increment rate. On average, the long-term GDP growth appears to be greater in the group of countries that borrows more in the growth period. On the contrary, the average growth rate was lower in the group of countries, borrowing in the recession period. Conclusions Although present research does not answered question in what extend empirical findings corresponds to the documented government debt policies of the world countries, the general tendency may imply, that borrowing in the growth period is more sustainable debt policy, that helps to withstand economic periodicity.","[Semjonova, Nadezhda] Riga Tech Univ, Kalku St 1, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Semjonova, N (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Kalku St 1, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia.",Nadezda.Semjonova@rtu.lv,,,Enhancing Latvian Citizens' Securitability through Development of the Financial Literacy [394/2012],Enhancing Latvian Citizens' Securitability through Development of the Financial Literacy,"This study was supported by the grant Nr. 394/2012 ,,Enhancing Latvian Citizens' Securitability through Development of the Financial Literacy.",,11,0,0,0,0,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,682,687,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200084,0

The demographic modelling has undergone a long history from component method as a matrix operator or expert estimations and expectations to Lee-Carter models based on principal component analysis and stochastic modelling. However, all models have their pros and cons. Their main weakness is that they are based on historical data. This means that they are not able to take into account unusual situations and demographic shocks. Despite that simplification of the reality is natural for all models, such big change as recent heavy migration to the EU can negatively influence the explanatory power of the models. Migration is a very important demographic component and it cannot be ignored in models or cannot be considered as unchangeable in time.

We investigate the effect of deforestation on flood-mitigation services in Peninsular Malaysia during 1984-2000, a period when detailed data on both flood events and land-use change are available for 31 river basins. Floods are the most common natural disaster in tropical regions, but the ability of tropical forests to mitigate large-scale floods associated with heavy rainfall events remains disputed. We find that the conversion of inland tropical forests to oil palm and rubber plantations significantly increased the number of days flooded during the wettest months of the year. Our results demonstrate the importance of using disaggregated land-use data, controlling for potentially confounding factors, and applying appropriate estimators in econometric studies on forest ecosystem services.","[Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng; Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.; Vincent, Jeffrey R.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.; Vincent, Jeffrey R.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Adnan, Norliyana; Ahmad, Ismariah; Vincent, Jeffrey R.] Forest Res Inst Malaysia, Kepong 52109, Selangor, Malaysia",Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Institute Penyelidikan Perhutanan Malaysia,"Vincent, JR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Vincent, JR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Vincent, JR (通讯作者)，Forest Res Inst Malaysia, Kepong 52109, Selangor, Malaysia.",Jeff.Vincent@duke.edu,"Vincent, Jeffrey/JZU-1149-2024","Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng/0000-0003-1804-9462",Global Environment Facility through the United Nations Development Programme [MAL/04/G31]; Government of Malaysia through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Forest Research Institute Malaysia; Center for International Forestry Research,Global Environment Facility through the United Nations Development Programme; Government of Malaysia through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Forest Research Institute Malaysia; Center for International Forestry Research,"This study was funded by the Global Environment Facility through the United Nations Development Programme (MAL/04/G31).

Design/methodology/approach - It is a longitudinal ethnographic case study. Following an inductive theory building approach, data were collected over an 11-year period via in-depth interviews, participant observations and unobtrusive data. Findings - Data reveal three different contexts in which legitimation takes place: legitimation of the new industry and of the new venture domestically and internationally. A new venture drives the process of industry legitimation by achieving legitimacy threshold first nationally at meso and micro levels as well as internationally. The challenge therefore for such a venture is to establish legitimacy in the absence of any precedents at the organization, industry or international levels. Unless at least one new venture achieves legitimacy threshold in a new industry there is no possibility for that industry to become institutionalized. Research limitations/implications - The authors advocate for further research at the intersection between legitimation, international entrepreneurship and emerging markets in order to further advance the emergent theory. Practical implications - The data suggest that in order for an INV to achieve cognitive legitimacy and socio-political legitimacy in an emerging industry located in an emerging economy, and successfully internationalize, it shall design a robust business model targeting both internal and external stakeholders; engage in persuasive argumentation invoking familiar cues and scripts; engage in political negotiations promoting and defending incentive and operating mechanisms; and overcome the country-of-origin effect by pursuing technology legitimation strategy. Social implications - Governments and NGOs may wish to see new industries emerge but they lack the means and mandate to establish and lead them themselves, instead rely on enabling actions, such as investment in capacity building. However, building capacity for an as-yet non-existent industry in an emerging economy may prove to be counter-productive, driving a brain drain of qualified workers who are forced to migrate to find suitable work. The work leads the authors to speculate about whether there may be a role for investment in programs of industry legitimacy building in pursuit of public policy objectives. Originality/value - The study puts forward a process model of new industry legitimation. The model theorizes the process of change from an initial condition in which an industry does not exist to a final condition in which it is institutionalized. The model addresses the case where the initial catalyst is the formation of an INV that is the seed for the birth of the industry. Since both the new venture and the new industry lack cognitive and socio-political legitimacies, the model theorizes temporal emergence of these at organizational and industry levels, leading ultimately to institutionalization.","[Turcan, Romeo V.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fraser, Norman M.] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England",Aalborg University; University of Reading,"Turcan, RV (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Aalborg, Denmark.",rvt@business.aau.dk,"Turcan, Romeo/C-8199-2009","Turcan, Romeo/0000-0002-0830-1209",,,,,49,4,5,0,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Because entrepreneurship is multifaceted, it is studied from many different perspectives, yet, that has fostered a multitude of definitions. Even the scholarly literature (where normally the deepest understanding would be found) is rife with disparities and even contradictions about what is and is not entrepreneurship. Some have suggested a narrower and more defined focus on entrepreneurship where only bona fide entrepreneurship research theories would explain entrepreneurial phenomena. We believe that constricting the field may the wrong approach. Our purpose then is to try and make sense of the disparate meanings and views of entrepreneurship prevalent in both the scholarly literature as well as among thought leaders in business and policy. We reconcile the seemingly chaotic and contradictory literature by proposing a coherent approach to structure the disparate ways that entrepreneurship is used and referred to in the scholarly literature. We examine three coherent strands of the entrepreneurship literature and identify an emerging eclectic view of entrepreneurship, which combines several of the views prevalent in the main approaches discussed.","[Audretsch, David B.; Kuratko, Donald F.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Link, Albert N.] Univ N Carolina, Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Audretsch, DB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",daudrets@indiana.edu; dkuratko@indiana.edu; anlink@uncg.edu,,"Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762",,,,,94,80,108,0,117,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper investigates whether boards of directors and risk management-related corporate governance mechanisms are associated with a better bank performance during the financial crisis of 2007/2008 for a sample of Chinese and Indian listed banks. We measure bank performance by Tobin's Q return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and price-earnings ratio (PIE). In line with the previous literature on US banks, we find the general irrelevance of the standard boards variables when specific variables related to the risk committee are included in the analysis. The positive relationship between the size of the risk committee and ROE and ROA suggests that over the period 2007-2011, banks with larger risk committee perform better in terms of profitability. However, the market valuation and the expected market growth (Tobin's Q and PIE) are larger for banks with smaller risk committee. In particular, we find that the market valuation is negatively associated with the size of the risk committee and positively associated with the number of the risk committee' meetings. This seems to suggest that the market discounts as favorable the information related to strong risk governance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using survey data from the 2006-2012 waves of the US Health and Retirement Study, we show that self-perceived social status is associated with all the Big Five personality traits, after controlling for observable characteristics that arguably reflect one's actual status. We also construct an objective status measure that in turn is associated with personality traits. Objectively measured status is positively but not highly correlated with its subjective counterpart. When incorporated in a regression specification, it still leaves room for significant correlations between personality traits and status perception: traits such as openness, conscientiousness and extraversion predict a higher self-positioning on the social ladder, while agreeableness and neuroticism predict a lower one.

Although aware of their true income, taxpayers face uncertainty concerning their taxable income. We distinguish three settings where differences between reported income and taxable income are either not punished, punished symmetrically, or punished asymmetrically, respectively. We find that tax aggressiveness can be best reduced by introducing an asymmetric penalty scheme. In this case increasing tax uncertainty increases tax compliance further. The fiscal authority benefits from uncertainty to the detriment of the taxpayer.

What makes this paper unique is that we investigate the combined impact of adaptation and investment on global mitigation and we compare the subgame-perfect equilibria for different sequences of decisions. Considering a purely non-cooperative, game-theoretic framework, we find that by investment countries commit to lower national contributions to the global public good of mitigation. Moreover, the order of adaptation before mitigation might reinforce this strategic effect of technological investments. As a consequence, the subgame-perfect equilibrium for symmetric countries yields a globally lower level of mitigation, and higher global costs of climate change when countries engage in advanced adaptation. Besides this theoretical contribution, the paper proposes some strategies to combat the unfortunate 'rush to adaptation' which can be currently observed in climate politics.","[Heuson, Clemens; Peters, Wolfgang; Schwarze, Reimund; Topp, Anna-Katharina] European Univ Viadrina, POB 1876, D-15207 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schwarze, Reimund] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Topp, AK (通讯作者)，European Univ Viadrina, POB 1876, D-15207 Frankfurt, Germany.",topp@europa-uni.de,,"Schwarze, Reimund/0000-0002-2734-9259",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ01LA1139A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We have benefited from discussions at the workshop on 'The Future of Climate Policy' in Regensburg and at conferences in Bad Honnef, Dresden, and Toulouse as well as from Marcel Thum's valuable comments.

Nevertheless, subsidies generate a positive employment effect and enhance firm survival. Additional scrutiny reveals that subsidies positively affect the human capital level of low-skill firms.","[Karhunen, Hannu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla Univ Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Huovari, Janne] Pellervo Econ Res PTT, Helsinki 00180, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Karhunen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla Univ Sch Business & Econ, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",hannu.a.karhunen@jyu.fi,"Karhunen, Hannu/JPX-4110-2023","Karhunen, Hannu/0000-0002-8238-5738; Huovari, Janne/0000-0003-4167-3810",Alfred Kordelin Foundation; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation [6029]; University of Jyvaskyla,Alfred Kordelin Foundation; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; University of Jyvaskyla,"We are grateful to Mika Haapanen, Mika Maliranta, Ari Hyytinen, Jaakko Pehkonen, Hannu Tervo, Petri Bockerman and Terhi Maczulskij for their helpful comments.

The level of stakes was also manipulated. I found that the probability to win monetary rewards was weighted almost linearly in the high stakes condition, the probability to win vouchers associated with stronger positive affect was underweighted and the probability to win affect-poor vouchers was strongly underweighted. Substantial underweighting also prevailed in all three domains in the low stakes condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, the studies suffer index number bias and a number of shortcomings that are due to the underlying price and quantity data. These shortcomings include inconsistencies over time in the inclusion of production originating from homeland farmers as well as changing statistical methods and definitions used in forming the national estimates of agricultural production. By addressing these data and measurement issues, including the use of the Fisher Ideal indexing methods, we generate an output quantity index that differs substantially from those presented in past studies. For example, the hybrid Tornqvist-Theil approach suggests that South African agricultural output grew by an average of 2.96 per cent per year over the century spanning 1910-2010, whereas a Fisher Ideal aggregation of the same underlying price and quantity data suggests a growth rate of 3.33 per cent per year.","[Liebenberg, Frikkie; Kirsten, Johann] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pardey, Philip; Beddow, Jason] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pardey, Philip] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Pretoria,"Liebenberg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",frik.liebenberg@gmail.com; ppardey@umn.edu,"Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019","Kirsten, Johann/0000-0003-0770-9648; Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341","South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); Agricultural Research Council (ARC); University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) centre; International Food Policy Research Institute; University of Pretoria; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF); Agricultural Research Council (ARC); University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) centre; International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); University of Pretoria; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)","The research supporting this paper was funded principally by the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), with additional support from the University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) centre, the International Food Policy Research Institute, the University of Pretoria, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation by way of the HarvestChoice project.

The relevance of this study comes not only from the existence of a vast literature on the topic but especially from the specific features of these agreements. The emphasis of the survey is on coalition games, an approach that has become prominent in the fisheries economics literature over the last decade. It is shown that coalition games were first applied to international fisheries agreements in the late 1990s addressing cooperative issues under the framework of characteristic function games. Then, progressively, this cooperative approach was combined with non-cooperative elements such as the stability analysis of the agreements. Finally, partition function games, which model coalition formation endogenously, were introduced and became the standard approach to study the formation and stability of international fisheries agreements. A key message that emerges from this literature strand is that self-enforcing cooperative management of internationally shared fish stocks is generally difficult to achieve. Hence, the international legal framework and regulations play a decisive role on ensuring cooperation over the use of these resources.","[Pintassilgo, Pedro] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Pintassilgo, Pedro] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Kronbak, Lone Gronbaek] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Lindroos, Marko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve; University of Southern Denmark; University of Helsinki,"Pintassilgo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",ppintas@ualg.pt,"Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/H-5848-2019; Lindroos, Marko/B-7966-2015","Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/0000-0001-9115-4301; Gronbaek, Lone/0000-0002-9022-378X; Lindroos, Marko/0000-0002-9351-6115",Academy of Finland,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the suggestions of the editor, Michael Finus, and of two anonymous referees.

Cities have opted for a regulatory approach to truck movement and deliveries at a local level but few have tried to develop a systematic approach to management Following certain suggestions in the literature, a hierarchical deliveries approach is being adopted in some new developments in Europe and Australia using light vehicles at the local level. In East, South and South-East Asia, where 3-wheeled non-motorised vehicles have been a mainstay of goods and people transport for several decades, they are under renewed pressure from city governments. This study of the tricycle in Beijing examines their role for packages delivery, food and beverage distribution and waste and recycling services, which covers nearly all of the uses of utilitarian tricycles in northern Chinese cities. Drivers (n = 97) were interviewed, their usual trips were mapped, and the subsequent trip was recorded using a geo-positioning system. These trips were compared with trips executed by small, motorised vans, favoured since 2014 by Beijing government Operations can be divided into four categories according to delivery chain organisation, field operations and vehicle type. Motorised alternatives to the tricycle are shown to be uncompetitive in terms of time, cost and energy efficiency. This first detailed examination of the operations of the tricycle in a Chinese city provides a useful base for consideration of local distribution services organisation and a possible model for cities outside China.

For this reason, most are fitted under strong parametric restrictions that reduce the interpretation and flexibility of the models. Recently, the literature has focused on multivariate models with milder restrictions, whose purpose is to combine the need for interpretability and efficiency faced by model users with the computational problems that may emerge when the number of assets can be very large. A contribution to this strand of the literature including a block-type parameterization for multivariate stochastic volatility models is provided.

Utilizing recent advancements in market microstructure research to estimate firm-specific proxies for market efficiency, we demonstrate that the existence of the overreaction anomaly (where stock prices of late announcers in response to the earnings reported by early announcers in the same industry are negatively related to subsequent price responses of late announcers to their own earnings reports) is specific to an earlier sample period and results from the inefficient incorporation of information into prices, largely attributable to an environment with high barriers to arbitrage. Our results indicate that the pricing efficiency of intra-industry information transfers has increased in the recent years of increased liquidity and markedly higher trading activity.

We investigate if its role in the propagation of the crisis was due to contagion or interdependence. Using a Markov-switching VAR with time-varying transition probabilities, we analyse the transmission of shocks across the financial system. We find little evidence of asset correlation changes between normal and crisis regimes and those that do occur are predominantly associated with liquidity variables. Otherwise, relationships are stable across market conditions, implying that the U.S. financial crisis was due to cross-market interdependencies rather than contagion. There is limited evidence that the deteriorating quality of the underlying assets can explain the transition from 'normal' market conditions to a high-volatility regime, although this is not consistent across model specifications.

We find that bank performance is positively related to state economic freedom. We also reconfirm the finding of Gropper et al. (2013) that bank performance is improved by political connections. However, the positive effect of political connections appears to be significantly reduced when there is a higher degree of economic freedom in the state, indicating that political connections may matter less to banks when there is more economic freedom. Economic freedom in a state can have a beneficial effect on state economic growth and hence may outweigh any political connection benefits.

We examine the US term structure of interest rates using a pairwise econometric approach advocated by Pesaran (2007). Our empirical modelling strategy employs a probabilistic test statistic for the expectations hypothesis of the term structure based on the percentage of unit root rejections among all interest rate differentials. We find support for the expectations hypothesis and provide new insights into the nature of interest rate decoupling which are of value to policymakers. The maturity gap associated with interest rate pairs negatively impacts on the probability of stationarity, and also on the speed of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium. We further show that the speed of adjustment has become more sensitive to the maturity gap over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

I find that the market responds more slowly in periods with lower media coverage of foreign news and to information from more linguistically and culturally distant countries.

The key insight we deliver is that, for typical sovereign debt contracts, the probability of debt repayment will equal the probability of victory in a civil war. We test our predictor for standard outcomes in civil wars, including when the incumbent government loses (the Chinese Nationalists), when a new government is installed by a foreign power and decides to repudiate debt (the restoration of Ferdinand VII of Spain), and when there is a secession (the U.S. Confederacy). For China, markets were predicting a Communist victory three years before it happened. For the U.S., markets never gave the South much more than a 40 percent chance of maintaining the Confederacy. For Spain, markets considered the restoration of Ferdinand VII as likely (probabilities above 50%) as soon as France declared its intention to send military forces to the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that loans from traditional bank lenders are significantly easier to restructure out of court than loans from institutional lenders. We also find that the existence of a past banking relationship between the borrower and the lead arranger of a syndicated loan adversely affects the ease of restructuring. Finally, we find that reliance on loans that are held in part by collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) is positively related to the likelihood of a prepackaged bankruptcy, consistent with greater holdout problems when loans are held by CLOs.

Questionnaire-based quarterly surveys were conducted with 290 randomly selected households. We used the instrumental variables technique to identify the factors influencing household participation. The instrumental variables used for forest dependence were: household head born in the village, duration of residence of the household head in the village, ethnicity of the household head, business ownership of the household head and off-farm income of the household. The results show that education of household head and households' trust towards community members positively influenced household participation in PES, while forest dependence influenced it negatively. Future PES projects may thus need to focus more on developing social capital and the resource dependence of households.","[Hegde, Ravi] Hort Australia, Econ Anal, Prestons, NSW 2170, Australia; [Bull, Gary Q.; Kozak, Robert A.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC V6T 1W5, Canada; [Wunder, Sven] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",University of British Columbia,"Hegde, R (通讯作者)，Hort Australia, Econ Anal, 3 Sligo Pl, Prestons, NSW 2170, Australia.",rhegde2005@gmail.com; gary.bull@ubc.ca; s.wunder@cgiar.org; rob.kozak@ubc.ca,"Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020","Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260",Hampton Grant from University of British Columbia; World Bank administered Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development through Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) through a Doctoral Research Fellowship,Hampton Grant from University of British Columbia; World Bank administered Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development through Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) through a Doctoral Research Fellowship,"Financial support is acknowledged from the Hampton Grant from the University of British Columbia, the World Bank administered Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development through the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) through a Doctoral Research Fellowship.

We provide an application to the U.S. economy by constructing an aggregate volatility index composed of implied volatility indexes characterizing the equity market, the FX market, fixed income market and the commodity market. The analysis reveals that 75% of the aggregate risk comes from the commodity market, and that the volatility index average value evolves around 22%.

More specifically for the case of the European Monetary System (EMS), the expectation is that realignments are related to partisanship, support for the broader European integration, trade integration, resource transfers from the European Community, as well as countries reacting to the political and economic costs of realignment in other EMS members. Hypotheses are tested using binomial logit models on monthly data on exchange rate realignments for all EMS countries from 1979 to 1993. I find lower realignment risk for left wing policy-makers and countries with more trade links to Germany, whereas more intra-European Community resource transfers appear to go to countries facing higher realignment risk. Also, realignments are less likely when the rest of EMS member countries have stable international reserves and their governments are pro-European. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We provide an exact upper bound for the mean squared error of the ABC filter, and derive sufficient conditions on the bandwidth and kernel under which the ABC filter converges to the target distribution as the number of particles goes to infinity. The optimal convergence rate decreases with the dimension of the observation space but is invariant to the complexity of the state space. We show that the adaptive bandwidth commonly used in the ABC literature can lead to an inconsistent filter. We develop a plug-in bandwidth guaranteeing convergence at the optimal rate, and demonstrate the powerful estimation, model selection, and forecasting performance of the resulting filter in a variety of examples.","[Calvet, Laurent E.] HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France; [Czellar, Veronika] EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; emlyon business school,"Calvet, LE (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Dept Finance, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France.",calvet@hec.fr,"Calvet, Laurent/B-8315-2013; Czellar, Veronika/AAA-7753-2022","Calvet, Laurent/0000-0001-9086-925X;",American Statistical Association; Europlace Institute of Finance; National Institute of Statistical Sciences,American Statistical Association; Europlace Institute of Finance; National Institute of Statistical Sciences,"We received helpful comments from Nicolas Chopin, Per Mykland, Nicholas Polson, Elvezio Ronchetti, Andrew Siegel, and seminar participants at CEF, CORE, the Econometric Society World Congress, ISBIS, the Toulouse School of Economics, the University of Chicago, the University of Evry, the University of Geneva, the Second HEC Finance and Statistics Conference, and the 2014 Conference on Indirect Inference Estimation Methods in Finance and Economics.

The framework mirrors the deposit-refund systems implemented in the used oil recycling programs of Italy, Spain, Australia and in the US State of California that favor re-refining uses over re-processing routes that lead to combustion of recycled oil as fuel. Our analysis considers environmental damage to arise jointly from improper disposal of used oil and from air pollution created by combustion of used oil. We demonstrate that the optimal policy involves a tax on manufactured oil and a subsidy of equal value on used oil collection irrespective of the ultimate end-use of used oil as re-refined lubricating oil or fuel oil. We derive policy implications to evaluate recently proposed changes to the management system for used oil in California.","[Hamilton, Stephen F.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Sunding, David L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Sunding, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sunding@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,7,5,6,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Distinct claims about the acceptability of tax evasion between centre-right and centre-left coalitions have clearly emerged in Italy in the last decades. According to the ruling coalition, these different attitudes could have influenced tax compliance, affecting reported incomes of the self-employed, who have much more room to engage in tax avoidance or evasion strategies than employees. Using a longitudinal administrative dataset recording the entire working life of the sampled individuals, we focus on the period 1996-2005 (the only period when a complete bipartisan political cycle took place in Italy) and, following a difference in differences design and carrying out fixed effects estimates, we test whether self-employed earnings, compared to employees earnings, significantly changed after the change in the ruling coalition. We find a clear reduction in self-employed reported earnings when the centre-right coalition ruled. Il prelievo fiscale corretto si aggira intorno a un terzo del reddito, se invece le tasse sono tra il 50 e 60% e troppo e cosi e giustificato mettere in atto l'elusione o l'evasione. The correct tax burden is about one third of the income; it is too much if the tax burden is approximately 50 or 60%, thus it is justified to resort to tax avoidance or evasion.

Without real wage rigidity, even when the steady state is inefficient, price stability is nearly optimal in response to technology or government shocks. Right-to-manage bargaining creates the wage channel to inflation, because there is a direct relationship between real wages and real marginal cost. In the presence of the wage channel, price markups consist of only real marginal cost, and real wages and hours per worker are determined such as in the Walrasian labor market.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Sunakawa, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Tokyo 1138654, Japan.",sunakawa@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Current critiques argue that considerations of material outcomes have been prioritized at the expense of social well-being. I argue that autonomy and independence frame our current approaches to understanding how people support themselves. This has obscured the interdependent and contingent nature of connections that found our social lives and reduced social connections to an instrumental role. The potential for taking a care-full approach to livelihoods is examined through the unfolding negotiations of livelihood strategies between an elderly woman and her daughter-in-law in rural northern Ghana.

An integrative model is proposed that captures the mediating effect of strategic renewal on the external environment-performance relationship within these organizations. Hypotheses are tested using hierarchical regression analysis with data from a sample of CEOs in 134 public sector state and semi-public enterprises in the Republic of Ireland. The findings indicate that environmental munificence is positively related to organizational performance. Strategic renewal further accentuates the impact of munificence on performance. Environmental hostility is also an exogenous driver of performance, but strategic renewal mediates the negative hostility-performance relationship. Decentralized decision-making and a flexible control system have a positive association with strategic renewal.

We employ Russian administrative data on reported earnings and market values of cars to measure wage misreporting for individual employees of domestic firms in Moscow. We show that closer ties to multinationals lead to improved transparency of wage reporting in private Russian companies. Employees located closest to movers from multinationals in the job quality space experience the largest gains in transparency.

We find that managerial overconfidence raises the repurchase cost implying an adverse impact on the market timing ability of share repurchases. The repurchasing firms with overconfident managers experience poorer short-run announcement return and long-run stock performance than those without overconfident managers because of the poorer market timing ability and the higher repurchase cost.

Taxes and the price stickiness mechanism are taken into account in the model. When prices are flexible, full monetary neutrality can be obtained even in the short-term. Intuitively, taxes on foreign exchange transactions discourage speculation by rising currency trading costs, and, thus, increase the stability of the exchange rate. Finally, the results show that not only the exchange rate but consumption, investment and employment will become less volatile by imposing trading taxes on foreign exchange transactions.

To better understand this complex issue, we build a game theoretic model to quantify a number of economic incentives and costs surrounding critical dimensions of the lender's decision to modify a loan and the borrower's decision to strategically default in an attempt to encourage such a modification. We mathematically demonstrate that it is rarely economically rational for lenders to modify loans. For the borrower, we find that their negative equity position, growth rate in home prices, and the probability the lender will exercise its legal right to recourse represent the top three strategic default determinants.","[Collins, Andrew J.] Virginia Modeling Anal & Simulat Ctr, Notfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Harrison, David M.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; William & Mary,"Collins, AJ (通讯作者)，Virginia Modeling Anal & Simulat Ctr, Notfolk, VA 23529 USA.",ajcollin@odu.edu; David.Harrison2@ucf.edu; Michael.Seiller@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474; Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-8012-2272",,,,,49,14,15,0,5,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Designed to promote employability through better assessment of individual obstacles to employment, local programs display paradoxically low participation rates. This study uses an original dataset on a cohort of newly registered RSA recipients to investigate the extent and causes of non-participation in a social program consisting of 15 workshops dealing with potential obstacles to employment. While the global participation rate is estimated to only 13 percent, we are able to distinguish the demand side causes (the behavior of eligible individuals) and those on the supply side (social policy offer) by decomposing the participation process in three stages: the receipt of notification to attend; acceptance; effective enrollment.

This approach allows obtaining a flexible and comprehensive description of the time variation in the linkage between stock and bond markets. The empirical results show that the dependence structure between stock and 10-year government bond returns varies significantly over time for most countries. In particular, a positive stock-bond association is observed during the 19905, while the relationship becomes negative from the early 2000s, supporting the presence of flight-to-quality effects.

Findings show that more than 40% of farmers dislike farming as a profession because of low profits, high risk, and lack of social status, yet they continue with it owing to a lack of opportunities outside agriculture. Farmers who express a preference for moving out of agriculture are mostly those with small landholdings, poor irrigation facilities, fewer productive assets including livestock, and follow a cereal-centric cropping pattern. They also have relatively lower access to credit, insurance, and information, and are weakly integrated with social networks such as self-help groups and farmers' organizations. Importantly, the disinclination for farming, conditional on other covariates, is not significantly differentiated by caste, an important indicator of social status in rural India. Yet, within a caste group, the dislike for farming moderates with larger landholdings.","[Birthal, Pratap S.; Khan, Md Tajuddin] Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi 110012, India; [Roy, Devesh] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Negi, Digvijay Singh] Indian Stat Inst, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Birthal, PS (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, DPS Rd, New Delhi 110012, India.",psbirthal@yahoo.com,"Negi, Digvijay Singh/IQT-0744-2023; Khan, Tajuddin/AAE-6349-2020; Birthal, Pratap/Q-7459-2019","Negi, Digvijay Singh/0000-0002-9249-2748; Khan, Tajuddin/0000-0003-4490-6974;",,,,,14,8,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We use two cross-sectional data sets that contain information on signatory countries' compliance with an IEA on responsible fisheries. Our empirical strategy is based on estimating a spatial Durbin model using a maximum likelihood procedure. The results show that compliance effort by other participants has a systematic positive effect on a country's own compliance.

In fact, most applications measure congestion as a simple count of users or, at best, consider the shares of users, defined as the proportion of people visiting a site during the course of the season. However, only when all sites have a similar size or length and the total number of visitors is constant over time, can these measures be used as a proxy for congestion. In general, these assumptions are unrealistic. In this paper we examine site density measures rather than participation shares as a measure of congestion. We show that endogeneity problems can be addressed using a control function approach and demonstrate that the density of users leads to more statistically significant coefficients of congestion.","[Bujosa, Angel; Riera, Antoni] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Hicks, Robert L.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23189 USA; [McConnell, Kenneth E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Universitat de les Illes Balears; William & Mary; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Bujosa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Ctra Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",angel.bujosa@uib.es,"Bestard, Angel Bujosa/K-9573-2014; Riera, Antoni/C-4385-2008","Bestard, Angel Bujosa/0000-0002-5959-6561;","CICYT program of the Spanish Government [SEJ2007-67910/ECO, ECO2010-22143]; Balearic Islands Government and EU FEDER founds",CICYT program of the Spanish Government; Balearic Islands Government and EU FEDER founds,The study was conducted under the economic support of research projects SEJ2007-67910/ECO and ECO2010-22143 funded by the CICYT program of the Spanish Government.

The existing debate on empowerment mostly focuses on agency's instrumental value, how agency benefits development and household/women's welfare. We depart from this debate by considering the intrinsic value of agency for women using the Indonesia Family Life Survey. We measure agency based on the decisions women make within their households. We find the effects of agency are not unambiguously positive. Agency has intrinsic value, seen in its strong relationship to well-being in certain spheres, which is moderated by the 'burden of responsibility' that seems to be felt by decision-makers.

The incumbent operator (SJ) thereby lost the sole rights to commercial services. The most evident supply increase is the establishment of services in the low-cost niche, which rather complements than competes with the incumbent's supply. Public Transport Authorities' (PTAs) joint services have however resulted in strong competition on at least one main line. Despite a period of almost five years since deregulation, the potential effects of the market opening have not yet fully materialised. The business risk for commercial rail operators seems to be much greater than for other modes like air and long distance coach services. SJ have also during decades of deregulated intermodal and years of intramodal competition developed their products and skills and seem well prepared for competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Funds paid more than twice the dividends implied by their holdings in 7.4% of fund-years examined. Juicing is associated with larger inflows, and is more common among funds with unsophisticated investors. This behavior is consistent with an underlying investor demand for dividends, but is hard to explain by taxes or need for income, as funds can generate equivalent tax-free distributions by returning capital. Juicing is costly to investors through higher turnover and increased taxes of 0.57% to 1.52% of fund assets per year. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Reis, V",,,,"Reis, Vasco",,,Should we keep on renaming a+35-year-old baby?,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION; TRUCK SERVICE; MODEL,"Over the last +35 years at least five concepts - multimodal, intermodal, combined, co-modal and synchromodal - relating to freight transport chains have been put forward. I pinpoint the main properties of each concept and trace a plausible evolutionary path. The original concept is multimodal transport; the newest one is synchromodal transport. Every new concept borrows certain elements from the previous concepts and introduces new ones. This profusion of concepts is not in itself a hindrance. However, the concepts do exhibit substantial areas of overlap and ambiguity. This status quo facilitates misinterpretation of research efforts and hampers the coherent development of theory, regulations and policies. In this viewpoint, I argue that such an orderly situation can only be attained if there is a unified, or at least consensual, ontology. With an ontology in place, we would (re-)specify the existent concepts following the same principles. The outcome would be unambiguous meanings and clear limits. And herein lies, in my view, the main limitation we face: we still have to agree on the respective domains of specification and on the nature of each concept. I identify a total of four domains, which are: technological domain, organisational and managerial domains, production domain and externalities domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The price of this strategy is a portfolio of implied moments, and its expected excess returns naturally accommodate compensation for higher-order moment risk. Variance risk and the equity premium approximate it to first order and it nests cross-sectional asset pricing models such as the linear Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). An empirical study in the US index market compares the investment behavior of an agent with recursive long-run risk preferences to one who merely uses an identically independently distributed time series model and takes market prices as given. The two agents exhibit very similar behavior during crises and can be distinguished mostly during calm periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using accruals quality as a proxy for the quality of SMEs' financial reports, we find that the quality of SMEs' financial statements is negatively related to those companies' effective interest cost. This result is also highly economically significant. The findings in this paper are consistent with the idea that earnings are important for creditors in predicting SMEs' reimbursement capacity (i.e., future cash flows) and that less estimation error in accruals enhances earnings' ability to predict future cash flows. We deliver evidence of an important economic benefit of financial reporting for SMEs, to wit, the potential to reduce information asymmetry between SMEs and their creditors through higher-quality financial reporting.","[Vander Bauwhede, Heidi; De Meyere, Michiel; Van Cauwenberge, Philippe] Univ Ghent, Dept Accountancy & Corp Finance, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vander Bauwhede, H (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Accountancy & Corp Finance, Sint Pieterspl 7, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Heidi.VanderBauwhede@ugent.be,"Van Cauwenberge, Philippe/B-2566-2013",,Hercules Foundation [AUGE/11/013]; National Bank of Belgium; Ghent University,Hercules Foundation; National Bank of Belgium; Ghent University(Ghent University),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the Hercules Foundation (AUGE/11/013), the National Bank of Belgium, and the Special Research Fund at Ghent University for financial support and the participants at the Corporate Finance Research Meeting and Ph.D. Day at Ghent University and the 2013 Annual Congress of the European Accounting Association (EAA) for useful comments.",,43,49,55,2,110,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The analysis compares the correlation of these outcomes between identical twins, who share all their genes, to the correlation between nonidentical twins, who share, on average, only one-half of their genes. Because the environmental similarities of twins are assumed to be the same for identical and nonidentical twin pairs, researchers can partition the variance in behavioral outcomes that are due to genetic and environmental factors. Using established methods in this field, we find evidence of significant genetic influences on preferences toward prevention, overall prevention effort, routine checkups, and prescription drug use. Use of curative services does not appear to be influenced by genes. Our findings offer several implications for policymakers and researchers and suggest that genetics could be informative for health services and policy research.","[Wehby, George L.] Univ Iowa, NBER, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wehby, George L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wehby, George L.] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ Prevent & Community Dent, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wehby, George L.] Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Domingue, Benjamin W.; Boardman, Jason D.] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Boardman, Jason D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Sociol, Boulder, CO 80302 USA",University of Iowa; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Wehby, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, NBER, 145 N Riverside Dr,100 Coll Publ Hlth Bldg N248, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",george-wehby@uiowa.edu; Benjamin.domingue@colorado.edu; boardman@colorado.edu,,"Domingue, Ben/0000-0002-3894-9049","NIA NIH HHS [U19 AG051426, P01 AG020166] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613, R01 HD060726] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,42,6,6,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

On the other hand, the few panel tests that exist are too restrictive in the sense that they are based on homogeneity assumptions that might not be true. As a response to this, the current study proposes new predictability tests in the context of a random coefficient panel data model, in which the null of no predictability corresponds to the joint restriction that the predictive slope has zero mean and variance. The tests are applied to a large panel of stocks listed at the New York Stock Exchange. The results suggest that while the predictive slopes tend to average to zero, in case of book-to-market and cash flow-to-price the variance of the slopes is positive, which we take as evidence of predictability.","[Westerlund, Joakim; Narayan, Paresh] Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Melbourne Burwood Campus,221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",j.westerlund@deakin.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019","Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,52,34,36,3,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

These data allow us to disentangle the effects of a funding shock from the effects of a real shock. Contrary to conventional assumptions, we find that the funding shock works through reduced prospecting-as opposed to tightened lending standards-and leads to fewer loan applications among new applicants in particular, which improves the borrower pool. The real economy shock instead works through loan approval and affects small and medium enterprise rather than micro borrowers.","[Berg, Gunhild] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kirschenmann, Karolin] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Espoo, Finland",The World Bank; Aalto University,"Berg, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",karolin.kirschenmann@aalto.fi,"Kirschenmann, Karolin/G-2291-2013",,,,,,74,9,12,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Impacts of the Istanbul Metro on the generation of spatio-economic inequalities,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wider economic impacts; Spatio-economic inequalities; Ex-post analysis; Istanbul Metro,GROWTH,"Assessment of the Wider Economic Impacts (WEIs) of transport infrastructures has become crucial for justifying transport infrastructure investments, especially large-scale projects, not only for transport researchers but also for policy makers. Although the WEIs have been widely discussed in transport research and policy for more than a decade, these discussions lacked an important dimension: the likelihood of transport infrastructure investments to produce spatio-economic inequalities. This paper discusses the necessity of incorporating an understanding of spatio-economic inequalities in the analysis of WEIs. In order to do that, an ex-post analysis of the Istanbul Metro is carried out. In this sense, this paper also adds to the growing number of ex-post analysis of transport infrastructures. Through its findings based on the ex-post analysis of the impacts of the Istanbul Metro, this paper concludes that contemplating spatio-economic inequalities in ex-ante analysis of transport infrastructure investments will improve the calculation of WEIs of transport infrastructures. Such an approach is expected to help policy makers investing in projects that are less likely to produce spatio-economic inequalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence suggests that short sellers sold short stocks that had the greatest asset and insolvency risk exposures, and that the short selling of financial firms' stocks was not significantly greater than that of non-financial firms after we match them on firm Size and insolvency risk. When the short ban was in effect, the market quality of financial stocks without subprime assets exposure had deteriorated to a larger degree than that of financial companies with subprime assets exposure.

In a model with three imperfect markets - goods, labor, and credit - we find that credit and goods market imperfections are substitutable in raising volatility. Goods market frictions are unique in generating persistence. Two key mechanisms in the goods market generate large hump-shaped responses to productivity shocks: countercyclical goods market tightness and prices alter future profit flows and raise persistence; procyclical search effort of consumers and firms raises amplification. Goods market frictions are thus key in understanding labor market dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the U.S. housing market is found to be highly exogenous and the global leader since it is influenced primarily by its own innovations and is not affected reciprocally by shocks originating from the international housing markets. Finally, the study shows that the trends and co-movements among global housing markets can be attributed to real convergence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that multinational corporations in our study sample have increased more than 1.9 times (from $529.63 million to $1544.82 million) in their sales in Asia, and have increased 13.7 times (from $16.88 million to $247.74 million) in their sales in China from 1999 to 2012. Moreover, we find that the increase in Asian/Chinese percentage sales results in higher accounting performance after the crisis, in contrast to domestic firms. This result is robust and controls for firm and industry characteristics, and possible endogeneity issues. Finally, new entrant firms to Asia and China experienced an increase in ROA, while their matched firms and domestic firms did not. All these results indicate that firms which have taken aggressive actions (e.g., by strategically relocating their sales to other parts of the world such as Asia/China) experienced less adverse effects from the crisis compared with their domestic counterparts.

Researchers have used trolley problems to investigate this phenomenon, eliciting moral judgments or behavioral predictions about hypothetical scenarios where five people can be saved at the cost of harming one other person. We operationalized trolley problems in the laboratory, with economic incentives and real-life consequences, allowing us to observe not only judgments but actual decisions. We varied whether the five were saved by clicking a switch that diverted the harm to the one or by dragging the one in front of the harm. We found differences in moral judgments between the two tasks, but no differences in behavior. The judgments of actors and observers also differed, with observers judging it more right to act. Our results suggest that the difference between moral judgments and actions arises because participants think that doing the right action still involves doing something morally discreditable, and that the morality of taking action does not exhaust the normative reasons for acting.

Consequently, analysis of their inequalities between nations becomes of paramount importance for the achievement of sustainability. This paper aims, on the one hand, at revising methodological aspects of the inequality measurement of certain environmental data and, on the other, at extending the scarce empirical evidence relating to the international distribution of Ecological Footprint (EF). Most of the techniques currently important in the literature are revised and then tested on EF data with interesting results. We consider the underlying properties of different inequality indices. Those indices which fit best with environmental inequality measurements are CV and GE(2) because of their neutrality property. Subgroup and Source decompositions are also discussed from a methodological perspective. Empirically, this paper contributes to the environmental inequality measurement of EF: this inequality has been quite stable. Subgroup decomposition by using exogenous country groups (World Bank classification) conclude that between group inequality explains almost the totality of international EF-inequality. Source decomposition warns of the dangers of confining CO emissions reduction to crop-based energies because of the implications for basic needs satisfaction.","[Teixido-Figueras, Jordi; Antonio Duro, Juan] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain; [Teixido-Figueras, Jordi; Antonio Duro, Juan] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Teixidó-Figueras, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",jordijosep.teixido@urv.cat,"Teixido, Jordi/AAA-1596-2019; Teixido, Jordi/J-2854-2017","Teixido, Jordi/0000-0002-2530-388X; Teixido, Jordi/0000-0002-2530-388X",[ECO2010-18158],,The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

A choice,experiment design was applied to the survey protocol. A split-sample technique was then used out to obtain two datasets. The first dataset corresponds to the choices from individuals who responded to the neutral survey protocol. The second dataset was obtained from the same choice sets as for the neutral survey protocol, but the survey used also specific information to respondents on each biodiversity attribute. We then applied the latent class approach to ascertain preference heterogeneity according to respondents' environmental knowledge and sensitiveness to issues of biodiversity. We found that willingness to pay (WTP) values were higher for familiar respondents, i.e., those who make regular use of forests and are more sensitive to biodiversity concerns, as opposed to unfamiliar participants. For the former, giving more information had an influence on choices. For the latter, giving more information increased WTP for preferred. biodiversity attribute levels. We then concluded that giving specific information on biodiversity to the public does affect preferences. However, environmental sensitiveness combined with forest use constitutes the main explanatory variables of higher WTP.","[Brahic, Elodie; Rambonilaza, Tina] Irstea, UR ADBX, F-33612 Cestas, France",INRAE,"Brahic, E (通讯作者)，Irstea, UR ADBX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France.",elodie.brahic@irstea.fr,,"Brahic, Elodie/0000-0001-5361-5373","French Ministry for Ecology; Ministry for Agriculture; National office for Forest [2200505021, E21/2011]",French Ministry for Ecology; Ministry for Agriculture; National office for Forest,"Study benefitting from financial support from the French Ministry for Ecology, the Ministry for Agriculture and the National office for Forest, under convention no 2200505021 and no E21/2011.",,31,7,7,1,32,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We apply a dynamic simulation model with overlapping generations where single and married agents decide on labor supply and homework under income and life-span risk. We compute welfare changes across households and isolate aggregate efficiency effects of a move towards either individual taxation or family splitting. In terms of economic efficiency a switch towards individual taxation performs better than family taxation, due to reduced labor market distortions and improved insurance provision. The efficiency increases even further when individual taxation is combined with a child-splitting factor. Since such a reform also has very favorable distributional consequences, it should be seriously considered in the political debate.","[Fehr, Hans] Univ Wurzburg, Netspar, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fehr, Hans] Univ Wurzburg, CESifo, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Kallweit, Manuel] German Council Econ Experts Sci Staff, Stat Bundesamt, D-65180 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Kindermann, Fabian] Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Wurzburg; Ifo Institut; University of Wurzburg; University of Bonn,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Netspar, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de; manuel.kallweit@svr-wirtschaft.de; fabian.kindermann@uni-bonn.de,,"Kindermann, Fabian/0000-0002-7845-4948",Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,"Financial support from the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung is gratefully acknowledged.

This paper aims to assess the impact of ECB monetary policy announcements on the stock price of large European banks. As a first step, an event study is conducted in order to measure cumulated abnormal returns (CARs) around the announcements over June 2007-June 2013; the second step is a regression analysis aimed at identifying the determinants of CARs. Results show that banks were more sensitive to non-conventional measures than to interest rate decisions, and that the same type of intervention may have a different impact depending on the stage of the crisis. In addition, banks with weaker balance sheets and operating with high-risk were more sensitive to monetary policy interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We emphasize that considering the temporal aspect is crucial for assessing co-management and social capital. The following factors were found to facilitate co-management: a Participatory Advisory Council as a negotiation arena that links with a community-based organization; rotating meeting location to encourage community involvement; a committed Park director and sufficient staff. A co-management process requires ongoing investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The savings task was developed to be readily understood and performed online by members of a diverse participant population. A preliminary study (N = 165) involving such a population was conducted in which performance on the savings task was observed as length of retirement phase and the presence of a consumption-smoothing goal were experimentally manipulated. Results suggested that most participants understood the task and responded sensibly; for example, they saved a greater portion of current income for later consumption when faced with a long, compared to a short, retirement phase. Responsiveness of saving levels during the task to retirement length was found to be correlated with an independent measure of participants' financial risk attitudes. Consumption smoothing during the task was found to be correlated with a measure of individual differences among participants in temporal delay discounting. Compared to experimental savings tasks developed in previous research, the task described here may offer some practical advantages in requiring less extensive participant instructions, providing a user-friendly graphical interface, being readily performed online, and potentially being more accessible as a consequence to participants with limited education or financial sophistication.

We vary experimentally whether individuals can condition a simple lottery choice on the lottery choice or the lottery allocation of a peer. We find that peer effects increase significantly, almost double, when peers make choices, relative to when they are allocated a lottery. In both situations, imitation is the most frequent form of peer effect. Hence, peer effects in our environment are explained by a combination of relative payoff concerns and preferences that depend on peer choices. Comparative statics analyses and structural estimation results suggest that a norm to conform to the peer may explain why peer choices matter. Our results suggest that peer choices are important in generating peer effects and hence have important implications for modeling as well as for policy.","[Lahno, Amrei M.] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Serra-Garcia, Marta] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Munich; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Serra-Garcia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, 9500 Gilman Dr,0553, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",amrei.lahno@econ.lmu.de; mserragarcia@ucsd.edu,"Serra-Garcia, Marta/AAA-3340-2020","Serra-Garcia, Marta/0000-0002-5875-4986",Fritz Thyssen Foundation [AZ.10.12.2.097],Fritz Thyssen Foundation,"We would like to thank Kenneth Ahern, Jim Andreoni, Daniel Clarke, Dirk Engelmann, Florian Englmaier, Fabian Herweg, Alex Imas, Martin Kocher, Johannes Maier, Jan Potters, Justin Sydnor, Stefan Trautmann, Lise Vesterlund and Joachim Winter for their useful comments as well as seminar participants at Royal Holloway, University of Bamberg, University of Gothenburg, University of Innsbruck, University of Munich, University of Pittsburgh, at the 2014 AEA Meetings, 2012 CESifo Area Conference on Behavioural Economics, 2012 European and North-American ESA Meetings, 7th Nordic Conference in Behavioral and Experimental Economics in Bergen, ESI Workshop on Experimental Economics II, the CEAR/MRIC Behavioral Insurance Conference 2012, the Risk Preferences and Decisions under Uncertainty SFB 649 Workshop, the 2013 theem meeting in Kreutzlingen, and the 2013 Workshop on Behavioral and Experimental Economics in Florence.

Empirical analysis of our model using monthly US data from 2002 to 2011 shows that variations in selling (cash) market prices lead rapidly dissipating changes of leasing market prices in the opposite direction. We discuss the practical implications of these results by augmenting a standard leasing valuation formula.

Since many products now are transformed into services, the old fashioned dichotomy between product and service has been replaced by the current service - product continuum business function. In pure economics, it was quite safe, so far, that the output produced Q, represented by famous production function(s) (i.e. Cobb-Douglas) would be a tangible good. Now the production of services displays the same level of diversity pending upon capital intensity, level of innovation and growth prospects. A service system can be defined as a dynamic value co-creation scheme of combined resources that creates and delivers value. Two service systems are shortly analyzed here, e-health and tourism services. We conclude upon the needed quantification of the value co-creation process, in order to produce concrete experimental outcomes, in terms of the positive scientific foundations of economics, thus affecting the economic efficiency of service production, along the lines of transaction cost economics.

The time period, when it was possible to call the concept of macroeconomic competitiveness into question, is gone. Nowadays all countries and economic integrations need to accept this concept and work towards improving their competitiveness. The European Union also realised this challenge and has started taking up interest in competitiveness. The EU accepted the Lisbon strategy in the year 2000 and the strategy Europe 2020 ten years later. Both this strategies indicate macroeconomic competitiveness as one of the priorities of the European Union. As it is obvious from these strategies not only the competitiveness growth is important. Major role plays the competitiveness convergence among the individual countries. The homogeneity of the EU member states is crucial for further common development and competitiveness is one of the most important indicators of the homogeneity. In the contribution we reflect this EU challenge and aim to verify, whether the differences in competitiveness among individual EU economies decrease or not. We apply two widely used competitiveness indices to evaluate competitiveness and test their convergence applying the concept of beta and sigma convergence. According to our results, convergence is confirmed only when we use the Global Competitiveness Index to evaluate competitiveness.

In counterbalance to the slow economic recovery, managers need to start a series of antifraud measures, as a leverage of cost control, while reducing available resources. Fraud involves inclusively significant financial risks which may threaten profitability, and the image of an economic entity. In these circumstances, in which development of the IT systems plays a central role in the creation of competitive companies, the amount of processed data has grown exponentially. Internal control team members should need to look at every transaction that takes place, but, unfortunately this issue can no longer be manually performed, requiring the use of data analysis tools and programs. Since the companies usually operate with large volumes of data, it is absolutely necessary to implement such processes of continuous monitoring, in order to identify anomalies in the data stream or behavioral patterns, potentially fraudulent. Such new and significant information will be later used in directing investigations, as well as to make recommendations to improve the control activities.

Developed by analogy with the Component Value-at-Risk concept, our new systemic risk measure, called Component ES, presents several advantages. It is a hybrid measure, which combines the Too Interconnected To Fail and the Too Big To Fail logics. CES relies only on publicly available daily data and encompasses the popular Marginal ES measure. CES can be used to assess the contribution of a firm to systemic risk at a precise date but also to forecast its contribution over a certain period. The empirical application verifies the ability of CES to identify the most systemically risky firms during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. We show that our measure identifies the institutions labeled as SIFIs by the Financial Stability Board. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We found that the Slovak economy was relatively specialised already before the accession to the EU. Accession to the EU had statistically significant positive effect on concentration economic activities and diversification of economy. Significant changes in specialisation have occurred in agriculture. The share of crop production has been steadily growing at the expense of animal production. The concentration of both, crop and animal production has increasing trend.

After Eurozone crisis, it is vital for controlling the excessive imbalances in the budget deficits. We indicate that the main policy implication is essential to reduce the public spending to continue the balance of public finance.","[Bolat, Suleyman] Aksaray Univ, FEAS, Dept Publ Finance, TR-68100 Aksaray, Turkey; [Belke, Murat] Mehmet Akif Ersoy Univ, FEAS, Dept Econ, TR-15030 Burdur, Turkey",Aksaray University; Mehmet Akif Ersoy University,"Bolat, S (通讯作者)，Aksaray Univ, FEAS, Dept Publ Finance, TR-68100 Aksaray, Turkey.",bolatsuleyman80@gmail.com; muratbelke@gmail.com,"Bolat, Suleyman/AAA-1748-2020; Belke, Murat/AAO-9657-2021","Belke, Murat/0000-0002-3299-7162; BOLAT, SULEYMAN/0000-0001-5635-7322",,,,,37,2,2,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,20,25,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500003,0

Data reveals that the Czech municipalities often introduced local coefficient of 2 which doubled the basic property tax revenue. This is the mean value applied for more than one half of the surveyed units. Local fee is often introduced at the level of 500 CZK per capita. It seems that the municipality rather prefers such values, which are used by the vast majority of municipalities. We can hypothesize it is due to a competitive effect, when citizens move from one municipality to another to reach lower taxes or fees, ceteris paribus. Moreover, it seems there is not a trade-off between the tax and fee financing. It also seems that both larger and more industrialised municipalities prefer lower level of fees. It is in accordance with the hypothesis that the revenue needs of the larger municipalities are sufficiently financed by the taxes or by other sources.","[Brabcova, Pavlina] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Publ Finance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Brabcová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Publ Finance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xbrap23@vse.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,53,60,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200007,0

The financial performance can be influenced by individual characteristic of the entity, like: size, indebtedness ratio, and liquidity ratio, type of the auditor, the industry where they act or other particular features. The research was conducted upon the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE). It took into consideration the entities that have to report their individual financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This regulation is compulsory for entities that are admitted for listing on a regular market from 2012. The study provides proper evidence about the factors that influence the entities' performance. Both quantitative and qualitative measures were taken into consideration. The qualitative elements were quantified using dummy variables (the development region, the type of auditor, the specialization field, the case in which major shareholder has more than 50 % of the shares). The results emphasize the important of several variables (i.e. the company's size, the region where the entity acts, the company's indebtedness ratio, and the company's age) that have significantly influenced, both in a positive and a negative way, the financial performance. Considering the area in which the company is specialized, no reliable information was detected. It seems that neither return on equity, neither return on assets, neither cash flow from operation divided by total assets are reliable financial measure though which the influence of specialization can be properly reflected. Considering geographical regions, companies from nord - west region and from the west region do obtained a lower financial performance that that that it's obtained if the company act in other development region.

Here, our main goal is to model the Eurozone financial crisis within that framework. The underlying system comprises many economic agents that belong to several subsystems. In each instantiation of this framework, the hierarchy and nesting of the subsystems is dictated by the nature of the problem at hand. We describe in great detail how a suitable model can be set up for the Eurozone crisis. The dynamical system is defined by the evolution of the wealths of the individual agents and can be estimated by solving a nonlinear programming problem that incorporates features of prospect theory. Contagion is formulated in terms of how the market instability indicators for the different subsystems and the global system behave. We present several scenarios tailored to recent financial developments in the Eurozone and discussed within our model. These all point to the key role played by the elasticity coefficients of the wealth dynamical system. Accordingly, we put forward general recommendations on how regulators or other super-systemic agents may act to prevent and forestall the spreading of financial distress. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In an economy with aggregate risk, the different portfolio choices induced by heterogeneous trading technologies lead to a larger consumption inequality in equilibrium, while this source of inequality vanishes in an economy without business cycles. Put simply, the heterogeneity in trading technologies amplifies the effect of aggregate output fluctuation on consumption inequality. The welfare cost of business cycles is, therefore, larger in such an economy. In the benchmark economy with a reasonably low risk aversion rate, the business cycle cost is 6.49 percent per-period consumption for an average household when the model is calibrated to match the risk premium.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Chien, YL (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Chien, Yili/I-5741-2016","Chien, Yili/0000-0002-6820-1197",,,,,21,0,0,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

In Romania, this process proved to be a particular problem, with major impact in all areas such as economic, social, environmental, cultural, education. The ownership restructuring process results were the basic premise of the acknowledgement of market economy in Romania, of the market and its mechanisms. The transition from a centralized, planned economy based on control principles to an economy based on market principles meant radical changes of the entire inherited building structures, thus on the labour force occupation. Once Romania joined the European Union, we had to get in line with the European standards and social policies, the first steps requiring the abandon of the social clauses included in the shares selling contracts of the Romanian state-owned companies. We will try to analyze what were the effects of ownership restructuring over the economic activities of privatized companies, if the maintenance of social clauses lead to labour force distortion with effects on the labour force occupation, to a deficiency in implementing effectiveness in economic activities or even business closures.

The database is provided by Zephyr and SDC International M&A and includes aggregated data on acquisitions and mergers for the 2006 2010 periods in all countries of the world. We analyzed 30 countries from 4 different legal systems: common law on one hand and French, German and Scandinavian civil law on the other hand. In order to analyze the relation between the characteristics of a state's M&A market and the legal might of a state, we conducted several regression models. The M&A market was explained by the average value of a transaction and the size of the control premium, and for the legal system we considered several variables besides the dummy variables for each legal system. To do this, we analyzed business indicators that show how attractive is the legal system of a country for investors. For example, common law countries are considered to be business friendly, so a low number of tax payments and a low number of days required to start a business is recorded in these states. There is an opposite situation in the French and German civil law countries. The results show that a country's mergers and acquisitions market is influenced by the business environment that the law can create for investors who are likely to invest more in a well regulated markets which can protect the their capital, but also can provide an excellent environment for development and capital gains.

Nevertheless, only few farmers cultivate MSC. Therefore, it seems as if farmers do not act according to classical investment theory. In contrast to the classical investment theory, the real options approach (ROA) considers irreversibility and temporal flexibility of an investment as well as uncertainty with regard to investment returns. Consequently, investment triggers indicating when a decision-maker should invest can be shifted upwards in comparison to the classical investment theory. It is therefore often concluded that the ROA can help to explain investment restraint. However, the possibility of disinvestment is often neglected. Thus, there is the risk that calculated investment triggers of the ROA are overestimated. We develop a model by using a combination of a genetic algorithm and stochastic simulation in order to calculate investment triggers in general, and conversion triggers in particular (with and without reconversion possibilities) to the conversion possibility from wheat to MSC following the ROA. Our results show that the conversion triggers of the ROA are higher than those of the classical investment theory. Nevertheless, the neglection of disinvestment (reconversion) possibilities leads to overestimating conversion triggers. However, conversion triggers of the ROA are still higher than those of the classical investment theory. With an increasing risk attitude, conversion triggers of both theories decrease. It can be concluded that the ROA has the potential to partially explain farmers' inertia to convert to MSC.","Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Haverkamp, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr Wissensch, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Arbeitsbereich Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",matthias.haverkamp@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,49,2,2,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

An important issue surrounding this topic is whether people truly thrive in the welfare state or is they better off without it. Recently, there has been a growing interest in measuring the quality of life using subjective well-being indicators in order to complement the perspective offered by objective well-being indicators. These indicators are perceived as being an increasingly important component of human welfare, as they are not only an assessment of a person's life, but can also serve as a means to improve one's life. The objective of this research is to provide empirical evidence for the existence of a positive relationship between social expenditure and life satisfaction. Based on the happiness economics literature, the current paper distinguishes itself by examining the connection between life satisfaction, as a proxy for wellbeing, and social expenditure. The paper contributes by examining the link between well-being and social expenditure components to offer a more holistic view on the subject at hand. Given the structure of the data, a dynamic panel data model with small T, large N, we involve a GMM methodological framework. We use this approach mainly because estimators like random and fixed effects, or even standard GMM, may turn up biased results. We use a two-step expanded system estimator (System GMM) which features a set of supplementary restrictions applied to the already existing ones in the process generating the dependent variable.

The recent global financial crisis in the countries of CEE has caused high increase in the share of nonperforming loans in the total volume of loans granted. In accordance with definition settled by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision non-performing loans are the one with delay in repayment more than 90 days from maturity date. As they are main source of risks for banks and entire financial sector, entire financial intellectuals are considering non-performing loans problem and methods of its solving. Therefore, banks often, with scrutiny of international institutions, restructure non-performing loans and preform balance cleaning. It is currently the most common move in the dealing with the non-performing loans. The aim of this paper is to identify which of macroeconomic determinants have impact on level of non-performing loans in banking sector. For that purpose, macroeconomic data for period 2006-2013 from Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as data about non-performing loans for the same period have been used. This time series is representative, because it covers pre-crisis as well as crisis period. Thus, it was possible to detect moment of NPLs appearance as well as its growth and movements. Further, in order to perceive the problem more globally, a comparison between levels of non-performing loans, as well as disclosed macroeconomic determinants of non-performing loans in CEE countries have been conducted. Therefore, analysis of panel data was conducted as well as regression analysis. Results have shown that improvement in macroeconomic condition causeimprovement in credit quality.

The decision of multiple listing may be also related to the global business strategy of the firm. Firms from emerging countries, especially those with high quality, list in additional foreign market in order to overcome investment barriers. While liquidity and informational considerations play little role, culture proximity is a determining factor in the decision of multiple foreign listing for firms from emerging countries.

We develop a model in which the manager, compensated with an equity-based contract, makes investment decisions for a firm that faces time-varying volatility. The contract creates incentives that affect both the sign and magnitude of a manager's optimal response to volatility shocks. The model is calibrated using compensation data to quantify this predicted investment response for a large panel of firms.

Essentially, the validity of the theory of efficient markets is tested in the foreign exchange market by analysis of daily exchange rates of chosen currencies over the period from 2009 to 2013. USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, AUD and CHF are chosen according to their share in global foreign exchange market. The author presents the characteristics of currency pairs like their average daily change, total change, standard deviation of change and transaction costs. The changes in exchange rates in abnormal days are also analysed. Exchange rates change extremely in such days. Chosen currency appreciates or depreciates relative to the USD in these days, too. Insufficient and excessive responses to new information are examined. Then author analyses exchange rates in days following abnormal days. In order to find out the reasons of abnormal changes, the author analyses a number of political, economic and other information in abnormal days, total number of information and the number of abnormal days. Correlations between currency pairs are also presented. Findings how much various information influence various currencies can be helpful not only for investors and speculators in the foreign exchange market. They can find out, whether the changes are insufficient or excessive and how much are currency pairs correlated. Based on results, as for the appreciation, excessive responses were found out by all currency pairs except USD/GBP. On the other hand, as for the depreciation, insufficient responses were found out by all currency pairs except USD/AUD. The existence of semi-strong form efficiency in the foreign exchange market were not rejected, nor failed to reject, with respect to chosen currencies and chosen period, because of insufficient and excessive responses. Negative correlations were found out in the cases of currency pairs where currencies AUD or CHF were together with currencies EUR, JPY or GBP. In other cases, the correlations were positive. High positive correlation was found out between currencies EUR and GBP, while high negative correlation was found out between currencies EUR and CHF.","[Gottwald, Radim] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Gottwald, R (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",radim.gottwald@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,231,238,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000026,0

Subsidizing TT leads to the adoption of better abatement technologies in the South, thereby reducing the international permit price. This is beneficial for the North as long as it is a permit buyer; hence it chooses to subsidize TT. By contrast, the permit selling South suffers from the lower permit price and its welfare usually deteriorates, despite receiving subsidies. We also consider how TT affects countries' non-cooperative choices of permit endowments and find that it tends to reduce overall emissions.

Watzlawick argues that it is impossible not to communicate. ( 1969, 53) We agree with him that there is communication everywhere and all the time. So within the context of this topic, we put a question: How can we communicate properly and successfully with a foreign business partner? In that connection, the cultural background of our business partner it is very important. The true fact of the matter is that there is quite frequent misunderstanding during business negotiations as a consequence of the partner's different cultural background that is reflected in their thinking and acting. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance and direct connection of intercultural literacy as one of the conditions for successful communication in the negotiation processes. The paper presents some theoretical starting points for the topic, it offers the views of the problem of interculturality by several theoreticians, and tries to reply the questions directly connected with intercultural business negotiations: what is the impact of my partners' culture on their behaviour and thinking? Is intercultural communication only a product of communication in a foreign language, or is it something more than that?

The objective of this paper is 1) to gain a better understanding of the relationships between empowerment indicators and 2) to characterize clusters of different rural promoters of the Condoray Institute under the background factors that affect them. A survey was developed and administered to a sample of 31 female rural promoters in February 2015. By means of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), three main pathway matrixes of female empowerment were extracted: material, relational and perceptual.

The paper analyzes one specific proposal consisting in the differentiation of pension insurance contributions based on the number of dependent children. It thoroughly analyzes the given proposal from both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspective and assesses it within the context of the contemporary theory of pension systems. Based on the performed analysis, it concludes that the proposed measure is not appropriate, systemic and only brings partial effects for children with families in respect of the foreseen objectives - i.e. support of families with children - as it does not comprise all forms of family life, and that there are more suitable measures under the existing social policy that would lead to the fulfilment of the defined objectives.","[Holub, Martin] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Holub, M (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic.",martin.holub@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Firstly, it impose the elaboration of a classification of population into social classes, for which it is necessary to take into consideration some objective criteria, as level of incomes, occupation or level of education, skills or others, but also subjective criteria as the prestige of the profession or company, manual or non-manual character of work, social category of family or residential area where person was born. Bigger the number of criteria taken into account is, bigger the subjectivity of the classification is. Another difficult issue is related to the availability of data sources allowing the estimation of middle class. Ordinary data sources, namely the sample surveys, use major classifications' classes, which make less detailed the analysis. This article proposes to present a first perspective, strictly quantitative, regarding the measurement of middle class in Romania, through the indicator of population's incomes. The authors use two approaches in order to estimate middle class: an absolute one and a relative one. In the relative approach, the middle class is defines as the category of persons which represents one third from the total population, that third which carry-out the median part of the income distribution. On the contrary, in the absolute approach, the middle class contains the persons which have the incomes included in the second interval of the income distribution. For each of those two approaches, the article presents the main characteristics of the persons defined as middle class..

From a supply-side perspective, carbon capture and storage (CCS) policies differ substantially from renewable energy policies: they increase fossil resource demand and simultaneously lower emissions. We analyze CCS and renewable energy policies in a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model for settings of imperfect or missing carbon prices. We find that in contrast to renewable energy policies, CCS policies are not always capable of reducing emissions in the long run. If feasible, CCS policies can carry lower social costs compared to renewable energy policies, in particular when second-best policies are only employed temporally. In case fossil resources are abundant and renewable energy costs low, renewable energy policies perform better. Our results indicate that a pure CCS policy or a pure renewable energy policy carry their own specific risks of missing the environmental target. A smart combination of both, however, can be a robust and low-cost temporary second-best policy.","[Kalkuhl, Matthias; Edenhofer, Ottmar; Lessmann, Kai] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Kalkuhl, Matthias] Univ Bonn, Res Dev Ctr, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, D-10829 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Bonn; Technical University of Berlin,"Kalkuhl, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Res Dev Ctr, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",mkalkuhl@uni-bonn.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Lessmann, Kai/0000-0002-8839-343X; Kalkuhl, Matthias/0000-0003-4797-6628",,,,,38,24,26,5,57,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

It presents a parsimonious model of banking across borders, which is matched to bank-level data and used to quantify cross-border frictions. The counterfactual analysis shows how higher barriers to foreign bank entry alter the composition of international bank flows and may reverse the direction of net interbank flows. It also highlights that interbank lending and lending to non banking firms respond differently to changes in foreign and domestic conditions. Ultimately, the analysis suggests that policies that change cross-border banking frictions and, thereby, the composition of banks' foreign activities affect how shocks are transmitted across borders.","[Niepmann, Friederike] Board Governors Fed Reserve System, Int Finance Div, Washington, DC USA; [Kerl, Cornelia] Tufts Univ, Univ Tubingen, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Kerl, Cornelia] London Sch Econ, London, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Tufts University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kerl, C (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Univ Tubingen, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,,"Niepmann, Friederike/0000-0002-9454-7431",,,,,44,8,8,1,5,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Recent research suggests that changes to the work practices and business processes must accompany the implementation process if the desired goals and expectations of implementing IT are to be met. However, there is still limited knowledge on what types of change are required in an organisation as a whole in relation to BIM implementation. The purpose of this study is to explore how a large public client is initiating BIM implementation in their organisation. The main focus is to investigate what types of changes are being proposed to the work practices and processes in relation to BIM implementation. This paper studies the BIM initiation project at a large Swedish public infrastructure client. It is based on a case study involving both interviews and active participation. The findings indicate that the BIM initiation project proposes changes to the routines for how projects are initiated and conducted by introducing the concept of BIM in guiding documents. Yet, how these changes will influence the actual work practices and process is unclear. From these results, it can be argued that the organisation as such is not yet certain of how the implementation of BIM should and will influence the organisation. Rather, the initiation of BIM at the public client is a learning process about BIM and how it can improve productivity in the organisation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This issue has become very topical, especially in relation to changes in the CMO (abolition of quota system). The authors used mostly the database of European Dairy Farmers (EDF) association, in which the economic results of 19 European countries are summarized over the last few years. The enterprises were sorted by farm size (according to heads in dairy cow herds) and for evaluation of the basic characteristics were used methods of testing of statistical hypotheses. The results show that there may be some differences between large enterprises and family farms. In case of the total cost, there has been clearly demonstrated that the costs of milk production decrease with increasing herd size. Total costs varied significantly in 3 groups: up to 100, from 101 to 350 and herds with more than 350 heads of dairy cows. This roughly corresponds to the cost of feed, which is one of the most important items of direct costs. It is proved that, with larger farms, these costs have risen significantly in the same groups as was recorded in the growth of concentrate intake. Concentrated fodders are far more used on the large farms (around 8 kg per cow and day), suggesting efforts for greater intensification of production. However, it is obvious that especially on small family farms (up to 50 heads) are used rather extensive production methods and it corresponds to both the intake of concentrate (about 5 kg per cow) and lower total milk yield (up to 7.500 kg ECM/cow. year). On the other hand, we can see here a better treatment of cows on these small (family) farms, which can be seen through the indicators as culling rate or total lifelong milk yield.","[Mach, Jiri; Plasilova, Lenka] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Hoskova, Pavla] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Mach, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",mach@pef.czu.cz,"Hošková, Pavla/H-4594-2018; Mach, Jiri/H-4657-2018","Hošková, Pavla/0000-0003-0139-8498; Mach, Jiri/0000-0002-0526-4246",,,,,14,0,0,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,256,263,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600028,0

Thus the aim of the paper is to confirm or refute this hypothesis for OECD countries in the period 2000-2012. Unlike similar studies, the analysis is based on a dynamic panel data model and uses two alternative proxies for taxation - the tax quota and the World Tax Index (WTI). Results of the analysis confirm the hypothesis, showing that if productive spending is financed by indirect taxes, the effect on economic growth is positive, while if the spending is financed by direct taxes, the effect on growth is negative. However, the increase in indirect tax revenues must be accompanied by an increase in real tax burden via this type of taxation approximated e.g. by the WTI, which means that only an increase in effectiveness of tax collection is not sufficient.","[Machova, Zuzana; Kotlan, Igor] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Machová, Z (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",zuzana.machova@vsb.cz; igor.kotlan@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",,,,,45,2,2,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,531,539,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300056,0

The problem rising today is how to integrate innovation in this integrated management systems. The challenge of the problem is that the development of an innovation management system is in the early phase. In this paper we have studied the possibility of integrating some of the innovation request in an existing management system, we have identify the innovation performance request and we proposed some recommendations regarding innovation management and its implementation as a part of an integrated management system.

Unfortunately, on the long term, the impact of these measures hasn't always been a favorable one due to its collateral effects. Although the upward trend of the economy has been re-established as a result of increasing public expenditures, the public debt accumulated in this way has been difficult to manage. This paper aims to identify the main determinants of economic growth in the EU countries and to highlight several reforms in terms of public policies. The results point out the fact that a rather small dimensioned public sector positively influences economic growth, just like productive investments do, as opposed to non-productive investments. The differential taxation of tax base categories, as well as a cautionary increase of public debt or even public debt reduction, has to be considered in order to get a sustainable fiscal policy.

There are envisioned the implications of marketing techniques in the transformation of Closed Innovation models to Open Innovation models. This study brings to light new approach to explaining Open Innovation in terms of marketing science. Marketing, one of the youngest sciences, has contained in its intrinsic nature, the fact of major changing all sciences that interfere with. This is easily observable in the field of inventions. The newest practice of bringing in a short time the new findings on the market is to use models based on Open Innovation. The study conducted, presents Open Innovation beyond the definitions generally accepted among specialists. Working hypothesis is putting into question the fact that Open Innovation is actually Closed Innovation enhanced by well-applied Marketing Techniques. Exploratory research undertaken was qualitative and consisted of discussions through in-depth interviews with a group of 36 inventors of Closed Innovation generation, which try to adapt themselves to Open Innovation, the quickly new way to innovate. Were also consulted the opinions of other actors involved in bringing innovation to market: representatives of certification bodies and licensing, members of companies' management, end-users. Results of the research confirm largely that interference of the marketing techniques in inventor's domain has led to the emergence of models based on Open Innovation. Marketing instrumentation properly used, complements and strengthens all research and development departments' works. Marketing strategies and techniques can be implemented at every step of its development efforts on new products or services, through the identification and appointment of the optimal solutions and ideas of the moment, coming from outside the companies. This produce an immediate impact in decreasing the time to market for innovations and a substantial increase in profits. Using marketing techniques, companies identify latest opportunities that their clients want to benefit of and thus, can adjust their own findings with those developed outside the company. The results reached in this way are beneficial for both companies and end consumers. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This chapter introduces the articles in this volume, which applaud these accomplishments and explore their root causes, all the while raising concerns about the tradeoffs inherent in the Texas model and their implications for the state's future.","[Orrenius, Pia M.; Weiss, Michael] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Southern Methodist Univ, Tower Ctr Polit Studies, Dallas, TX USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Baylor Coll Dent, Execut MBA Program, Dallas, TX 75246 USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Council Econ Advisers, Washington, DC USA; [Canas, Jesus] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Southern Methodist University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M Health Science Center; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Orrenius, PM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN,LONDON,"4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-53017-2; 978-1-137-53016-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,3,11,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ5BN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000598368600014,0

Basis risks are considered to be a major reason for this. By the use of weather index- based insurance, basis risks remain with the farmer. However, weather index-based insurance can be interesting for agribusiness companies, specifically those which aggregate yields of several farms amongst themselves. This paper investigates the importance of the aggregation level of yield time series for the hedging effectiveness of weather index-based insurance following the example of a sugar processing company. This investigation is based on empirical sugar beet yield data from 40 sugar beet producing farms in Northern Germany. Furthermore, we work with the aggregated sugar yield time series of roughly 5,000 farms, which account for sugar beets used in the sugar processing company in question. At the same time, this highly aggregated yield time series describes the quantity risk of the sugar processing company. Our results empirically show that in consequence of aggregating the sugar yield time series, basis risk is diminished and risk reduction potential is raised through the use of weather index-based insurance. The risk reduction potential of weather indexbased insurance can, therefore, be underestimated if it is derived from studies pertaining to yield time series at the individual farm level. The focus of the present study may be relevant for agribusiness companies, as well as for potential providers of weather derivatives.","[Pelka, Niels; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Pelka, N (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Okon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",npelka@gwdg.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,44,0,0,0,12,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Prolonged underdevelopment of a financial system increases the overall costs and risks associated with change efforts. Widening and diversifying of financial markets allows for improved allocations of savings and better productivity, new investment opportunities, and improved employment. One of the important components of a well-functioning financial system is effective regulation that can provide confidence in the system as well as support the transformation. Global experience has taught us that financial liberalisation supports the economy growth, but also that the development efforts do not bring the same results everywhere. Developing countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina can increase their chances for economic growth through liberalisation,creating new investments through increased deposits, which also increases the risk of banking crisis due to higher volatility. Therefore, it is important to look at the process of financial liberalisation and integration in combination with regulatory transformation. In case of BiH this also includes the role of the currency board. Policymakers in developing countries such as BiH can find valuable learning lessons in literature and empirical research that can be useful in better understanding the benefits and challenges associated with financial liberalisation. The experience from other countries clearly shows that there is a fine line between progressive liberalisation actions and effective regulations to support the transformation and provide confidence in the financial system. Open communication and encouragement of ideas among the main economic players (including general public) are the key elements in designing a balanced response to financial globalisation and transformation efforts. The paper addresses some historical elements relevant to predominantly bankoriented financial systems characteristic to many developing countries such as BiH, as well as pros and cons associated with economic development efforts, currency board, prudential regulation, and supervision practices.","[Peric, Amela] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kozarevic, Emira; Polic, Nedzad] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Polic, Nedzad] Hifa Oil Doo, Tesanj, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Technology Sydney; University of Tuzla,"Peric, A (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",amela_peric@hotmail.com; emira.kozarevic@untz.ba; nedzad.polic@ef.unze.ba,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,87,105,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700005,0

Even though it may seem rather a technical matter only, the task to choose a proper valuation date is a cornerstone of every valuation analysis. The facts presented in this paper suggests that the choice of the valuation date is not solely formal, legal issue, but it obviously has a material impact to the rights of individuals, i.e. owners of companies, and also to the financial statements of the companies involved. It is therefore not correct to talk about the well known value drives and leave the valuation date in the background. In fact, it's exactly the opposite - the date of valuation determines the value drivers, and also fixes the premises and circumstances, regardless of whether the appraiser decides to use valuation models based on market comparison, DCF or asset-based models.

This is because Islamic microfinance has the ability to nurture its clients from being a recipient of zakat (obligatory contribution) to eventually becoming a zakat payer in the future. From the capital assistance provided to clients, Islamic microfinance institutions monitor its clients' growth from start-up all the way to success. The emergence of technology had made life much simpler in the past few years. Also, with the interaction between members of the community, benefits of establishing this community via Islamic microfinance institutions would be expanded, rather than acting as capital provider alone. This can be made possible with the introduction of community currency, which is a medium to exchange goods and services within a community, where this community is defined to be a group with a common bond, such as members of a locality or an association, and it is not restricted geographically. The current study looks into the usage of community currency worldwide. The benefits of community currency usage are hence investigated. Finally with the findings gathered and discussions made throughout the research journey, the current study proposes a community currency framework which could serve as an alternative economy in a Malaysian context. The study examines secondary data, such as reports, documentaries and booklets to understand how community currency is being a success in other parts of the world. The study had also identified one type of community currency that can suit the environment of Islamic microfinance institutions, which is the Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) mechanism.

Within the context of a small open economy model and building on the work of Mihov and Santacreu (2013), the author analyzes the economic implications of two monetary policy rules. The first is a rule in which the central bank uses the nominal exchange rate as its policy instrument and adjusts the rate whenever there are changes in the economic environment. The second is a standard interest rate rule in which the central bank adjusts the short-term nominal interest rate to changes in the economic environment. The main finding of the analysis is that, if the uncovered interest parity condition that establishes a tight link between the interest rate differential in two countries and the expected rate of depreciation of their currencies does not hold, the exchange rate rule outperforms the standard interest rate rule in lowering the volatility of key economic variables. There are two main reasons for this: First, the actual implementation of the exchange rate rule avoids the overshooting effect on exchange rates characteristic of an interest rate rule. And second, the risk premium that generates deviations from the uncovered interest parity condition is smaller and less volatile under an exchange rate rule.","Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Santacreu, AM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Santacreu, Ana Maria/I-5753-2016","Santacreu, Ana Maria/0000-0002-3788-4511",,,,,20,5,6,0,8,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Labour markets of SEE must adapt to fast changes of European labour market where opportunities for life-long jobs will be very rare and job mobility will be even more intensified in the future. In order to find adequate answers to these challenges labour markets in the region should become more market-driven. Process of transition in most of the countries of the region started nearly 25 years ago and countries in the SEE region have been trying to implement the best solutions and practices into local labour markets and to move in the right direction. The main purpose of this paper is to make comparison of labour markets among the countries in the region of South East Europe, especially comparison of non-EU members with the labour markets of Bulgaria and Romania, from the aspects of gender, age and other characteristics, and to draw the conclusions about the changes on the labour market of the region in the last decade when it comes to the employment, unemployment and participation rates and other labour market indicators. Through implementation of principal components analysis and factor analysis changes of regional labour market in last decade were monitored and key factors were identified.

The major objectives of an economy such as stability, economic growth and sustainable development are closely linked to the ability of financial systems to undertake such objectives. However, the main objective of the financial system in an economy is that of ensuring long-term economic growth through efficient financing of the economy. Financing economy refers to how the procurement and allocation of resources, both at micro and macro level, which can be divided into three categories:, Equity Finance (self-financing); Financing the capital market (direct funding); Debt financing (indirect financing). Elements of the financial system in our country are: financial markets (money market and capital market), financial intermediaries (banks, insurance companies, and investment companies), and financial infrastructure (payment systems and clearing houses). In general, emerging markets are characterized by financial systems based mainly on banks, while in developed countries for financial systems is based on the capital market. This may explain why emerging markets return after a period of crisis, it is cumbersome and lengthy. We believe that there should be a balance between the two components of the financial system so that recovery of losses incurred in a period of crisis, to be made in a short time. In this paper we use several variables to measure the development of the two components of the financial system and the banking capital market, such as market capitalization, leading interest rates, average annual growth rate in money and quasi-money, bank capital to assets ratio, domestic credit provided by banking sector. We analyzed, using SPSSS, the main indicators characterizing the relationship between financial sector development in our country, showing that there is a significant relationship between capitalization and loan rate, M2, the rate of bank assets and domestic credit from the banking sector.

In particular, answers are sought to two key questions: firstly, how is the volatility of returns in the gold futures market influenced by the sentiment of non-scheduled news events? Secondly, is this news-volatility relationship affected by the state of the business cycle? The empirical evidence points to the sentiment of newswire messages having a significant asymmetrical impact on volatility such that negative news has a significantly greater impact on volatility than does positive news. There is evidence to suggest that participants in the gold futures market initially over-react to newswire messages and this is subsequently reversed. The recessionary environment of Q4 2007-Q2 2009, serves to greatly increase the volatility response to newswire messages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, European Union cooperates with these countries through the instrument of European Neighborhood Policy. The first comprehensive instrument for the cooperation of European Union with the South was Euro-Mediterranean Partnership established in 1995. In 2008 during French Presidency of the Council of European Union, French president Nicolas Sarkozy declared the intention to deepen the mutual cooperation with Middle East and northern Africa through establishment of Union for Mediterranean. Four year later, it seems that Union for Mediterranean is not as effective tool as it was expected. Many countries of Middle East and northern Africa have had the experience of Arab revolutions that in some cases turned into serious armed conflicts. The attitudes of EU member states towards these conflicts have been rather divided. In result, European Union has not been able to develop a clear response to these events.","[Taterova, Eva; Darkwah, Samuel Antwi] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Taterová, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",eva.taterova@mendelu.cz; darkwah@mendelu.cz,"Taterova, Eva/HME-1250-2023; Darkwah, Samuel Antwi/AAV-9276-2020","Taterova, Eva/0000-0001-9984-4841; Darkwah, Samuel Antwi/0000-0003-3996-7246",,,,,15,0,0,1,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,829,836,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300088,0

This paper discusses various possible enhancements to active management tools and processes to generate extra returns in an increasingly challenging environment. The proposed framework is based on an affine model, which includes macroeconomic and market sentiment indicators among the explanatory variables. Using estimates of expected excess returns drawn from the model, an operational indicator produces input highlighting the portfolio's exposure to duration risk. This indicator is incorporated within a broader framework, in which a scorecard considers a range of qualitative elements, including consensus figures on macroeconomic data, monetary policy and interest rates. These elements are then combined with the model output to produce a comprehensive indication with respect to portfolio deviation from the benchmark. It should be noted that the approach presented in this paper is experimental; it has not yet been used in an active portfolio. Finally, consideration is given to the governance of the central bank investment process in order to assess how the proposed enhancements could strengthen the decision-making process. The analysis suggests that the scorecard with model-based input may address some weaknesses inherent in tactical decision-making.

J,"Wang, YD",,,,"Wang, Yi David",,,Convertibility restriction in China's foreign exchange market and its impact on forward pricing,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Foreign exchange; Conversion restriction; Forward pricing,INTEREST ARBITRAGE; RMB,"In contrast to the well established markets such as the dollar-euro market, recent CIP deviations observed in the onshore dollar-RMB forward market were primarily caused by conversion restrictions in the spot market rather than by changes in credit risk and/or liquidity constraint. This paper proposes a theoretical framework by which the Chinese authorities impose conversion restrictions in the spot market in an attempt to achieve capital flow balance, but face the tradeoff between achieving such balance and disturbing current account transactions. Consequently, the level of conversion restriction should increase with the amount of capital account transactions and decrease with the amount of current account transactions. Such conversion restriction in turn places a binding constraint on forward traders' ability to cover their forward positions, resulting in the observed CIP deviation. More particularly, the model predicts that the onshore forward rate will equal a weighted average of the CIP-implied forward rate and the market's expectation of the future spot rate, were the weighting is determined by the level of conversion restriction. As a secondary result, the model also implies that offshore non-deliverable forwards reflect the market's expectation of the future spot rate. Our empirical results are consistent with these predictions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, narrowing down the gap of income difference between the rich and the poor in rural society has become a commonly concerned issue by the government policy makers and academic scholars in China. This paper conducts analysis on the factors which contribute to the farmers' income differences by taking Liaoning province as a pilot study area, and from which some relevant government policies are proposed as to reduce the income gaps for the provincial economy. In the process, first of all, a field survey was administrated by selecting the farmer's households from the central, the southern, and the western regions, respectively, in the province. A total of 542 farmer households' cross-section dada was gathered; second, the log regression model was used in analyzing those primary factors which contribute to the farmer income differences; finally, the Shapley-value method was utilized to estimate the rate of contribution of each individual influential factor to the inequality of farm household incomes. The results indicate that the two upmost important factors are singled out in contributing to the farmer household income differences: one is the work time farmers spent in going out of their residential areas and the other is the years of education farmers received. Based on those findings, some related government policies are proposed.","Liaoning Univ Int Business & Econ, Dalian 116052, Peoples R China",,"Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Liaoning Univ Int Business & Econ, Dalian 116052, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-146-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,189,195,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364787100032,0

However, it is widely recognized that realizing the demographic dividend is policy dependent. In this paper, we document how economic conditions are able to either negate or amplify the gains from demographic dividends by looking at the case of the Philippines in separate periods of boom and bust. Recent evidence suggests that the Philippines has been benefitting from a favorable population age structure transition. It is expected, however, that the experience is not uniform among different population groups in the country. Some population groups are farther along in the demographic transition while others lag behind given the documented differentials in their fertility levels. Additionally, different groups could have different economic lifecycle schedules. We analyze how different population groups contributed to the overall economic growth experienced by the Philippines over different economic conditions in the past two decades.

When explaining insurers' trading behaviour we explicitly control for country risk and momentum strategies. The results show that insurers exhibited a flight to quality during the European sovereign debt crisis, while we find no evidence of a flight home. The flight to quality was not present before the European sovereign debt crisis and disappeared after ECB chairman Draghi's speech mid-2012.

One important facet of this conversation is whether prepurchase homebuyer education (HBE) is effective in reducing default or foreclosure risk. Studies to date have primarily focused on default risk and have faced challenges in accounting for borrower selection into HBE. This study analyzes the outcomes of a natural experiment in the provision of a classroom-based HBE program during the start-up phase of a down payment assistance loan program at Tennessee's state housing finance agency in 2002. A competing risks analysis of monthly payment data from 2002 to 2009 for 732 mortgages indicates that, after controlling for borrower, mortgage, and economic factors, HBE did not reduce default risk, but was associated with 42 percent lower odds of foreclosure. Among borrowers who defaulted, HBE was associated with an increased probability of curing a first default and of avoiding foreclosure post-default. Policymakers should consider the timing and intensity of HBE programs needed to influence default risk and how HBE may promote sustainable homeownership by influencing borrowers' help-seeking behavior and strategies for resolving defaults.

Expected shortfall (ES) is a tail risk measure, which is now recommended by the Basel Committee, involving a conditional expectation that can be semi-parametrically estimated via an asymmetric sum of squares function. The conditional autoregressive expectile class of model, used to implicitly model ES, is generalized to incorporate information on the intraday range. An asymmetric Gaussian density model error formulation allows a likelihood to be developed that leads to direct estimation and one-step-ahead forecasts of expectiles and, subsequently, of ES. Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes are employed for estimation, while their performance is assessed via a simulation study. The proposed models compare favorably with a large range of competitors in an empirical study forecasting seven financial return series over a 10-year period.","[Gerlach, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Chen, Cathy W.

In this paper, we study the incentives for hospitals to provide quality and cost-reducing effort under different payment regimes - either a retrospective or a prospective payment system - explicitly considering the role played by financial incentives linked to readmissions. In line with the general wisdom, we find that prospective payment systems do not perform better than retrospective systems, especially if the payment to the hospital is not adjusted to further enhance the incentive for the quality of care. More specifically, if the hospital receives full payment for readmitted patients, moving from a retrospective to a prospective payment system could induce a reduction in quality and, in turn, an increase in readmissions. However, if the prospective system is adjusted to internalize this counterincentive via a reduced payment for readmitted patients, it could foster higher treatment quality.","[Guccio, Calogero; Lisi, Domenico; Pignataro, Giacomo] Univ Catania, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Guccio, C (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",guccio@unict.it; domenico.lisi@unict.it; giacomo.pignataro@unict.it,"PIGNATARO, GIUSEPPE/H-8876-2012; Guccio, Calogero/M-4127-2015; Pignataro, Giacomo/AAG-7370-2021","PIGNATARO, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-7290-4397; Guccio, Calogero/0000-0002-1053-4968; Pignataro, Giacomo/0000-0002-1972-0572",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This study is part of the International Research Project on Financing Quality in Healthcare (InterQuality), whose main purpose is to investigate the effect of different financing methods and incentives on the quality, effectiveness, and equity of access to health care.

Uninsured depositors are also sensitive to bank solvency.

After specific disclosures, short-run abnormal returns are insignificantly negative, but 90-day cumulative abnormal returns are a statistically significant -5.23%. We find disclosures are likely to be followed by other disclosures, especially when the initial discloser is large or centrally located. However, there is no subsequent increase in short interest, and prices do not subsequently reverse.

We develop a neighborhood typology to characterize the built environment and transportation networks in almost every U.S. census tract, allowing us to identify possible synergistic and/or threshold effects on travel. We measure travel behavior in two ways: (1) using a multi-faceted traveler typology created using latent class analysis, and (2) by measuring the vehicle miles of travel among people in each of these traveler types. This dual approach allows us to distinguish between the built environment changes needed to encourage travel by modes other than driving, and those needed to reduce vehicle miles traveled among drivers. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we find that travel patterns are relatively stable along much of the urban-rural continuum, everything else equal. Driving was substantially lower only in Old Urban neighborhoods, where densities, job access, and transit service are dramatically higher than in all other neighborhood types. This finding implies that dramatic changes in the built environment doubling or even tripling development density or transit service may do little to get young people out of their cars when initial densities or transit services are low, as they are in most of the U.S. Conversely, reducing vehicle miles traveled among drivers appears to require more modest built form changes, a finding that offers some room for optimism among those concerned with auto dependence.

These community members can in turn sell permits to polluters according to their personal preferences. For a special case with a sole household, market transactions between the household and polluters achieve an efficient pollution level. However, for a group of households, the decentralized market solution fails to yield social efficiency because of competitive consumption of the environmental goods. We design a revenue-sharing mechanism akin to unitization, under which market transactions also achieve efficient resource allocation. Importantly, in some cases, efficiency can be achieved even when regulators are ignorant of the private valuation of the environmental good.","[Yang, Peifang] China Univ Petr, Acad Chinese Energy Strategy, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Kaffine, Daniel T.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Econ Bldg,256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",China University of Petroleum; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Yang, PF (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Acad Chinese Energy Strategy, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",peifang@cup.edu.cn; daniel.kaffine@colorado.edu,"Kaffine, Daniel/V-9996-2019",,,,,,29,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

With this policy, the government is willing to increase equality of opportunity among students. We show quantitatively that the policy, in fact, leads to a decrease in equality of opportunity since SECs are given the option to convert into private schools. We use a political economy model of education at which households, heterogeneous with respect to exogenously set income, choose among a continuum of private schools differentiated by tuition and a public school. Households choosing the public school can privately supplement their child's education spending in any amount. Public school is free of charge, and its spending is financed by income tax revenue collected from all households. Income tax rate is determined by majority voting. Achievement of a child depends only on educational spending. We calibrate the model's parameters by matching certain targets from 2013 Turkish data. We then exogenously restrict the supplemental education spending to zero in a counterfactual experiment. We find that variance of achievement (or inequality of opportunity) increases by 23.51% and mean achievement decreases by 1.74%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We don't make any specific assumptions as regards the origin of the tax evasion. We simply consider a society made up of two categories of heterogeneous agents, the rich and the poor. Among the rich people, some declare their total income whereas the others declare the same income as the poor. While the government is unable to control this factor, it can't distinguish the wealthy tax evaders from the poor ones either. Moreover, in the human capital accumulation function, we have introduced complementarities between personal tax contributions. Our model is declined in two cases, each corresponding to different education policies characterized by different ways of education funding. In the public education regime, the government collects income tax. Tax revenues are used to finance education. In the mixed education regime (public and private), the government finances education by collecting income tax whereas the richest parents can complete this education privately. We show that taxation depends positively on how large the tax evasion is but we also show that, in the mixed education regime, this sub optimality can be corrected by a longer compulsory length of schooling.","[Arestoff, Florence] Univ Paris 09, LEDa, DIAL UMR225, PSL, F-75016 Paris, France; [Arestoff, Florence] IRD, LEDa, DIAL UMR225, F-75010 Paris, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE EA 437, UPEM, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 09, PSL, LEDa CGEMP, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Arestoff, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, LEDa, DIAL UMR225, PSL, F-75016 Paris, France.;Arestoff, F (通讯作者)，IRD, LEDa, DIAL UMR225, F-75010 Paris, France.",florence.arestoff@dauphine.fr; Jean-Francois.Jacques@u-pem.fr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,8,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

In particular, the study investigates how banks make the trade-offs among these risks under the maturity transformation business model. The sample consists of banks in 43 countries over the period of 2002-2010. Results show that credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks are related to one another, and that the interactions among them can be reduced by corporate governance and regulations. During the regular yield curve spread (YCS) period, management-controlled banks take less credit risk and even less liquidity risk whereas shareholder-controlled banks encounter more liquidity risk as they pursue more interest rate risk. During the inverted YCS period, management-controlled banks still opt for less credit risk-taking, but shareholder-controlled banks are greatly exposed to risks and should thus be monitored by concerned authorities.

Firstly, this research analyses residents' perceptions of the impact of tourism development and examines the factors that influence the support for sustainable tourism development. Secondly, the research discusses Community Based Tourism (CBT) and its positive impact of tourism development; CBT is connected to community's capacity to protect itself from outside threats by negotiating the quality of tourism development. Thirdly, Gastronomic Tourism development is depicted as an interaction between outside developers and local residents that ultimately builds a sustainable dialogue for growth of tourism. Usually, the partnerships established between local community residents and outside tourism developers began with initial resistance from residents and led to the following sequence of behaviour: town meetings, formal organization of residents, petitioning, public demonstration, and legal action. By examining collective action narratives in the study communities, a framework for sustainable rural tourism development is built to understand relationships between tourism impacts, sustainable development and community identity. Findings indicate that residents see tourism as a development factor. The natural, economic, and social-cultural environment as well as infrastructure, age, gender and education are factors that influence the sustainable development of tourism and gastronomic tourism.","[Diaconescu, Dan Mihnea; Moraru, Remus; Stanciulescu, Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stanciulescu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cecilia.stanciulescu@gmail.com,"Moraru, Remus Christian/AAC-6951-2021; STĂNCIULESCU, GABRIELA CECILIA/AAI-2108-2021; Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022","STĂNCIULESCU, GABRIELA CECILIA/0000-0003-4791-1111; Moraru, Remus Christian/0000-0001-8734-6335",,,,,21,13,15,1,57,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18,,,,10,,999,1014,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700020,0

Focusing on a more homogenous group of financing events greatly improves the specification and predictive power of the selection model as compared to earlier studies, which is the key requirement to control for selection bias. This paper looks into a wide range of potential economic and political determinants of participation. Lower reserve coverage, deterioration in the current account balance, a weaker real GDP growth, increased macroeconomic instability (evident in higher fiscal deficits, inflation and exchange market pressures), and lagged elections would increase the probability of participation, i.e., propensity scores. Moreover, global conditions, including changes in real oil and non-oil commodity prices and world trade, are also significant; therefore, adverse global shocks could create cycles in demand for IMF financing. The short-term IMF engagement is positively associated with a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes. Notably, the impact on the short-term growth is the greatest and becomes significant only for LICs facing substantial macroeconomic imbalances or large exogenous shocks. When matching accounts for propensity scores and institutional quality, program countries in this group have changes in growth 1empty set-3empty set percentage points higher than the control group.

Unlike other Romania's counties that possess tourism advantages in the form of landscape or anthropic heritage, Olt county appears to lack the first part. However, the landscape is developed on a wavy morphology with not so crowded roads that favours cyclotourism. Therefore, the analysis focused on highlighting the historical-geographic objectives with touristic potential, as well as turing them to good account in the form of cycle routes. The novelty of the research is to design four cycle routes using Strava app and choosing a county in the lowlands as a case study. At the time of this analysis cycle tourism in Olt county, there was only one route for cyclists, currently online, but without no touristic importance. The methodology used involved identifying historical and geographical objectives of national importance, structuring categories and grouping them into four mixed tracks which were dedicated to cyclists. Previous stages were followed by field research in order to collect technical data (map, time, distance, total ascent etc.). Finally, a critical review of proposed bicycle routes was undertaken in the research. Study results showed that cycling tourism is a real opportunity for Olt county economy thanks to the number and value of the present tourism potential objectives. Nevertheless, at this stage, the lack of infrastructure, promotion and the small number of units makes it difficult to organize cycle tourism. What is more, the lack of cycle paths endangers cyclotourists' safety.","[Mionel, Viorel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Mionel, Oana] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Mionel, V (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",viorel.mionel@rei.ase.ro,"Viorel, Mionel/IQS-8911-2023; Mionel, Viorel/ABB-6643-2020","Viorel, Mionel/0000-0001-8636-5710; Mionel, Viorel/0000-0001-8636-5710",,,,,34,0,0,1,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18,,,,10,,913,928,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700014,0

TOPSIS is a multicriteria decision making technique similar to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which ranks a finite set of units based on the minimization of distance from an ideal point and the maximization of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Islamic banks using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature. Then, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to both country origin and cost structure have a prominent impact on efficiency. Findings also indicate that the Islamic banking market would benefit from higher level of competition between institutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose we employ Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The empirical evidence is based on three complementary knowledge diffusion variables (innovation, internet penetration and educational quality) and 10 governance indicators that are bundled and unbundled. The following are the main findings. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of mobile phone penetration on good governance. Second, the net effects on political, economic, and institutional governances that are associated with the interaction of the mobile phone with knowledge diffusion variables are positive for the most part. Third, countries with low levels of governance are catching-up their counterparts with higher levels of governance. The above findings are broadly consistent with theoretical underpinnings on the relevance of mobile phones in mitigating bad governance in Africa. The evidence of some insignificant net effects and decreasing marginal impacts may be an indication that the mobile phone could also be employed to decrease government quality. Overall, this study has established net positive effects for the most part. Five rationales could elicit the positive net effects on good governance from the interaction between mobile phones and knowledge diffusion, among others, the knowledge variables enhance: reach, access, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and interaction. In a nut shell, the positive net effects are apparent because the knowledge diffusion variables complement mobile phones in reducing information asymmetry and monopoly that create conducive conditions for bad governance. The contribution of the findings to existing theories and justifications of the underlying positive net effects are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this is a generic prediction and depends on maintained assumptions about industries, factor markets, and trade patterns that may not fit well for developing countries. Using firm-level data from Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania during the 1990s, a period of fairly rapid trade policy liberalization, we estimate productivity effects of trade. Our analysis confirms the well-known association between export intensity and higher productivity of the firm; however, the evidence for learning by exporting, or an increase in productivity associated with greater exports, is mixed, with several instances of negative average TFP growth among exporters. Our analysis indicates that such declines are likely attributable to the effects of lower external tariffs, because the firm-level productivity margin below which exporting is unprofitable moves down as the external tariff rate is reduced. We also find that sales to the rest of the world and sales to other African economies have differential effects on productivity growth rates, and that for country-specific reasons, these effects are not uniform. Controlling for initial productivity and the destination of exports (within or outside Africa) helps us understand why in some cases, export participation is associated with negative rates of TFP growth.

Building on existing theoretical and empirical work, we formulate hypotheses on the relationship between family ownership and R&D and organizational flexibility, and on how this translates into successful innovation. Using a sample of 2604 firms and 3140-year observations, we find that family firms engage less in R&D, but are more flexible in the way they organize and that this organizational flexibility enables them to successfully develop new products and even outperform non-family owned businesses when it comes to process innovation. This research contributes to the family business field by disentangling R&D and organizational flexibility as processes underlying the relationship between family ownership and innovation performance. It illustrates how family firms' organizational flexibility can result in an innovation advantage and thereby has important implications for practitioners.","[Broekaert, Wouter] KU Leuven Assoc, Res Ctr Entrepreneurship Odisee SVO, Dept Business Sci, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Andries, Petra] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Debackere, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven Res & Dev, Minderbroedersstr 8A, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; Ghent University; KU Leuven,"Broekaert, W (通讯作者)，KU Leuven Assoc, Res Ctr Entrepreneurship Odisee SVO, Dept Business Sci, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",wouter.broekaert@odisee.be; Petra.Andries@UGent.be; koenraad.debackere@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,79,71,77,10,145,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our explanation is that high-beta assets are prone to speculative overpricing. When investors disagree about the stock market's prospects, high-beta assets are more sensitive to this aggregate disagreement, experience greater divergence of opinion about their payoffs, and are overpriced due to short-sales constraints. When aggregate disagreement is low, the Security Market Line is upward-sloping due to risk-sharing. When it is high, expected returns can actually decrease with beta.

We depart from the literature by estimating a structural model of the social interactions in an individual's decision to engage in energy-saving practices and account for the methodological issues that are inherent in survey data: simultaneity, common shocks, and nonrandom group selection. Using data from a Japanese household survey, we find that the influence of social norms on individuals' energy-saving practices is small or insignificant and that unobserved individual characteristics are correlated between members in a group. Although based on a specific sample and a particular identification strategy, our results illustrate that reduced-form evidence, of positive correlation among group members, which is abundant in the literature, should be interpreted with caution because it may not reflect causation.","[Arimura, Toshi H.] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Katayama, Hajime] Waseda Univ, Fac Commerce, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Sakudo, Mari] Dev Bank Japan, Res Inst Capital Format, Chiyoda Ku, 9-7 Otemachi 1 Chome, Tokyo 1008187, Japan; [Sakudo, Mari] Waseda Univ, Waseda Inst Polit Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Sakudo, Mari] Japan Econ Res Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 2-2-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1000004, Japan",Waseda University; Waseda University; Waseda University,"Arimura, TH (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",toshi.arimura@gmail.com; hajime.katayama@waseda.jp; marisakudo@gmail.com,,"Katayama, Hajime/0000-0001-6529-8926","Center for Global Partnership of the Japan Foundation; [24530267]; [15H03352]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03352, 25245043] Funding Source: KAKEN","Center for Global Partnership of the Japan Foundation; ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) 24530267 and (B) 15H03352.

This paper uses administrative National Health Service (NHS) hospital records to examine key features of public hospital spending in England. We describe how costs vary across the life cycle, and the concentration of spending among people and over time. We find that costs per person start to increase after age 50 and escalate after age 70. Spending is highly concentrated in a small section of the population, but the degree of concentration is lower for older age groups. For those aged 25 and under, a third of all hospital spending is accounted for by 1 per cent of the population under 25 and a fifth of spending is accounted for by 1 per cent of patients under 25. For those aged 65 and over, these figures fall to 22 and 13 per cent, respectively. There is persistence in spending over time, with patients with high spending more likely to have spending in subsequent years and those with zero expenditures more likely to remain out of hospital.","[Kelly, Elaine; Stoye, George; Vera-Hernandez, Marcos] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Stoye, George; Vera-Hernandez, Marcos] UCL, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Kelly, E (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",elaine_k@ifs.org.uk; george_s@ifs.org.uk; m.vera@ucl.ac.uk,"Stoye, George/AAM-2292-2021","Kelly, Elaine/0000-0003-3396-6664; Vera-Hernandez, Marcos/0000-0003-4128-8883","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) [ES/M010147/1]; Health Foundation; ESRC under Future Research Leaders [ES/K009060/1]; ESRC [ES/K009060/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K009060/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Health Foundation; ESRC under Future Research Leaders(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank the Health and Social Care Information Centre for providing access to the Hospital Episode Statistics data sharing agreement NIC-210364-Z4K2F.

One way to answer this question is to identify and compare positive and negative outlier areas, those that experience greater and lesser poverty reduction, respectively, compared to what was anticipated given their levels of economic growth. The more similar these areas, the more leverage there is to unearth the factors that allow the poor to benefit from growth. In this paper, we employ an inductive approach to glean possible pathways out of poverty from two highly similar underdeveloped neighboring provinces in northeastern Thailand. Using extensive fieldwork and interviews, we explore factors that can account for one province reducing poverty at a quicker pace than expected, even as the other failed to channel its faster growth into significant poverty reduction. Our study finds that in Surin province, because a strong network of local NGOs was working closely with provincial leadership, national policies that targeted the poor found fertile ground and thrived. Small-scale, low-tech, rural based initiatives including organic rice, handicraft production, and rural tourism helped drive initially high levels of poverty down. Though many in Si-Saket also pursued many of these initiatives, they were structured in ways that promoted economic growth but largely prevented poor farmers from benefitting. Further research can examine whether this kind of micro-oriented path to rapid rural poverty reduction is useful in other contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results from a sample of 137 research groups at a university in an ultra-peripheral region reveal the existence of this bidirectional relationship. Scientific production has a positive influence on university-industry relations. Thus, when the articles published by the research groups increase, the contracts between university and industry also increase. Moreover, the results reflect a nonlinear relationship between contracts and scientific production. University-industry relations are complementary to scientific production up to a certain level, and after that point, there is a substitution effect. The results also show the moderating effect of the knowledge area on this relationship because groups belonging to technology-oriented areas have higher scientific production in response to university-industry relations.","[Aguiar-Diaz, Inmaculada; Lidia Diaz-Diaz, Nieves] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Luis Ballesteros-Rodriguez, Jose; De Saa-Perez, Petra] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Econ & Direcc Empresas, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Aguiar-Díaz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",iaguiar@defc.ulpgc.es; ndiaz@defc.ulpgc.es; jballesteros@dede.ulpgc.es; pdesaa@dede.ulpgc.es,"Ballesteros, José Luis/AAY-8614-2020; Díaz-Díaz, Nieves L./A-2468-2014; Diaz-Diaz, Nieves Lidia/AAW-1582-2020; AGUIAR-DIAZ, INMACULADA/I-5776-2019; De Saá-Pérez, Petra/AAJ-4345-2020; Ballesteros-Rodríguez, José Luis/AAY-8450-2020","Díaz-Díaz, Nieves L./0000-0002-8752-6157; Diaz-Diaz, Nieves Lidia/0000-0002-8752-6157; AGUIAR-DIAZ, INMACULADA/0000-0002-2809-2520; De Saá-Pérez, Petra/0000-0002-3945-5454; Ballesteros-Rodríguez, José Luis/0000-0002-3934-2679",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-21139],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),The authors thank the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation for its grant ECO2010-21139.

In our research we test experimentally what its effect is on social capital. To this purpose we structure a sandwich' experiment in which participants play a common pool resource game (CPRG) between two trust games in a Nairobi slum where social capital is scarce but informal rules regulating the commons are abundant. Our findings show that the change in trustworthiness between the two trust game rounds generated by the CPRG experience is crucially affected by the subjective satisfaction about the CPRG, rather than by standard objective measures related to CPRG players' behaviour. These results highlight that subjective satisfaction in a collective action has relevant predictive power on social capital creation, providing information which can be crucial to designing successful self-organized environmental resource regimes.","[Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Ist, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Castriota, Stefano] Univ Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy; [Conzo, Pierluigi] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Conzo, Pierluigi] CSEF, Anacapri, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Turin,"Becchetti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Ist, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it; stefano.castriota@unibz.it; pierluigi.conzo@unito.it,"Conzo, Pierluigi/AAN-3874-2020","Conzo, Pierluigi/0000-0002-5125-0646; BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,41,1,1,1,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The empirical analyses show that life satisfaction decreases substantially more in the probability of losing work when self-employed than when paid-employed. It also turns out that becoming unemployed yields a much stronger decline in self-employed workers' life satisfaction than in paid employees' life satisfaction. Although these results do not necessarily represent causal effects, they indicate that losing self-employment is an even more harmful life event than losing dependent employment. Further analyses substantiate this conclusion. It is also shown that non-monetary reasons may explain much more than monetary reasons why the self-employed seem to suffer in particular from unemployment. In addition, the difference in the responses of well-being to unemployment between self-employed workers and paid-employed workers originates from varying levels of life satisfaction after terminating work, but not from divergent levels of life satisfaction before terminating work. One implication of these findings is that the potential psychological cost of unemployment might constitute a risk that prevents workers from going into business by themselves.","[Hetschko, Clemens] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Hetschko, C (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",Clemens.Hetschko@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,53,23,27,3,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This project analyzes the factors that lead Mexican state governments to allocate distributive benefits to small-business organizations (SBOs) rather than directly to entrepreneurs or to other groups. Theoretically, I address how electoral threats to the ruling party shape the incentives of politicians to deliver benefits to core and non-core interest organizations. Using an original dataset of decentralized small-business subsidies, I deploy a novel subnational design, comparing states governed by parties with different relationships to SBOs, facing different levels of electoral threat. I find that electoral competition shapes politicians' incentives for incorporating organizations in distributive spending. Governors from the pro-small-business PAN increase allocations to SBOs when they are electorally strong, while governors from the centrist PRI allocate more to these organizations when they face an electoral threat. Case studies provide additional evidence that ruling politicians allocate benefits to SBOs when linkages with these groups contribute to their most pressing electoral objectives.

Lately, diverse studies discuss how much objective and subjective indicators are able to characterize some of the above mentioned dimensions. This has opened the door to some apparent contradictions between different food security measurements that reflect perception (through specific surveys) and behavior (expenditure data). This article aims to extend the food security debate, focusing on the dimension of nutritional quality and classifying food products as healthy or unhealthy, in addition to computing their calorie value. Using a nationally representative database of nearly 6700 households in Mexico, we found that food-secure households (55% of the total sample) purchase an overall food basket that is 0.7 items less diverse, spend $85 Mexican pesos per week more, and show no significant difference in terms of purchased kcals compared to food-insecure households. After controlling for confounding factors, we found that food secure households purchase a wider variety of healthy food items (and a smaller variety of unhealthy food items), spend more money on food, and purchase more calories in healthy food items compared to food-insecure households. Therefore, with this article, we enhance the relevance of the nutritional quality of food purchases in the food security debate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, we might also expect a negative relationship between pay for accounting performance and R&D investment in firms under temporary earnings pressure. However, we show that in an emerging market such as China, where the agency cost of innovation is high, firms may use incentive plans based on accounting performance to mitigate the opportunistic behavior of management. We find a positive relationship between pay for accounting performance and R&D investment. In addition, we find that the above relationship becomes weaker if there are alternative governance mechanisms to mitigate the agency cost of innovation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Analyzing rebalancing operations for nine BSS, we describe implications for operators, municipalities, and future optimization work. We find that stations adjacent to transit hubs receive disproportionate amounts of rebalancing relative to trips and that rebalancing is more often responding to morning and afternoon demand exceeding station dock capacities rather than longer term accumulations of bicycles. More importantly, we observe some operator rebalancing behaviors constrained between opposing goals of maximizing trips, profits, and service level agreements.

In response, a consumer education program was created and tested by university researchers and educators associated with Cooperative Extension. This article draws extensively on the emerging literature on health insurance literacy and on data from participants in the Smart Choice Health Insurance (TM) program. The intent of the study was to understand socio-demographic and environmental variables that predict initial health insurance literacy and gains in health insurance literacy. A standardized instrument measuring health insurance literacy was used to collect the data. Multivariate analysis showed higher income consumers demonstrated greater initial health insurance literacy scores compared to middle income consumers, whereas younger, male and lower educated consumers reported lower initial health insurance literacy. After participating in the Smart Choice Health Insurance (TM) program, consumers who made greater gains in their health insurance literacy tended to be female, higher income, and consumers residing in states that showed supportiveness of the ACA. The findings highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic characteristics in program design and delivery, as well as how contextual issues, such as the political environment, might impact the delivery of educational efforts. Findings from the analyses help inform ways to adapt and tailor educational opportunities that focus on health insurance literacy for a range of consumers.","[Bartholomae, Suzanne] Iowa State Univ, Human Dev & Family Studies, 58 Le Baron Hall, Ames, IA USA; [Russell, Mia B.] Univ Maryland Extens, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, 3300 N Ridge Rd,Suite 240, Ellicott City, MD 21043 USA; [Braun, Bonnie] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Family Sci, College Pk, MD USA; [McCoy, Teresa] Univ Maryland, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Univ Maryland Extens, 1208 Symons Hall, College Pk, MD USA",Iowa State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Russell, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Extens, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, 3300 N Ridge Rd,Suite 240, Ellicott City, MD 21043 USA.",mbr@umd.edu,"Russell, Mia Baytop/J-9619-2019","Russell, Mia Baytop/0000-0003-4834-2467; Bartholomae, Suzanne/0000-0001-5779-6239",University of Maryland Extension; College of Agriculture and Natural Resources; University of Delaware Cooperative Extension,University of Maryland Extension; College of Agriculture and Natural Resources; University of Delaware Cooperative Extension,"This study was funded by University of Maryland Extension, the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the University of Delaware Cooperative Extension.",,62,22,25,1,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

In this paper, we compare the relative merits of public and private delivery within a mixed delivery system. We study the role played by ownership, transaction costs, and competition on local public service delivery within the same jurisdiction. Using a stochastic cost frontier, we analyze the public-private urban bus system in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. We find that private firms have higher delivery costs than those incurred by the public firm, especially when transaction costs are taken into account. Furthermore, tenders tend to decrease delivery costs.","[Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, Econ, John Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Bel, Germa; Rosell, Jordi] GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Rosell, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, John Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Bel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, Econ, John Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Bel, G (通讯作者)，GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu; jrosell@ub.edu,"Rosell, Jordi/H-9068-2015; Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008","Rosell, Jordi/0000-0002-9715-7228; Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085","Spanish Government [ECO2012-38004, CSO2015-68391]; Regional Government of Catalonia [SGR2014-325]; ICREA-Academia; Societat Economica Barcelonesa Amics del Pais",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Regional Government of Catalonia; ICREA-Academia(ICREA); Societat Economica Barcelonesa Amics del Pais,"This research received support from the Spanish Government (projects ECO2012-38004 and (CSO2015-68391)), and the Regional Government of Catalonia (project SGR2014-325).

We use a series of panel estimations as well as several robustness checks to test these effects, using relevant controls for economic development, the size of the state, and other regulatory and tax policy measures. We find that higher tax rates consistently discourage entry. Further, we find that although the direct influence of corruption on entry is also consistently negative, the interaction influence of corruption and tax rate is positive. This indicates that corruption can offset the negative influence of high taxes on entry.

Historical legitimacy is more strongly correlated with ethnic diversity than are the antiquity of states, genetic diversity or the duration of human settlement.

Using for 115 countries a novel dataset containing the characteristics of the constitutions enacted in the world, applying an IV-GMM treatment to deal with the endogeneity of constitutional rules, and controlling for de facto variables, the paper finds that provisions about the right to conduct/establish a business, the right to strike, consumer protection, anti-corruption, and compulsory education promote higher rates of new firm formation.

The reform-of the school week in France provides the ground, for a verification of the attribution of accountability hypothesis, as it was nationally decided and locally implemented, right before a municipal election. The results confirm that local incumbents have taken the blame of the reform, especially in larger cities. In this case, thus, the cost of the reform is borne twice by the lower level of government, financially and politically. So doing, the central government does a dirty deed to the local ones, for a very cheap cost That mayors who have announced a boycott of the reform have received electoral gains confirms that some local politicians expected to be the fall guys, bearing the brunt of the costs of the reform.

Macro evidence from sovereign wealth funds' investment behaviour,EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sovereign wealth funds; Cross-border investment; Acquisition determinants; Contrarian; Financial crises,CAPITAL FLOWS; DETERMINANTS; STRATEGIES; IMPACT,"This paper investigates the determinants of the investment activity of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) at a macro level, with special emphasis on the possible reaction to a financial crisis in a potential target economy. The analysis relies upon a specially built proprietary database, which-encompasses 1,903 acquisition deals spanning the period-1995-2010 and involving 29 out of the 79 existing SWFs. According to a three-step modelling approach, we find that this class of investors prefers to invest in countries with a higher degree of economic development, larger and more liquid financial markets, institutions that offer better protection of legal rights, and a more stable macroeconomic environment. Most importantly, and in stark contrast with the existing empirical literature on other major institutional investors, SWFs seem to engage in 'contrarian' investment behaviour, i.e. increasing their acquisitions in countries where crises hit. The results are shown to be valid if we consider both the likelihood of a country being the target of SWFs' investments and the amount SWFs choose to invest in each country. Capital flows stemming from SWF5' acquisition activity worldwide may therefore have a stabilizing effect on local markets during periods of financial turmoil, protecting the targeted countries from foreign shocks instead of propagating them globally.

We investigate reactions from stock, bond, foreign exchange and futures markets and banking and financial companies during the Asian crisis. We explore the impact of IMF bailouts not only on crisis countries, but also on main creditor countries. We study the impact of local governments' and public responses in crisis countries to account for interaction between the IMF and local parties. We show IMF involvement and local governments' co-operation actually helps crisis countries but not creditors. We show that in crisis countries, financial markets generally react unfavourably to their governments' initial demands for IMF assistance, while compliance of the crisis countries with the IMF policy action is commonly perceived as good news. Financial markets in crisis countries react negatively to prolonged negotiations and government actions against IMF policy. Creditor countries' financial markets are not responsive to IMF actions in crisis countries.

This paper presents estimates of ATSMs for the UK and explores how much weight users of these models can place on point estimates of term premia. Over much of the period since the early 1990s, broad movements in estimated premia are robust across a wide range of reasonable specifications. But there is substantial model and parameter uncertainty associated with these models and estimates of the time-series dynamics of yields may be biased in short samples. This model uncertainty is greater towards the end of our sample period, when bond yields have been well below historically normal levels. (C) 2016 The Bank of England. Published by Elsevier B.V.

By adopting a spatiotemporal autoregressive panel model as the platform of our study, the complex impact resulting from FDI penetration is separated into spatial direct and indirect effects while accounting for feedback loops among regions. A set of spatially partitioned summary measures is produced to identify and to quantify FDI spillovers from different channels with distinct geographic scopes. Empirical results based on data from China document that the direct impacts of FDI presence to a specific location itself are likely to be negative. Domestic firms mainly benefit from FDI presence in their neighboring regions through knowledge spillovers that have wider geographic scope. Negative market stealing effect nevertheless has no spatial boundary. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We conduct a theoretical analysis to compare the electoral consequences of top-two primaries with those of closed primaries. Each primary procedure induces a sequential game with three stages: candidate-entry stage, primary elections, and general election. We analyze the equilibria of these games and show that top-two primaries contribute to political moderation. In particular, when the median voter is extreme, closed primaries always generate extreme winners and, yet, top-two primaries can generate moderate winners. Furthermore, when the median voter is moderate but the partisan median voter of her party is extreme (and some additional mild conditions hold), closed primaries always generate extreme winners while top-two primaries always generate moderate winners. We also show that top-two primaries increase the number of swing states since, in certain cases, the party affiliation of the winner under top-two primaries may not coincide with the party affiliation of the median voter.","[Amoros, Pablo; Socorro Puy, M.] Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Martinez, Ricardo] Univ Leon, Dept Econ & Estadist, Leon, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Leon,"Amorós, P (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",pag@uma.es; mps@uma.es; ricardo.martinez@unileon.es,"Puy, M.

Although the PCAOB is mandated to inspect all auditors of SEC registrants, certain foreign governments prohibit PCAOB inspections of their domestic auditors, providing variation in PCAOB inspection access that is not available when studying a sample of US companies. I find that auditors subject to PCAOB inspection access provide higher quality audits as measured by more going concern opinions, more reported material weaknesses, and less earnings management, relative to auditors not subject to PCAOB inspection access. There is no observable difference between the two sets of auditors prior to the PCAOB inspection regime. The positive effect of PCAOB inspection access on audit quality is observed in jurisdictions with, and without, a local audit regulator.

The development of successive commodity frontiers gave way to long waves of economic expansion that have been pivotal to accelerating accumulation and transcending capital's recurrent crises. In short, commodity frontiers are constitutive of world-ecological moments premised on booms and crises of accumulation. In this paper, I examine the coal commodity frontier in Appalachia, to illustrate the region's history as one of succeeding frontiers in and out of the region over the long twentieth century of American capitalism. I argue that the origin of Appalachia's coal frontier was decisively made through the nineteenth-century agricultural revolution expressed outside of the region. Appalachia's full-fledged development was an outcome of capital's under-reproduction strategies. The crisis of the region's frontier turned on a lack of surplus from under-reproduction strategies, competing coal basins, economic diversification and competing energy sources. I find that the commodity frontier concept not only illuminates regional political economies and ecologies of difference, but also explains the production of nature of historical capitalism.","[Marley, Benjamin J.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Sociol, Lib Tower 3rd & 4th Floors,POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Marley, BJ (通讯作者)，Binghamton Univ, Dept Sociol, Lib Tower 3rd & 4th Floors,POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",bmarley1@binghamton.edu,,,,,,,134,29,38,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

An often suggested government policy is therefore to allocate resources towards formal schooling for adults. However, returns on such investments are uncertain and the foregone earnings are potentially large. We use Swedish population register data from 1982 to 2011 to estimate average long run earnings returns on higher education for 29- to 55-year-olds who enrolled 1992-1993. We find substantial positive estimates, but these only fully emerge after approximately ten years. Nevertheless, calculations indicate that the benefits for society exceed the costs also under fairly pessimistic assumptions.

Using state-level data for 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2007, we estimate for the median voter in each state the change in the marginal cost of higher education subsidization generated by tax exportation, and calculate the increased higher education spending that results. We consider three types of spending: state appropriations to public universities as well as need- and non-need-based aid awarded to in-state students. We find that neither type of aid is responsive to the marginal cost, or tax price, faced by the median voter. However, the median voter's price elasticity of demand for state appropriations is statistically significant and negative. We find that the median voter's tax price is substantially reduced by the presence of prominent mining and tourism industries and by the federal deductibility offset available to firms. Thus, these tax-exporting capacities exert upward pressure on voter demand for state appropriations to public universities.

Emergency savings can act as form of insurance against such economic shocks and reduce the risk of hardships that influence family wellbeing. Prior research has established that threshold amounts of liquid assets can reduce the risk of economic hardship. This study used a measure of self-reported emergency saving behavior to examine whether households who reported saving for emergencies were less likely to experience subsequent economic hardships in a longitudinal sample of households in disadvantaged neighborhoods from the Annie E. Casey Foundation's Making Connections project. Results across a range of regression models suggest that households who saved for emergencies experienced slightly less overall hardship and were less likely to report several specific hardships, such as food insecurity and having a phone disconnected, three years later. This study supports the idea that small, unrestricted savings may play a protective role for low-income households.","[Gjertson, Leah] Univ Wisconsin, 1300 Linden Dr,Suite 2208, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Gjertson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, 1300 Linden Dr,Suite 2208, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",lmgjertson@wisc.edu,,,,,,,58,77,85,3,22,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

While various studies predict large environmental migration flows due to climate change and other environmental events, the ex post empirical evidence for this phenomenon is inconclusive. We contribute to the extant literature by focusing on the micro-level. We examine whether and how individual perceptions of different types of environmental stressors induce internal migration. The analysis relies on original survey data from Vietnam including both migrants and non-migrants. The results suggest that individual perceptions of long-term environmental events, such as droughts, significantly reduce migration while perceptions of sudden-onset environmental events, such as floods, significantly increase the likelihood of migration controlling for other determinants of migration. These findings also imply that improving the targeting of aid to environmental disaster-affected areas and the financial and technical support for adaptation to environmental change could be the most productive policy-options. Policymakers, thus, need to implement a wide range of developmental policies in combination with environmental ones in order to improve society's ability to effectively cope with environmental change and minimize its effect on migration.

Adoption of the gold standard by the United States in 1879 resulted in all four core countries (France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States) being fully committed to gold. I use the concept of half-life (HL) to measure the time it takes for a deviation from purchasing power parity (PPP) to dissipate by 50%. Relative to the years 1870-1913, between 1880 and 1913 the half-lives of REERs in core countries decrease from between 4.4 and 5.2 years to between 3.1 and 3.4 years, with similar declines across dynamic panels. Combined with evidence elsewhere that interest rates adjusted quickly, the evidence herein suggests that adjustment in goods markets was faster following adoption of the gold standard.","[Mollick, Andre Varella] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Mollick, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",andre.mollick@utrgv.edu,"Mollick, Andre/AAP-2699-2020",,,,,,41,0,0,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The results suggest that while managers who are related to the owners of an enterprise receive higher performance-based compensations than professional managers, their compensations are less sensitive to firm performance than that of professional managers. These findings parallel those of Chinese enterprise managers identified by Cai et al. (Rev Econ Stat 95(3), 850-867, 2013).

It is an increasingly common belief that KIBS not only perform innovation activities in the service of the manufacturing sector, but they are also bridges of knowledge or innovation bridges, connecting the manufacturing sector, science and customers. The research questions were numerous. This paper attempts to reveal the existence of any relationship indicators, with special regards to the tourism indices and the KIBS related variables and how their position among different development indicators can be determined. It also explores whether there is any territorial difference or disparity within the counties of Romania. The results show that the KIBS related activities represent significant spatial concentration in the urban centres, especially in Bucharest. The concentration of KIBS-related local units were significant in several Romanian counties: Brasov, Cluj, Constanta, Ilfov, Sibiu and Timi. (these counties and Bucharest contain almost 60 percent of the KIBS-related local units in Romania in 2013) and this territorial pattern is completely overlapped by the results of the multivariate cluster analysis. Different factors of KIBS are analysed by factor analysis, setting the KIBS-related indicator into the first component named 'Economic prosperity' with different development and infrastructural indicators. The research also reveals a strong correlation among the development indicators that predicts the significant spatial disparities from the respect of KIBS. The method used and the results produced could be useful for experts and decision makers in the field of economics and regional development.","[Bujdoso, Zoltan] Karoly Robert Univ Coll, Gyongyos, Hungary; [Penzes, Janos] Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary; [David, Lorant] Eszterhazy Karoly Univ Appl Sci, Eger, Hungary; [Madaras, Szilard] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transylvania, Miercurea Ciuc, Romania",University of Debrecen; Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University; Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania,"Dávid, L (通讯作者)，Eszterhazy Karoly Univ Appl Sci, Eger, Hungary.",,"Pénzes, János/AAC-9939-2020; David, Lorant/AAM-3567-2020; Pénzes, János/AAA-6975-2019; David, Lorant Denes/AAN-4640-2020","Pénzes, János/0000-0002-4870-087X; Dr. David, Lorant Denes/0000-0001-7880-9860",European Union; State of Hungary; European Social Fund [TAMOP-4.2.4.A/ 2-11/1-2012-0001]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of Hungarian Academy of Sciences; [TAMOP-4.2.1.D-15/1/KONV-2015-0013],European Union(European Union (EU)); State of Hungary; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of Hungarian Academy of Sciences;,"This research was supported by the European Union and the State of Hungary, co-financed by the European Social Fund in the framework of TAMOP-4.2.4.A/ 2-11/1-2012-0001 'National Excellence Program'.; This paper was supported by the Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.; The paper was compiled within the frameworks of the TAMOP Programme (Social Renewal Operative Programme) Research, Innovation, Cooperation - Strengthening the cooperation of social innovation and research networks by the collaboration of Eszterhazy Karoly University of Applied Sciences, Bay Zoltan Applied Research Non-profit Ltd. and Agria TISZK Non-profit Ltd, project identification number: TAMOP-4.2.1.D-15/1/KONV-2015-0013.

Prolonged exposure to high road noise levels can lead to various problems in people's health and well-being. The objective of this article is to determine whether the groups most vulnerable to road noise, that is, children under 15 years old, people 65 years old and over, and the groups most likely to experience high nuisance levels, visible minorities and low-income individuals, are affected by an environmental inequity related to this nuisance. The method of estimating this nuisance employed in the study is based on a combination of several elements: that is, average traffic flows, road geometries, normal atmospheric conditions, and the characteristics of the urban environment. All of these parameters were considered for the 14 boroughs that make up the central portion of the Island of Montreal. Modelling was used to calculate the maximum daily road noise, based in part on the LimA software predictive model and according to the XPS 31-133 computation method. The results obtained from three different statistical tests and spatial regression analyses show that, on the one hand, the groups chosen on the basis of age are not affected by any environmental inequity related to the phenomenon of road traffic noise. On the other hand, low-income individuals and visible minorities live in city blocks marked by road traffic noise levels that are slightly higher than those experienced by the rest of the population.

We find a positive association between D&O insurance and the cost of equity. Information quality and risk-taking appear to be two underlying channels through which D&O insurance affects the cost of equity. Further tests suggest that this positive association is not due to optimal risk-taking, as evidenced by a negative market reaction to an increase in D&O insurance coverage, a lack of improvement in firms' cash flow and a low valuation associated with high D&O insurance. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the notion that MO insurance weakens the disciplining effect of shareholder litigation, leading to an increase in the cost of equity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Changing production patterns demanding greater end to end visibility by customers and accessibility to key inland population centers assume greater importance in the organization and design of transport resources and cargo flows. While synchronization of all aspects of the supply chain has become an operational necessity for firms, it is often held hostage to the efficiency of hinterland networks who must respond to a large group of stakeholders with sporadic coordination. This is particularly true when looking at the central US city and region of Chicago, a critical intermodal exchange point for truck, air and river barge traffic domestic and global, as well as a major central distribution location. This paper analyzes supply chain integration (SCI) efforts in the metropolitan Chicago region and considers efforts by public and private actors to collaborate for region-wide SCI improvements. Pareto analysis suggests that concentrated freight corridors exist, influencing freight planning for regional transportation networks more directly than diffused regional freight movements. If the corridor service becomes less responsive or congested the corridor will move to different end nodes within the broad region. Regional planning must thus address national, regional, and local moves. Private/public sector infrastructure firms should address functional cooperation on SCI by focusing on corridors as well as local improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, possible complementarities of aid and FDI have received limited attention so far. It remains open to debate whether aid could render recipient countries more attractive to FDI by removing specific bottlenecks that prevent higher FDI inflows. In particular, we raise the hypothesis that aid specifically targeted at economic infrastructure helps developing countries attract higher FDI inflows through improving their endowment with infrastructure in transportation, communication, energy, and finance. By performing 3SLS estimations we explicitly account for dependencies between three structural equations on the allocation of sector-specific aid, the determinants of infrastructure, and the determinants of FDI. We find strong and robust evidence that aid in infrastructure is effective in improving the recipient countries' endowment with infrastructure. In sharp contrast, other aid is not effective in improving infrastructure. Infrastructure consistently proves to be an important determinant of developing countries' attractiveness to FDI. Consequently, only targeted aid promotes FDI indirectly through the infrastructure channel. In addition, aid in infrastructure has direct effects on FDI. It appears that foreign investors anticipate longer term effects of aid on the country's endowment with infrastructure and expect aid-financed infrastructure to serve them particularly well.

Using the gap between the estimated and reported total direct costs of rights offerings as a measure of firms' bribes payments in the process of rights offering applications under this system, we find that bribe payments are positively related to local governments' control rights, firms' opportunity costs of refusing to pay bribes, and the severity of firms' Jensen agency problems. We further show that after termination of the regulatory system, firms' bribe payments are substantially reduced, and local governments' control rights as well as the severity of firms' Jensen agency problems can no longer explain the variation in bribe payments.

The main causes of this trend are still unclear. Using a unique dataset in which vehicle registration data were combined with population and income register data for 2012/2013, this paper explores how car ownership among young Dutch households varies with household composition, urbanisation level (of household location), household income, employment status and ethnic background. Logistic regression analysis of this data revealed that urbanisation level and household composition are essential factors influencing car ownership. In addition, we found significant interaction effects between these two factors: the influence of urbanisation level on car ownership was much stronger for young couples than for young families or singles. Our results imply that increasing urbanisation and postponement of parenthood could reduce future car ownership among young adults in general. However, the increasing number of young families moving to more urbanised areas could increase future car ownership in cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we revisit Castles's seminal 1967 article, based on the 1961 Population Census of Indonesia, on the educational and ethnic composition of Jakarta. Using data from the full-count 2010 Population Census, we examine spatial patterns in the educational gradients of the population across the Jakarta MUR and look to determine whether these patterns can be explained by internal migration and ethnic composition at the kecamatan (subdistrict) level. We find that population movement from the core to the outer areas has softened the historically extremely sharp gradation in educational attainment across the MUR. We show the dominance of the Sundanese and Bantenese ethnic groups in the rural hinterlands of the MUR, where the average educational attainment is relatively low, and note this question of rurality versus ethnicity when interpreting our results.","[Jones, Gavin W.; Rangkuti, Hasnani; Utomo, Ariane; McDonald, Peter] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Jones, Gavin W.] Murdoch Univ, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Australian National University; Murdoch University,"Jones, GW (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,"Utomo, Ariane/0000-0003-2314-9513; McDonald, Peter/0000-0001-5579-0335",Australian Research Council [LP120200381]; Australian Research Council [LP120200381] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant (LP120200381).

Efficiency and productivity were estimated by non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), using output-oriented CCR and BCC models. Total factor productivity changes were expressed by Malmquist indices and their decomposition. To estimate the net effects of the investment support we applied Conditional Difference in Differences (CDID) method. We constructed panel data of 631 Slovak farms, with 1375 ha of UAA on average. We found, that productivity of both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the investment support slightly decreased over time. This decline could be mostly attributed to technological regress. The farms non-beneficiaries of investment support, were more technically efficient on average, than beneficiaries. Beneficiaries, specialized on crop production significantly improved their performance. We found mixed evidence of investment support net effects on farm performance indicators.

Design/methodology/approach - Primary data was collected from weekly T-bill auctions in five Sub-Saharan countries and was analysed using a range of Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models in order to determine the volatility characteristics of each of these instruments. Differences in the institutional arrangements for each market are used to interpret the results of the econometric analysis. Findings - Evidence is presented that indicates that the size and financial liberalisation of capital markets affect volatility. While the markets with the greatest exposure to international investors exhibit greater volatility in the long-run, the presence of non-residents in the market appears to contribute to more efficient pricing of these instruments. Research limitations/implications - The limited sample restricts the ability to generalise these findings, however, the finding that differences exist in the volatility of these markets even though they are geographically similar indicates the value of this methodological approach. Practical implications - The finding that greater capital mobility may result in increased volatility and greater efficiency has significant policy implications for governments and market regulators who have to weigh the costs and benefits of financial liberalisation. Originality/value - The paper employs a unique data set to model the volatility characteristics of the selected T-bills to improve the understanding of the behaviour of these important instruments in Sub-Saharan frontier markets. More specifically the study provides a novel empirical approach to addressing the question of whether capital mobility is linked to increased volatility. The finding that capital mobility is linked to greater market efficiency offers a fresh insight to this debate.","[Charteris, Ailie Heather; Strydom, Barry] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Pietermaritzburg Campus, Kwa Zulu, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Charteris, AH (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Pietermaritzburg Campus, Kwa Zulu, South Africa.",charterisailie@gmail.com,"Charteris, Ailie/AFK-1488-2022; Strydom, Barry Stephen/H-7535-2019","Charteris, Ailie/0000-0001-5709-4309;",,,,,72,2,2,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

As a consequence, sales of so-called distressed properties, often after a foreclosure, became commonplace. This spurred numerous research papers on various related issues. The authors' review summarizes the research findings on three topics: the impact of changes in housing prices on foreclosures; the impact of foreclosure on the sales price of the foreclosed house; and the impact of foreclosure on the sales prices of nearby houses. Not surprisingly, declining housing prices are associated with increasing foreclosure rates; however, various other factors, such as a job loss or expected housing prices, can also play an important role. This review highlights various theoretical and econometric issues that have raised doubts about the accuracy of estimated price impacts of foreclosures and led to numerous refinements of the subsequent empirical analysis. Estimates of the own foreclosure discount generally range from near zero to 28 percent, with most estimates greater than 12 percent. Estimates of the discount resulting from spillover effects of nearby foreclosed houses are generally less than 2 percent and diminish rapidly with distance.","[Cohen, Jeffrey P.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Real Estate & Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Coughlin, Cletus C.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Yao, Vincent W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Real Estate, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University of Connecticut; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Cohen, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Real Estate & Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",,"Coughlin, Cletus/K-6860-2016","Coughlin, Cletus/0000-0002-8304-2796",,,,,76,9,10,0,6,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

This paper sets out from five major aspects including the policies, power, laws, governance and supervision and combines with the current situation of ecological environmental governance of our government based on the analysis of domestic and foreign research summary, from the aspects of dynamic mechanism, incentive mechanism, monitoring mechanism, execution mechanism and safeguard mechanism of ecological environmental governance to discuss the construction of the target system and long-term mechanism of ecological environmental governance of the government.","[Ding, Yu; Zou, Chengcheng] Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Literature Law & Econ, Wuhan 430065, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Science & Technology,"Ding, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Literature Law & Econ, Wuhan 430065, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-291-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,20,,,,,,228,231,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ8XD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000428893700052,0

Special attention will be paid to studies of regional economy because it created conditions for the development factors of the infrastructure of knowledge-based economy that include human capital, public institutions, which provide a high quality of life, education, fundamental science etc. Researches in the field of regional development have a long tradition and since the 2008s this field has grown significantly. The purpose of this article is the identification of advanced research in the field of the regional development on the basis of Russian and foreign experience. In this paper, we performed a comparative study in the field of regional development made by Russian scientists and the world scientific community in order to define perspective research fronts. Web of Science and Russian Science Citation Index were used as an information base. We used specific methods for comparative analysis of research fronts that include: (a) Cite Space for the definition and visualization of research fronts, (b) Google maps for visualization the connections of collaboration between scientists and (c) semantic analysis techniques for identifying areas of research in the field of regional economy made by Russian scientists. Our results showed that there are differences between research areas in Russia and other countries that are caused by the fundamentally different level of development. Most Russian studies confine oneself to vague generalities and problems of regional development; regional development factors are studied in them. But since 2008 publications on the development of information society began to emerge. The results of our study can be the basis of forecasting perspective directions of research. However, the methods of this paper require in-depth study and can be used to further improve government support of scientific research in Russia.","[Filimonova, Natalia] Vladimir State Univ, 79 Gorkogo St, Vladimir, Russia; [Fedosova, Raisa] Financial Univ, 49 Leningradsky Prospekt, Moscow, Russia; [Kheifits, Boris] Antique Arms LLC, 49 Leningradsky Prospekt, Moscow, Russia",Vladimir State University,"Filimonova, N (通讯作者)，Vladimir State Univ, 79 Gorkogo St, Vladimir, Russia.",natal_f@mail.ru; fed3670@yandex.ru; frn-professor@yandex.ru,"Filimonova, Natalia/AAL-3595-2021; Filimonova, Natalia/IVV-4266-2023; Filimonova, Natalia Mikhailovna/J-3577-2013",,,,,,20,0,0,0,10,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,548,559,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300045,0

It was introduced by the central government led by Indian National Congress (INC). While it's implementation is, in principle, based on demand for work from households, we investigate how political competition affects intra district allocation of funds under the scheme. Using longitudinal data on funds allocated to blocks and elections held for block councils, we find that greater amount of funds were allocated to blocks where INC had lower seat share. Further, we address the issue of endogeneity by focusing on a subsample of blocks where the aggregate vote share of INC was close to that of it's rivals. Our results suggest that 1.5 percentage point more funds were approved for blocks that had 1 percentage point lower seat share for INC. We also provide a mechanism for the effect by showing that the results are only true when the MP of the district, a member of the body that approves the block fund allocation, is from INC.

It represents the sum of micro-effects and constitutes a significant part of the aggregate output. The size the micro-effects are subject to the quality of managerial decision-making processes involving the qualified estimates of future expected profits. To meaningfully improve the estimates of future profits cannot be realized without respecting the following principles: Focus on the selection of significant variables according to the Pareto principle 80/20 when assessing the project (i.e. those variables that most affect the researched problem, hence the problem solution and outcome); Construction of the problem solution on the bases of a recursive function (i.e. a sequence of steps within the managerial calculus, by means of which partial solution steps are implemented); The case-based reasoning approach (i.e. a reflection of a sequence of steps implemented by a recursive function). The application of the above listed principles contributes to establishing an original and effective solution in terms of correctness, simplicity, transparency and credibility. To follow these principles requires knowledge of microeconomic laws, financial mathematics within managerial applications, as well as the ability to construct a solution from the bottom up (which unlike a solution from top to the bottom allows a tailor-made solution to the problem). It is recommended that managerial training includes the aforementioned skills. The evidence from collected surveys conducted at five academic institutions in the Czech Republic shows that the managerial seminars often focus on the from top to the bottom problem solutions (i.e., a model of a general formula that is adapted by an appropriate choice of parameters to a specific problem). In this way it bypasses the case-based reasoning approach, the principle of which lies in constructing the solution from the bottom up. The from top to the bottom problem solutions do not comply with requirements for the construction of a recursive function. As such, these solutions do not support the utilization of techniques commonly used in the process of selecting the best solution strategy. The aim of this paper is to discuss the above stated principles in support of improving managerial decisions, and to demonstrate these principles by means of a sample solution of a decision making process in the purchasing of technology items, as well as in the renewal process. The procedures are optimised based on the standard solution, which is subjected to a detailed discussion. The application of the Pareto principle is used to identify a parameter that is less significant and therefore neglected in the optimal solution. As shown, such a solution is more simple and clear without any significant detriment to the accuracy of the result.","[Haskova, Simona; Babulak, Eduard; Vochozka, Marek] Inst Technol & Business, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz; babulak@mail.vstecb.cz; vochozka@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019; Babulak, Eduard/C-2826-2017; Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814; Babulak, Eduard/0000-0003-2450-090X;",,,,,9,3,3,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,112,118,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300014,0

The EU member states have decided to punish Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and gradually take steps to reduce their dependence on Russian energy resources. Therefore, it is natural that Russia needs a new customer with favourable prospects for the future. On the other hand, in order to sustain the recent pace of economic growth, China needs to secure sufficient supplies of raw materials. More importantly, China's main interest when it comes to the enhancement of the energy cooperation with Russia, is the trade in natural gas. It has to be pointed out that this relationship is promising for the future of both, the Russian and the Chinese economy.

Starting from these assumptions, the purpose of this paper is to examine how the connection between knowledge management (KM) and innovation management has been developed in the last 10 years. In order to achieve our goal, an etic approach is employed which encompasses an external view of meaning associations and real-world events. The research combines the qualitative with the quantitative perspective and the whole multi-stage process is dominated by an inductive approach. The analysis focuses on 894 articles that were published in knowledge management and innovation journals, mostly indexed in Scopus and Thomson Reuters databases, during 2006 - 2016. The main results prove that there is a strong connection between KM and innovation management although the number of KM journals that approach topics related to innovation is higher than the number of innovation journals that focus on knowledge-related issues. The concept of innovation is by far the most used in the analyzed KM papers, while the term of knowledge is frequently used as a generic keyword in the Innovation papers; only a few papers are about a specific topic such as product development, project management, and process improvement - in the case of KM journals - or organizational learning, social capital, and human capital - in the case of Innovation journals. The research findings have both theoretical and practical implications. On the one hand, it synthesizes how the link between knowledge management and innovation management evolved in the last 10 years. On the other hand, it may serve as a handbook of managerial guidelines; it brings forward the knowledge management approaches and tools which can be used for product or process innovations.","[Leon, Ramona-Diana] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania; [Bolisani, Ettore] Univ Padua, 3 San Nicola, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; University of Padua,"Leon, RD (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",ramona.leon@facultateademanagement.ro; ettore.bolisani@unipd.it,"Leon, Ramona D./G-1091-2015","Leon, Ramona D./0000-0002-1448-0522",,,,,33,2,2,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,662,676,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300055,0

In addition, we take advantage of differences in trading technology across a sample of major international stock exchanges.

In this study, based on a game-theoretic analysis of discrete public goods, it is shown that pure excludability and pure non-excludability are equally inefficient, whereas the socially optimal level of excludability is a function of the benefits and costs of the knowledge investment, where it lies between the two extremes. This result illustrates the challenges and dangers of intellectual property rights policy. Allowing for voluntary R&D cooperation, the optimal level of excludability becomes an interval, typically between the two extremes. Thus, R&D cooperation can make intellectual property rights perform more efficiently and alleviate the problem of optimal policy design. This also demonstrates that knowledge commons can be provided efficiently through voluntary cooperation when imperfect property rights give partial excludability. Therefore, R&D cooperation and intellectual property rights should be considered as complementary rather than as separate and alternative policy measures.","[Leppaelae, Samuli] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Leppälä, S (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",leppalasm@cardiff.ac.uk,"Leppälä, Samuli/AAZ-3762-2021","Leppala, Samuli/0000-0002-1702-0417",OP-Pohjola Research Foundation,OP-Pohjola Research Foundation,"I am grateful for the generous and constructive comments from two anonymous referees.

This index measures the level of human development by not only GDP per capita but also trough the indicators of education and healthy life. The differences in the level of human development are observed not only at the national level, they are also measured at the regional level of countries. The aim of this article is, with the quantification of regional human development, to describe the potential for human development using cluster analysis at the regional level. The regions of the Visegrad Group Plus countries (the countries of Visegrad Group - Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the countries of Regional Partnership Agreement, Austria, and Slovenia) at NUTS II level were selected for this purpose. There are 46 regions on the NUTS II level eight in the Czech Republic, seven in Hungary, sixteen in Poland, nine in Austria, four in Slovakia and two in Slovenia. The research was made in the period from 2004 to 2013. In the selection of indicators, the same approaches as by the HDI were adopted; however, the components of each dimension were modified. Life expectancy at birth (dimension of health), tertiary educated people and lifelong learning (dimension of education) and GDP per capita in PPS (dimension of living standards) have been chosen as indicators of human development. These components were then used in a hierarchy cluster analysis in the Ward method. Three clusters were created with different levels of development potential (from below - average potential to above average one). Initially, a research hypothesis that there was a dynamization of human development processes in most regions has been set. Namely, it was assumed that more than half of monitored regions in the lower group of potential to human development would shift to the higher group. This hypothesis was not confirmed and it was found that a vast majority of the regions have not changed their positions in the cluster in the monitored period.","[Majerova, Ingrid; Nevima, Jan] Silesian Univ Opava, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Majerova, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",majerova@opf.slu.cz; nevima@opf.slu.cz,"Nevima, Jan/AAC-5530-2021; Majerova, Ingrid/AAJ-7666-2021; Majerová, Ingrid/AAA-6448-2021","Nevima, Jan/0000-0002-4788-9009; Majerová, Ingrid/0000-0002-0835-9128","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2016",,16,3,3,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,110,121,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300009,0

The purpose of this paper, drawing on the legal research method, is to discuss the following question: when using the transactional net margin, quite common in transfer pricing tax reporting, does the new Portuguese financial accounting system produce profit level indicators that are closer to the underlying reality that transfer pricing aims to capture, or are these profit level indicators of a lower quality than before? Our main conclusion is that the new accounting regime has a significant potential for increasing uncertainty and compliance costs in the area of transfer pricing, given the nature of operating income adopted in the new IAS based system.","[Martins, Antonio] Univ Coimbra, 165 Dias da Silva Av, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Martins, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, 165 Dias da Silva Av, Coimbra, Portugal.",amartins@fe.uc.pt,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,17,29,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300001,0

Innovative relationships between agricultural and industrial realities, processes of enhancement of typical local products, cultural and landscape heritage represent the hallmarks of these territories, which are grafted on a strong territorial identity based on reciprocity, trust, bonding with the history and local traditions. In this context, the slow territories often follow an original development process, by combining local traditions with cultural, social and technical innovation, allowing growth development paths no measurable through traditional indicators of growth. In this framework, the slow territories represent not only a model of local development but also a growth trajectory that combines economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental protection, with a view to sustainability. The distinctive characteristics of these territories appear so consistent with the changing characteristics of the tourism market that, especially in recent years, highlights the growth of a substantial segment of demand more aware and attentive to responsible, sustainable and experiential dimensions of the holiday.","[Pavione, Enrica; Pezzetti, Roberta] Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Pavione, E (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",enrica.pavione@uninsubria.it; roberta.pezzetti@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,7,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,1007,1014,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300084,0

Cities must meet these new requirements and make all the necessary changes in their own way of being, using what they have at hand - strategies successfully used in business environment.

The research reveals, on one hand, the moderate interest in innovation at the basic level of local administration in direct relation with the position of Romanian cities accordingly among other European cities.

The analysis shows that the indicators mostly considered as measures of external economic balance - current account and net foreign assets-have not much statistical significant impact on the risk of currency crisis. Much more important is a structure of foreign liabilities in terms of liquidity - a greater share of foreign direct investments on foreign liabilities and a lower share of short term foreign debt to total debt statistically significantly reduce the risk of crises. The risk significantly decreases also with higher trade openness, faster GDP growth and underestimation of nominal exchange rate with respect to the purchasing power parity.

We expect that the impact of selected determinants (by itself) will be weaker than when the determinants act in combination with each other. Methodology/methods Using survey of innovation activities in enterprises - Community Innovation Survey from 2010-2012 were analyse relationship between % of turnover in new or improved prod-ucts introduced (new to the market; R&D expenditures dependent variable) and selected determinants of inno-vation activities (cooperation, type of innovation, financing source, enterprise and subsidiaries; independent variables) by using own multiple linear regression models. Scientific aims Revealeation of variables combination with the greatest effect on innovation activities leading to the innovations creation is the second part of the goal. Findings We confirmed the impact of various financing sources. We conclude that public support achieved the greater effect only if it is well targeted; it is the individual support of the selected type of innovation. Positive effect can be further increased if the cooperation (targeted on creation of innovation) is supported by public funds. Likewise we show that cooperation may have a greater positive effect if it occurs during the formation of a certain innovation (and in combination with different entities - typically cooperation within/without universities). Conclusions An important implication arising from these results is that public policies to encourage the innovations creation should to be selective, should to be directed to selected sector and cooperation in the creation of a specific inno-vation have to be the aim. In this case, it is possible to record even the existence of knowledge spill-over effects mostly in knowledge networks.","[Prokop, Viktor; Stejskal, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Stejskal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic.",jan.stejskal@upce.cz,"Stejskal, Jan/S-7591-2017; Prokop, Viktor/ABG-1835-2022","Stejskal, Jan/0000-0003-3015-8274;",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic,Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This article was created as a part of the solution of the research task No. 14-02836S entitled Modelling of knowledge spill-over effects in the context of regional and local development, financially supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.",,37,0,0,1,5,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,603,611,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200075,0

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative-descriptive approach was applied to the study, and data collection was conducted through secondary sources. Findings - The analysis employed a competitiveness analysis model consisting of 11 competitiveness factors. The Chilean cluster presented a higher level of competitiveness in four competitiveness factors (scope of viable and relevant business, introduction of new technologies, balance with no privileged positions and oriented strategy), while the Brazilian cluster presented a higher level of competitiveness in three competitiveness factors (concentration, cooperation and replacement). For four of the competitiveness factors of the model, both clusters presented similar levels of competitiveness. Practical implications - By comparing the two wine clusters, it was possible to identify aspects that can be improved to increase competitiveness, especially in the Brazilian cluster. These aspects include, first, the need for bottle manufacturers in Serra Gaucha, which would have a positive impact on production costs; second, the expansion of the geographical indication registration for the entire Serra Gaucha region, resulting in an enhanced image of Brazilian wine abroad; and third, greater incentives for exports, which would result in an increase in market share. Originality/value - The paper proposes an explanation for the superior level of competitiveness of the Chilean cluster regarding the scope of viable and relevant business, balance with no privileged positions, introduction of new technologies and strategy focussed on cluster development. In terms of its contribution, the study developed additional metrics for the model adopted, which can be used for the competitive analysis of other agribusiness clusters.","[Sarturi, Greici; Augusto, Carlos; Vargas, Franca; Gama Boaventura, Joao Mauricio; dos Santos, Silvio Aparecido] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting FEA, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Boaventura, JMG (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting FEA, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",jboaventura@usp.br,"Sarturi, Greici/AAS-6036-2021; Boaventura, Joao Mauricio Gama/G-1679-2014","Boaventura, Joao Mauricio Gama/0000-0003-3070-2153; Sarturi, Greici/0000-0002-6670-7565",,,,,52,14,16,4,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

However, these projects have principally been driven by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies. Moreover, despite many pilots to include smallholders in high value-adding supply chains, scaling or scaling up successful pilots has so far proven elusive. The aim of the present article is to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) that can help F& A MNEs to design and implement sourcing strategies for sustainable smallholder supply from a business perspective, and to scale up successful pilot projects from a business perspective.","[Sjauw-Koen-Fa, August R.; Blok, Vincent; Omta, S.

Although the uses and gratifications theory was developed in relation to traditional media, as the use of social media has spread widely in society, recent studies applied the theoretical framework to new media. Reference communication and media studies advance the idea that each medium offers a different set of gratifications according to their features and characteristics. The uses and gratifications theory suggests that audiences actively seek out media through a goal-oriented approach in order to gratify theirtheir needs. Research regarding Facebook usage patterns shows that this social network is used primarily to maintain contact with others, to keep up-to-date on friends' activities, to learn more about someone or about social events. This paper focuses on identifying what drives individuals to use Facebook and what are the main usage patterns in the case of Romanian graduate students, as well as their perspectives on Facebook use and online image construction. The study is based on a qualitative research consisting of 21 in-depth interviews, conducted in January 2016 with master's students in the broad area of communication. The research questions guiding the analysis focused on Facebook use and types of gratifications, and on how much students engage in constructing an online image.","[Stefanita, Oana; Udrea, Georgiana; Buturoiu, Raluca; Corbu, Nicoleta] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Bvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Stefanita, O (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Bvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",oana.stefanita@comunicare.ro; georgiana.udrea@comunicare.ro; raluca.buturoiu@comunicare.ro; nicoleta.corbu@comunicare.ro,"Corbu, Nicoleta/AFN-5125-2022; Buturoiu, Raluca/ABF-2388-2020; Udrea, Georgiana/GNO-9419-2022","Corbu, Nicoleta/0000-0001-9606-9827; Buturoiu, Raluca/0000-0001-9841-0929;",,,,,41,0,0,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,630,640,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300052,0

The product development process engages mixed teams with personnel from design, engineering, manufacturing and marketing working in tandem at all times. Given the complexity of the information flows in such a process, value creation in product development is almost exclusively based on intangible resources. The successful management of intellectual capital has emerged as a key condition for effective organizational learning in the innovation process. Empirical research in the past has provided some evidence that a team leader's emotional intelligence impacts new product outcomes. Recent research however indicates that emotional intelligence at the individual team member level may contribute more to creativity in new product development. The objective of this paper is to present a pilot study to assess the way group member emotional competencies impact the success of the innovation process in the presence of moderating factor such as project complexity. In this context, 22 scientists and engineers were asked to work in small groups and tasked to develop a few innovative product and service concepts. The concepts presented were assessed both in terms of their perceived complexity and in terms of their presumed performance in the market. The data collected were then analyzed against the emotional intelligence makeup of the members of each group. The aggregation of the findings of this pilot study in a small number of classes was used to identify only major trends in the data. The moderating effect of project complexity on the relationship between emotional intelligence of the design group and success in product development projects was thus assessed in detail. The results of the pilot study indicate that emotional intelligence improves team interactions, facilitates the management of intellectual capital and does indeed affect innovation performance.","[Tsakalerou, Mariza] Nazarbayev Univ, Astana, Kazakhstan",Nazarbayev University,"Tsakalerou, M (通讯作者)，Nazarbayev Univ, Astana, Kazakhstan.",mariza.tsakalerou@nu.edu.kz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,294,299,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300036,0

Conservation ROI analysis quantitatively measures the costs, benefits, and risks of investments, which allows conservation organizations to rank or prioritize them. This article surveys the literature in this area. We organize our discussion around the way studies treat the core elements of ROI, which include the definition and measurement of the conservation objective, identification of relevant baselines, the types of conservation investments considered, and investment costs. We discuss the state of the art of ROI analysis, highlight some unresolved issues, and make suggestions for improvements. We also describe options for extending ROI analysis beyond biodiversity conservation, which is the typical objective. The literature indicates that conservation planning that uses ROI analysis can considerably alter the location and targets of conservation, lead to more protection and higher quality conservation outcomes, and result in significant savings. The measurement and prediction of baseline ecological conditions and threats remains a central challenge for conservation ROI analysis, as does accounting for landowner and developer responses to conservation investments. Another key priority for future research is the identification of ways to more comprehensively incorporate ecosystem services and multiple environmental objectives into the assessment framework.

A good example for this danger is the well-known study by Falk and Szech (Science, 2013), who conclude that markets erode moral values. If this were true, economists, who have emphasized the efficiency enhancing effects of markets for centuries, would have to reconsider their judgments fundamentally. In this note we demonstrate that the claim made by Falk and Szech is unfounded for at least four reasons and that their experimental results can be (and should be) interpreted, if anything, in the opposite way.

The introduction of the pension option not only mitigates longevity risk for workers but also provides a higher expected present value of old-age benefits to workers than the one-time benefit option (on average). Based on a lifecycle model with uncertain lifespan, we expect that workers will increase current consumption and reduce saving in response to this policy intervention. We use data from the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure in Taiwan to empirically test this prediction. In order to isolate other systematic structural changes or economic shocks from the true impact of the pension option on saving and consumption, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach in this study. Our results indicate that the implementation of pension benefits in LI lowers households' saving by 8.41 percent (NT$50,587) and raises consumption by 5.73 percent (NT$42,897) for LI workers. In addition, we find that, in general, households with less saving or consumption tend to be more responsive to this policy in terms of reducing saving or increasing consumption.","[Chen, Hua] Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Hsu, Wen-Yen] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Hsu, Wen-Yen] Natl Chengchi Univ, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, Coll Commerce, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Weiss, Mary A.] Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Feng Chia University; National Chengchi University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Hsu, WY (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 100 Wen Hwa Rd, Taichung 407, Taiwan.",wyhsu@fcu.edu.tw,,,Temple University,Temple University,"Hua Chen is at the Department of Risk, Insurance and Healthcare Management, Temple University, 1801 Fa, PA 19122.

First, we show that managerial ability is positively associated with innovative output. Second, we show that the positive association between managerial ability and innovative output is weaker for older CEOs and managers who stay in the same job for longer, suggesting a preference for a 'quiet life' by long serving CEOs. Third, we find that the equity market values patents generated by more able managers more positively, suggesting that equity holders deem better skilled managers more effective at converting innovative ideas into valuable new products. Finally, we show that managerial ability is positively associated with more 'radical' innovations, which are outside of the firm's knowledge base.

The stock price follows a stochastic volatility jump-diffusion process and the investor can have different levels of uncertainty about the diffusion parts of the stock and its volatility. We find strong evidence that the optimal exposures to stock and volatility risks are significantly affected by the ambiguity aversion to the corresponding risk factor only. We also show that volatility ambiguity has a smaller impact in incomplete markets. Investors who ignore jump risk/model uncertainty/derivatives always incur welfare losses. In our numerical example, the loss from neglecting model uncertainty can be almost as much as the loss from not trading the derivatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This is true even within-firm: tax increases that are later reversed nonetheless lead to permanent leverage increases.

A possible application would be an electricity transmission network operator whose actions can affect electricity prices. In a simple moral hazard model, first-best outcomes can be implemented by forcing the network operator to auction off forward contracts on the electricity price.

The results showed the importance of procedural factors, such as the consistency of objectives in policy packages, communication and marketing efforts, and the use of public referendums, and of contextual factors, including urban form, level of congestion, and functioning of public transport. Important lessons were drawn between the two cities, but primarily on how to design, rather than secure public acceptance for, a congestion tax scheme.

Using seven major jump tests, we show that separating jumps from diffusion improves volatility forecasting both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, we show that these statistical improvements can be translated into economic value. We find that a risk-averse investor can significantly improve her portfolio performance by incorporating realized jumps into a volatility timing based portfolio strategy.

The analysis presented here is observational, not causal, as it examines how the business activities affirms that chose to invert changed after expatriation. In addition to statistically assessing the equity market's reaction to inversion announcements, this paper examines how firms alter their patterns of employment and investment after inversion. In particular, the paper follows how the foreign shares of an inverting firm's employment and investment change following inversion, relative to comparable non-inverting firms. The behavior of inverting firms following expatriation is assessed going back to 1980 as well as only after the 2004 policy change, which made expatriation through merger with a foreign firm with substantive foreign business activities more attractive. The results suggest that inverting firms have higher shares of their employees and capital expenditures located abroad after inversion relative to changes experienced by similar non-inverting firms. Further, these increases are not attributable to one-time changes due to the inclusion of a new foreign partner's existing workforce and ongoing investments; foreign shares of employment and investment are higher two or more years after inversion relative to the first year after inversion when any one-time increases would occur.","[Rao, Nirupama S.] NYU, Robert F Wagner Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Rao, NS (通讯作者)，NYU, Robert F Wagner Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10012 USA.",nirupama.rao@nyu.edu,,,International Tax Policy Forum,International Tax Policy Forum,"I thank Emma Harvey for outstanding research assistance, and Itai Grinberg for helpful comments.

Over the 1997-2014 period, all provinces have made progress toward narrowing the gender wage gap, though notably little progress was made in Newfoundland and Alberta. Much of the variation across provinces in the gender gap is eliminated once we account for gender differences in individual and job characteristics in each province. Decomposition results suggest a large portion of the wage gap in each province is explained by gender differences in industry and occupation. The unexplained portion of the wage gap has been reduced in many provinces as gender differences in industry and occupation play an increasingly important role.","[Schirle, Tammy] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Schirle, T (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,,,Ontario's Pay Equity Commission,Ontario's Pay Equity Commission,This study benefitted from research funding provided by Ontario's Pay Equity Commission through the Gender Wage Gap Grant Program.

Advocates argue that PB can serve to educate citizens, increase transparency, and even improve living standards in the cities and towns that implement this form of public finance. However, we still know very little about how inclusive these processes are. This article asks: first, are participatory budgeting processes engaging women and men equally? Second, if gender exclusion is taking place, why? Finally, what can the development community do to begin to eradicate exclusion? Through the case study of participatory budgeting in Peru, the article documents that participatory budgeting in this country is not inclusive. Economic barriers, combined with the fact that women are expected to take on most domestic duties, make it very hard for women to actually attend meetings, especially in rural areas where poverty and patriarchy are more pronounced.

The measure is motivated by prior studies arguing that a mutual fund is skilled if it buys stocks with subsequent high earnings announcement returns. We find that this measure predicts future mutual fund returns. On average, after adjusting for Carhart's four risk factors, the top decile of mutual funds outperforms the bottom decile by 44 basis points per quarter. By decomposing fund alphas into two components in their relations to earnings, we find that this measure is only associated with earnings-related fund alphas. This measure can also be used to predict stock returns at future earnings announcements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We exploit longitudinal health expenditure data from 2005 to 2007 in Kunshan City, Jiangsu Province of China. We find a high concentration of low IHA balances at the end of life, with most equal to zero. This finding suggests that most IHA balances are used for health expenditures and that the income redistribution effect through the accumulation of IHA balance is limited. However, the results also show a wide variation in lifetime out-of-pocket spending in the form of deductibles and coinsurance, which implies serious inequality in individual financial burden that can lead to a large income redistribution effect.","[Gong, Guan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongmei] Univ Nebraska, Med Ctr, Coll Publ Hlth, Omaha, NE 68198 USA; [Xu, Lingli] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Medical Center; Shanghai University,"Gong, G (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",guan.gong@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71273162, 71301098]; Shanghai Municipal Education Commissionand Shanghai Education Development Foundation [11CG47]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Education Commissionand Shanghai Education Development Foundation(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)),"This study has benefited from support of the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71273162 and 71301098), and Chen Guang project (No. 11CG47) funded by Shanghai Municipal Education Commissionand Shanghai Education Development Foundation.",,13,1,1,1,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In particular, this paper shows that ETS firms with the smaller number of installations and with less trading experience were less likely to participate in the European emissions trading market and traded the lower quantities of permits. Furthermore, these firms chose to trade permits indirectly via third parties.

The optimal portfolio weights are obtained in quasi-closed form and the optimal consumption in closed form. To solve the optimisation problem, we show how to switch back and forth between the stochastic differential and standard exponentials of the Levy processes. We apply this procedure to both the Variance Gamma process and a Levy process whose arrival rate of jumps exponentially decreases with size. We show through a numerical example that when jumps, and therefore asymmetry and leptokurtosis, are suitably taken into account, then the optimal portfolio share of the risky asset is around half that obtained in the Gaussian framework.

The MV criterion shows that risk averters are indifferent from the oil spot and futures but risk seekers prefer to invest in oil futures to spot. The information drawn from the CAPM statistics does not lead to any preference between spot and futures prices. Our SD results reveal that risk-averse investors prefer the spot index, whereas risk seekers are attracted to the futures index to maximize expected utility, though not their expected wealth for the entire period as well as for the sub-period (pre-GFC) before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the sub-period during and after the GFC (GFC). To compare the performance of spot in pre-GFC and GFC sub-periods, we find that the 2008 GFC has no impact on the means, variances, and the CAPM statistics. In addition, our SD analysis reveals that spots from pre-GFC and GFC do not dominate each other, both risk averters and risk seekers are indifferent from the spots from pre-GFC and GFC, there is no arbitrage opportunity for spots before and after GFC, and the spot market is efficient to the GFC crisis. The same conclusion is drawn on the impact of the GFC on the futures. The findings in our paper could provide more information to academics, practitioners, and policy makers in their derision toward oil spot and futures markets as well as toward the impact of any financial crisis in the future.

Using INEGI's National Survey of Urban Employment for the period 1994-2004, the empirical analysis is conducted on two stages. In the first stage, individual wages are regressed on worker characteristics, job and firm attributes, informality and a set of federal entity and industry indicators. In the second stage, inter-industry wage differentials (derived from the coefficient estimates of the industry indicators) are regressed on trade and FDI variables. The main findings show that trade openness does not have a statistically significant effect on inter-industry wage differentials, whereas for the case of FDI, a positive nonlinear relationship is found to exist.

The elasticity of substitution is important for rural-urban migration in China, because there is a substantial difference in schooling quality between rural and urban regions and because there is imperfect competition in city labor markets. Using aggregate city-level data from the 2010 China Population Census, we find that the positive effect of human capital on city productivity improves as the substitutability increases. Moreover, a grid-search shows that the best estimate of the substitutability in China is between 2.1 and 2.5, far from being complete.","[Yu, Jixiang] Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Bengbu 233100, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jixiang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shen, Kunrong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Desu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Dept Finance & Insurance, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Anhui Science & Technology University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Liu, DS (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Dept Finance & Insurance, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",liudesu@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,8,10,2,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

With public information, households with low vacancy hazard rates pay lower rents and search in thicker rental markets. With private information, rentals are under-provided to long-duration households to discourage short-duration households from searching there. Ownership is attractive in part because it cures the private information problem. Using a novel data set of rental listings, we show that homeownership rates are high where rent-to-price ratios are low but rentals are scarce and that long-duration households sort into scarce rental markets.

We find that various contracting terms are more favorable for loans to supplier firms whose major customers have higher return on assets (ROA). More importantly, we find that the effect of major customers' earning performance on loan contracting terms is weaker for the borrowers with prior loan relationships with banks, while it is stronger for the borrowers that are highly dependent on their major customers. Our results suggest that banks take into account major customers' earnings performance when contracting with their supplier firms, and the informativeness of customer earnings varies with the nature and strength of the customer-supplier relationships.

This has led to the understanding that financial and banking supervision has to bethought of as a systemic task, focusing on the interdependent relations among the institutions. Using network theory, we develop a dynamic model that uses a bipartite network of banks and their assets to analyze the system's sensitivity to external shocks in individual asset classes and to evaluate the presence of features underlying the system that could lead to contagion. As a case study, we apply the model to stress test the Venezuelan banking system from 1998 to 2013. The introduced model was able to capture monthly changes in the structure of the system and the sensitivity of bank portfolios to different external shock scenarios and to identify systemic vulnerabilities and their time evolution.

Our study supports the assumption of conditional convergence among all EU Member States. It should take around 10 years for the EU-15 countries to stabilize their per capita emissions. This result holds if we include the new Member States in the sample. We also find that the emission growth/GDP relation is strictly negative, indicating that EU-15 countries switched to a less carbon intensive economy starting from the early 1990s. This result remains robust when the new Member States are included. We therefore argue that the decline in EU carbon emissions is a long-term trend and not a result of the economic crisis. We then discuss the effectiveness of climate and energy policies and the EU burden-sharing agreement. Some countries like Germany, Great Britain and France can meet their carbon targets without adopting more aggressive climate and energy policies by 2020. Other EU-15 Member States can reduce their domestic emissions beyond their targets if they adopt energy-efficient technologies. Most of the new Member States emit much less than their domestic targets even when per capita income and oil price increase.","[Benjamin, Catherine; Cadoret, Isabelle; Hubert, Marie-Helene] Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Hubert, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, 7 Pl Noche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",catherine.benjamin@univ-rennes1.fr; isabelle.cadoret@univ-rennes1.fr; marie-helene.hubert@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,14,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This paper investigates these distortions in the context of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, where activity level thresholds (ALTs) were introduced in Phase 3 to reduce the overallocation of free allowances to low-activity installations. Using installation-level data, we find evidence that cement producers indeed respond to such thresholds when confronted with low demand, by strategically adjusting output to obtain more free allocation. We estimate that in 2012, ALTs induced excess cement clinker production of 6.4 Mt (5% of total EU output), and in affected regions this further distorted trade patterns and reversed carbon intensity improvements. As intended, ALTs reduced free allocation by 4%; however, a linear scheme (output-based allocation) would have achieved a 32% reduction.","[Branger, Frederic] CIRED, AgroParistech ENGREF, F-75732 Paris, France; [Ponssard, Jean-Pierre] CNRS, Paris, France; [Ponssard, Jean-Pierre] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [Sartor, Oliver] IDDRI, Palaiseau, France; [Sato, Misato] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sato, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",branger@centre-cired.fr; jean-pierre.ponssard@polytechnique.edu; oliver.sartor@iddri.org; M.Sato1@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,36,17,20,1,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

After collecting data on relevant fiscal policy announcements, we perform an econometric comparative analysis between the three administrations that followed one another during the period 2009-2013. The results indicate that only fiscal policy announcements made by members of Monti's cabinet had a significant impact on the Italian spread. We argue that these findings may be partly explained by a credibility gap between Monti's technocratic administration and Berlusconi's and Letta's governments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In so doing we revisit the effect of direct democratic institutions on public policies. Particularly, we are interested whether the effect of upper-level (state) direct democratic institutions on lower-level expenditure varies with lower-level direct democracy. Empirically, we exploit the large institutional variation in the degree of direct democracy both for state (cantons) and local governments (municipalities) in Switzerland. Considering 119 municipalities belonging to 22 cantons for the period 1993-2007, we find that the cantonal fiscal referendum increases local spending for those municipalities without fiscal referenda, while this effect is significantly reduced for municipalities that also avail of referenda. This suggests that upper-level fiscal restraint can be undone by lower-level profligacy if direct-democratic control is limited to the upper level. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

(2013) in two new directions. First, the SHP approach is generalized from the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model of Cox (1975) to the jump to default extended CEV (JDCEV) framework of Carr and Linetsky (2006). For this purpose, the recovery value of the American-style down-and-in put is hedged through the one attached to a European-style plain-vanilla contract whereas for an up-and-in put it is necessary to use the recovery component of the corresponding European-style up-and-in option. Second, the SHP methodology is adapted from single to double barrier American-style knock-in options by matching the value of the hedging portfolio along both lower and upper barriers. Finally, and to benchmark the accuracy of the novel SHP pricing solutions, the optimal stopping approach of Nunes (2009) is also extended to price American-style double knock-in options under the JDCEV framework. Such extension highlights the relevant credit derivative component embedded in American-style knock-in equity puts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The earlier date corresponds to expansion of Rome to the Rhine and Danube. During the subsequent century Germanic governance institutions changed in a number of ways. In particular, (1) temporary military commanders elected from the nobility gave way to standing retinues under the leadership of professional commanders, (2) public assemblies met more frequently and regularly, (3) councils made up of nobility gained agenda control in the assemblies, and (4) these councils relinquished their control over the allocations of land. I account for these constitutional exchanges in light of Rome's encroachment. This encroachment brought new sources of wealth as well as constraints on the expansion of Germans into new lands.

A cross-country inquiry on globalisation, financialisation and employment at the industry level",REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Offshoring; Globalisation; Financialisation; Employment; Industry dynamics,SHAREHOLDER VALUE; MARKET,"Financialisation and globalisation have important implications for the functioning of economies and, in particular, for employment. However, their impact on labour market dynamics has not been sufficiently analysed. The aim of this article is to contribute to fill this gap in the literature with a cross-country analysis at the industry level. The authors identify four industry dynamics (Protection, Expansion, Escape from production and Decline with sunk costs) and explore the hypothesis that financialisation is a phenomenon mostly specific to mature developed economies. They provide an econometric analysis at the country and industry level of the relationship between globalisation, financialisation and employment over the period 1995-2009. They estimate a standard labour demand function in which they introduce financialisation as a demand shifter. They also propose a simple model to explain the financialisation phenomenon and provide a regression testing its prevalence, including regressions with an interaction term between offshoring and financialisation. Their result does not point out to a financial-led globalisation but shows that labour is impacted negatively through the financialisation observed in certain industries.","[Durand, Cedric] Univ Paris 13, Ethol & Sociobiol Lab, CNRS, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Durand, Cedric] Univ Paris 13, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Miroudot, Sebastien] OECD, Paris, France; [Miroudot, Sebastien] Grp Econ Mondiale Sc Po, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris 13; Universite Paris 13; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Durand, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Ethol & Sociobiol Lab, CNRS, CEPN, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",cdurand@ehess.fr,,"Durand, Cedric/0000-0002-1279-4966; Miroudot, Sebastien/0000-0003-3850-2754",,,,,39,7,7,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In a survey of more than 1000 French residents, we find substantial coherence and heterogeneity. We elicit pairwise preferences between three perturbations of age-and gender-specific survival curves: transient (reduce hazard for next 10 years), additive (reduce hazard in all future years by subtracting a constant), and proportional (reduce hazard in all future years by a common fraction). The preference order implied by these pairwise responses is transitive for 85% of respondents. The most common preference orders, accounting for more than half the respondents, are strict indifference, proportional. additive. transient, and the inverse of that ranking. These are consistent with globally risk-neutral, risk-seeking, and risk-averse preferences toward longevity, respectively. Choices between one of these scenarios and a latent version that provides no risk reduction for the first 10 or 20 years are consistent with these risk postures. The mean and median consumption-discount rates are 12 and 5% per year, respectively, and the average coefficient of relative risk aversion with respect to financial gambles is about 0.5. Preferences toward the time path of mortality-risk reduction are not strongly associated with individual characteristics, although respondents who are older or exhibit higher consumption-discount rates tend to exhibit less longevity-risk aversion.","[Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hammitt, James K.] Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA INRA, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Tuncel, Tuba] Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Tuncel, Tuba] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Tuncel, Tuba] Ctr Vieille Charite, EHESS, F-13002 Marseille, France",Harvard University; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Hammitt, JK (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, 718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jkh@harvard.edu,,,"INRA (the French National Institute for Agricultural Research); European Research Council under the European Community [230589]; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; ECOCEP (Economic Modeling for Climate-Energy Policy)","INRA (the French National Institute for Agricultural Research); European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; ECOCEP (Economic Modeling for Climate-Energy Policy)","We thank Mike Jones-Lee, Sue Chilton, Jytte Nielsen, Kip Viscusi, Rebecca McDonald, Henrik Andersson and other participants at the April 2014 Event in Honour of Emeritus Professor Michael W.

In this context, foreign trade companies must adapt their logistics strategies to the new customs system, a necessary condition in order to obtain competitive advantages. In an increasingly competitive global environment, best practices in the customs activity have a positive influence both on the international trade as well as on the consumer safety and protection. The results of implementing best practices are also found in rankings made by different institutions and international organisations regarding the competitiveness in logistics and ease in the development of foreign trade transactions. They mainly relate to reducing the time for the necessary clearance procedure and reducing the logistics costs by decreasing the number of physical and documentation checks, giving a priority treatment to consignments when they are selected for control, the possibility to choose the location for customs controls and less information to submit in summary declarations.","[Popa, Ioan; Belu, Mihaela Gabriela; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai; Marinoiu, Ana Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Belu, MG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",belumihaela@gmail.com,"Mihaela, Belu/HPE-6574-2023; Popa, Ioan/D-2816-2015; Belu, Mihaela/I-1104-2013; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/O-9071-2016","Belu, Mihaela/0000-0001-7631-6798; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/0000-0002-4559-3466",,,,,27,3,3,1,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17,40,,,,,1095,1107,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700017,0

Changes in capital only marginally affect liquidity when capital is available abundantly, but have a large effect when capital is scarce. In this paper, we confirm this relation within a regime-switching model using three broad measures of German bond market liquidity. We then analyze how the term structure of illiquidity premiums of German agency bonds is related to intermediaries' capital and foreign flows. Illiquidity premiums are related to both variables only in the stress regime. The effect of intermediaries' capital is most strongly pronounced at the short end of the term structure. In contrast, flows into and out of the illiquid bond market segment constitute a level effect as they are related to illiquidity premiums of all maturities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the importance and impact of green marketing, by using theoretical concepts and defining a set of research directions, the paper and the research conducted were focused on creating a matrix model for choosing the optimal green marketing strategy, oriented towards competitive advantage. The model is based on the correlation that can be established among the generic strategies of competitive advantage, the variables of extended marketing mix (7Ps) and the green marketing strategy matrix.

Particular attention was given to the nature of the population growth variable, i.e. whether it is an endogenous or exogenous variable. The goal of this paper is to position this discussion into a historical, empirical and institutional perspective in order to establish population as an important factor for socio-economic prosperity, mostly measured in terms of economic growth. Regardless of ambiguous empirical conclusions about the influence of population growth on economic growth, the political aspect is crucial. Population effect should not be measured only in terms of population growth, measured by the increase in the number of inhabitants. Population is an endogenous variable which is under the influence of culture, values, political processes and industrial structure.","[Skare, Marinko; Blazevic, Sanja] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr,"Blazevic Buric, Sanja/AAE-5792-2022; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",Croatian Science Foundation [9481],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

The identification restrictions on the sign of the contemporaneous responses of observable variables are derived from a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and robust to parameter uncertainty. I find that the variance of news shocks has decreased over time, contributing to the Great Moderation in real activity and inflation. The importance of news shocks is, however, modest compared to technology surprise and non-technology shocks.

To capture potential damages from an individual typhoon we use historical typhoon track data in conjunction with a detailed wind-field model. We then combine our damage proxy with satellite derived nightlight intensity data to construct a panel data set that allows us to estimate the impact of typhoons at a spatially highly disaggregated level (approx. 1 km). Our results show that typhoons have a negative and significant, but short-term, impact on local activity - a typhoon that is estimated to destroy 50% of the property reduces local economic activity by 20% for that year. Over our period of analysis (1992-2010) total net economic losses are estimated to be in the region of $US 28.34 billion. To assess the damage risk from future typhoons we use simulated probability distributions of typhoon occurrence and intensity and combine these with our estimated effects. Results suggest that expected annual losses are likely to be around $US 0.54 billion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Elliott, Robert J.

Fiscal transparency can also reduce uncertainty about fiscal policy and fiscal outturns by providing more information on the underlying fiscal position and fiscal risks. Both effects suggest that countries should benefit from adopting transparency enhancing policies through better market assessments of their sovereign risk. In this paper, we investigate whether fiscal transparency has an effect on market perceptions of sovereign risk, as measured by sovereign credit ratings, and if so, through which channels. We find that fiscal transparency has a positive and significant effect on ratings - one standard deviation increase in fiscal transparency increases credit ratings by 0.7 and 1 notches (or steps in the credit rating scale) in advanced and developing economies, respectively - but its effect works through different channels in advanced and developing economies. In advanced economies, fiscal transparency is associated with better fiscal outcomes, leading indirectly to higher credit ratings. In developing economies, the direct uncertainty-reducing effect of fiscal transparency seems to be more important. Indeed, the effect of fiscal transparency on fiscal performance is found to increase with the level of institutional development.","[Arbatli, Elif; Escolano, Julio] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC USA; [Arbatli, Elif; Escolano, Julio] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Arbatli, E (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",earbatli@imf.org; jescolano@imf.org,,,,,,,27,35,39,6,59,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

First, we document the existence of wide-spread herding in 41 countries (referred to as target countries hereafter) in the sample. We then examine the relation between contemporaneous institutional demand and future returns and find that institutional herding stabilizes prices. Next, we examine the relation between institutional investors' herding behavior and the level of information asymmetry in the target countries. We measure the degree of information asymmetry in each target country along five dimensions: (1) stock market development, (2) ease of access to information, (3) corporate transparency, (4) investor rights, and (5) macroeconomic factors that relate to the information environment. We find evidence that institutional investors herd more in markets characterized by low levels of information asymmetry (high level of information transparency). This result suggests that institutional investors' herding behavior is likely driven by correlated signals from fundamental information. Lastly, we show that price adjustment is faster in informationally transparent markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An increase in credit spreads of riskier relative to safer firms, in particular for firms with lower firm-level shareholder bargaining power, confirms a shift in bargaining power from bondholders to shareholders.

In contrast, an opposite trend is occurring in advanced economic countries (AEC), with cars replacing motorcycles as income grows. Motor vehicle crashes and injuries are an inevitable consequence of a high motorcycle population. This study focused on understanding how economic growth affects the motorcycle to passenger car (MPC) ownership ratio and what factors underlie this relationship. The data used in this analysis contained a sample of 80 countries at various levels of economic developmental growth over the 48-year period between 1963 and 2010. The results pointed to an inverted U-shaped relationship between the MPC ownership ratio and the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Generally, the MPC ownership ratio increased with income at a lower level and decreased with income at a higher level. The evidence indicated that urbanisation, the total road length per thousand population, and a proxy for purchasing power with regard to vehicle purchases were the underlying factors that contributed to this relationship.

We adopt a Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model where microstructure noise is interpreted as measurement error, and asynchronous trading as missing observations in an otherwise synchronous series. Missing observations are treated as any other parameter, as typical in a Bayesian framework. An augmented Gibbs algorithm is used since all full conditionals are available and its convergence and robustness are discussed. A realistic simulation study compares our estimator with existing alternatives, under different liquidity and microstructure noise conditions. The results suggest that our estimator is superior in terms of RMSE particularly under severe conditions, such as portfolios of assets with heterogeneous liquidity and high level of microstructure noise.

Personality traits mediate the effect of income on life satisfaction. The effect of neuroticism, which measures sensitivity to threat and punishment, is strong in both the British Household Panel Survey and the German Socioeconomic Panel. Neuroticism increases the usually observed concavity of the relationship: individuals with a higher neuroticism score enjoy extra income more than those with a lower score if they are poorer, and enjoy extra income less if they are richer. When the interaction between income and neuroticism is introduced, income does not have a significant effect on its own. To interpret the results, we present a simple model based on Prospect Theory, where we assume that: (i) life satisfaction is dependent on the gap between aspired and realized income, and this is modulated by neuroticism and (ii) income increases in aspirations with a slope less than unity, so that the gap between aspired and realized income increases with aspirations. From the estimation of this model we argue that poorer individuals tend to over-shoot in their aspirations, while the rich tend to under-shoot. The estimation of the model also shows a substantial effect of traits on income. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the study is to examine in detail the argument that logistics sprawls increase truck trip distances, and thus would incur negative impacts to the society. We found that between 1980 and 2003, logistics facilities in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area have migrated outward, albeit in a much smaller scale than the cases documented in some U.S. and European cities. Our analysis of the shipment data confirms that logistics sprawl increases truck travel. Furthermore, we found that, regardless of their age, logistics facilities tend to increase shipping distances as their distances to the urban center increase, due to the spatial mismatch between the locations of the facilities and the shipment origins and destinations. The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive efforts to coordinate land use, not only for logistics facilities but also other businesses that generate freight movements.

We use randomly generated municipal audit reports with objective measures of corruption from Brazil to assess whether new information about corruption affects municipal property tax collection and the structure of fiscal institutions. We find short-run effects consistent with this theory: property tax revenue rises with clean audit reports and falls as revealed corruption increases; furthermore revealed corruption increases the probability that a municipality adopts participatory budgeting.

In this paper, we propose a new plot we call the eigenvalue plot which can be seen as a generalization of the Hill plot. The theory behind the plot is based on a heavy-tailed parametric distribution class called the scaled Log phase-type (LogPH) distributions, a generalization of the ordinary LogPH distribution class which was previously used to model insurance claims data. We show that its tail property and moment condition are well aligned with EVT. Based on our findings, we construct the eigenvalue plot from fitting a shifted PH distribution to the excess log data with a minimal phase size. Through various numerical examples we illustrate and compare our method against the Hill plot. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Kim, Joseph H.

In doing so, we employed a novel empirical technique i.e. the general to specific (GETS) method of Hendry (1995) to estimate the cointegrating equation and dynamic adjustments in panel data. Using the classical fixed and random effects estimators, we estimate the long- and short-run effects in the same model and we show that it is possible to estimate the lagged adjustment process. The procedure used is general enough to allow for the presence of endogeneity, heteroscedasticity, serial correlation and cross-sectional dependence in the residuals. Our findings show that the estimate of saving retention has declined and the speed of adjustment has increased in the post-integration period, implying that the international mobility of capital has increased in these countries. Moreover, our findings reveal that regional integrations stimulate financial intermediation, which in turn, improves real productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, an imperfectly informed LOLR causes allocational inefficiencies in the investment decisions of smaller banks but mitigates the moral hazard problem in larger banks due to the constructive ambiguity nature of bail-outs when the LOLR's information set is noisy. Policy implications include stricter supervision for smaller banks, and buffer requirements complemented with liquidity provision at penalty rates for larger banks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It develops a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which banks operate subject to agency problems and funding liquidity risk in their intermediation activity. Importantly, the amount of liquidity reserves held in the financial sector is determined endogenously: Balance sheet constraints force banks to trade off insurance against funding outflows with loan scale. A financial crisis, simulated as an abrupt decline in the collateral value of bank assets, triggers a flight to liquidity, which strongly amplifies the initial shock and induces credit crunch dynamics sharing key features with the Great Recession. The paper thus develops a new balance sheet channel of shock transmission that works through the composition of banks' asset portfolios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

On a sample of 164 economies for 1963-2009, our analysis confirms NSE propositions that the type of development policies, as captured by the Technology Choice Index (TCI), has a significant effect on long-term growth. However, this differs for TEs as a whole and its subgroups. Further to this, using a sample of 94 countries for 1985-2009, we provide a first empirical test of the relationship between growth, TCI and financial structure distortions and we show that there is a negative relationship between financial distortions and TCI on the one hand and medium-term growth on the other hand. We also find that the negative effect of a higher ratio of TCI on medium-term growth is partly mitigated, although not eliminated, by moderate level of financial sector distortions. This points towards some positive externalities of simultaneous financial and industrial sector distortions, at least in the medium run. However, TEs are shown to differ from the rest of the sample as financial distortions play a more pronounced direct negative effect on medium-term growth in these countries.","[Bruno, Randolph Luca; Douarin, Elodie; Korosteleva, Julia; Radosevic, Slavo] UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Radosevic, S (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies, London, England.",s.radosevic@ucl.ac.uk,"Radosevic, Slavo/AAH-6516-2019; Bruno, Randolph Luca/I-3301-2019; Douarin, Elodie/AAF-9967-2020; Korosteleva, Julia/ABB-9376-2021","Radosevic, Slavo/0000-0001-7905-2281; Bruno, Randolph Luca/0000-0002-3436-5046; Douarin, Elodie/0000-0003-3915-0420;",,,,,40,14,14,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Overall, the best model, which is conditional on the form of heterogeneity, is a form of Rank Dependent Utility or Prospect Theory that captures most behaviour at the representative agent and individual level. However, the curvature of the probability weighting function for many individuals is S-shaped, or ostensibly concave or convex rather than the inverse S-shape commonly employed. Also contextual utility is broadly supported across all levels of heterogeneity.

This paper refers to the overall literature on participation and provides the design, test and ex-post evaluation of a deliberative-participative procedure (DPP) aimed at selecting a new scheme for the regulation of traffic and parking in the Murat, a central area of Bad (Italy). The potential benefits and shortcomings of participation were explicitly considered when designing a DPP which integrates three tools: an opinion poll and two deliberative arenas - the stakeholder dialogue and the citizens' jury. The ex-post evaluation of the test confirmed ex-ante design choices. The DPP was effective and learning was generated: the use of understandable techniques for deliberation and assessment helped participants to generate an unambiguous final result which was based on the hybridisation of the alternative schemes proposed to the participants at the beginning of the procedure. The last word given to the citizens' jury avoided that the most powerful stakeholders may capture the DPP. Only a frustration effect was clearly generated because of the limited involvement of the Municipality of Bad, thus confirming that the involvement of the relevant Authority is an essential requisite for successful participation. We suggest that the generation of new knowledge and learning could be further assured by the participation of citizens and stakeholders to the definition of the alternatives they will assess later.

The deposit refund system for recycling in Delhi provides a discount to consumers on purchasing new batteries and returning used batteries to retailers for recycling. The retailers determine whether batteries are recycled in an environmentally friendly or unfriendly manner by selling them to manufacturers or to unorganized scrap dealers who then sell to unregistered smelters. This study finds that the economic instrument that brings used batteries into recycling works well. Organized recycling is limited, since retailers prefer selling used batteries to the informal sector because of higher prices, lower storage costs and taxes. In addition, we consider policy instruments like a green tax on batteries with a refund when the manufacturer ensures environment-friendly recycling and fiscal incentives to organized smelters to increase production.","Univ Delhi, Dept Business Econ, New Delhi 110021, India",University of Delhi,"Gupt, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Dept Business Econ, South Campus,Benito Juarez Marg, New Delhi 110021, India.",ygupt@yahoo.com,"Gupt, Yamini/GOK-2612-2022",,South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),"The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE).

The Ostroms used the abstract methods and language of public choice theory, but their appreciation of human capability and self-governing kept them solidly grounded in real world decision-making. This belief led to their rich analytic approach to understanding human institutional design, which combined theoretical analysis, laboratory experiments, and empirical fieldwork. This essay identifies the major themes that formed the Bloomington School-the importance of constitutional design and self-governance, federalism and polycentric orders, the challenge of institutional design to solve social dilemmas, the importance of using multiple approaches (analytic, laboratory experiments, and careful field work) to understand important social problems., and a personal examination of the Ostrom's lasting impact for public choice and public policy. Lin's and Vincent's lives and their academic careers came together to create their significant contributions.

In principle, the insurance premiums collected by PBGC should be sufficient to cover potential losses; this would ensure that PBGC could pay the insured benefits of terminated pension plan without additional external funding (e.g., from taxpayers). Therefore, the risk exposure of the PBGC from insuring DB pension plans arises from the probability of the employer insolvencies; and the terminating plans' funding status (the excess of the value of the insured plan liabilities over the plan assets). Here we explore only the second component, namely the impact of plan underfunding for the operation of the PBGC. When a DB plan is fully funded, the PBGC's risk exposure for an ongoing plan is low even if the plan sponsor becomes insolvent. Thus the questions most pertinent to the PBGC are: what key risk factors can produce underfunding in a DB plan, and how can these risk factors be quantified? We discuss the key risk factors that produce DB pension underfunding, namely, investment risk and liability risk. These are interrelated and must be considered simultaneously in order to quantify the risk exposure of a DB pension plan. We propose that an integrated risk management model (an Integrated Asset/Liability Model) can help better understand DB pension plan funding risk. We also examine the Pension Insurance Modeling System developed by the PBGC in terms of its own use of some of the building blocks of an integrated risk management model.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Chair Investment Portfolio Management & Pens Fina, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Maurer, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Chair Investment Portfolio Management & Pens Fina, Frankfurt, Germany.",maurer@finance.uni-frankfurt.de,,,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at The Wharton School,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at The Wharton School,"The research reported herein was pursuant to a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); the author also acknowledges support from The Pension Research Council at The Wharton School and helpful comments from Olivia S.

If a present government expects its successor to value the social costs of fuel usage differently, this adds a strategic component to its investment considerations. We analyze this governmental time-inconsistency situation as a sequential game. In particular, we show how the expectation of a more conservative party taking over makes a green government choose an investment level that is inefficient, in that neither of the parties would prefer it to the investment level of a permanent green government. Under some circumstances, the opposition would even prefer the government definitely to stay in power: The gain from avoiding a strategic investment then outweighs the loss of not being able to regulate energy consumption. We also analyze the welfare gains from binding agreements.","Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Voss, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",achim.voss@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,"Voss, Achim/0000-0002-3852-020X",,,,,29,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This article investigates the impact of a beneficiary feedback mechanism (ParFARM) on the performance of a farmers' field school project in the Philippines. A participatory feed-back module was randomly allocated to farmer field schools and its impact was observed on a series of outcomes. We find that ParFARM increases farmers' motivation and improves project performance as measured by farmers' agricultural knowledge and practices. The intervention, however, does not, within the context of a one-year treatment, increase agricultural yields. Unlike much of the impact literature focusing on the comparison of groups with and without the intervention, we analyse impact over the entire intensity of treatment and we find that the impact of ParFARM increases with the number of farmer field school sessions attended. Our results suggest that farmer field school interventions can be made more participatory and that this can increase their effectiveness.","[Masset, Edoardo; Haddad, Lawrence] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Masset, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",e.masset@ids.ac.uk,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through ALINe project,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through ALINe project,"We would like to thank the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for their funding of this study through the ALINe project.

But domestic corporate listings on stock markets have been abysmal. This study examines the reasons behind the low patronage of stock markets by domestic firms in SSA using Ghana as a case study. Data for the study was obtained from 110 out of the 200 largest firms in Ghana and included firms which were listed on the stock market and unlisted firms over three time-periods from 2002 to 2009. The findings show that knowledge about stock market dynamics and financial institutions' support encourages listing on the stock market. However, extensive information and disclosure costs requirements, and loss of ownership and control discourage listing on the stock market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our empirical results indicate that the model-free implied volatility index of the KOSPI 200 (VKOSPI) does not greatly enhance the performance of suggested VaR models, compared with other Volatility forecasting models, especially during and after the recent financial crisis. Furthermore, under the VaR framework, the VKOSPI does not perform better than Black-Scholes (BS) implied volatilities in measuring market risk. We also find that before the financial crisis, the BS implied volatility of out-of-the-money (OTM) options yields a better performance of the VaR models than the BS implied volatility of at-the-money (ATM) options. However, during and after the crisis, the VaR models incorporating the BS ATM implied volatility outperform the VaR models incorporating the BS OTM implied volatility. Our additional analyses show that combining with an extended GJR-GARCH model, which captures the asymmetric volatility effect, improves the overall performance of VaR models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from a system of equations using a large panel data set of European subsidiaries by and large supports the profit-shifting hypothesis. We find that a 10-percentage-point decrease in the tax rate increases posttax profitability by up to 0.6 percentage points, with a larger direct tax effect. Further, our results suggest that financial profits and losses are particularly responsive to taxes, which indicates that a large part of profit shifting takes place via debt shifting.","[Loretz, Simon] Univ Bayreuth, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Loretz, Simon] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Mokkas, Socrates] Deloitte LLP Econ Consulting, London EC4A 3BQ, England; [Mokkas, Socrates] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, London EC4A 3BQ, England",University of Bayreuth; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; University of Oxford,"Loretz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",simon.loretz@uni-bayreuth.de; smokkas@deloitte.co.uk,"Loretz, Simon/AAE-5830-2020","Loretz, Simon/0000-0002-7117-1531",,,,,33,11,11,1,13,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2015,71,1,,,,,1,36,,10.1628/001522115X14206439673251,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CH2MJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353859000001,0

While trade openness emerges as more important for developing countries, financial openness is more important for advanced economies.

Open source software (OSS) is developed by communities of programmers and users, usually sponsored by private firms, is available in the public domain and redistributed for free. We present a model of open and closed source software competition in a differentiated oligopoly of hardware-software bundles. Hardware and software are complement goods and OSS is financed by hardware firms. Results are several. Hardware firms contribute to the development of open source, although the level of contribution is not socially optimal. OSS availability has a positive impact on hardware firms' profits and prices, whereas the closed source producer is harmed by OSS competition. Furthermore, we analyze under what circumstances hardware firms have incentives in investing in OS projects. The model can explain the increasing participation in OS projects of several embedded device producers and server producers. Although we focus on hardware, this model can be generalized to a wide range of complementary goods and services, such as IT training, web hosting, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) consultancy services.","[Di Gaetano, Luigi] Italian Competit Author, Autor Garante Concorrenza & Mercato, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Di Gaetano, Luigi] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Di Gaetano, L (通讯作者)，Italian Competit Author, Autor Garante Concorrenza & Mercato, Piazza Verdi 6A, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",luigi.digaetano.10@ucl.ac.uk,,"Di Gaetano, Luigi/0000-0002-8532-1510",,,,,30,3,4,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

While continuing research on country logistics assessment generates some of this information, its relevance for the decision makers, and relationship to their unpredictability from foreign national logistics systems remains indefinite. This paper identifies and categorises the relevant, available information on country logistics environments by using a content analysis approach. We demonstrate the immensity and nature of this information, are able to confirm the changing spatial transaction cost structures, and to reflect upon the overall conditions of information-related complexity and globalisation in the environment. Besides making a contribution to the further development of the spatial impedance factors and measures that form the basis for decision maker unpredictability, the paper offers an alternative approach for measuring the importance of transportation costs in industrial location, and offers a useful lens to distinguish between the emerging literatures on national logistics systems. Finally the paper also offers practical implications on location attractiveness for investment promotion agencies and other public sector agencies for business development and cluster growth.

Dark pools allow some traders to bypass existing limit order queues with minimal price improvement. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that spread constraints significantly weaken exchanges' competitiveness. As more orders migrate to dark pools, the probability of subsequent order execution there increases, raising liquidity. The ability to circumvent time priority of displayed limit orders is one cause of the rapid rise in US equity market fragmentation. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that sales fees make the investment decision partially irreversible. Under these circumstances investors await for a stronger signal of managerial ability before committing to a new fund. This stronger signal can take the form of a particularly strong performance or a particularly long series of positive performance realizations. Looking at pairs of fund shares with the same portfolio but different sales fee arrangements we show that investment flows in share classes with front loads react disproportionally to good performances (higher convexity in the flow-performance relationship) and react to performance realizations further back in time (longer memory).

In middle-income countries, however, the migration of skilled workers becomes the more important factor in economic progress. Evaluating the skill content of migration patterns therefore is essential to understanding migration's economic implications. For this purpose, we investigate the determinants of skilled and unskilled migration decisions in Vietnam. Rural higher education is shown to promote knowledge-intensive production by encouraging skilled individuals to migrate to cities. In complementary fashion, commercial farm development helps alleviate urban overcrowding by encouraging unskilled individuals to remain at home. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixteen years on from its creation, the Retirement Savings System (SAR) has had favourable macroeconomic effects for Mexico, as it has significantly increased financial savings and encouraged the development of local financial markets. However, the employment and pension coverage has not developed as hoped, due to the high rate of informality in the labour market. In addition, the replacement rates (RR) forecast for old-age pensions from the defined-contribution scheme will be low, due to problems exogenous to the pension system, such as low contribution rates and low contribution densities. The main objective of this study is to develop a macroeconomic and actuarial projection model to simulate the expected coverage and RR for the period 2012-2050, within the framework of a demographic and economic forecast that will allow a detailed diagnosis of the current conditions of the pension system. The results reveal the unpromising scenario that the pension system has and will continue to have in the long term, with limited improvements in coverage rates. The possibility of obtaining adequate pensions will be restricted to those who have socioeconomic conditions with a long employment history, who can thus make contributions to their individual accounts. Taking into account this baseline projection scenario, we simulate the expected effects of applying a set of proposals with the aim of tackling the main problems, such as the low coverage, low RR, and low level of participation by young people in the system.","[Alonso, Javier; Hoyo, Carmen; Tuesta, David] BBVA Res, Madrid, Spain; [Tuesta, David] Univ San Martin de Porres, Ctr Competitividad & Desarrollo, Lima, Peru",Universidad de San Martin de Porres,"Alonso, J (通讯作者)，BBVA Res, Madrid, Spain.",javier.alonso.meseguer@bbva.com; consuelodelc.hoyo@bbva.com; david.tuesta@bbva.com,,,,,,,27,6,12,2,48,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

In the US, the UK, and Japan the centerpiece of these non-standard measures has been large-scale purchases of financial assets, also known as quantitative easing (QE). Purchases of financial assets financed by central bank money increase liquidity and push up asset prices, as those who have sold assets to the central bank rebalance their portfolios into riskier assets. This, then, stimulates expenditure by increasing wealth and lowering borrowing costs for households and companies. The sharply appreciation process of US dollar against euro and other currencies, has an implication on asset allocation, GDP growth, international business flow and profit distribution. The paper deals with the analyses and influence of applied monetary policies to global economy development, asset prices and reallocation trends, the currency movements and predictions.

One of the highest growth rates, along with a significant share in the national output, can be found in the Central Black Soil Region, which is one of the main agricultural regions of Russia. The question arises whether this change is a temporary occurrence or whether a fundamental shift in cropping patterns lies ahead. To answer this question, possible reasons for such a shift in the production pattern have been investigated. To collect the data a survey was conducted among farmers in the Voronezh region. Findings revealed mostly economic reasons of the agricultural pattern change. Additional reasons for the crop pattern shift are the existence of necessary infrastructure. However, future plans for discussed crops depend heavily on the market situation and decisions about current rotation are revised by farmers every year. In comparison to corn, the likelihood to extend the soybean acreage is higher in this region due to the lower production cost.","[Chetvertakov, Sergey] Inst Betriebswirtschaft, Thunen Inst, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Chetvertakov, S (通讯作者)，Inst Betriebswirtschaft, Thunen Inst, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",sergey.chetvertakov@ti.bund.de,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,199,207,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600021,0

They may also interact with various other policies, such as monetary and microprudential, raising coordination issues. Countries, especially emerging markets, have used these tools, and analyses suggest that some of those tools reduce procyclicality and crisis risks. Yet, much remains to be studied, including the costs of such tools, as they may adversely affect resource allocations; how best to adapt these tools to a country's circumstances; and preferred institutional designs, including how to address political economy risks.

Job satisfaction is correlated with labor market behavior demonstrated through productivity. The data set survey of 2000 employees is used to investigate the job satisfaction in the FYROM. Due to the lack of data from the State Statistical Office or other relevant institutions, we carry out a survey which involves interviews with employees and covers the entire region of the country. Ordered probit model is employed to measure the relationships of job satisfaction to a variety of individual and job-related characteristics. The results show that employees with good education, wage level satisfaction, good work conditions, career and secure job, as well as longer experience are more satisfied with their jobs than those who are less educated, wage level dissatisfied, have bad work conditions, not so successful career and job security and shorter experience. Contrary to previous studies, the skills management does not have any effect on job satisfaction, no matter whether it is bad or good. Furthermore, good relationships of the employees with the management, with consumers and with friends show positive impact on job satisfaction compared to those who have bad relationships. This result is in line with the previous literature from the field. Other results also conform to those found in the literature, such as women being more satisfied than men. These results may be useful to policy makers both at the public and private sector and employers in general. The study has some limitations with possibility to include social relations such as volunteering, meeting with friends, visiting relatives and religious institutions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The study further finds evidence of a limited cross-exciting behavior, with significant relationships between jumps in USD/JPY and the future jump intensity in USD/CHF, as well as between jumps in USD/CHF and the future jump intensity of EUR/USD.
