Despite this growth premium, the patterns of employment and wage polarization that characterize the nation are also apparent in Texas. The share of middle-wage jobs has declined while the shares of low- and high-wage jobs are increasing. Looking at Texas by decade, the 1990s stand out as a period when the highest-wage jobs grew the fastest. This trend was disrupted by the Great Recession, which erased most of the relative employment gains at the top of the wage distribution in both Texas and the nation. Consistent with the job polarization, cross-industry wages have grown more disparate over time, with more interindustry wage inequality in 2012 than in 1979.","[LoPalo, Melissa] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Reg Grp, Dallas, TX USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Southern Methodist Univ, Tower Ctr Polit Studies, Dallas, TX USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Baylor Univ, Execut MBA Program, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Orrenius, Pia M.] Council Econ Advisers, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Southern Methodist University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; Baylor University,"LoPalo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN,LONDON,"4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-53017-2; 978-1-137-53016-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,91,105,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ5BN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000598368600006,0

This paper shows that financial integration, fostered by securitization and nationwide branching, amplified the positive effect of housing price shocks on the economy during the 1994-2006 period. We exploit variation in credit supply subsidies across local markets from government-sponsored enterprises to measure housing price changes unrelated to fundamentals. Using this instrument, we find that house price shocks spur economic growth. The effect is larger in localities more financially integrated, through both secondary loan market and bank branch networks. Financial integration thus raised the effect of collateral shocks on local economies, increasing economic volatility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Southern Africa has suffered continued hunger despite a myriad of technological interventions that have been introduced in agriculture to address issues of food security, as well as poverty alleviation. IAR4D is a new approach that was recently introduced by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa through the sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme as an alternative strategy to address the challenges that the conventional Agricultural Research and Development (ARD) approach has been facing. Data for this article has been derived from two sources: baseline and endline surveys of the sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme that were implemented in southern Africa.The findings of the study showed reduced food insecurity in the intervention sites when compared with counterfactual (clean and conventional) sites. This is a clear evidence that IAR4D has had some impact, as food insecurity has been reduced in the intervention villages where the programme was implemented, unlike the control villages where the programme was not implemented. The results also show that IAR4D has improved the quality of food dietary diversity and smallholders' coping strategies when compared with control sites. However, these results are not robust across sites. Given the positive impact, this article recommends the adoption of IAR4D over ARD as an alternative approach to addressing household food security by increasing agricultural production.","[Mango, Nelson; Makate, Clifton] Ctr Int Agr Trop, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Nyikahadzoi, Kefasi] Univ Zimbabwe, Sch Social Work, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Dunjana, Nothando] Univ Zimbabwe, Marondera Coll Agr Sci & Technol, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Siziba, Shephard] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Agr Econ, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Zimbabwe; University of Zimbabwe; University of Zimbabwe,"Mango, N (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Agr Trop, Harare, Zimbabwe.",n.mango@cgiar.org; knyika@gmail.com; ruumakate@gmail.com; ntandodunjana@yahoo.com; s.siziba@hotmail.com,"Makate, Clifton/GWV-1821-2022; Makate, Clifton/ACV-8483-2022","Makate, Clifton/0000-0002-6061-6638; Dunjana, Nothando/0000-0001-7367-969X",Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA); International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA); International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT),The authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance received from the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) that was used in carrying out this study.

The main paradigm of agriculture has been also gradually reshaped. In the context of the Common Agricultural Policy food production as the main driving force of agriculture is being gradually replaced by post-productionist approach to agriculture. A demonstration of the above mentioned shift includes non-agricultural activities of farmers, growing of energy crops or processing of agricultural production into energies (biogas stations). Nowadays the direction of agriculture should be generally linked more to the requirements for sustainable rural development. The aim of this contribution is to follow how this change is reflected in changes of agricultural labour force before and after EU accession. Population in the Czech Republic engaged in agriculture was analysed on the basis of two agricultural censuses (Agrocensus 2000 and 2010) and basic attention was paid to the regional specifics of agricultural labour force changes. The development of age structure of the farmers in the districts of the Czech Republic (77 units) has been evaluated and basic trends for future have been identified. Changes of agricultural labour force have been also assessed in the context of the quality of natural conditions for agriculture. Widespread dynamic worsening of age structure of farmers and intensive decrease of the number of farmers in areas with average agricultural natural conditions were all found out as the main results of analyses.","[Martinat, Stanislav] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic; [Klusacek, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava; Mendel University in Brno,"Martinát, S (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",martinat@opf.slu.cz; petr.klusacek@mendelu.cz,"Martinat, Stanislav/H-9974-2013; Klusacek, Petr/B-9253-2012","Martinat, Stanislav/0000-0003-4060-2009; Klusacek, Petr/0000-0001-9391-1126",,,,,21,2,2,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,550,560,,,,,,11,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300058,0

Based on data provided by the National Forest Administration - Romsilva and NIS - National Institute of Statistics, there appears a contradiction: Romania reports an area of forest larger than 10 years ago, although illegal logging increased year by year. The diagnosis analysis of forest in Romania is performed by comparison to the forest in Austria. Austria was chosen because it is a country with a strong wood processing industry, while being a country with a substantial growth forest. Article aims to demonstrate the importance and contribution of the woodworking industry in Romania's exports, which proved to be positive even during the economic crisis of recent years. The conclusion is that the rational exploitation of forest bring benefits, if and only if the environment is a priority concern for the government, is effective on the medium and long term and development is sustainable through an integrated nationwide reforestation.

Also, we will highlight the determinants of banks cost efficiency. Our analysis is important because, the efficiency of commercial banks became essential for banks stability. The results showed that a high macroeconomic stability supports the efficiency of commercial banks. Also, banks which undertake higher risks are more inefficient. Therefore, banks with less liquidity, with a lower solvency rate and a higher credit risk are more inefficient than more cautious credit institutions. By analyzing the evolution of the cost index, we have noticed that the banks from all the banking systems included in our study managed to increase the level of efficiency until 2008. The year 2009 brought upon it a decrease of the efficiency for the banks from Poland, Romania, Russia and Hungary. At the same time, for the banks from Bulgaria and the Czech Republic we can notice a stagnation of the efficiency index. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Generally, charities have to depend on individual donors and less on the government for fundraising in order to survive in the competition. As charities need to depend on individual donor, it is compulsory to study on the individual donor characteristics which can help to identify and describe recognizably the individual donor features. Furthermore, in Malaysia, there are limited studies on the characteristics of individual donor. Thus, this study aims is to investigate the characteristics of Malaysian charitable donors and the study followed the study on donor characteristics in Britain, Australia, Brunei and Pakistan to develop a better understanding of Malaysian donor's extrinsic determinants (demographic determinants and socio-demographic determinants) and intrinsic determinants (psychographic determinants). Data is collected from the individual donors in the Central Region of Malaysia that consist of Selangor, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Negeri Sembilan and Melaka. To measure the results, factor analysis is used in the development and evaluation of test and scale. Later, logistic regression is used to analyse the relationship between variables. It is basically used when dependent variables is categorical (donor/non-donor). Findings show that age, income, education and religious factors affect the charitable donation behavior in Malaysia. Further, the research also identifies major differences between donor characteristic from Malaysia with Britain, Australia, Brunei and Pakistan. The findings indicate that the characteristics of donors differ between each country and more exploration is needed in this field. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These risks may materialize in the possibility of the beneficiary of the payment instrument to pursue the person signing the cheque or promissory note, in the case when it is also personally avalised by the latter, as well as in the possibility to have the person who signed the cheque recorded at the Payment Incident Bureau, along with the issuing company in certain situations, or even, in the most serious cases, in sanctions of criminal nature. On the other hand, there are many cases where economic agents cannot recover debts guaranteed by creditors with such payment instruments, either because of lack of funds in the issuer's account or because the cheque or promissory note does not meet the legal conditions to be accepted to payment.

As funds grow larger and new sovereign funds come into the market, the identification of suitable investments in an increasingly crowded marketplace becomes correspondingly more difficult. The universe of potential investments is narrowed by a trust deficit between many sovereign funds and the regulators in countries in which these funds invest; this trust deficit can result in higher transactional costs that price public funds out of the market, or can create unacceptably high regulatory risks that deter funds from considering certain investments.

This survey examines the growing body of empirical research on efficient market hypothesis. The conclusion of this article is that testing for market efficiency is difficult and there is a high possibility that, because of changes in market / economic conditions, new theoretical model should be developed to take into consideration all changes.

Visual management is not well known within the construction industry; however, the importance of visualization is well recognized. In construction design, two types of visual means are frequently applied, i.e., 3D models and visual planning. These visual means support communication and mutual understanding during design, but do however not address the management of the project. The aim of this article is to explore how visual means support the design in terms of coordination and how they utilize the potential that exists in a multi-disciplinary design team. For exploring how visual means support the design coordination, we conducted and compared two case studies qualitatively in a construction design setting. Both case studies were followed throughout the entire design process, where the design teams were semi-collocated. More than 15 semi-structured interviews were recorded and transcribed. Both cases were residential in-house projects. Based on our findings we contribute with the following: (1) by using multiple visual means, i.e., visual management, the design teams become more self-going. (2) However, the self-going supported by visual management is primarily related to a collocated setting and active engagement of all actors involved. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We consider the relationship between the euro and other floating currencies in terms of excess returns on bond markets and also the relationship between the euro-dollar and the US and European equity markets. One novelty in the paper is to consider the variation in the euro-dollar rate from an international capital asset pricing model (CAPM) perspective. The second new innovation is to use a kernel weighted time varying parameter regression approach which allows structural parameters and risk premium terms to evolve over time.

We focus our attention upon political violence as a key subnational determinant of aid commitments and argue that donors commit aid to areas with recent political violence in the hope of ameliorating need and bolstering stability. This being the case, however, we contend not all areas experiencing violence are equally likely to receive aid commitments. This is because potential donors are faced with a dilemma-balancing risk and reward-that leads them to question whether they can effectively deliver aid to areas under conditions of extreme violence. We test these two hypotheses and provide confirmation for them in the context of bilateral aid commitments to local areas within Sub-Saharan African states experiencing civil war between 1990 and 2007.","[Bezerra, Paul; Braithwaite, Alex] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Braithwaite, A (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",abraith@email.arizona.edu,,"Bezerra, Paul/0000-0001-5078-5043",,,,,81,11,12,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2016,169.0,3-4,,,,,333,355,,10.1007/s11127-016-0377-9,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EA3ML,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386506800010,0

The model features endogenous producer entry into domestic and export markets and search-and-matching frictions in labor markets. This allows us to highlight the consequences of financial integration and the exchange rate regime for the dynamics of business creation and unemployment. We show that, under flexible exchange rates, access to international financial markets increases the volatility of both business creation and the number of exporting plants, but the effects on employment volatility are more modest. Pegging the exchange rate can have unfavorable consequences for the effects of terms of trade appreciation, but more financial integration is beneficial under a peg if the economy is subject to both productivity and terms of trade shocks.

Prior research on wealth and entrepreneurial entry has relied on data providing only a snapshot of the transition into self-employment. The present study draws on a sample of US nascent entrepreneurs actively attempting to start new ventures. Controlling for a number of covariates and the endogenous accumulation of wealth, we find strong evidence of higher dropout rates among low-wealth and moderately wealthy nascent entrepreneurs. However, wealth appears to have no effect on venture creation for those managing to remain in gestation. This suggests liquidity constraints theory applies more toward entrepreneurial disengagement than entrepreneurial entry. Furthermore, the suggestion that the wealthy are able to aggressively grow their ventures is only partially supported by the data when we include a set of covariates correlated with wealth. Integrating these findings, we conclude that entrepreneurial success is concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution, despite notable evidence of capability for those at the lower end of the wealth distribution.","[Frid, Casey J.] Pace Univ, 1 Pace Plaza,4th Floor, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Wyman, David M.] Coll Charleston, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Beatty Ctr, 5 Liberty St,Room 411, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Coffey, Bentley] Duke Univ, 230 Rubenstein Hall,Box 90312, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Pace University; College of Charleston; Duke University,"Frid, CJ (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, 1 Pace Plaza,4th Floor, New York, NY 10038 USA.",cfrid@pace.edu,"Frid, Casey/F-2981-2012","Frid, Casey/0000-0003-1929-4662",,,,,62,19,32,5,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Both airports and airlines, particularly low-cost carriers, have recently started catering to the needs of this type of passengers with the introduction of transfer fees or the development of self-connection platforms. The evidence provided by the existing literature, however, suggests that the degree of implementation of these strategies falls short of its true potential. In order to investigate how much self-connectivity could be observed in global air transport markets, this paper develops a forecasting model based on a zero-inflated Poisson regression on MIDT data. We identify the airports that have the highest potential to facilitate self-connections, as well as the factors that hinder or facilitate the necessary airline agreements at major locations. The results from this paper have many implications in regards to the widespread implementation of self-connection services and the future of the air travel industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The CDM has provided financial support for a large share of Chinese wind projects since 2002. Using pooled cross-sectional data of 486 registered CDM wind projects in China from 2002 to 2009, we examine the determinants of technological change in wind power from a learning perspective. We use a spatial error model to estimate the effects of different channels of learning-learning through R&D in wind turbine manufacturing, learning from a firm's previous wind project experience, spillovers from industry-wide project experience, and learning through the network interaction between project developer and turbine manufacturer-on technological change, measured as reductions in projected costs or as increased capacity factor across CDM wind projects. While we find that a project developer's previous experience matters, interactions between a wind project developer and its partner foreign turbine manufacturer lead to the largest cost reductions and capacity factor improvement. We also find that spillovers from industry-wide experience only exist for wind farm installation. The evidence of industry-wide spillovers and the joint learning within partnerships between project developers and foreign turbine manufacturers supports the subsidies to users of wind technologies, and policy regimes that promote international collaboration and technology transfer.

Inequality increased at the start of this period but declined sharply from the 1960s onwards. The increase was due to a shift from domestic to export agriculture over the period up to the Great Depression. During the 1930s, as the price of export crops declined, the income of rich farmers suffered a blow. Yet this was counterbalanced by an increasing gap between expenditures in the urban and rural sectors, causing an overall rise in inequality. As for the second half of the century, we find that the employment shift towards manufacturing and servicescombined with an increase in labour productivity in agricultureaccounts for inequality's decline, which was halted in the 1990s. These inequality trends affected poverty as well, but prior to the 1940s the negative impact of the rise in inequality was offset by an increase in per capita GDP. Between 1950 and 1980 a decline in inequality, combined with increased per capita GDP, rapidly raised a large portion of the population above the poverty line. Penulis melakukan estimasi terhadap ketimpangan yang terjadi di Indonesia antara 1932 dan 2008. Ketimpangan naik pada awal kurun waktu tersebut dan turun tajam sejak 1960. Kenaikannya merupakan dampak pergeseran dari pertanian domestik ke arah ekspor seiring dengan periode menuju Masa Depresi Besar (The Great Depression). Sepanjang 1930, seiring dengan turunnya harga hasil pertanian, pendapatan petani kaya mengalami penurunan. Namun hal ini nampak diimbangi oleh bertambahnya kesenjangan yang tercipta antara sektor-sektor di perkotaan dan pedesaan, yang pada gilirannya menyebabkan naiknya ketimpangan secara umum. Sedangkan untuk paruh kedua dalam abad tersebut, penulis menemukan pergeseran ketenagakerjaan ke arah sektor pengolahan dan jasa - disertai naiknya produktivitas tenaga kerja di sektor pertanian - menyebabkan penurunan ketimpangan sampai tahun 1990an. Tren-tren ketimpangan ini juga mempengaruhi kemiskinan, namun sebelum 1940an, dampak negatif dari pertumbuhan ketimpangan dapat diredam oleh naiknya PDB per kapita. Antara 1950 dan 1980, penurunan ketimpangan disertai dengan naiknya PDB per kapita secara cepat dapat mengangkat sebagian besar proporsi populasi ke atas garis kemiskinan.","[van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"van Leeuwen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,63,12,13,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

These situations are clearly observable in agricultural activities, whose development has often determined an artificialisation so intense to change the original appearance of entire areas. The evolution of the territorial role of agriculture has implicated the coexistence among various economic activities, some of which have gained benefits from the artificialisation realized by farmers. It is the case of touristic activities and food services which take advantages from the beauty and from the attractiveness of landscapes shaped by agricultural activities. The purpose of this paper is to verify how, for territorial realities where tourist offer found its main basis on contexts realized by agriculture, the set of economic activities can take advantages from the sustainable use of the same resource and, therefore, it can contribute to its development. To this aim, we'll take as an example the recent development of food and wine tourism, in Italy, as an important expression of tangible socio-economic systems based on the enhancement of local resources.","[Calabro, Grazia] Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy; [Vieri, Simone] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",University of Messina; Sapienza University Rome,"Calabrò, G (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy.",grazia.calabro@unime.it,"Vieri, Simone/GQZ-3803-2022",,,,,,24,7,8,1,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,989,998,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700019,0

E2SFCA method which is an enhancement of two step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method differentiates the accessibility of the population within the catchment area by introducing a distance decay function. At the point when calibrating the distance decay from the travel behavior of patients in the study areas, it is revealed that sigmoidal functions are more likely suitable for the high population density regions and also plain terrains and decline functions for low population density regions and difficult desert or hilly areas. The paper yields health care shortage areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed.","[Zona, Fabio] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Zona, Fabio] ICRIOS Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",University of Trento; Bocconi University,"Zona, F (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",fabio.zona@unitn.it,,,,,,,71,36,40,4,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using large-scale language data from an online college course, we measure the impacts of peer interactions on student learning outcomes and persistence. In our setting, students are quasi-randomly assigned to peers, and as such, we are able to overcome selection biases stemming from endogenous peer grouping. We also mitigate reflection bias by utilizing rich student interaction data. We find that females and older students are more likely to engage in student interactions. Students are also more likely to interact with peers of the same gender and with peers from roughly the same geographic region. For students who are relatively less likely to be engaged in online discussion, exposure to more interactive peers increases their probabilities of passing the course, improves their grade in the course, and increases their likelihood of enrolling in the following academic term. This study demonstrates how the use of large-scale, text-based data can provide insights into students' learning processes.

Consistent with recent studies, we find that systemic credit and counterparty risks, market liquidity, and volatility are spread determinants. However, the impact and relevance of these determinants change, depending on the stages of the interbank market crisis. We show that commercial bank leverage and the state of the economy are additional spread drivers. We also discover that the key USD spread is strongly related to banks' risk tolerance levels, capital concerns, and secondary market liquidity during the crisis, even after controlling for other factors.

To this end, we first extend the FCVAR model to accommodate deterministic trends in the levels of the processes. The methodological contribution is to provide a representation theory for the FCVAR model with deterministic trends, where we show that the presence of the deterministic trend in the process induces both restricted and unrestricted constant terms in the vector error correction model. The consequences for the cointegration rank test are also briefly discussed. In our empirical application we use the data from Figuerola-Ferretti and Gonzalo (2010), who conduct a similar analysis using the usual (non-fractional) cointegrated VAR model. The main conclusion from the empirical analysis is that, when using the FCVAR model, there is more support for the cointegration vector (1, - 1)' in the long-run equilibrium relationship between spot and futures prices, and hence less evidence of long-run badmardation, compared to the results from the non-fractional model. Specifically, we reject the hypothesis that the cointegration vector is (1, - 1)' using standard likelihood ratio tests only for the lead and nickel markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that tradeability and nontraded inputs play a significantly smaller role for cross-country price dispersion after the adoption of the euro, and for Eurozone economies as compared to European Union ones. We then compare the distributions of law-of-one-price (LOP) deviations over time to understand how the degree of integration across European economies changed after the euro. Our tests reveal that the distributions after the euro are typically significantly different from those before, consistent with a greater degree of integration. Utilizing our unique panel data set to trace the location of individual goods in the distribution of LOP deviations, we ask how the price advantage or disadvantage evident in these price distributions evolves over time, and whether goods characteristics play a role for the persistence of these LOP deviations. LOP deviations for these goods are highly correlated over 5- or 10- year horizons, and correlations remain significantly high over longer horizons. These correlations are greater for homogeneous as compared to differentiated goods and vary across countries. Finally, for most of these European economies and goods, price advantage is typically revealed to be more persistent than price disadvantage.","[Glushenkova, Marina; Zachariadis, Marios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Glushenkova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",glushenkova.marina@ucy.ac.cy; zachariadis@ucy.ac.cy,"Glushenkova, MARINA/AAC-9443-2019; Zachariadis, Marios/S-1140-2017","Glushenkova, MARINA/0000-0002-4206-3697; Zachariadis, Marios/0000-0002-2308-1881",,,,,29,11,11,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The findings show that fathers' daily commute to work was associated with more peer relationship problems, and it also appeared to be linked to more emotional symptoms and greater hyperactivity in children. Fathers' weekly commute was also linked to child emotional problems. The likelihood of having peer relationship problems in children increased with the distance of fathers' daily commute to work.

We use the Archimedean copula models: Gumbel, Clayton, Frank and AMH which have different tail dependence structures. The results show that the three largest country sukuk indices exhibit significant dependence but only with the volatility of the considered stock markets. Moreover, the dependence structure between the local sukuk yields and the various stock markets' volatility is asymmetric and oriented toward the upper side for Malaysia and United Arab Emirates, while it has a symmetric dependence for the Saudi Arabian market. We also find that the country sukuk yields are more sensitive to the global conventional stock market rather than to the global Islamic, regional and local stock markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We also examined the data using parental household characteristics to reinforce the importance of previous transfer behaviors. We found that the receipt of prior transfers, family structure and parental household income were the strongest determinants of the odds that parents gave financial assistance to adult children as both generations aged.

Housing price appreciation generates real estate investment opportunities with high returns, making manufacturing firms more likely to diversify into the real estate industry. With limited resources, once investing in real estate development, these firms will invest less in innovation. By examining manufacturing firms in China for the period 1999-2007, we provide evidence by finding that housing price appreciation negatively influenced manufacturing firms' innovation propensities. Additionally, we further explore the underlying mechanism by examining the likelihood of listed firms' diversification into the real estate industry, and how the diversification influenced their patenting. Consistent with the investment opportunity hypothesis, we find that (1) housing price appreciation stimulated firms to enter the real estate industry, and a firm's invention patenting was negatively influenced subsequent to its real estate diversification; (2) the negative effect was more pronounced where housing price growth rates were higher.

The paper provides an analytical solution for the optimal contribution of an arbitrary coalition member to a linear and pure public good. Based on empirical estimates for the parameters the model is then applied to the problem of climate mitigation policies. We provide a full stability analysis of all coalitions that can be formed by the twelve world regions from Nordhaus' RICE model. As it turns out, only four two-player coalitions are internally stable. For a wealthy country leaving a coalition, its absolute payoff increases more than its disutility from additional advantageous inequality. A poor country improves its welfare by dropping out since its absolute payoff increases and, at the same time, disutility from disadvantageous inequality is reduced. Introducing suitable transfer schemes, however, large coalitions consisting of economically divergent countries turn out to be internally stable.","[Vogt, Carsten] Bochum Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Bochum, Germany",Hochschule Bochum,"Vogt, C (通讯作者)，Bochum Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Bochum, Germany.",carsten.vogt@hs-bochum.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Funding of this research by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is gratefully acknowledged.

Many influential surveys have found that the empirical evidence of decentralization's effects on service delivery is weak, incomplete, and often contradictory. Our own unweighted reading of the literature concurs. However, when we organize quantitative evidence first by substantive theme, and then-crucially-by empirical quality and the credibility of its identification strategy, clear patterns emerge. Higher-quality evidence indicates that decentralization increases technical efficiency across a variety of public services, from student test scores to infant mortality rates. Decentralization also improves preference matching in education, and can do so in health under certain conditions, although there is less evidence for both. We discuss individual studies in some detail. Weighting by quality is especially important when quantitative evidence informs policy-making. Firmer conclusions will require an increased focus on research design, and a deeper examination into the prerequisites and mechanisms of successful reforms.","[Channa, Anila; Faguet, Jean-Paul] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Faguet, Jean-Paul] London Sch Econ, STICERD, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Faguet, JP (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Faguet, JP (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, STICERD, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.p.faguet@lse.ac.uk,"Faguet, Jean-Paul/K-9205-2019","Faguet, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-7188-0098",World Bank; London School of Economics,World Bank(The World Bank India); London School of Economics,"The research in this article was financed by the World Bank and the London School of Economics.

Because of their dissimilar formats, Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) and Traffic Light (TL) may trigger different responses among consumers. While GDA is comprehensive and cognitively demanding, information is coarser and more salient in TL. We implement an incentivized laboratory experiment to assess the relative performance of GDA and TL labeling schemes in assisting consumers to build a healthy daily menu. Participants must compose a daily menu, choosing from a finite set of products, and are paid a fixed cash amount only if the menu satisfies pre-determined nutritional goals. Goals correspond to achieving the Guideline Daily Amount values of 1 (kcal), 4 (kcal, fat, sugar, salt) or 7 (kcal, fat, sugar, salt, fiber, vitamin C and calcium) different nutritional attributes. Three different labels, GDA, TL and a combined GDATL are provided. Results show that GDA performs better than TL when subjects do not face time constraints.

The analysis is based on a household decision model that relates spatial deployment of working-age, migration-capable members to inundation and salinization threats. The empirical analysis uses appropriate estimation techniques, including adjustments for spatial autocorrelation. The findings are consistent with a model that treats urban migration of working-age family members as both an income source and the only feasible form of disaster insurance for coastal households. Greater inundation risk unambiguously decreases the rural household share of working-age members, while the direction of the salinity effect depends on households' income elasticity of demand for disaster insurance. The econometric results suggest that this elasticity is significantly greater than one, yielding higher rural household shares of working-age members in areas with higher salinity (ceteris paribus). Both increased inundation risk and greater salinity increase the incidence of extreme poverty among coastal households. However, powerful poverty reduction results for market access indicate that road improvements would provide an important countervailing force. The benefits of increased market access for coastal households are present with or without inundation and salinization threats, making such investments an attractive no-regret option.","[Dasgupta, Susmita] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Hossain, Md.

This paper utilizes the concept of regional innovation systems (RISs) and introduces a methodological approach that allows for evaluating an Science and Technology Park's (STP) contribution into the corresponding RIS performance, taking into consideration (1) the RIS idiosyncrasies, (2) the dominant role of government expenditures on R&D and (3) the underlying complexity of knowledge production and management, under alternative sets of restrictions imposed by fiscal consolidation on the preferences of authorities which design and implement Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policies. Our framework relies on the estimation of a multi-input-multi-output latent knowledge production function approach and the corresponding efficiency indices. Data requirements are sourced from the Regional Innovation Scoreboard, for the four Greek regions and from a small-scale case study, with respect to the examined regional STP covering the period from 2000 to 2012. The main empirical findings highlight that the contribution of the examined STP in the corresponding RIS performance diminishes alongside with the decrease in GERD investment levels, with respect to all the efficiency indices. These findings are attributed to the structural characteristics of both the RIS and the STP under investigation, and capture their dependence on managing public financial resources for STI activities.","[Gkypali, Areti; Tsekouras, Kostas] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26504, Greece; [Kokkinos, Vasileios; Bouras, Christos] Univ Patras, Dept Comp Engn & Informat, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26504, Greece; [Kokkinos, Vasileios; Bouras, Christos] Comp Technol Inst, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26504, Greece; [Kokkinos, Vasileios; Bouras, Christos] Press Diophantus, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26504, Greece",University of Patras; University of Patras,"Tsekouras, K (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus Rio, Patras 26504, Greece.",gyparet@upatras.gr; tsekour@econ.upatras.gr,"Gkypali, Areti/AAG-7329-2021","Gkypali, Areti/0000-0002-5206-6357; Kokkinos, Vasileios/0000-0003-1326-6281; Tsekouras, Kostas/0000-0002-9524-3237","INTERREG IVC project 'InCompass-Regional Policy Improvement for Financially Sustainable Creative Incubator Units' [1127R4]; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Programme 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Programme: Thales, investing in knowledge society through the European Social Fund [MIS 380232]","INTERREG IVC project 'InCompass-Regional Policy Improvement for Financially Sustainable Creative Incubator Units'; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Programme 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Programme: Thales, investing in knowledge society through the European Social Fund(Thales Group)","The authors acknowledge that the starting point and the drive of this paper have been generated in the context of the INTERREG IVC project 'InCompass-Regional Policy Improvement for Financially Sustainable Creative Incubator Units' (Contract Number 1127R4).

Yet, there is still insufficient knowledge about whether ethnic diversity necessarily entails large economic costs, or whether the implications of diversity depend, inter alia, on the government's approach toward the ethnic question. We note that economic growth tends to increase average incomes, but it also affects the income distribution. Then, if growth is accompanied by growing economic inequality, the perception of the impartiality of the government toward different ethnic groups is likely to be important for whether growth can be sustained, or whether sparks of growth will evaporate because of rising political divisions and internal conflicts. In this paper, we study whether the degree of ethnic impartiality in the government's policies is related to the emergence of sustained growth in sub-Saharan Africa, irrespective of the actual content of the policies. We measure perceptions about the impartiality of the government with survey data from the Afrobarometer covering 20 countries starting in the late 1990 s. Our main definition of sustained growth is when there is a GDP per capita growth rate of at least 2% for at least five consecutive years. Our empirical results suggest that countries whose governments are perceived as impartial are more likely to experience sustained growth. We conclude that in order to ensure economic development, it is not only important to choose the right policies, but also to implement these policies in a fair manner. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We find that firms with high earnings management activities are associated with high financial leverage. More importantly, this positive relation is attenuated by strong institutional environments. Our results lend strong support to the notions that (1) both corporate debt and institutional environments can be served as external control mechanisms to alleviate the agency cost of free cash flow; and (2) it is less costly to rely on institutional environments than debt.

The shadow cost includes two components. The first component is the product of pure information cost due to imperfect knowledge and heterogeneous expectations. The second component represents the additional cost caused by the short-selling constraint. Information costs are linked to Merton's (1987. Jour nal of Finance 42, 510) model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information, CAPMI. This model is extended by Wu et al. (1996. Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 7, 136) who propose an incomplete-information capital market equilibrium with heterogeneous expectations and short sale restrictions, GCAPM. This model is used in our paper to provide for the first time in the literature analytic solutions for derivatives in the presence of both shadow costs of incomplete information and short sales. When deriving the compound call option formula, we consider a call option on a stock, which is itself an option on the assets of the firm. Our methodology incorporates shadow costs of incomplete information and short sales on the firm's assets as well as the effects of leverage in the capital structure. The formula can be useful in the valuation of several corporate liabilities in the presence of information uncertainty and short sales constraints about the firm and its cash flows. Our analysis can be used for the valuation of several real options. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Two themes are central: first, the divergence of view with respect to the possible relevance of past transitions for the present (posited by Byres) and the contemporary, pre-emptive power of globalization (argued by Bernstein); and, second, the basic difference of analytical procedure. There is discussion of how, in India, before 1947, colonialism sought unsuccessfully to replicate an English model' of transition in eastern India; and how, throughout India, colonialism through surplus appropriation and remittances to Britain prevented the creation of the underlying structural conditions necessary for successful agrarian transition. Aspects of the nature of the Byres treatment of the Scottish experience of agrarian transition in the eighteenth century are considered, to illustrate the nature of the Byres method. The paper seeks to advance the conversation by clarifying the contrast between the two approaches.","[Byres, Terence J.] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ & Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Byres, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ & Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",tb1@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,19,23,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The results reveal that the degree of connection between 10-year bond rate movements and stock returns differs considerably among countries and also varies over time and depending on the time horizon considered. In particular, the UK shows the greatest interdependence between long-term interest rates and equity returns across time and frequencies, while the relationship is much weaker for several peripheral European countries such as Portugal, Ireland and Greece. The highest level of connection is observed for most countries since the onset of the recent global financial crisis.

With the continuous weakness of the euro area economy, this exchange rate limit was abandoned on 15 January 2015. This paper proposes a quasi-bounded process for the Swiss franc exchange rate dynamics under a one-sided target zone during this period, in which the exchange rate can breach the strong-side limit under a restricted condition of the relationship between the parameters of the drift term and stochastic part of the process. The empirical results using market data during 6 September 2011-14 January 2015 with a rolling one-year window suggest that this model can describe the dynamics of the Swiss franc under a one-sided target zone, where the drifting force is an increasing function of foreign reserves. While the exchange rate was bounded below the strong -side limit during most of the time, as indicated by its dynamics, the condition for breaching the limit was met in November 2014 using only information until that point, i.e., about two months before abandoning the limit.

Drawing on empirical research in Afghanistan, the discussion looks specifically at how local actors interact to reshape the rules of the game in women's enterprise. The research has highlighted diverse actor negotiation in the transformation of (heterogeneous) purdah norms and development of enterprise institutions. This has crucially influenced the scope of norm development, and women's engagement in business. The study shows that external actors (such as NGOs) may be able to both initiate and guide institutional change and development. Yet in challenging environments such as Afghanistan, there may be limitations to their endeavors, with strong resistance from local power holders, unpredictable entrepreneurs and disruptive (local) events. The use of liberal cultural/religious narratives has proved fundamental in permitting change processes. Emerging open-minded beliefs have unleashed a more democratic narrative on women, particularly if championed by progressive leaders, or credible outsiders in receptive local conditions. This has led to the evolution of new attitudes and preferences, with potential effects beyond the market, including increasing girls' education and women's property rights. The research has generated a micro-social perspective of institutional change, identifying key actors and conditions that may shape grassroots institutional processes in enterprise development. In emerging outcomes, the paper presents insights into the role of dominant entrepreneurs in driving (nested) institutional pathways. This may promote inclusive opportunities for (new) power and wealth through open institutions, in productive institutional pathways. Yet it can equally foster distorted economies if exclusive institutions are allowed to prevail in more destructive institutional pathways. To further develop micro-institutional theory, the paper argues for a greater appreciation of culture, religion, and fragility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply our estimator to a sample of long records of returns of various stock and foreign exchange markets as well as the price of gold. Using the estimated parameters to form the best linear forecasts for future volatility we find that the behavioral model generates sensible forecasts that get close to those of a standard GARCH(1,1) model in their overall performance, and often provide useful information on top of the information incorporated in the GARCH forecasts.

In the transport sector, this is especially relevant for toll roads since.they entail a burden to the users. Previous literature in this field has mainly focused on analyzing the influence of different individual characteristics on attitudes towards road charges, without clear results. However, other context-specific drivers such as regional parameters may also play an important role to explain users' attitudes, especially when the implementation of tolls within the same nation varies throughout regions. The goal of this paper is to analyze regional differences in users' perceptions with regard to tolls as an appropriate way to finance the provision of road infrastructure. Based on a nationwide survey conducted to road users in interurban toll roads in Spain, we develop a multilevel logit model to explore regional differences in drivers' perceptions. The research concludes that differences identified seem to be more influenced by context-specific variables, related to either the characteristics of the toll road or the region, than by the characteristics of the individuals. The paper also underlines the negative effects of an asymmetrical distribution of toll roads across regions on users' perceptions, since those territories especially suffering the burden of tolls show a more negative attitude towards road charging.

Light rails continue to be built despite often having poor socio-economic returns - other similar modes could provide the same transport function at a lower cost. Through a case study, this article explores the main vision and rationalities behind light rail projects in two mid-sized European cities - Bergen and Angers - and considers how this vision has materialised in various 'light rail scapes'. The article argues that the city shapes the light rail project, but also that the light rail re-configures and shapes the urban structures, design and planning practices within the city based on its materiality and spatial interaction with it. This means that light rail projects need to be rethought as complex urban development projects instead of just simple 'pieces of infrastructure'. Ultimately, this work seeks to shed light on a number of ideas for future light rail research and practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted an eye-tracking study to test these assumptions using a paradigm on decision behavior in lottery choices by Glockner and Herbold (2011). While major effects of that article were replicated, mindsets also affected information search. Overall, position was the dominant factor in information search for all participants, and decision times increased in relation to the level of difficulty. However, a significant interaction between level of difficulty and mindset indicated that implemental participants used significantly longer decision times and more fixations than deliberative participants at the most difficult level of decision making. This had no effect on decisions. We conclude that decisions on lottery choices are very robust and that mindsets influence decision processes. Achievement motivation is discussed as a possible explanation for the increased effort in information search in difficult decisions in the implemental mindset. In an exploratory analysis, self-reported decision strategies were analyzed, finding a strong focus on risk avoidance in both mindsets.","[Rahn, Johanna; Jaudas, Alexander; Achtziger, Anja] Zeppelin Univ, Dept Social Sci, Seemooser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany",Zeppelin University,"Rahn, J (通讯作者)，Zeppelin Univ, Dept Social Sci, Seemooser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany.",jo.rahn@zeppelin-university.net,,,,,,,34,8,11,1,25,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

More specifically, we seek to establish the linkages by which government effectiveness affects per capita income via its mediating impact on human capital formation. Our empirical approach adopts a two-stage strategy that estimates national-level educational production functions that include government effectiveness as a covariate, and uses these estimates as instruments for human capital in cross-country regressions of per capita income. Our results identify a significant and positive effect of human capital on per capita income levels, and partially resolves the inconsistency between macro- and micro-level studies of the effect of human capital on income. The results remain robust to alternative specifications, extension to a panel setting, subsamples of the data and fully endogenous institutions.","[Lim, Jamus Jerome] World Bank, MSN MC2-204,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lim, Jamus Jerome] Santa Cruz Inst Int Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Adams-Kane, Jonathon] Milken Inst, 1250 4th St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA",The World Bank,"Lim, JJ (通讯作者)，World Bank, MSN MC2-204,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Lim, JJ (通讯作者)，Santa Cruz Inst Int Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jlim@worldbank.org,,"Lim, Jamus/0000-0002-7665-9173",,,,,32,12,12,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this paper, the importance of seasonal behavior in the volatility for the pricing of commodity options is analyzed. We propose a seasonally varying long-run mean variance process that is capable of capturing empirically observed patterns. Semi-closed-form option valuation formulas are derived. We then empirically study the impact of the proposed Seasonal Stochastic Volatility Model on the pricing accuracy of natural gas futures options traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and corn futures options traded at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Our results demonstrate that allowing stochastic volatility to fluctuate seasonally significantly reduces pricing errors for these contracts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, we relate to risks that imply the growth of pollution, especially against nuisance air pollution increase (CO, SO2, NO etc.) with major implications on the growth of greenhouse effect, the melting of the ice fields, respectively the pollution of the soil with nitrates from fertilizers intensively used in agriculture. Our study is up-to-date, as pursuant to the ONU Conference from Paris (France 2015, Conference on Climate Changes), they reached an agreement and the adopted text admits the menace of climate modifications is far more important than previously acknowledged and engages the participants to reduce their pollutant emissions. The researchers' current concerns focus on studying the effects of the redistribution of financial resources obtained by practising the 'green' fiscal policy on dependent variables. Observing them, we integrate the respective variables into complex models analysed by multiple regression (both standard and robust) and the fixed effects panel on 20 European countries which also reflect the different effects on the environmental policy and the expenses it incurred. The main purpose of the analysis we aim to accomplish is the impact of the policy for environment expenditure tenable within the European framework on against nuisance air pollution attenuation. The statistical analysis aims at identifying these effects by means of regression equations (OLS), robust regression (M method), fixed and random effects, using panel data from 18 EU countries, as well as Switzerland and Turkey due to their position in relation to the community block; we will analyse the period between 1995-2013. Further to the application of multiple regression statistical methods (OLS and robust M), our results show that teimiqgdp expenses played a major role in the reduction of carbon monoxide. These are the total investments made in the mining sector; when these expenses were raised by 1% of the GDP value, there was a decrease of 11 628.3 thousand tons Cot at the level of the European countries analysed, according to the result of the OLS analysis, based on the robust M estimation.","[Bostan, Ionel] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania; [Bostan, Ionel; Dascalu, Elena-Doina] Romanian Court Accounts Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Onofrei, Mihaela; Firtescu, Bogdan; Toderascu, Carmen] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania; [Dascalu, Elena-Doina] Spiru Haret Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Spiru Haret University,"Bostan, I (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.;Bostan, I (通讯作者)，Romanian Court Accounts Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",ionel_bostan@yahoo.com,"Firtescu, Bogdan Narcis/U-5725-2017; Onofrei, Mihaela/K-3668-2015","Firtescu, Bogdan Narcis/0000-0002-2292-8120; BOSTAN, Ionel/0000-0002-7653-7192",,,,,27,7,11,2,47,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2016,18.0,42,,,,,286,302,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP1SW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378270700004,0

The results show that the economic cycle significantly affects trade credit received and granted, which both increase in the period of economic boom, and contract during a period of crisis. In addition, constrained firms receive less credit from suppliers during the crisis, while their accounts receivables increase.

The existence of such externalities lead to exclude some workers from the vocational training system, contrary to what the social optimum suggests. It should be proposed a training support policy directed on certain workers. Our main contribution consists in replacing the question of social externalities of general training in a life-cycle framework, and emphasizing the need to set up an age-dependent policy of subsidies to encourage workplace training and restore social optimality. We highlight that employers stop training workers too early in the life-cycle compared to what the inclusion of social externalities suggests. By contrast, at the end of career (closer to retirement), the social return of training converges towards the private one and is close to zero. Our results argue in favour of an incentive policy non-monotone with age, increasing up to a certain age and decreasing beyond.","[Cheron, Arnaud; Terriau, Anthony] Univ Maine GAINS, Le Mans, France; [Cheron, Arnaud] EDHEC Business Sch, Roubaix, France",Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Chéron, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maine GAINS, Le Mans, France.",acheron@univ-lemans.fr; anthony.terriau@univ-lemans.fr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,7,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Moreover, the effect of verbal intervention on the exchange rate of the RMB is weaker than that of actual intervention. One possible explanation is that most of the statements made by the governor of central bank on the RMB exchange rate are neutral in China.

This framework allows us to examine systematically how various possible party roles, such as agenda setting, result in legislative gridlock which, in turn, create or undercut presidential incentives, and how directional constraints on discretion undermine presidential leverage. In particular, negative agenda setting and party discipline intensify gridlock, enhancing presidential policy gains; positive agenda setting's effect depends upon governmental regime. Empirically, majority parties consistently play some role, especially negative agenda setting, regardless of the threshold used to define EO significance, while party discipline is more pronounced with higher thresholds. Also, while a majority party median is crucial for constraining the direction of how presidents use discretion with lower thresholds, a chamber median (whose preference may be induced by party pressure) is key with higher thresholds.","[Chiou, Fang-Yi] Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Rothenberg, Lawrence S.] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; University of Rochester,"Chiou, FY (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;Rothenberg, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",fchiou@gate.sinica.edu.tw; lrot@mail.rochester.edu,"Lai, Melody/D-4569-2011",,,,,,49,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2016,167.0,1-2,,,,,145,171,,10.1007/s11127-016-0335-6,0.0,,,27,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DQ2GC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379019500008,0

We model the impacts on agriculture using a Ricardian model, where current agricultural production is modelled as a function of temperature and precipitation, among other things, and where future agriculture is assumed to follow the same climate function. The effect of overall climate change is projected to be relatively benign until approximately 2030, but will become considerably worse thereafter. Our simulation results indicate that, over a 50-year period, the projected reduction in agricultural productivity may lead to reductions in average income of some 20 per cent compared with the outcome that would have prevailed in the absence of climate change. This indicates that adaptation policies - both government planned and those that ease autonomous adaptation by farmers - will be crucial for Ethiopia's future development.","[Gebreegziabher, Zenebe] Mekelle Univ, Dept Econ, Adi Haqui Campus,POB 451, Mekelle, Tigrai, Ethiopia; [Stage, Jesper] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, Lulea, Sweden; [Stage, Jesper] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Business Econ & Law, Sundsvall, Sweden; [Mekonnen, Alemu; Alemu, Atlaw] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Mekelle University; Lulea University of Technology; Mid-Sweden University; Addis Ababa University,"Gebreegziabher, Z (通讯作者)，Mekelle Univ, Dept Econ, Adi Haqui Campus,POB 451, Mekelle, Tigrai, Ethiopia.;Stage, J (通讯作者)，Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, Lulea, Sweden.;Stage, J (通讯作者)，Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Business Econ & Law, Sundsvall, Sweden.;Mekonnen, A; Alemu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",zenebeg2002@yahoo.com; jesper.stage@itu.se; alemu_m2004@yahoo.com; atlawalem@yahoo.com,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568","Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) through EfD (Environment for Development) initiative; International Institute for Environment and Development; Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg, Formas, Elforsk","Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) through EfD (Environment for Development) initiative; International Institute for Environment and Development; Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg, Formas, Elforsk","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work from Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) through the EfD (Environment for Development) initiative, Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg, Formas, Elforsk and the International Institute for Environment and Development.",,41,21,21,0,39,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We study the effect of immigration through all the stages of entrepreneurial process: interest in starting a new business, effectively starting, running a new business and managing an established business. We adopt a sequential logit to model entrepreneurial process as a sequence of stages.

First, does the propensity of self-employment vary with sexual orientation? The study found that the individuals most likely to be self-employed were heterosexual men, followed by gay men, then lesbians, and lastly heterosexual women. Second, do the impacts of explanatory variables on the odds of being self-employed differ with sexual orientation? Multinomial logit estimation revealed that, in particular, the effects of married and unmarried partners' income varied with the gender/sexual orientation group. Third, among employed individuals, does incidence of self-employment across occupations differ with sexual orientation? According to the analysis, heterosexual men showed a significantly higher incidence of self-employment than gay men in three occupation categories, while gay men had higher rates in two occupation groups. Lesbians had higher incidences of self-employment in all four occupation categories that exhibited significant sexual orientation differences among the women.","[Leppel, Karen] Widener Univ, Sch Business Adm, One Univ Pl, Chester, PA 19013 USA",Widener University,"Leppel, K (通讯作者)，Widener Univ, Sch Business Adm, One Univ Pl, Chester, PA 19013 USA.",kleppel@widener.edu,,,,,,,44,12,12,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

It gives consideration to periods before and after the recent global financial crisis (GFC). To this end, the bivariate DCC-FIAPARCH model, the modified ICSS algorithm and the Value-at-Risk (VaR) are employed to capture volatility spillovers, detect potential structural breaks and assess the portfolio market risks. Using the U.S. and the BRICS daily spot market indices for the period from September 1997 to October 2013, our empirical results show strong evidence of asymmetry and long memory in the conditional volatility and significant dynamic correlations between the U.S. and the BRICS stock markets. Moreover, we find several sudden changes in these markets with a common break date centered on September 15, 2008 which corresponds to the Lehman Brothers collapse. The Brazil, India, China and South Africa markets are strongly affected by the GFC, supporting the hypothesis of recoupling (with increased linkages). In contrast, the hypothesis of decoupling is supported for the Russian stock markets only. Finally, the skewed Student-t FIAPARCH models outperform and provide more accurate in-sample estimates and out-of-sample forecasts of VaR than the normal and Student-t FIAPARCH models in almost all cases. These results provide helpful information to financial risk managers, regulators and portfolio investors to determine the diversification benefits among these markets.

However, most renewables have very low SRMCs, which in a competitive market is likely to lead to an increasing proportion of low priced periods. Combined with concerns around the variable availability of some renewable generation types, this has led to suggestions that energy-only markets may need to be augmented with capacity remuneration mechanisms as their renewable penetration grows. This analysis explores the operation of energy-only markets with high renewables, with a case study of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Results suggest that existing energy-only market mechanisms have the potential to operate effectively in a 100% renewables scenario, but success will rely upon two critical factors. Firstly, an increase in the Market Price Cap is likely to be required. Preliminary analysis suggests this may need to increase from the present $13,500/MWh in the NEM to the range $60,000 to $80,000 /MWh. Alternatively, comprehensive demand side participation could allow each customer to select their preferred level of reliability and associated cost, removing the need for an administratively determined Market Price Cap. Secondly, a liquid and well:functioning derivative contracts market will be required to allow generators and retailers to hedge increased market risks successfully.","[Riesz, Jenny; Gilmore, Joel; Macgill, Lain] Univ New S Wales, Sch Elect Engn & Telecommun, Ctr Energy & Environm Markets, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Riesz, J (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Tyree Energy Technol Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",j.riesz@unsw.edu.au,,,CSIRO Future Grid project; Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA),CSIRO Future Grid project; Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)(Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)),"The authors thank Ben Skinner from the Australian Energy Market Operator, Simon Camroux from AGL and Kerry Burke from Westpac for their insightful comments and helpful feedback on this paper, and acknowledge funding from the CSIRO Future Grid project, and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).",,60,16,18,1,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The article's major finding is robust when controlling for potential endogeneity.

First, a substantial portion of the price impact of futures trades is persistent, indicating the presence of informed trading in the futures market. Second, informed trading is concentrated in the opening period. and liquidity trading is concentrated in the closing period of the continuous trading session. Third, small trades usually have a greater price impact than large ones, supporting the existence of stealth trading by futures traders. Fourth, trades by institutional investors have a greater price impact than those by individuals, suggesting that institutional investors are better informed and/or more sophisticated than individual investors in the futures market.

However, these studies remain silent about the role of institutional context for these mechanisms. Applying an extended sender-receiver model, we hypothesize that observing entrepreneurs reduces fear of failure in others in environments where approval of entrepreneurship is high, while this effect is significantly weaker in low-approval environments. Taking advantage of the natural experiment from recent German history and using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Project, we find considerable support for our hypotheses.","[Wyrwich, Michael] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Stuetzer, Michael] Baden Wurttemberg Cooperat State Univ, Coblitzallee 1-9, D-68193 Mannheim, Germany; [Stuetzer, Michael] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Inst Econ, Fac Econ Sci & Media, Ehrenbergstr 29, D-98684 Ilmenau, Germany; [Sternberg, Rolf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Technische Universitat Ilmenau; Leibniz University Hannover,"Wyrwich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",michael.wyrwich@uni-jena.de; michael.stuetzer@dhbw-mannheim.de; sternberg@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,,"Stuetzer, Michael/0000-0001-9375-8125; Sternberg, Rolf/0000-0002-7649-0419",,,,,109,127,142,11,177,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

A possible source of the mismatch in perceptions is that employers and educators have different understandings of the types of skills valued in the labor market. Using economics and psychology literature to define four skills sets-socio-emotional, higher-order cognitive, basic cognitive, and technical-this paper reviews the literature that quantitatively measures employer skill demand, as reported in a preference survey. A sample of 27 studies reveals remarkable consistency across the world in the skills demanded by employers. While employers value all skill sets, there is a greater demand for socio-emotional skills and higher-order cognitive skills than for basic cognitive or technical skills. These results are robust across region, industry, occupation, and education level. Employers perceive that the greatest skills gaps are in socio-emotional and higher-order cognitive skills. These findings suggest the need to re-conceptualize the public sector's role in preparing children for a future labor market. Namely, technical training is not equivalent to job training; instead, a broad range of skills, many of which are best taught long before labor market entry, should be included in school curricula from the earliest ages. The skills most demanded by employers-higher-order cognitive skills and socio-emotional skills-are largely learned or refined in adolescence, arguing for a general education well into secondary school until these skills are formed. Finally, the public sector can provide programming and incentives to non-school actors, namely parents and employers, to encourage them to invest in the skills development process.","[Cunningham, Wendy V.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Villasenor, Paula] Mexico Minist Educ, Upper Secondary Educ, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",The World Bank,"Cunningham, WV (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20005 USA.;Villaseñor, P (通讯作者)，Mexico Minist Educ, Upper Secondary Educ, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",Wcunningham@worldbank.org; paulavillasenor@gmail.com,,,,,,,106,23,36,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Further, we find that the strength of the media's monitoring has an important effect on corruption behavior and banks' performance.

Institutional theory allows us to characterize these local conditions not simply as particularistic oddities but rather as elements of an institutional matrix that affects the livelihoods of chain participants. However, the institutional dimension of GVC analysis has been traditionally neglected in the literature, to the detriment of our understanding of the impacts of upgrading in GVCs. This study aims to remedy this failure by illustrating how institutional context mediates between value chain upgrading and the livelihoods of chain participants. It particular, it seeks to elucidate how value chain upgrading spurs a process of change in the institutions that govern the livelihoods of suppliers in developing countries. This examination sheds light on the more general question of how value chain upgrading sometimes helps, but sometimes hurts, the welfare of chain participants. This theoretical contribution to the value chain literature is based upon an institutional analysis of primary qualitative data from more than 80 small-scale tea farmers in Nepal, some of whom had upgraded from conventional to organically certified production. Our study finds that value chain upgrading launches a process of institutional change that can be summarized in a general typology. The typology highlights how rules, strategies, organizations, and informal norms affect whether a given upgrading intervention yields livelihood benefits in a particular place. Upgrading can yield positive impacts in chain-linked livelihood dimensions, such as price, and yet induce negative changes in other livelihood dimensions, such as risk, and thereby yield overall adverse livelihood implications, in a process we dub immiserizing upgrading. These findings contribute to advancing the conceptual literature on global value chains (GVCs) by suggesting a general typology for cycles of institutional change that influence livelihood outcomes. The typology provides a framework to analyze such processes that is also of use to development practitioners seeking to understand the conditions under which upgrading worsens or improves the welfare of value chain participants. The research findings provide an interesting window into how certification schemes interact with the daily lives of the rural poor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Given relatively small turndown rates historically (Vos et al. in J Bank Finance 31(9):2648-2672, 2007), higher credit prices may be a more substantial growth constraint than the access to finance issues that have dominated the academic literature to date. To this end, we observe, inter alia, that firms who have recorded recent high growth are more likely to pay higher interest rates for the loan they obtained. Moreover, small-sized firms who intend to grow through the introduction of new products exhibit a higher probability of paying more for credit than their peers. Finally, acknowledging that banks are not risk funders, we discuss the potential policy implications of these findings.","[Rostamkalaei, Anoosheh; Freel, Mark] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, ESI, Lancaster, England; [Freel, Mark] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Lancaster University; University of Ottawa,"Rostamkalaei, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, ESI, Lancaster, England.",a.rostamkalaei@lancaster.ac.uk; Freel@telfer.uottawa.ca,"Freel, Mark/ABC-3583-2020","Freel, Mark/0000-0001-9849-5272; Rostamkalaei, Anoosheh/0000-0002-8719-0104",,,,,65,60,79,1,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Focusing on Mexico's massive but inefficient land reform, we argue that governments do so to underpin political survival.

Furthermore, PRI support eroded more slowly in states receiving more reform. The program, which carried restrictive property rights, thus served the PRI regime's electoral interests. But while land distribution generated a loyal political clientele, it generated steep costs lower long-term economic growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The introduction of significant tuition fees in higher education is often presented as an obvious reform. According to recurring arguments, the State is too poor to fund adequately higher education; tax-funding is anti-redistributive since the average taxpayer is poorer than the average higher education graduate; tuition fees are useful to improve the overall matching of students to school. However, after analysis and taken separately, none of these arguments appears convincing: public funding is not necessarily a poor funding; vertical equity is better pursued with progressive income taxation; selection is a better matching instrument than tuition fees in the presence of asymmetric information and credit aversion. Beyond vertical equity and efficiency, the issue of higher education financing remains primarily a distributive issue between those who attended higher education and those who did not. It is an issue of horizontal equity, which depends on one preferred vision of distributive justice, the role of higher education and the justification of progressive taxation.","[Allegre, Guillaume] OFCE, Paris, France",,"Allègre, G (通讯作者)，OFCE, Paris, France.",guillaume.allegre@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,47,1,1,1,16,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The fundamental role of the QHC can be seen in the EU policy documents such as Europe 2020 strategy. In this context the main purpose of the article is to evaluate the QHC in the EU countries at the macroeconomic level and to make comparison between so called new member states that joined the EU after the year 2004 and the old EU countries. Methodology/methods QHC is considered as a multidimensional phenomenon. As a result, in the research Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was applied. The method enables to evaluate the objects in terms of economic phenomena that have multidimensional character based on the set of detailed economic attributes ( (variables). In the research eight diagnostic variables were used. The synthetic index describing the relative level of QHC in the analysed economies was estimated, which enabled to propose a rating of the countries and group them into homogenous subsets. Scientific aim The scientific aim of the article was to evaluate the progress obtained by the new member states after joining the EU. As a result, two ratings grouping the EU countries from the once with the highest level of QHC to the once with its lowest level in the year 2004 and 2012 were determined. Findings The comparison of the ratings in the year 2004 and 2012 shows that most of the new member states have made a significant progress in the analysed period. Conclusions The conducted multidimensional research enabled to quantify QHC in the EU countries in the year 2004 and 2012 with application of multidimensional perspective. As a result it enabled to evaluate the changes of that phenomenon in the period and to point the countries that are the leaders in the field.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Ul Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Ul Gagarina 13A, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,20,2,2,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,80,85,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200009,0

The analysis was carried out in the Spanish market, considered to be an ideal market given its characteristics. The authors' results indicate that although investors as a whole react to new information from analysts and their activity increases, this reaction is not independent of the type of stock. Informed traders do not increase their activity with small stocks to the same extent as uninformed investors do. Furthermore, the influence of these movements on price discovery is not significant. The results suggest that the interpretation role of analysts is more important for less accessible firms in terms of assessing their growth opportunities. This role may enhance the herding behavior of uninformed agents trading in those small titles for which they would otherwise need to invest extra time and extra money for taking profitable decisions.","[Blasco, Natividad] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; [Corredor, Pilar] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Blasco, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Finance, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",nblasco@unizar.es,"Blasco, Natividad/K-5607-2017; Corredor, Pilar/G-7800-2015","Blasco, Natividad/0000-0001-5629-7526; Corredor, Pilar/0000-0003-1739-0095","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35946-C02-01, ECO2013-45568-R]; Government of Aragon/European Social Fund [S14/2]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Government of Aragon/European Social Fund,This study received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2012-35946-C02-01 and ECO2013-45568-R) and the Government of Aragon/European Social Fund (S14/2),,54,3,3,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Previous studies generally focus on the number of analysts following a firm to measure a firm's information environment. The frequency with which news is updated is often defined as an analyst's effort. Analysts provide more information to investors if they update news more frequently. This study examines whether the frequency of information updating for a particular firm affects the firm's performance. We apply three proxies for firm performance: stock liquidity, the cost of equity capital, and firm value. Our findings indicate that the analysts' effort as measured by the frequency of news updating is effective in providing additional power beyond the number of analysts to represent the information environment of a firm. Therefore, this study suggests that combining both the number of analysts following a firm and the frequency of news updating can be a better proxy for assessing a firm's information environment.

Using a sample of 1432 firm-year observations of Korean-listed firms during 2005-2010, we find that socially responsible firms are significantly and negatively associated with RAEM. More importantly, we find that this relationship is moderated by CG as measured by a composite CG index. These results remain robust after we perform various sensitivity analyses. This study primarily contributes to the literature on CSR, CG, and RAEM by providing evidence for the moderating role of CG on the relationship between CSR and RAEM.","[Cho, Eunho] New York Inst Technol, Nanjing Campus, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chun, Sungbin] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",New York Institute Technology; Sogang University,"Chun, S (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",youngwha@sogang.ac.kr,,,,,,,80,49,51,2,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

P-C insurers serve risk management and risk-bearing functions in the economy. Insurers create diversified risk pools consisting of large numbers of exposures. However, even in the most highly diversified risk pools, uncertainty is not reduced to zero, and insurers must hold equity capital to credibly promise that claims will be paid even if losses are higher than expected. We begin with a financial overview of the industry. Insurers are well capitalized and financially stable, withstanding large catastrophic events and economic crises. Analysis of capital regulation further shows that regulation is not binding for the vast majority of insurers. We then review the theoretical and empirical evidence on the most important economic phenomena impinging on capital in P-C insurance: underwriting cycles, internal capital markets (ICMs), and optimal capital structure. P-C insurers are heavy users of ICMs, and insurer ICM transactions are efficient. According to available evidence, P-C insurers have optimal capital structures and behave according to the trade-off theory of capital structure.","[Cummins, J.

The findings suggest that, when compared with independent and local chain-affiliated stores selling low-end goods, middle and high-end goods chain stores operating at upper levels of affiliation are charged a rent premium.

This method also allows us, first, to classify risk shifting practices depending on the group of creditors to which shareholders transfer risk (that is, our method implies a taxonomy of risk shifting), and second, to identify positive and negative incentives for risk shifting.

Among the most critical of these changes were the newly introduced legal requirements for companies to produce IFRS-based audit reports regardless of the size of the firms or whether they are publicly or privately held companies. We examine the issue of mandatory of IFRS reporting from the perspective of the Economic Theory of Networks with respect to creating and enhancing corporate value as well as net social benefits of network externalities. We look at a review of the international examples of value relevance of mandatory IFRS reporting in a number of markets though there exists quite a limited array of research and data on unlisted/private companies in the literature. However, the paper argues that considering; a) the importance of the private companies in the economy, b) the impact of audited statements on the companies' ability to access higher quality financial resources and higher levels of management efficiency and, c) the resulting outcome in more efficient allocation of capital in the economy, implementation of IFRS reporting in Turkey on as broad a scale as technically possible would constitute an important value driver at micro as well as macro economic levels.

In particular, we analyse the basis defined as the difference between the premium on the CDS and the credit spread on the underlying bond. Our sample of weekly data covers the period from January 2007 to December 2012 and contains several episodes of sovereign market distress. Overall, we observe a complex relationship between the derivatives market and the underlying cash market characterised by sizable deviations from the no-arbitrage relationship (i.e. basis equal to zero). We show that short-selling frictions explain the persistence of positive basis deviations while funding frictions explain the persistence of negative basis deviations which are observed for countries with weak public finances. Moreover, we show that the flight-to-quality/liquidity phenomenon in bond markets is a key driver of the large positive basis of better rated countries. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The paper is structured as follows. First, it explores the literature relating to the term of technology entrepreneurship and explores the issues of IT sector in Romania. The methodological tools were data-mining and case studies, followed by an analysis of the data and discussion of the results. Finally, the paper draws conclusions and makes recommendations for future research, policy and practice. For Romania, technology entrepreneurship is an immense opportunity. IT sector, above all, supports the Romanian economy and is a top employer. The success of this boom has manifold explanations governmental support, highly qualified, cost-effective human resources. Romania is the third leading country (after India and China) among software exporters. The present study reveals big disparities among regions in Romania, since the large majority of business incubators, business parks or hubs, spin-offs are located only in Bucharest area and in the region of Transylvania. The study reveals that in Romania Business incubators and Technology parks are very successful (such as Liberty Technology Park Cluj or Sema Park in Bucharest). It is difficult, however, to establish the exact financial success of these entities, since their members rarely disclose on their websites what are their profits, turnovers, the number of employees. There are almost no data on spin-offs in Romania. Yet, the disastrous case of UBIT, suggests that universities should be supported by both local community and private companies. Co-working spaces are soaring recently in major cities, hosting young entrepreneurs and start-ups, active in the sectors of technology or creative industries.","[Gheorghiu, Anda] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blv,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Gheorghiu, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blv,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",anda.gheorghiu@facultateademanagement.ro,"Gheorghiu, Anda E/D-2238-2015",,,,,,9,1,1,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,395,405,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300032,0

We draw three main conclusions. First, the uncertainty around the equilibrium rate is large, and its relationship with trend GDP growth much more tenuous than widely believed. Our narrative and econometric analysis using cross-country data and going back to the 19th century supports a wide range of plausible estimates for the current level of the equilibrium rate, from a little over 0 per cent to the pre-crisis consensus of 2 per cent. Second, a bivariate vector error correction model that looks only to U.S. and world real rates well captures the behavior of U.S. real rates. The model treats real rates as cointegrated unit root processes. As of the end of our sample (2014), the model forecasts the real rate in the U.S. will asymptote to an equilibrium value of a little less than half a percent by 2021. Consistent with our first point, however, confidence intervals around this point estimate are huge. Third, the uncertainty around the equilibrium rate argues for more inertial monetary policy than implied by standard versions of the Taylor rule. Our simulations using the Fed staff's FRB/US model show that explicit recognition of this uncertainty results in a later but steeper normalization path for the funds rate compared with the median dot in the FOMC' s Summary of Economic Projections.","[Hamilton, James D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Harris, Ethan S.] Bank Amer, Global Econ Res, Charlotte, NC USA; [Hatzius, Jan] Goldman Sachs, Global Econ & Markets Res, New York, NY USA; [West, Kenneth D.] Univ Wisconsin, Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Bank of America Corporation; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"West, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jhamilton@ucsd.edu; ethan.harris@baml.com; jan.hatzius@gs.com; kdwest@wisc.edu,"West, Kenneth D/A-5693-2008",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Jari Stehn and David Mericle for extensive help with the modeling work in Implications for Monetary Policy sections.

Entrepreneurs have developed new strategies to enter new markets and fend off competition using novel business model breakthroughs. Entrepreneurs in the new economy identify niches and develop new customers, new products and/or new architectural approaches (linking existing technologies in novel ways) to a market. Knowledge and information-represented by intellectual capital-have become increasingly important drivers of production and commerce. As important as intellectual capital has become, the business model which gains economic rewards from this intellectual capital has become even more important. Within this context, strategies have evolved that begin with the intellectual capital (driving innovation) and development of business models that support electronic business models. Do new technology and technology streams drive the development of novel business models or does the novel business model drive strategic focus and intellectual capital development (innovation) to serve the new business models? How does a business model for these emergent businesses develop and what elements of business model and strategy develop and with what is the sequential timing in this new environment? In this paper, I will draw upon several well-known companies(Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Tesla) and compare their progression through the strategic frontier of new and novel to develop a model of what comes first; strategy, business model or intellectual capital (driving innovation). This model will be valuable as managers develop business plans to bring new ideas to market or novel new business models to apply.. This paper explores the major model within the strategy, intellectual capital and business models using a literature review of each of these topics. The two models from this research offer some clear paths in this conceptual paper.","[Harlow, Harold] Wingate Univ, Dept Management, Porter Byrum Sch Business, Charlotte, NC USA",Wingate University,"Harlow, H (通讯作者)，Wingate Univ, Dept Management, Porter Byrum Sch Business, Charlotte, NC USA.",h.harlow@wingate.edu,,,,,,,69,0,0,1,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,104,111,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300013,0

The following indicators were used: pro-poor growth index (Kakwani and Pernia, 2000), poverty equivalent growth rate (Kakwani and Son, 2008), poverty growth curve (Son, 2004), and the rate of pro-poor growth (Ravallion and Chen, 2003). Applied to Bangladesh, the results of the four indicators mostly point in the same direction. While the conditions for the pro-poor growth in the strict (relative) sense were rarely met, all the indicators suggest there was a certain degree of pro-poor element in the growth process. However, there were noticeable differences between the two periods. In the first period, the growth led to a faster reduction in absolute poverty while inequality increased, whereas in the second period the poor benefited relatively more from growth but the reduction of poverty was less pronounced (since the growth in the mean income was lower in the second period). The results also show that the relatively richer part of the poor population (those not far below the poverty line) benefited more from the growth process than the poorest of the poor.","[Harmacek, Jaromir; Syrovatka, Miroslav; Schlossarek, Martin; Pavlik, Petr] Univ Palackeho, Olomouci, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Harmácek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Palackeho, Olomouci, Czech Republic.",jaromir.harmacek@upol.cz; miroslav.syrovatka@upol.cz; martin.schlossarek@upol.cz; petr.pavlik@upol.cz,"HARMÁČEK, Jaromír/IWV-3110-2023; Syrovátka, Miroslav/B-6427-2018","HARMÁČEK, Jaromír/0000-0002-3711-0663; Syrovátka, Miroslav/0000-0003-0409-4182",,,,,26,1,1,0,13,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

They define, characterize, and compute Markov-perfect risk-sharing contracts with bargaining. These contracts significantly improve consumption smoothing and welfare relative to self-insurance through savings. Incorporating savings decisions into the contract (asset contractibility) implies sizable gains for both the insurers and the insured. The size and distribution of these gains depend critically on the insurers' market power. Finally, a rate of return advantage for insurers destroys surplus and is thus harmful to both contracting parties.","[Karaivanov, Alexander K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Martin, Fernando M.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Simon Fraser University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Karaivanov, AK (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,"Martin, Fernando M/I-5747-2016; Karaivanov, Alexander/AAX-4761-2021","Martin, Fernando M/0000-0001-5045-7998; Karaivanov, Alexander/0000-0002-5184-3126",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2013-0698],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Alexander K.

It is true that research of Europeanization relates not only to the new member states, but it is also true that this process in Central Europe has acquired a completely new connotation.

To expand what is known about risk factors for violence, this study investigates links between having a parent with a history of incarceration and experiencing social exclusion. Data from waves 1 and 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to conduct regression analyses to assess associations between parental incarceration and social exclusion adjusting for child, parent, and family factors. Results indicate that compared to individuals whose parents had never been incarcerated, those who reported a parent had been incarcerated were at greater risk of experiencing material exclusion, incarceration, and multiple forms of exclusion. When assessing differences by parent gender, results indicate that those who reported their mother had been incarcerated compared to those who reported their father had been incarcerated had higher risk of being incarcerated themselves and experiencing multiple forms of exclusion. Since research suggests social exclusion increases violence risk, studies are needed (1) to identify mechanisms linking parental incarceration to offspring social exclusion and (2) to increase understanding around differential impact by parent gender. Such studies can inform development of interventions to promote better outcomes in this vulnerable sub-population of children.","[Lee, Rosalyn D.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Injury Prevent & Control, Div Violence Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Fang, Xiangming] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Feijun] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Injury Prevent & Control, Div Anal Res & Practice Integrat, Atlanta, GA USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; China Agricultural University; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Lee, RD (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Injury Prevent & Control, Div Violence Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",,"Fang, Xiangming/B-8650-2014; Fang, Xiangming/O-1653-2014","Fang, Xiangming/0000-0001-9922-8977",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J.

There are economists who reject the principle of central banking model as well as the European Monetary Union and the ECB. They also include F. A. Hayek, a representative of the Austrian school. The starting point of Hayek's concept is the claim that money is not different from other goods. The supply of money could be better ensured by private entities which would issue private money and thus compete with the money issued by the state. Hayek was against the creation of a single currency in the EU. According to him, individual national currencies are the better one, which could be used freely in the EU. Each country would issue only the amount of money that would ensure its stability. Experience has shown that the central banks cannot always ensure internal and external stability of the currency and of the whole economy as well. Therefore, the problems which are currently faced by the EU and the euro area are confronted with the views of Hayek and are the subject for further scientific discussion.","[Lisy, Jan] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lisy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",jan.lisy@euba.sk,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,SOCIETAS SCIENTIARUM OLOMUCENSIS II,OLOMOUC,"KRIZKOVSKEHO 10, OLOMOUC, 77900, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87533-14-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,280,284,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5TX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389757500040,0

We exploit detailed data on unsuccessful takeover bids between 1980 and 2008, and we show that targets of cash offers are revalued on average by 15% after deal failure, whereas stock targets return to their pre-announcement levels. The differences in revaluation do not revert over longer horizons. We find no evidence that future takeover activities or operational changes explain these differences. While the targets of failed cash and stock offers are both more likely to be acquired over the following eight years than matched control firms, no differences exist between cash and stock targets, either in the timing or in the value of future offers. Similarly, we cannot detect differential operational policies following the failed bid. Our results are most consistent with cash bids revealing prior undervaluation of the target We reconcile our findings with the opposite conclusion in earlier literature (Bradley, Desai, and Kim, 1983) by identifying a look-ahead bias built into their sample construction.

Methodology/methods An empirical study on the subject of disclosures of intangible assets was conducted on selective companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in Poland. Annual reports of 57 companies perceived by investors as having hidden potential contributing to the generation of market value of the enterprise were analyzed. The methodology of Guthrie and Petty based on the aggregation of studied intangible assets within the three basic components of intellectual capital: human capital, organizational capital and structural capital (Guthrie and Petty, 2000) was adopted for the study. The scientific aim is to fill the science gap in the area of disclosures dealing with intangible assets contributing to intellectual capital. Findings Companies included in the study were characterized by a low quantitative range of disclosures dealing with intangible assets contributing to intellectual capital. This is confirmed by the overall value of the ICD - 49.9%, which means that the number of indications within the area of intangible assets contributing to intellectual capital in analyzed reports did not exceed 50%. Conclusions The scope of reporting in the area of intangible assets is determined on the one hand by the constraints of the effective accounting standards and on the other by the information policy of companies in the area of disclosures in regards to those intangible assets which do not meet the definition of assets and are not expressed as elements of the balance sheet.","[Michalczuk, Grazyna] Univ Bialystok, M Sklodowskiej Currie 14, PL-15097 Bialystok, Poland; [Widelska, Urszula] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok; Bialystok University of Technology,"Widelska, U (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",u.widelska@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,455,462,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200057,0

A large proportion of private-sector enterprises is owned and at the same time managed by individuals or by families. Opinion exists in business literature and among entrepreneurs that growing companies outgrow their founder's managerial capabilities, and unless the founder is replaced or supplemented by professional management, performance is predicted to stagnate or decline. This paper contains review literature on challenges for owner-managed companies and owner contribution to performance of the SMEs. Methodology/methods Literature review is undertaken using the overview method in order to identify ways how owners-managers impact SME management system and performance. Key findings were discussed in three focus groups with representatives of Latvian owner-manager companies during September 2015-February 2016. Scientific aim To evaluate through literature review the impact of owner-manager personality on SME performance. Findings This paper identifies variety in terminology around SMEs and their owners-managers, and presents several ways on how owners-manager impacts company management system, performance and culture. Conclusions The literature review draws attention to the controversy of the topic around role of the owner-manager in small and medium sized enterprise. There is evidence of both differences and similarities between owner-managed and professionally managed enterprises from the management systems and performance perspectives. It is identified that issues of owner-manged companies are discussed in publications, using wide range of terminology, including founder-managed and family-owned companies, owner-CEO, and other. There is need for a further study using holistic approach that will include both internal factors influencing management system and performance of owner-managed small and medium enterprises, as well as external factors, such as stakeholder relationships and market conditions.","[Millers, Maris; Gaile-Sarkane, Elina; Sceulovs, Deniss] Riga Tech Univ, Kalku Iela 1, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Millers, M (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Kalku Iela 1, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia.",maris.millers@rtu.lv,"Gaile-Sarkane, Elina/HLQ-5653-2023",,,,,,23,0,0,1,13,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,579,585,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200072,0

Design/methodology/approach - Using a panel data set of commercial banks in the Mercosur during the period 1990-2006, the authors analyze the impact of crises on four sets of financial indicators of bank behavior and outcomes - profitability, maturity preference, credit supply, and risk taking. The authors employ convergence methodology - which is often used in the growth literature - to identify the evolution of bank behavior in the region after crises. Findings - A key finding of the paper is that bank risk-taking behavior is significantly modified leading to prolonged reduction of intermediation to the private sector in favor of less risky government securities and preference for high levels excess liquidity well after the crisis. This can be attributed to the role played by macroeconomic and institutional volatility that has nurtured a relatively high level of risk aversion in banks in the Mercosur. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, using convergence methodology is a relatively novel approach in this area. An added advantage of using this approach over others currently used in the literature is that the authors can empirically quantify the rate of convergence and the institutional and macroeconomic factors that condition the convergence. Moreover, the methodology allows one to identify - in some hierarchical order - factors that condition persistent deviation from normality. The lessons learned from the Mercosur case study are useful for countries that suffered systemic banking crises in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.","[Mlachila, Montfort; Sanya, Sarah] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Mlachila, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mmlachila@imf.org,,"MLACHILA, MONTFORT/0000-0003-2533-3728",,,,,52,3,3,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

This article investigates whether commercialisation is able to increase the intensification and yield of banana and legumes in central Africa. The study utilises survey data from 480 smallholder farmers in selected regions in rural Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The findings show a positive effect of commercialisation on improved seed varieties use and food crop yields, even after controlling for an endogeneity problem. There is no strong evidence of commercialisation effect on fertilizer use among the sampled farm households. Apart from commercialisation, better education, larger farm sizes, access to markets and credit facilities, good roads and extension contacts are necessary for farmers to increase input use and crop yields. Overall, these findings suggest that programmes targeting to increase smallholder farm productivity through commercialisation will only work if they consider production and marketing conditions surrounding the target households.","[Ochieng, Justus] World Vegetable Ctr, Arusha, Tanzania; [Knerr, Beatrice] Univ Kassel, Dept Dev Econ Migrat & Agr Policy, Kassel, Germany; [Owuor, George] Egerton Univ, Njoro, Nakuru, Kenya; [Ouma, Emily] ILRI, Kampala, Uganda",Universitat Kassel; Egerton University; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Ochieng, J (通讯作者)，World Vegetable Ctr, Arusha, Tanzania.",justus.ochieng@worldveg.org,,"Justus, Ochieng/0000-0002-6326-1377",,,,,40,22,22,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,4,,,,,458,482,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1243062,0.0,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EI7SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392703200007,0

This is being used not only in an attempt to stimulate the economy, but to finance government expenditure, although the latter has been less commented upon. Whilst being necessary short term measures, they bring potential dangers to the future not least with respect to inflation. All of this has propelled central banks, and central bankers to the forefront of economic policy making, so much so that there may be a case for regarding them as an emerging fourth branch of government.

They implemented lexicographic analysis of Twitter data over a three-month period and found that talk intensity of economic issues not only causes shifts in the daily stock market prices, but also has a significant negative effect.","[Reed, Markum] Southeast Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Reed, M (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Jiulonghu Campus,Bldg A 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",markumreed@seu.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,12,14,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

In particular, the main idea of employing various GARCH models is to determine which one of these linear and nonlinear asymmetric models perform more accurate in terms of ingroups and intergroups activities. Therefore, the main purpose of the paper is to determine a model which ensures to get a maximum return with response to the minimum loss for returns of the investments held by individual investors and fund managers, private sector budget planning decision makers, and state agencies forecasting about macroeconomic indicators. To do this, the ten-days out-of-sample volatility forecasts of Loss Functions to capture the forecasting performance of GARCH class models and to prevent forecasting errors with efficiency hedge ratio in energy market are being considered. For two periods, asymmetric and integrated GARCH models give relatively more accurate performance than other available models. Respectively, for the first period, minimum loss model is FIGARCH-BBM (SST) and for the second period, is EGARCH(GED) for WTI crude oil series in consideration of MSE and MAE criterion. Similarly, for the first period minimum loss model is FIGARCH-BBM (SST) and for the second period, is EGARCH(GED) for Henry Hub natural gas series in consideration of MSE and MAE criterion.

The scale changes over time, the profits are gradually getting to the generalized use of the EVA. Firm measures such as ROA and ROE are a prerequisite for the creation of EVA. Inputs of the most widely used measures are of financial nature. Experts warn that the hard scales can be used to evaluate the past, but even non-financial indicators should be addressed (Pollak, 2004). Definitions of non-financial indicators are not as consistent and accurate as financial measures that are now compatible worldwide. Likewise, the influence of individual non-financial parameters of success of the company is very hard to measure. This is often the reason for their neglect. The article deals with monitoring the non-financial indicators in the Czech manufacturing companies of medium size. Methodology/methods The research is focused on the communication between companies and the public, which is based on annual reports, and they are monitoring the non financial information. In the Czech Republic there is a valid legislation that defines the work and subsequent regulations, which recommend how to structure the companies' annual reports. As part of the orientation on CSR European Commission (European Comission, 2016b) recommends a reference to the annual reports they give an assessment of non-financial indicators and the interests of stakeholders. The present research compiled annual reports of 100 selected Czech companies for the year 2014. Companies were selected so that it was not in the company's results did not show extreme dominanceonthe market - the sample consisted of medium firms, successful, transparent and mainly active in manufacturing. 12 areas have been identified for evaluation and monitoring by the scale of the extent to which the annual report mentions the aspect. The data were processed using descriptive statistics. We set the rate of including various aspects of corporate monitoring and presentation and subsequent mutual respect by the correlation coefficient. Scientific aim The aim of the study was to determine the extent to which Czech companies work with non-financial indicators, especially those oriented stakeholders. A secondary aim was to determine how prepared they are to reflect the renovation of recommendations of the annual report by the European Commission, which will come into force in 2017. We observed that non-financial aspects in their annual reports are elaborated now. Findings Companies are taking the annual report as a document necessary or a form of publicity, a way to publish product information, history and basic business activities. Companies must disclose the date of the financial statements, but some indicators based on them publish only 57% of firms. From stakeholder groups to report the most engaged employees -67% of reports about them speak more than just superficially. Also mentioned are strongly oriented tactical plans for the immediate future. From the research it can be stated that Czech companies still do not pay more distant stakeholders and distant future, sufficient attention. Document annual reports are used more as an internal message than as a product of public relations. Conclusions Research has confirmed that Czech companies have created a sufficiently strong network of public relations outside the company, even in the nearest vicinity of corporate stakeholders. Results are limited to a selected sample of companies, but also a source of information - the companies do not pay attention to the annual report document.","[Scholleova, Hana] Czech Tech Univ, Masaryk Inst Adv Studies, Kolejni 2a, Prague 16000 6, Dejvice, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Scholleová, H (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Masaryk Inst Adv Studies, Kolejni 2a, Prague 16000 6, Dejvice, Czech Republic.",hana.scholleova@cvut.cz,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,328,335,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200041,0

A total of 984 farming households were randomly selected from four districts of KwaZulu-Natal, and data were analysed using the double-hurdle model. The econometric results indicated that use of social grants had a positive impact on the level of fertiliser use, while increasing dependency on social grants had no significant negative impact. The positive influence of social grants on the amount of inorganic fertiliser used suggests that these grants play a significant role in alleviating the liquidity constraints faced by poor farmers. This result is consistent with the presence of credit constraints that limit poor households' ability to invest in modern farming technologies. To increase technology adoption among the poor, the study recommends that policymakers should address imperfections in the rural credit markets, increase smallholders' assets in order to increase their risk-bearing capacity and improve the expected profitability of using inorganic fertiliser.","[Sinyolo, Sikhulumile; Mudhara, Maxwell; Wale, Edilegnaw] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Sinyolo, S (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Durban, South Africa.",sksinyolo@gmail.com; Mudhara@ukzn.ac.za; WaleE@ukzn.ac.za,"Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/JXY-0016-2024; Wale, Edilegnaw/N-5292-2013; Sinyolo, Sikhulumile/F-8769-2018; Wale, Edilegnaw/AAC-9048-2021","Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971; Sinyolo, Sikhulumile/0000-0001-9324-081X; Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971",,,,,53,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,4,,,,,436,457,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1243063,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EI7SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392703200006,0

The article is one of the first attempts to colligate the theory of order with one of the economy's sectors - services. Thus the aim of the work constitutes a cause for discussion about a place and a role of services in the economic order as well as the feedback they provide each other. Methodology/methods Assuming that services may represent peculiar combination of administered order and spontaneous order, the concept of ordoliberalism and the concept of social market economy have been used for the analysis and the synthetic approach. Scientific aim The quest within the confines of this research field requires answering the questions from the area between services and economic order: How do services support and realize the ordo rule? May one relate the ordo rule to services in the first place? Findings Such background entails two theses: The development of services favors economic order. These services may include legal services or advisory services. However, the development of creative services, e.g. advertising or services connected with financial engineering, upsets or may upset the economic order. Conclusions Depending on the type of order, directed (administered) or spontaneous (market) one, services are more or less coupled with the order. Public services are governed by a state, and market services are shaped by the market.","[Skapska, Elzbieta] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Skapska, E (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",e.skapska@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,403,408,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200050,0

The EBA approach is applied for the indebted countries in the MENA region during the 1970 to 2010 period to determine whether economic and political factors are robust or fragile. This study finds that debt accumulated arrears can be perceived as a signal of default and can warn MENA countries to prevent total failure or at least alleviate the severity of the default. This paper is important for policy makers in the MENA region when seeking to reduce the probability of default. Many recommendations are offered to the indebted MENA countries. For example, they should (1) attract more foreign reserves through adjusting domestic policies and regulations of investment, (2) enact proactive fiscal policies, and (3) fight corruption and promote democracy.

For two asymmetric countries facing the challenge of a transboundary pollution problem, we compare the relative efficiency of these two second-best agreements. We study especially the role of the costs associated with transfer payments across countries in the choice of these agreements. To conduct this analysis, we use a negotiation game and the generalized Nash bargaining solution (Nash in Econometrica 21: 128-140, 1953) as the equilibrium. For total welfare, our findings show that countries collectively prefer the uniform to the differentiated agreement if the cost of transfers is sufficiently low compared to the ratio for countries of the difference of the abatement costs between the two agreements. In the analysis of individual welfare, we also discuss the reluctance of one country to sign a specific type of agreement even if it is better off than in the case of non-cooperation.","[Bayramoglu, Basak] INRA AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 09, LEDa CGEMP, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, 2 Rue Jean Carbonnier Bat 1,BP 623, F-86022 Poitiers, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite de Poitiers,"Bayramoglu, B (通讯作者)，INRA AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Basak.Bayramoglu@grignon.inra.fr; jacques@dauphine.fr,"Bayramoglu, Basak/X-1281-2019","Bayramoglu, Basak/0000-0002-0847-5858",,,,,36,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Duverger (Les partis politiques, 1951) proposed that plurality rule leads to bi-partyism and proportional representation leads to multi-partyism. We show that in a dynamic setting, these static effects also lead to a higher option value for existing minor parties under plurality rule, so their incentive to exit the party system is mitigated by their future benefits from continued participation. The predictions of our model are consistent with multiple cross-sectional predictions on the comparative number of parties under plurality rule and proportional representation. In particular, there could be more parties under plurality rule than under proportional representation at any point in time. However, our model makes a unique time-series prediction: the number of parties under plurality rule should be less variable than under proportional representation.

Or do carbon leakage and the rebound effect imply that it is possible to take advantage of technological improvements under the umbrella of a global arrangement only? For answering these questions two possible states of the world are discussed: one, where more energy efficient technologies are transferred unconditionally from the North to the South, and where regions do not cooperate in the solution of the global climate problem but unilaterally decide on climate policies and technology transfers; one, where the North-to-South technology transfer is tied to the requirement that the South in some way contributes to the solution of the global climate problem. Rebound and leakage effects hinder a sustainable and welfare improving solution of the climate problem.","[Stephan, Gunter] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res OCCR, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland; [Stephan, Gunter] DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Mueller-Fuerstenberger, Georg] Univ Trier, Dept Econ, Trier, Germany",University of Bern; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Universitat Trier,"Stephan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res OCCR, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland.",gunter.stephan@vwi.unibe.ch,,,Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate); Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Trade Regulations (NCCR Trade) - Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate); Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Trade Regulations (NCCR Trade) - Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),"Financial support by the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) as well as the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research on Trade Regulations (NCCR Trade) funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) is gratefully acknowledged.

The survey was conducted in 2009 in the Reykjavik capital region of Iceland and yielded 1,160 responses. Descriptive analyses and multivariate statistics are applied. The results demonstrate the economic crisis influenced people's travel behavior. About 30% of the participants make fewer trips since the crisis, due in part to reduced income and/or unemployment, suggesting increased risk of transport-related social exclusion. About 20% of the participants perceive bus transit as more important than before, to some extent at the expense of personal automobiles. Important variables associated with reduced trip frequency and increased importance of bus transit were: working more at home and more than 40% household income reduction. Those using their own vehicle less also reported greater bus transit importance. The residents in the suburbs of Reykjavik and in the nearby communities were more likely than the residents in central parts of Reykjavik to reduce their number of trips, suggesting that central city residents were less sensitive to the economic crisis in terms of transportation. The importance of the bus system was found more based on personal and household characteristics than neighborhood type (urban, suburban, nearby communities). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Immigrant families often come to the US for a better life and to improve their economic opportunities; however, immigrants experience higher levels of poverty than their native-born counterparts. Despite their financial concerns, less than half of eligible immigrant families in the US receive government assistance. Framed within ecocultural theory, qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews with 40 low-income immigrant mothers from Latin America and Africa, were conducted to examine the economic experiences of immigrant families, including the process of building economic security. The findings indicate that mothers' development of economic security was shaped by their ecocultural context including the intersection of: accessibility of government programs, family situations, and unique needs of their families.","[Vesely, Colleen] George Mason Univ, Coll Educ & Human Dev, 1102 Thompson Hall,MSN 4C2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Goodman, Rachael; Ewaida, Marriam; Kearney, Katina] George Mason Univ, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Vesely, CK (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Coll Educ & Human Dev, 1102 Thompson Hall,MSN 4C2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",cvesely@gmu.edu,"Goodman, Rachael/GVU-0841-2022",,Child Care Scholars Dissertation Grant Program in the Office of Child Care within the US Department of Health and Human Services,Child Care Scholars Dissertation Grant Program in the Office of Child Care within the US Department of Health and Human Services,The data used in this paper were collected with support from the Child Care Scholars Dissertation Grant Program in the Office of Child Care within the US Department of Health and Human Services.,,61,18,29,1,5,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

By comparing lending changes within a group of banks that lend to the same facility of the same firm in the same year, it eliminates the impacts of demand-side factors that often bias the results of empirical studies on bank credit supply. Overall, I find that TARP, DW, and TAF played only a marginal role in increasing bank syndicated lending. By examining lending changes at the facility-lender and firm-lender levels, this study is less prone to the reverse causality problem that is inherent in studies using bank-level data. Therefore, this study complements studies using bank-level data and provides policymakers with a balanced view on the effects of these programs.

It analyses the effect of women's employment and economic contribution to their household on health care use at three phases in the reproductive cycle: before pregnancy, during pregnancy and at child birth. Economic empowerment shows a positive effect on health seeking behaviour during pregnancy and at child birth, which remains robust after controlling for bargaining power and selection bias. This indicates that any policy that increases women's economic empowerment can have a direct positive impact on women's RH.","[Westeneng, Judith] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Cultural Anthropol & Dev Studies, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands; [D'Exelle, Ben] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of East Anglia,"Westeneng, J (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Cultural Anthropol & Dev Studies, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",jwesteneng@hotmail.com,,,PopDev program of NWO-WOTRO; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Tanzanian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),PopDev program of NWO-WOTRO; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Tanzanian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support of the PopDev program of NWO-WOTRO and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the collaboration with Dr. Switbert Kamazima from Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) from Tanzania and the support from the Tanzanian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

In this unified framework, we examine the twelve potential intertemporal relationships among inflation, growth and their respective uncertainties using US data. We find that high inflation is detrimental to output growth both directly and indirectly via the nominal uncertainty. Output growth boosts inflation but mainly indirectly through a reduction in real uncertainty. Our findings highlight how macroeconomic performance affects nominal and real uncertainty in many ways and that the bidirectional relation between inflation and growth works to a large extent indirectly via the uncertainty channel.","[Conrad, Christian] Heidelberg Univ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Karanasos, Menelaos] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Brunel University,"Conrad, C (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",,,"Conrad, Christian/0000-0001-7981-2615",,,,,49,11,12,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We rely on potential variations in earthquake risk perceptions by floor level to assess whether the pricing of apartments in lower versus upper floors is consistent with a disproportionate fear of heights. We use a unique transaction dataset for new apartment units in the affected area. We find that the relative price of low to high floor units, particularly units located in the first and second floor, considerably increased for several months after the earthquake and then returned back to the levels observed prior to the tremor. This temporal increase in relative prices is in line with a higher risk perception and fear, triggered after the earthquake, of living in upper floors, which gradually dissipated over time. The results are robust to alternative model estimations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Second, even though China's production network is mainly Asian, its parts and components trading partners are increasingly global. Brazil also increasingly trades its parts with China and East Asia, while Mexico is still focused on its trade with the United States.

A large body of literature corroborates this belief. But, could the incentives for corporate social responsibility (CSR) come from an altruistic inclination fostered by the social capital of the region in which the firm is headquartered? We investigate whether this phenomenon exists by examining the association between the social capital in the region and the firm's CSR. We find that a firm from a high social capital region exhibits higher CSR. This result suggests that the self-interest of shareholders or mangers does not explain all of the firm's CSR, but the altruistic inclination from the region might also play a role.

The endogeneity of the IMF intervention is addressed by adopting an instrumental variable strategy and a propensity score matching estimator. Controlling for the standard determinants of banking crises, the results indicate that countries participating in IMF-supported lending programs are significantly less likely to experience a future banking crisis than nonborrowing countries. The paper also provides evidence suggesting that compliance with conditionality and loan size matter, corroborating the importance of IMF-supported reform and liquidity provision for banking sector stability.","[Papi, Luca; Zazzaro, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Econ, Ancona, Italy; [Papi, Luca; Presbitero, Andrea F.; Zazzaro, Alberto] MoFiR, Chicago, IL USA; [Presbitero, Andrea F.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Zazzaro, Alberto] CSEF, Madison, WI USA",Marche Polytechnic University; International Monetary Fund,"Papi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Econ, Ancona, Italy.",l.papi@univpm.it; apresbitero@imf.org; a.zazzaro@univpm.it,,"Presbitero, Andrea/0000-0003-4622-941X",U.K. Department for International Development (DfID) [60925],U.K. Department for International Development (DfID),"The authors thank Axel Dreher, Christopher Kilby, and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti for providing data on IMF compliance with conditionality, UN votes and foreign assets and liabilities, respectively.

Using a sample of shareholder proposals from 1993 to 2013 and a hand-collected data set of the political variables of public pension funds, we document evidence consistent with the political attention hypothesis. We find that the number of politicians on public pension fund boards is significantly positively related to the frequency with which portfolio firms are targeted. Moreover, the frequency of social-responsibility proposals by public pension funds increases significantly, as the funds have a greater number of board members running for election to public office. However the frequency of corporate governance proposals is not related to the number of board members running for elections to public office. Furthermore, we document that political connection between a portfolio firm and a public pension fund mitigates the firm's likelihood of being targeted by the fund with social-responsibility proposals. This result supports the political contribution hypothesis. The paper provides direct evidence that public pension-fund board members employ shareholder proposals to enhance their political capital.

While it can work in favor of girls by improving relative female wages or average household income, it can worsen the relative preference for girls by changing marriage payments. This paper exploits an exogenous policy shock in India to study the impact of trade openness on son preference, as reflected in the sex-ratio. Survival chances of girls worsened in regions experiencing high trade openness, particularly for Hindus belonging to traditionally higher castes. I argue that Dowry inflation is a possible channel through which trade liberalization affected sex-ratio.

The evaluation of their effect is still controversial. Unlike previous research, our purpose is to appraise to what extent firm growth reacts to a decrease in the cost of labor per employee. We tackle this question using an unbalanced panel of French establishments operating in the manufacturing industry between 2004 and 2011. We run estimations using a 2-STEP estimator making it possible to estimate the impact of explanatory variables on job creation at any point of the distribution of establishments' employment growth rate, while also controlling for individual fixed-effects component. Our results show that the effect of the decrease in the labor cost generated by tax rebates mainly benefits fast growing and large establishments. Indeed, the change in the number of employees in other establishments is significantly less affected, even though the effect remains positive, by the reduction in social contributions. This is particularly the case for smaller establishments as well as for those whose growth is stagnant or negative. These results lead us to reconsider the relevance of large-scale policies aiming at reducing labor costs in the same way for all establishments, regardless of their size or financial health.","[Garsaa, Aziza] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Garsaa, Aziza; Levratto, Nadine] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Levratto, Nadine] CEE, Noisy Le Grand, France; [Levratto, Nadine] Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Nanterre; Kedge Business School,"Levratto, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, Bldg G,200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",Aziza.Garsaa@u-paris10.fr; nadine.levratto@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,58,9,9,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Will small farmers, in particular, be squeezed out of this growing, remunerative market by the quality standards imposed by supermarkets? In an attempt to answer this question, we analyse data from a stratified random sample of 1,180 urban households in Indonesia. We find that only a small share of fruits and vegetables are purchased from modern outlets, even among high-income urban households. On the basis of the relation between income and shopping patterns in our data, we project that even after 15 years of income growth, supermarkets will account for less than 40% of urban food spending. The impact of supermarket standards on small farmers may be less dramatic than has been feared.","[Minot, Nicholas] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Paris, France; [Stringer, Randy; Umberger, Wendy J.; Maghraby, Wahida] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Adelaide,"Minot, N (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Paris, France.",,"Umberger, Wendy/HSF-2064-2023","Umberger, Wendy/0000-0003-4159-7782; Minot, Nicholas/0000-0001-9657-0427",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research,Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research,"This article was made possible by financial support from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

Specifically, we study memory biases in the ability to remember people within and across races, in a context where there is no difference in the distribution of payoffs across racial groups. Participants see pictures of people-whom we call candidates-of White and East Asian origin, learn payoff-relevant information about them, and then are asked to identify the candidates associated with the highest payoffs. I find that people are much better able to recall candidates with higher payoffs if they are of the same race. Candidates of the other race are more likely to be confused with each other. This leads to positive and negative discrimination at the same time: those at the bottom of the distribution benefit whereas those at the top lose out. These results suggest that cognitive biases could play a role in the nature of cross-racial relations, in particular for phenomena relying on repeated interactions and individual recognition, such as the formation and maintenance of social ties and the establishment of trust relationships.","[Belot, Michele] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Belot, M (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, 30 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",michele.belot@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,13,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The computation of the LIX index combines the conic finance theory, which recognizes the two-price economy and is built upon the concept of indices of acceptability of Cherny and Madan (2010), with the option payoff spanning formula of Breeden and Litzenberger (1978). Matching the conic finance bid and ask prices of the stock with those observed in the market allows us to derive a model-free and unit-less indicator of spot liquidity. Just as the VIX and the SKEW index quantify the volatility and the tail risk perceived by today's investors, the resulting LIX index measures, in a similar market-implied fashion, the liquidity risk. The maximum likelihood estimation of popular mean-reverting processes applied to model-free liquidity time series indicates that spot liquidity tends to dry up during distress periods whereas a global drying-up of liquidity could not be detected during turmoil periods in the option market.

We apply our model to study the effect of the implementation of Chile's Tender Offer Law in 2000 and find that control premiums fell significantly.

Our main finding is that, although global commodity prices are indeed related to real and financial processes in the euro area macroeconomy, the relations among them are not stable over time. Energy prices and interest rates depart from real processes in the pre-crisis period, whereas the relative importance of real and financial factors changes for non-energy commodity price index.

By contrast, negotiating a single internationally-binding minimum carbon price (the proceeds from which are domestically retained) counters self-interest by incentivizing agents to internalize the externality. In this contribution I attempt to sketch out, mostly with verbal arguments, the sense in which each agent's extra cost from a higher emissions price is counter-balanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price. Some implications are discussed. While the paper could be centered on a more formal model, here the tone of the discussion resembles more that of an exploratory think piece directed to policy-makers and the general public.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Weitzman, ML (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mweitzman@harvard.edu,,,,,,,22,28,29,0,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We include the actual foreclosure times in the analysis to capture the dynamic nature of foreclosure duration. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find a statistically and economically significant impact of foreclosure delay on borrower default behavior. In the current market condition where many borrowers have negative equity, the increase in delay may make default an optimal choice for more borrowers. The negative effect of increased foreclosure delay may need to be considered when devising policies to aid troubled borrowers.","[Zhu, Shuang] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Pace, R.

Because information asymmetry is likely higher for cross-listed bonds than for U.S. bonds, we expect and find that cross-listed bonds are rated more conservatively than U.S. domestic bonds at issuance. Further, cross-listed bonds receive less frequent upgrades and take longer to be upgraded after issuance. Because lower ratings might also reflect higher default risk based on agencies' private information, we conduct additional tests to discriminate between the rating conservatism and private information explanations. The results are consistent with ratings conservatism and inconsistent with the private information explanation.","[Atilgan, Yigit] Sabanci Univ, Sch Management, Finance, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ghosh, Aloke (Al)] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Yan, Meng] Fordham Univ, Accounting & Taxat Area, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Zhang, Jieying] Univ Texas Dallas, Accounting, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",Sabanci University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); Fordham University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Atilgan, Y (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Sch Management, Finance, Istanbul, Turkey.",yatilgan@sabanciuniv.edu; aloke.ghosh@baruch.cuny.edu; myan@fordham.edu; Jieying@utdallas.edu,"Atilgan, Yigit/AAG-8646-2019","Atilgan, Yigit/0000-0003-3818-3300",,,,,52,10,12,2,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We develop a theoretical model in which the quality of a firm's employees determines its average cost, a firm's productivity is based on its pre-entry experience and persistent shocks, and over time firms learn about their productivity. The model predicts that more productive firms are larger and hire more talented employees, which gives rise to various predictions about how pre-entry experience, firm growth rates, and firm size influence the wages firms pay to their early hires. We find that beginning with the time of entry, larger firms consistently pay higher wages to their new hires. These are firms with greater survival prospects at the time of entry based on the pre-entry backgrounds of their founders and that grow at greater rates over time, both of which are predictive of the wages paid to new hires from the time of entry onward. Our findings suggest workers are allocated to firms according to their abilities, which can give rise to enduring firm capabilities.","[Dahl, Michael S.] Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Klepper, Steven] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Dahl, MS (通讯作者)，Dept Business & Management, Fibigerstr 11, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",md@business.aau.dk,"Dahl, Michael S./M-9867-2019; Dahl, Michael S.

In a situation of currency pressure the central bank can in principle decide to let the currency float freely, to maintain the peg or to implement a managed float policy, i.e. a mix of depreciation and intervention. As the central bank's choices are subject to self selection and endogeneity, we use propensity score matching to adequately cope with these methodical challenges. We find that monetary authorities have two options to keep down the economic costs in terms of output, namely stabilizing the exchange rate or letting the currency float freely. In contrast, a managed float under currency pressure is accompanied by the worst possible outcome with an average loss of gross domestic product (GDP) between 5% and 6%.","[Erler, Alexander; Sirries, Steffen; Herz, Bernhard] Univ Bayreuth, Fac Law & Econ, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Bauer, Christian] Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany",University of Bayreuth; Universitat Trier,"Erler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Fac Law & Econ, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",alexander.erler@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

A large experimental data set was obtained from a psycho-physiological task conducted with 645 bank customers and financial professionals. With respect to causes, we found that the individual emotional response to gains/losses is trend-dependent and influenced by habituation, as well as by anchoring/framing due to the external layout of risky alternatives. With respect to consequences, we found evidence that the somatic reinforcement experience is able to guide asset picking, but within a long-term strategy. Consequently, selection behaviors were observed in a portfolio mean variance framework, revealing that somatic markers lead individuals to pursue a long-term 'psycho-economic' efficiency that integrates factual information (monetary outcomes) with the implicit subjective experience.

The purpose of financial reports is to provide useful information to users. According to International Accounting Standards Board, the utility of information is defined through the qualitative characteristics (fundamental and enhancing). The financial crisis emphasized the limits of financial reporting who has been unable to prevent investors about the risks they were facing. Some managers expressed reservations about the quality and relevance of corporate reporting, stating that the annual report is no longer a useful tool. Due to the current changes in business environment, managers have been highly motivated to rethink and improve the risk governance philosophy, processes and methodologies. The lack of quality, timely data and adequate systems to capture, report and measure the right information across the organization is a fundamental challenge to implementing and sustaining all aspects of effective risk management. Starting from 80s, the investors became more interested in narratives (Notes to financial statements), than in primary reports (financial position and performance). Our research suggests a framework for risk reporting with the main goal of improving the good practice in risk management field.

The analysis is based on representative agent model, where two sources of water supply exist: exhaustible groundwater stock and a renewable substitute. Two alternative water pricing reforms are considered: gradual tariff increase and multipart pricing with first block sold at the initial pre-reform tariff and additional water sold at higher prices (block pricing reform). Under block pricing reform, the amount of water offered at low price gradually diminishes. The results of comparative analysis prove that under the same reform time horizon block pricing is preferred to the gradual tariff increase.","Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Fridman, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",afriedman@hse.ru,"Fridman, Alla/G-8689-2015","Fridman, Alla/0000-0003-3132-8837",,,,,20,4,4,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Using a method to correct for a look-ahead bias when applying an EGARCH model to calculate expected idiosyncratic risk, we show that leverage distorts the relationship that it has with returns. We find that leverage has a significant nonlinear relationship with returns and when we control for this leverage effect we find no evidence of idiosyncratic risk being priced before and during the global financial crisis. Only during the post-crisis period do we see a positive relationship emerges between returns and idiosyncratic risk Our results suggest that investors should consider carefully the impact that leverage has on pricing REITs and the corresponding impact it has on the idiosyncratic risk and return relationship.

A number of scholars and casual observers have noted that terrorist organizations often are comprised of two types of participants: ideologues or true believers dedicated to the group's cause, and mercenaries, who are adept at raising money through illegal means. The latter are interested primarily in their personal gains and have relatively little ideological commitment. Terrorist groups need both participants in order to function effectively. The purpose of the study is to understand the impact of communication on the compositions of terrorist groups. Three experimental treatments consider a coordination problem, and focus on the behavior of the mercenaries. Participants choose whether or not to participate in a terrorist attack. Payoffs are U-shaped in the number of participants, and increase with the number of successful attacks. The treatments allow communication between a leader and frontline fighters (leader treatment) or among the frontline fighters themselves (communication treatment). In the first treatment, a group leader can post messages to the members, which has a 19 % coordination success rate. For the communication treatment, all participants can post messages anonymously to each other, which yields a 27 % coordination success rate. By contrast, the baseline (no communication treatment) shows a success rate of 11 %. We conclude from our experimental evidence that disrupting communications among the frontline fighters is more effective in terminating terrorist organizations.","[Hausken, Kjell] Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Banuri, Sheheryar] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Gupta, Dipak K.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Diego, CA 92129 USA; [Abbink, Klaus] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Universitetet i Stavanger; University of East Anglia; California State University System; San Diego State University; Monash University,"Hausken, K (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",kjell.hausken@uis.no,,"Abbink, Klaus/0000-0003-4436-604X; Banuri, Sheheryar/0000-0002-8021-0299",National Science Foundation; NSF [BCS-0905044]; Division Of Computer and Network Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1028177] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Computer and Network Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We thank the National Science Foundation for financial support and participants at the conference Bridging areas of expertise: funding research on terrorism, October 7-10, 2010, http://cbees.utdallas.edu/tsconference/home.php for useful comments.

Using a broad sample of firms from 37 countries over the 1990-2008 period, we find that firms that operate in more concentrated industries and with stronger pricing power are associated with greater analyst following, higher forecast accuracy, and lower forecast dispersion. Moreover, the effect of product market power on analyst following and forecast properties is more pronounced in countries with less effective competition laws and higher entry costs. These findings suggest that high industry concentration and a dominant market position enhance the earnings predictability of firms and lower their information uncertainty, and that country-level institutions that promote competition effectively constrain the power in product markets.

Wavelet analysis allows the simultaneous examination of co-movement and causality between the two markets in both the time and frequency domains. Our findings provide robust evidence that co-movement and causality vary across frequencies and evolve over time. Examining market co-movement in the time domain, the two markets exhibit positive co-movement over recent decades, except for 1998-2002 when a high negative co-movement emerged. In the frequency domain, the two markets correlate with each other mainly at low frequencies (longer term), except in the second half of the 1900s as well as in 1998-2002, when the two markets correlate at high frequencies (shorter term). In addition, we find that the causal effects between the markets in the frequency domain occur generally at low frequencies (longer term). In the time-domain, the time-varying nature of long-run causalities implies structural changes in the two markets. These findings provide a more complete picture of the relationship between the U.S. real estate and stock markets over time and frequency, offering important implications for policymakers (and practitioners).

Rating convergence is more likely when Fitch rather than the rival has to adjust its evaluation downwards.

However, empirical evidence supporting such a relationship turns out to be mixed. This paper shows how the different empirical reactions can be rationalized within a simple model of tax avoidance and costly tax enforcement. By focusing on structure-induced equilibrium in which taxpayers vote over the size of the income tax and the level of tax enforcement, we show that more inequality may well reduce the extent of redistribution, depending on two opposing effects: the standard political effect and a negative tax base effect working through increases in the average level of tax avoidance and the share of enforcement expenditures in total tax revenue.","[Bethencourt, Carlos] Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ, Tenerife 38071, Spain; [Kunze, Lars] TU Dortmund, Dept Econ, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany",Universidad de la Laguna; Dortmund University of Technology,"Kunze, L (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund, Dept Econ, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.",cbethenc@ull.es; lars.kunze@tu-dortmund.de,"Bethencourt, Carlos/E-9267-2016","Bethencourt, Carlos/0000-0002-5605-9576",,,,,64,1,2,4,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2015,163.0,3-4,,,,,267,287,,10.1007/s11127-015-0248-9,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CI0DY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354407500004,0

As economic data have proliferated over the last decade, uses of the difference-in-differences design and its variations have become more numerous. Nevertheless, published research that invokes difference-in-differences commonly fails to present evidence and reasoning that enable the reader to properly evaluate the causal claims under investigation. In this paper, we examine the threats to internal validity that exist when using difference-in-differences for causal inference and review variations of the design that can be used to address these threats. Next, we survey the public finance literature in order to examine the ways that these threats are addressed in practice. We conclude by proposing a number of recommendations for researchers to consider as they implement difference-in-differences as an empirical strategy.","[Clair, Travis St.] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cook, Thomas D.] Math Policy Res Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Cook, Thomas D.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Mathematica; Northwestern University,"Clair, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",tstclair@umd.edu; t-cook@northwestern.edu,,,Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1228866] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),,,40,46,53,5,48,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We also find evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between a firm's risk-adjusted rate of return and regulations relating to capital requirements as well as corporate governance and internal control.

The outcome of auctions can be affected by various factors. One of these factors can be anchoring effects, which describe the influence of present available information on numerical values in human decisions. However, the influence of anchoring effects in auctions carried out offline that is, live events that are not taking place on the internet is largely unknown. For this reason, we analyze anchoring effects of exogenously provided values using an experimental common value auction with entrepreneurs. In total, 48 groups each made of five farmers participate in a series of four auctions for envelopes containing a 810 banknote with a 50% probability of occurrence. Our results indicate that anchoring based on exogenously presented values can either result in negative adjustment in open bid auctions, or no adjustment in closed-seal bid auctions. Furthermore, the results show that previous bids affect following bids, which may also be an anchoring effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing upon the psychology and communication literature, which documents that the end of popular TV series causes negative emotional reactions in large numbers of television viewers, I employ major TV series finales (between 1967 and 2012) as mood-altering events. I find that an increase in the fraction of Americans watching a TV show finale on a given day is immediately followed by a decrease in U.S. stock returns. This effect is stronger in small-cap and high-volatility stocks, whose pricing is more sensitive to sentiment, and is consistent with the hypothesis that negative mood reduces the demand for risky assets.

The methodological approaches that are employed to overcome difficulties in income data collection may affect the relative position of individuals and households within the income distribution and our estimates of mobility inequalities. In the context of a case study of Douala, this paper evaluates how the way income data is collected affects its accuracy and therefore the measurement of daily mobility inequalities. Simplified data collection tends to minimise the scale of inequalities as it misrepresents the income distribution. The error is greater in remote zones. Shortcomings in the statistical apparatus with regard to income data thus blur our perception of mobility inequalities and impede investigation of the links between daily travel, poverty and social exclusion.

We distinguish between privately controlled firms and state-controlled firms. We find that the value effect and incentives of appointing independent directors with political ties are shaped by a firm's ownership structure. More exactly, Chinese listed privately controlled firms with a large fraction of politically connected independent directors tend to outperform their non-connected counterparts, due to the ease of access to external debt financing and more subsidies from the government. However, the appointment of politically connected independent directors also enlarges the magnitude of related-party transactions with the controlling party in listed privately controlled firms. In contrast, having politicians as independent directors does not help to add value to listed state-controlled firms, especially firms controlled by the local government, due to the expropriation of minority investors via more related-party transactions and more severe over-investment problems.

Our results indicate that firms with smaller boards experience larger variability in future firm performance. These firms are also associated with higher executive pay-to-performance sensitivity, tend to pursue riskier investment policies, and engage more frequently in earnings management. However, Chinese firms with smaller-sized boards are found to be more conservative in using debt financing. Overall, our Chinese evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that board size has negative impacts on firm risktaking.

It also focuses on the sensitivity to various factors affecting the housing tenure choice between males and females of urban and rural areas. The study is based on both exploratory analysis and estimation of statistical models using a Household Travel Survey data collected for Bangalore Metropolitan Region in year 2010. The results indicate the role of both the land use attributes and commute travel characteristics on tenure choice and the behavioural difference between males and females. The sensitivity to various attributes is also observed to be varying between the individuals living in the urban and rural areas of the city. The finding that private mode use for commuting governs the housing tenure choice of individuals suggests that promotion of urban-transport policies such as Transit Oriented Development may be an effective strategy to curb the issues related to energy consumption and emission.

Most Lithuanian municipalities have signed Covenant of Mayors and have prepared local energy action plans. However, all these plans include just energy saving measures on supply side and renovation of buildings. Nevertheless, the significant energy savings and GHG emission reductions can be achieved through behavioural changes. The aim of the paper is to apply community based social marketing approach in assessment of achievable energy saving and GHG emission reduction targets set by local energy action plans. The paper presents the results of case study implemented in Kaunas region municipality. The case study was conducted by creating focus groups and applying two scenarios: baseline or doing nothing and climate change mitigation scenario including intervention measures. The results of case study revealed that the total energy consumption reduction target set in Sustainable energy development strategy of Kaunas region county - 11% - can be achieved by combining results of energy consumption reduction in both focus groups. The survey conducted after study finalization revealed that respondents were provided with a lot of additional knowledge during the study and achieved real money savings. The major barriers of energy savings in households are related with the lack of information on energy savings and GHG emission reduction.","[Streimikiene, Dalia; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lei.lt,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,25,2,3,1,26,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,723,734,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900015,0

Using data from 1883 to 2008, this article develops a means of mapping changes in the degree of international synchronisation of banking and currency crises through a formal concordance index. This index specifically accounts for the typically low incidence and potential serial correlation of crisis data. The results show that banking crises were highly internationalised at the beginning of the 20th century, and became far less so in the strong regulatory environment prevailing after the Depression until the 1980s. A strong increase in the synchronicity of international banking crises is revealed during the late 20th and early 21st century. Currency crises began the century as more idiosyncratic, but have tended to become more synchronised over the 115 year sample. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our findings are consistent with prior work in that internal unstable failure ascriptions are associated with greater perceived learning, while external stable ascriptions are associated with less perceived learning. Inconsistent with prior work, however, we find that starting a new venture more quickly after failure enhances perceived learning for entrepreneurs who made internal unstable ascriptions. Further, entrepreneurs with external stable ascriptions have even less perceived learning when they abandon their previous domain in their new venture. Implications for research on failure, ascriptions, and perceived learning for future ventures are discussed.","[Yamakawa, Yasuhiro] Babson Coll, Arthur Blank Ctr Entrepreneurship, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA; [Cardon, Melissa S.] Pace Univ, Lubin Sch Business, Pleasantville, NY 10570 USA",Babson College; Pace University,"Yamakawa, Y (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Arthur Blank Ctr Entrepreneurship, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA.",yyamakawa@babson.edu; mcardon@pace.edu,"Cardon, Melissa/GRJ-6682-2022","Cardon, Melissa/0000-0002-1057-9672",,,,,125,72,86,10,105,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Robustness analysis reaffirm the efficiency scores remain consistent across different selections of inputs and outputs as well as the underlying distribution of the return. Having estimated each fund's efficiency in the sample we unveil their underlying dynamics, also with respect to risk and operational characteristics such as flows, assets, and Morningstar star ratings. Panel-VAR estimations reveal that the response of funds' efficiency to a shock in risk is positive and substantial. Some evidence of reverse causality is also observed.

Using novel data from New York surveys that asked directly about cigarette prices and purchases from reservations, we focus on two under-studied but basic empirical economic questions this raises. First, what is the economic incidence of the tax break? In data from New York over a period when the state did not attempt to collect taxes on reservation purchases, our estimates suggest that the tax break is usually fully shifted to the consumer. The notable exception is on one reservation where a tribal monopoly captures almost half of the tax break. Second, has the tax break increased consumer demand for low-quality cigarettes relative to high-quality cigarettes? New York's cigarette tax is a fixed amount per pack, providing an opportunity to test the Alchian and Allen substitution theorem. We find some support for the prediction that the tax break increases consumer demand for lower-quality cigarettes.","[DeCicca, Philip] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Kenkel, Donald] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY USA; [Liu, Feng] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",McMaster University; Cornell University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"DeCicca, P (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",decicca@mcmaster.ca; dsk10@cornell.edu; liu.feng@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,National Institutes of Health [R21 CA13160001A1],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, # R21 CA13160001A1.

We use the Index of Financial Liberalisation (Abiad et al., 2009) as one of the instruments for financial variables.

However, models of renewable resource management under uncertainty have commonly assumed economic and biological uncertainties to be uncorrelated. We present examples of valuable fish species that experience correlated variation in biological growth and catchability, in response to a common environmental disturbance. Building correlation into a model of renewable resource management under uncertainty, we find correlation to alter the optimal response by managers to cost disturbances, and impact the value of retaining intra-period flexibility over harvest targets. Examining the performance of three harvest control mechanisms-harvest quotas, effort quotas, and taxes-reveals that positive correlation between costs and growth favors harvest quotas over effort quotas, and effort quotas over taxes (and vice versa). The model is then applied numerically to the Pacific bigeye tuna fishery, which experiences positively correlated shocks driven by the El Nio Southern Oscillation. Correlation qualitatively changes the optimal response to a cost shock, and harvest quotas are found to be strongly favored over both effort quotas and taxes.","[Kennedy, Chris J.] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",George Mason University; University of Wyoming,"Kennedy, CJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, MSN 5F2 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",ckenned7@gmu.edu,"Kennedy, Chris J/B-3496-2008","Kennedy, Chris/0000-0002-0360-9116",NOAA/NMFS - Sea Grant Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics,NOAA/NMFS - Sea Grant Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics,"We would like to thank Jason Shogren, John Tschirhart, and two anonymous referees for comments that have greatly improved this research.

Efficient screening involves distorting both types' contracts away from first best contracts, for example, via front-loaded annuities.

Strong and opposing views exist regarding the costs and benefits of these regulations, but the results of this review suggest that their impacts are generally smaller than the heat of the debates would suggest. Efficiency effects are found sometimes, but not always, and the effects can be in either direction and are usually modest. The distributional impacts of both minimum wage and employment protection legislation are clearer, with two effects predominating: an equalizing effect among covered workers, but with groups such as youth, women, and the less skilled disproportionately outside the coverage and its benefits. Although the overall conclusion is one of modest effects in most cases, the policy implication is not that these regulations do not matter. On the one hand, both minimum wages and EPL can affect distributional objectives. On the other hand, these regulations can generate undesirable economic or social impacts if they are established or operate in ways that exacerbate the labor market imperfections that they were designed to address.","Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Betcherman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",Gordon.Betcherman@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,129,31,36,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

We suggest in this article that, in a context of rising revenues and high rewards, the pressures to acquire more and better talent so as to out-perform other teams on the football pitch leads to a requirement for teams to practise effective contract management. Using a large dataset from the German Bundesliga, we find that players with longer term contracts perform better, ceteris paribus. Hence, selection effects in the award of long-term contracts dominate moral hazard (shirking) effects in the Bundesliga.","[Buraimo, Babatunde] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Frick, Bernd; Hickfang, Michael] Univ Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany; [Simmons, Rob] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",University of Liverpool; University of Paderborn; Lancaster University,"Buraimo, B (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",,,"Buraimo, Babatunde/0000-0003-3928-5624; Simmons, Robert/0000-0003-1755-4088",,,,,25,32,35,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We explore three questions using a new measurement tool in an experimental investigation of imprecision in lottery valuations: Does such preference imprecision vary coherently with lottery structure? Is it stable on repeat measurement? Does it have explanatory value for economic behaviour? We find that imprecision behaves coherently, shows no tendency to change systematically with experience, is related to choice variability, but is not a main driver of the violations of standard decision theory that we consider.","[Cubitt, Robin P.; Starmer, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Navarro-Martinez, Daniel] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Navarro-Martinez, Daniel] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Navarro-Martinez, Daniel] Barcelona Sch Management, Barcelona 08005, Spain",University of Nottingham; Pompeu Fabra University,"Cubitt, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Robin.Cubitt@Nottingham.ac.uk,"Navarro-Martinez, Daniel/D-6848-2013; Starmer, Chris/K-8891-2018","Navarro-Martinez, Daniel/0000-0003-4126-1680; Starmer, Chris/0000-0001-7705-0127",CeDEx at the Nottingham School of Economics; ESRC [ES/K002201/1]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2011BP-B00170]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness [MINECO-PSI2013-41909-P]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI,CeDEx at the Nottingham School of Economics; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness(Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for the support of CeDEx at the Nottingham School of Economics; Cubitt and Starmer acknowledge the support of the ESRC funded Network for Integrated Behavioural Science (ES/K002201/1); and Navarro-Martinez acknowledges support from the Generalitat de Catalunya (2011BP-B00170) and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness (MINECO-PSI2013-41909-P).

Using a data set of all U.S. repurchases from 2004 to 2011, we compare the actual average price paid monthly in a repurchase with the average market price for the same stock over various horizons. We find that firms repurchase stock at a significantly lower price than the average market price in all sample years. Less frequent repurchasers, firms that repurchase when insiders buy on their own account, and firms that experience low stock returns prior to the repurchase obtain significantly lower prices. After controlling for risk factors, repurchasing firms earn positive returns. Infrequent repurchasers earn a significantly higher return up to three years following the actual repurchase.

SMEs, which characterized by fast internationalisation of their activity from the very beginning of the establishment despite limited resources, knowledge, international experience, are called born global. Such firms distinguish in entrepreneurial orientation, innovativeness, orientation towards niches, competitiveness and proactiveness towards international opportunities. The paper argues that the accelerator of entrepreneurial SMEs is their being in networks. Active interaction with customers, suppliers and external partners is inseparable from entrepreneurial orientation in pursuing for new possibilities in the market. The empirical data have been obtained from internationalized Lithuanian high-tech firms operating in the information technology sector. The paper presents motives, which determined the involvement of entrepreneurial SMEs into international markets, characteristics of entrepreneurial orientation as well as peculiarities of network relationship in Lithuania, a small Central and Eastern European country. The empirical evidence suggests that necessity to create national and international network relationships is the determinant success aspect of international expansion.

We interpret this finding to suggest that employment protection increases operating leverage, crowding out financial leverage.

The paper presents a qualitative research conducted on Romanian social entrepreneurs. The results, interpreted through content analysis, indicate that social entrepreneurs, unlike business entrepreneurs, are not profit-driven, but mission driven, their main objective being to make a difference in the society and have a positive impact in the local communities. Furthermore, the research revealed specific challenges faced by Romanian social entrepreneurs, as well as specific differences between social and business entrepreneurs, who aim strictly achieving economic performance. Considering the limitations and future research directions, the implications of the findings are discussed, the paper outlining a profile of the social entrepreneur that can be useful to the public sector for the development of policies aimed at enhancing this type of entrepreneurship, in a constantly changing social environment.","[Tigu, Gabriela; Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina; Ravar, Anamaria Sidonia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Lile, Ramona] Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Arad, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad,"Tigu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela.tigu@ase.ro,"Lile, Ramona/ADJ-3011-2022; Lile, Ramona/G-2005-2016; Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina/L-7737-2015; Tigu, Gabriela/AEV-2179-2022","Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina/0000-0003-4957-3590; Tigu, Gabriela/0000-0001-6189-8027",European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134197],European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was cofinanced from the European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134197, Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.",,29,10,11,0,45,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,25,43,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800002,0

Results of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) demonstrate that perceived security and privacy as well as perceived risks have a significant relationship with behavioral intention, while perceived trust shows contrary result.

It is claimed by some researchers that exchange rate volatility causes a reduction on tourist arrivals. Empirical researchers often utilize the standard deviation of the moving average of the logarithm of the exchange rate as a measure of exchange rate fluctuation. In this study, a new measure for measuring volatility is proposed. The empirical methodology used relies upon the theory of cointegration, error correction representation of the exchange rate volatility measures using the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) modeling to cointegration. Overall, our findings suggest that there is a negative effect of volatility to tourists' arrivals for Iceland. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Hence, it can be argued that, at each point in time, the region sends out its Image and, depending on its impact on the receivers (both employers and employees), the region may be considered attractive or non-attractive. The available evidence suggests that all the receivers groups or in other words the potential movers react similarly to a basic set of factors; more precisely, a set of minimum standards, largely common to all the potential movers, must be satisfied if the region is to be considered as a potential choice by any of them. On the other hand, the potential movers may belong to a number of different groups that have a different type of interaction with a region and as result each of these groups is likely to have a different image of the particular region. Hence, a region does not have a single image, but multiple ones. To reconcile these two views we refine the concept of a region's Image by introducing the following two concepts: the Basic Image and the Specific Image. The Basic Image of a given region measures the degree to which the region satisfies a set of basic criteria, common for all movers. A region satisfying those criteria is considered by all potential movers as worth a closer examination and as a potential final choice. On the other hand the Specific Image of a given region, as perceived by a particular group of potential movers, measures the degree to which movers belonging to that particular group consider the region as their best final choice. A detailed exposition of the concept of a region's Basic Image has been presented in some of the authors earlier papers. In the present paper emphasis will be placed on a region's Specific Image as perceived by the various groups of potential movers. More precisely: The groups of potential movers will be determined. The factors affecting each group will be identified and ways for their measurement will be suggested. The form of each Specific Image function will be defined. The theoretical findings will be applied to a number of regions and their Basic and Specific Images will be calculated. The main results will be presented and discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

It is also significantly promoted by the strategic documents and practice of European member countries, as well the Czech Republic (CR). The article deals with the evaluation of the state of e-government in the European Union (EU) countries. Evaluation of the state of e-government is necessary for the future implementation of actions and measures in this field across EU countries. The paper focuses on the usage of methods of multi-criteria evaluation of alternatives - TOPSIS (The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and WSA (Weighted Sum Approach). TOPSIS and WSA methods were used to the comparison of current state of e-government in the EU countries and to the evaluation of the position of the CR. Methods of multi-criteria evaluation of alternatives are the multi-criteria decision methods used in operations research. The purpose of these methods is to provide the complete ranking of the alternatives starting from the best towards the worst one. In this research, there was selected the final list of alternatives (monitored countries EU-28) and criteria (9 indicators of e-government). The research was based on data set across multiple data sources. These were mainly study of 2014 eGovernment Benchmark, data processed by Eurostat and data managed by the UN from 2013. The evaluated data described in this paper and outputs of the research show the state of e-government in EU countries in the year 2013. The purpose of this paper is the determination of the state of e-government in the Czech Republic in an international comparison and the proposal of appropriate actions to improve the situation, based on experiences in other EU countries.","[Ardielli, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Ardielli, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",eva.ardielli@vsb.cz,"Ardielli, Eva/ABE-4547-2021","Ardielli, Eva/0000-0002-4476-1130",,,,,16,1,1,0,2,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Prior to this reform, implemented in 2009, base pay was aligned with that of national parliamentarians, causing large differences in pay between the MEPs representing 27 member states. Based on detailed information on individual MEPs between 2004 and 2011, we find that the reform, which introduced an exceptional base pay increase of 200 % per national delegation on average, has a positive incentive effect on in-office effort proxied by the number of speeches, written declarations and reports drafted. However, more generous remuneration is associated with higher rates of absenteeism. With respect to political selection, we find that higher pay also raises reelection rates. The composition of the pool of MEPs in terms of (ex-ante) quality approximated by formal education, previous political experience in elected office and occupational background is, however, unaffected. If we restrict our attention to newly elected MEPs, a salary increase is related to fewer MEPs with previous political experience at the highest national level.","Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Fed Dept Finance FFA, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Braendle, T (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Fed Dept Finance FFA, Bundesgasse 3, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland.",thomas.braendle@efv.admin.ch,,,,,,,57,29,30,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,1,24,,10.1007/s11127-014-0184-0,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000001,0

We offer a new perspective of the phenomenon by including in the analysis only unlisted companies using a sample of large unlisted companies from the Eastern European EU member states. Our empirical results confirm the existence of the two-step process between the European integration, and the corporate financing choices. The most important contribution of our research to existing literature is providing empirical evidence that even if unlisted companies don't benefit directly from capital market development, their size and reputation allows them to access external long term financing, exhibiting exactly the same characteristics as listed companies.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Carausu, DN (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",nicusor@live.com,"Carausu, Dumitru-Nicusor/AAV-5311-2020","Carausu, Dumitru-Nicusor/0000-0001-9177-4252",,,,,20,0,0,0,22,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,625,637,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600063,0

In addition, the rent underlying the conflict has a varying mix of public and private characteristics between a public (non-divisible) good and a private (divisible) good. We then show that cooperation within the group is more difficult to sustain as a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium as the degree of rivalry of the rent increases.

As a consequence the financial integrity and stability of the Moldovan banking system has been shaken and the confidence in it has been seriously affected. These deficiencies have induced the necessity of revising the central bank's role in regulating the Moldovan banking system and increasing the quality of banking supervision. This is the main argument for addressing the determinants of bank supervision quality and finding solutions for enhancing it. The quality of banking supervision depends on several factors and preconditions which are addressed in this article. There has been highlighted the need for a greater focus to be put on independence, accountability and transparency of the supervisor for increasing the effectiveness of banking supervision. There are identified banking supervision's deficiencies and their determinants in the Republic of Moldova and made an analysis of country's compliance with the Basel Committee's Core Principles. The evaluation of the quality of banking supervision in the Republic of Moldova includes statistical analysis of data related to the banking system, review of IMF assessments, as well as observations and qualitative judgments.

We find robust evidence that banking competition reduces state-level innovation by public corporations headquartered within deregulating states. Innovation increases among private firms that are dependent on external finance and that have limited access to credit from local banks. We argue that banking competition enables small, innovative firms to secure financing instead of being acquired by public corporations. Therefore, banking competition reduces the supply of innovative targets, which reduces the portion of state-level innovation attributable to public corporations. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of banking competition and the determinants of innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Other legal measures to disrupt the flows and incidence of such crimes were also introduced involving freezing, seizure and confiscation or forfeiture of the proceeds of such crimes by the authorities. Prior to the 2001 Act, confiscation cases were almost exclusively centred on drug trafficking cases under the Dangerous Drug legislation. The 2001 Act entailed two current types of confiscation of criminal property, namely, the criminal confiscation that is based upon the prosecution of the accused person and the civil confiscation when there is no such prosecution. This paper seeks to examine these confiscation systems in Malaysia to understand their origin, nature and the extent to which such confiscation systems could be governed at the international and local levels. Of significance, is the legal implications of the non-conviction based confiscation that indicates that such confiscation law represents one of the most serious encroachments on private property rights. It is worse when the rule of such confiscation is making the property and not the property owner, guilty until proven innocent. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We find that about 42% of the HFR universe exhibit iid absolute returns over the period spanning 2000 to 2012. These funds are mainly found in proportions within the Macro and Equity Hedge strategies. A similar result holds for relative returns. We also find that funds having non-iid returns often exhibit ARCH effects and structural breaks, with largest breaks located within financial crises. Also, only a small percentage displays persistence in their relative performance, 8.2% to 16.7% of the universe, mainly found in proportions within the Relative Value and Event-Driven strategies. The robustness of results is challenged by implementing the tests on a crisis-free period. We find similar results for absolute returns. For relative ones, differences appear across strategies and benchmarks, but still both ARCH and breaks are present.

Despite the simplifying assumptions that underlie its derivation, DD has proven empirically to be a strong predictor of default. We use simulations to show that the empirical success of DD may well be a result of its strong robustness to model misspecifications. We consider a number of deviations from the Merton model which involve different asset value dynamics and different default triggering mechanisms. We show that, in general, DD is successful in ranking firms' default probabilities, even if the underlying model assumptions are altered. A possibility of large jumps in asset value or stochastic volatility challenge the robustness of DD.

But risks exist because it's still in early phases of development in China. In the meantime, insurance industry in our country has reached a reforming stage. In the ongoing exploration and innovation, Peer-to-Peer Insurance, a new operation mode of finance, has come into being since insurance and P2P lending began collaborating. Based on relevant document literature and data, the article concludes the research results and discusses the theme, Opportunities and Risks Insurance Faces in P2P Lending. Firstly, it sums up the current situation of the P2P lending development. The industry is exposed to four major risks: risks in borrower defaulting, difficulty to control the funds' use, appearance of problematic P2P lending platforms and deficient supervisory efforts. Secondly, the advantages of P2P lending are summarized, including across localization, timeliness and convenience, which can relieve the financial pressure that small and micro businesses have confronted. Due to these advantages, P2P lending industry is facing unprecedented opportunities under New Normal. Finally, through analysis of current policies, the article puts forward an idea that to develop the modern insurance services, the industry's development has to combine with the present trend and explore more in the area of Internet finance. P2P lending industry demands more risk management tools, while insurance industry demands exploration in Internet finance, which results in the current situation where these two booming industries come into cooperation. Under the circumstances, the article analyzes the opportunities and risks that insurance firms faces when cooperating with P2P lending platforms in four aspects as follows: security of platforms, rate of bad debt in P2P lending, insurance firms' default and people's awareness of the risks. It propounds a suggestion that insurance firms, P2P guild and credit rating firms should cooperate together to build a P2P credit scoring system to strengthen the supervision and control the risks. Meanwhile, based on certain typical cases, it also puts forward an idea that insurance firms should strengthen the internal supervision to avoid defaulting. In the aspect of taking social responsibilities, the article suggests that insurance firms should enhance public awareness and education on risk control and management. Moreover, the article also summarizes several ways in which insurance firms can explore collaboration with P2P lending platforms such as credit & bond insurance and director's liability insurance.","[Jiang Ruihong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Jiang, RH (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",jiangrh223@163.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,16,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,280,289,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500018,0

Financial crisis meant also turning point in capital flow directions. Banks are important participants of fmancial markets and also can have significant influence on capital flows through cross-border interbank lending. Interbank credits, or providing liquidity, should be analysed from basic views such as yield, liquidity and risk, which should be main determinants of interbank lending.

My dataset consists of US quarterly time series within the period 1978-2013. Following Wainhouse (1984), Keeler (2001) and others I employ Granger causality as one of the primary tools of the analysis. Furthermore I also add impulse response functions to analyse the observed relations in closer detail. Two main hypotheses were tested. First one analyses how changes in interest rate affects relative proportion of investment and consumption outlays. Second hypothesis investigates how labour resources are reallocated as a consequence of an increase in interest rate. In both hypotheses, two concepts of interest rate were employed. Application of explicit interest rate does not seem to generate significant results. On the contrary, results fit in the Austrian story much better when implicit rate is employed. The traditional version of ABCT, which relies more on explicit interest rates, seems to suffer from invalid assumption about the allocation of credit during expansionary phase of business cycle.","Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Komrska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",martin.komrska@vse.cz,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,14,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

However, many of the existing valuation results rely on the existence of the moment generating function of the innovations' distribution, thereby ruling out the use of heavy-tailed distributions such as Student's t and its variants, which may better capture the excess kurtosis in historical asset returns. In this paper, we consider option pricing under GARCH models with Hansen's skewed-t distributed innovations. To overcome the limitations of the existing valuation results, we apply risk-neutralization to the empirical distribution of the simulated sample paths rather than the innovations' parametric distribution. We illustrate our proposed method by pricing options written on the S&P 500 index. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis of impulse response to technological shocks, labor demand shocks, labor supply shocks and wage-setting shocks was conducted on the basis of developed SVEC. The modeling results demonstrated that in Ukraine there is no single reason for hysteresis in unemployment. Various structural and cyclical shocks explain unemployment over different time horizons. In particular, labor supply shocks lead to contemporaneous growth of unemployment, while in the long run positive technological shocks and labor demand shocks are an important source of reducing unemployment rate. Technological shocks also have a significant beneficial impact on other labor market indicators. In particular was found that a positive technological shock causes an increase in productivity, employment and real wages, and this impact has a significant effect both in the short and in the long run.

Site meetings are typically the arena in which designers, engineers and managers co-create and develop new design solutions, give feedback to each other and jointly discuss design-related issues. In these meetings, project partners transcend their traditional, distributed job descriptions in order to share their knowledge to create better design details. This study explores what design-related issues are addressed in the site meetings, who participates in the discussions and creates new design solutions, and with whose expertise the decisions on the new design solutions are finally made. The unit of analysis is a discussion episode, which encompasses actions from identifying a design-related topic to answering a question, solving a problem or making a decision on the topic. The research data were collected by observing actual site meetings in two renovation projects. The findings reveal that the site managers were the most active party addressing design-related issues in the meeting discussions. Their main reason for initiating a discussion in the meeting was the need to modify or specify an existing design detail. As design work is iterative by nature, the same design topics were discussed repeatedly in several meetings. Each party's - the project manager's, the designers', site managers' and others' - contribution was crucial in design-related issues, problem solving and the creation of new design solutions. However, the question remains whether this multi-disciplinary collaboration could be organized differently in order to avoid disturbances, delays, and extra work and costs from later design changes in construction projects.

Upswings are rewarded by the naive, but punished by the sophisticated. Downswings are punished by all voters. Using an established dataset of over 400 general elections we find that the incumbent vote share (a) responds differently to trend growth than to the cycle, (b) does not respond significantly to positive variation in the economic cycle, and (c) responds significantly and negatively to negative realizations in the economic cycle.

The presented analysis brings specific recommendations on the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential regulation. The article starts with a critical analysis of the Austrian Economic School and its monetary theory of business cycle, which provides a methodological base for further empirical analysis in the paper. Based on the data of the Czech economy, the authors empirically test a hypothesis whether credits create a financial bubble when a credit growth exceeds a real GDP growth. The financial cycle had a significantly higher volatility comparing to real business cycle volatility in the Czech Republic in the period 1997-2013. The existence of the credit bubble was confirmed by statistically significant model parameters, when using the differences in relative year on year changes of banking client credits as a depended variable and relative year on year changes of real GDP as an independent variable. Currently valid European regulation doesn't allow using the same tools to host regulator and supervisor towards the bank subsidiaries and branches in a need to react to the different phases of financial cycle. If a host supervisor needs to influence and safeguard the financial stability, it has only the following tools applying to both forms of banking operations in the host countries: counter cyclical capital buffer, capital regulation of real estate exposures, and setting the loan to value (income) limits.","[Mandel, Martin] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Tomsik, Vladimir] Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech National Bank,"Mandel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",mandel@vse.cz; vladimir.tomsik@vse.cz,,,,,,,36,6,6,0,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Most of the studies surveyed show that privatization enhances privatized firms performance, efficiency, and profitability, which percolates to economic growth. Privatized firms performed better in countries with better regulatory and legal frameworks. Partial privatization may be beneficial in countries with weak institutions, namely, the French civil law countries. The stronger the economic and the governing institutions, the easier it is for privatized firms to thrive and contribute to economic growth. Overall, privatization allows firms to achieve improved efficiency while driving the development of the financial sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although there are various reasons for these differences, we have focused on the ones that can be quantified for further comparison. The main purpose of this study was twofold. First of all, we sought to identify stations with a low capacity to attract travellers and to explain the reasons for their concentration in certain countries rather than others. Secondly, we looked for a simple, but widely acceptable, method with which to calculate the capacity to attract users to HSR stations. This would help to establish a better way of allocating financial resources for public investment. This approach enabled us to identify those stations that had little or no potential at all and which had been established for essentially political reasons in countries where the concept of territorial cohesion had been applied in an inappropriate way. This led us to a number of observations relating to the railway policies undertaken in the countries studied and to underline the need for greater international coordination in areas like Europe and for better justified HSR policies. The calculations presented in this article use data relating to the urban populations which live in the vicinity of the world's HSR stations, the distance from each of these stations to the nearest urban centres and the level of the corresponding regional GDP. All of this information has been used to build a GIS to facilitate analysis and pave the way towards a general comparative approach in which stations would be classified according to their capacity to attract travellers. Such an approach could also be used in areas in which lines are currently under construction and/or where future projects - such as the TEN-T in Europe - have already been approved but not yet executed. Our approach will make it easier to obtain data to show the potential success of, and need for, a HSR connexion as a preliminary step within the decision making process. This constitutes a significant contribution to the debate about the need to assess political decisions concerning HSR investments. It also highlights the need to encourage improved intermodality around railway stations and particularly around those located in non-metropolitan areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The workhorse New Open Economy Macro (NOEM) model of Martinez-Garcia and Wynne (2010), which fleshes out this hypothesis, shows how expected future local inflation and global slack affect current local inflation. In this chapter, I propose the use of the orthogonalization method of Aoki (1981) and Fukuda (1993) on the workhorse NOEM model to further decompose local inflation into a global component and an inflation differential component. I find that the log-linearized rational expectations model of Martinez-Garcia and Wynne (2010) can be solved with two separate subsystems to describe each of these two components of inflation. I estimate the full NOEM model with Bayesian techniques using data for the United States and an aggregate of its 38 largest trading partners from 1980Q1 until 2011Q4. The Bayesian estimation recognizes the parameter uncertainty surrounding the model and calls on the data (inflation and output) to discipline the parameterization. My findings show that the strength of the international spillovers through trade - even in the absence of common shocks - is reflected in the response of global inflation and is incorporated into local inflation dynamics. Furthermore, I find that key features of the economy can have different impacts on global and local inflation - in particular, I show that the parameters that determine the import share and the price-elasticity of trade matter in explaining the inflation differential component but not the global component of inflation.","[Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Martinez-Garcia, Enrique] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Southern Methodist University,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res Dept, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",enrique.martinez-garcia@dal.frb.org,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X",,,,,30,5,5,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,51,112,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024016,0.0,,,62,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900005,0

However, the rights of donors in respect of their demands sometimes ignored. This phenomenon has led to the withdrawal of donor participation in NGO activities particularly where it has come to light that an NGO has misused funds. Upward accountability practices offer a way of providing information to donors in order to meet their requirements. In this study, the NGO, APB, was investigated as a case study using a qualitative approach. The NGO manages funds mainly from Malaysian donors and distributes them to Palestinian beneficiaries. This study aims to examine the ways in which the NGO discharges accountability to its donors and to understand the reason for the selection of particular methods of accountability. The data was collected by interviewing fifteen (15) informants, observation and document analysis. Drawing on social capital theory, this study found that trustworthiness, shared norms and information channel influence the practice of upward accountability in the NGO. The findings also indicate that when either formal or informal upward accountability is used in isolation the NGO is less effective in discharging its obligations to its donors because of barriers that prevent it reaching all donors using one type of practice. Therefore, the NGO uses both formal and informal upward accountability where both of them are coexist to satisfy its stakeholders. Also the practise of informal upward accountability is more dominant than formal upward accountability. (C) 2015 The Authors.

To effectively improve the quality of talents cultivation,higher education must pay attention to the cultivation of professional quality of undergraduates. Therefore, occupation quality training has been a problem that can not be ignored in college cultivating talents. Colleges and universities as the main camp of popular education, neglect the cultivation of occupation quality while steady focusing on teaching quality, mainly in lacking the concept of professionalism, deviating in the curriculum assessment system, weakening the practice teaching. To resolve these problems, we research on the three core elements about consciousness, knowledge, and practices, which are necessary for the occupation quality training, and explore the methods of the teaching reform to promote occupation quality, provided a theoretical basis for occupation quality training. Occupational quality including professional ethics, spirit, attitude and professional skills, knowledge and behaviors is high-quality that people engaging in professional activity manifested, is a careering inherent requirement,is a code of conduct people need to comply with in social activities([1]). Occupational quality has become the required characteristics when college students adapt to future careers and the basic skills when college students move to social, employment and entrepreneurship, t contributions([2]).

The contracting authority addresses a number of decision-making issues regarding public procurements. For example, it needs to decide between two types of criteria (choosing between a single-criterion evaluation or rather opting for several evaluation criteria). At the same time, the authority is free to choose among different types of award procedures while adhering to certain restrictions imposed by the Act on Public Contracts. Using a sample of 1,027 construction work contracts awarded in the Czech Republic, the study examines, in more detail, the impacts of individual choices made by the contracting authority (namely the type of evaluation criteria chosen and the type of procedure for awarding contracts) on the estimated and final price of public contracts.

These changes are accompanied by a reassessment of the protection of subjective fundamental rights (also called human rights) and of sovereignty as value, fact that is unconditionally accepted but many a time contested from the perspective of the effectiveness of these rights and of sovereignty itself. It is important to understand two aspects: first, the way in which positive law (positivism and its exclusively normative analysis) may cover causesthat are external to the legal system sometimes leading to an almost absolute inefficiency of fundamental rights. The second aspect regards the need for an inter-disciplinary approach (legal, political, economic) that may lead to a better understanding of the concrete causes and the phenomenon of inefficiency of these rights. In any field of human activity there are preoccupations regarding the dysfunctionalities that may occur inside it also and consequently one studies the causes, manner of occurrence, their manifestations and consequences. In the domain of guarantee of subjective rights - a legal domain par excellence, but with multiple implications in the other fields of the social sphere - this is much more obvious.

U.E cannot stay out of this reaction and must adapt to the international trend through the reorganization of the regulatory institutions of financial market after another model. Model that includes the regulation of the capital market of all country members'. Our research is preoccupied with the construction of a unique capital market in Europe; to realize this we need at least 3 basic elements. Firstly, a concept concerning the new markets, secondly, a unique reglementation and thirdly, a unitary infrastructure that will ensure the implementation of unique regulations. Like in other situations, EU works in a unique reglementation framework, builds infrastructure elements such as EMIR (European Market Infrastructure Regulation), without having a clearly contoured concept concerning the new unique market. The construction of a European capital market integrated in the global economy formed a cornerstone of the action plan on financial services and is one of the key objectives of the European Union. Our research proposes to realize a modulation that will ensure the optimal evolution of a unique European capital market, modulation that will ensure a reglementation symbiosis, pretty uneven in most European states. The reglementation that will have the consolidation phase with relative few legislative initiatives and a smoothing phase in which the European rules must be transposed in an efficient way in the national legislation and put into application correctly of the supervision authorities of each state member. The reglementation must allow establishing and showing the way this will be working in practice. It will be a challenge not only for the member states, but also for the EU institutions responsible of the monitorization of progress and the insurance of coherence application in the Union. The elaborated politics at the EU level are affected and have a influence over the politics and legislation from the other parts of the world. Therefore, it will be very important that they will get involved closely the reglementation authorities from the outside of the European union and ensure that the operating range of the rules, both in and outside EU, to be reasonable and equitable, and designed to facilitate the commercial exchanges and the provision of services abroad.

Monetary policy that was fundamentally based on interest rate regulation was neutralized by a liquidity trap. Central banks started to look for and use unconventional instruments: quantitative easing (QE), negative interest rates, currency floor. The reason for such radical steps was fear of deflation: most economists consider deflation (a fall in the price level) as a very costly development of economies. It seems politicians and central bankers are even more afraid of deflation. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is one of the first central banks that started to use unconventional monetary policy measures. The Czech National Bank (CNB) does not hide it is inspired by SNB in its fight against deflation. Are unconventional steps a good way how to avoid deflation and are they necessary? In this context we focus only on a fragment of this very broad area: deflation and growth. Several recent studies confirm that the link between output growth and deflation is relatively weak. We try to find how strong the association between goods and services price deflations and growth is in Switzerland where a recent period of deflation starts in the end of 2011.

In turn, Free Riga was jointly launched by the artists and the entrepreneurs. The projects resulted in the revitalisation of the disused or low-quality urban spaces via the low-budget interventions. Instead of municipal agencies, these projects were initiated by the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the urban revival activists. Free Riga is still running. Therefore, the main research methods employed were the semi-structured interviews, the participant observations and the field observations. The projects differed from each other in terms of organisation, influence on the urban environment and resident engagement. Pagalmu Renesanse and Labas Vietas Talka had the clear organisation structures and the action plans, whereas Free Riga began its activity with any structure or plan. Overall, the projects succeeded in changing the local built environment. The resident engagement was evaluated according to the contemporary adaptation of Arnstein's (1969) classical work.

The aim of this article is the identification of key metrics which influence the origin and the solution of alarms in the automotive industry. To gain this aim, we used the analysis of the company and assembly line, lean management focus, the analysis of a target of the process, identification of the sequence procedure in processes, the definition of internal and external conditions. We created the Petri net based on the particular process map by means of BPMN notation. In the article we use Petri nets as a way to identify attributes, which slow down the process or duplicate its performance. Based on the outcomes of the Petri net simulation, we suggest optimisation and we define the equation to set the ideal time of alarm messages. We point out the deduction of key metrics influencing the alarms as one of main results of the research. The results were implemented to the assembly line in the automotive industry.","[Priscakova, Zuzana; Oralek, Tomas] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Buy, Dmytro] Kyiv Natl Taras Shevchenko Univ, Fac Cybernet, Dept Theory & Technol Programming, Kiev, Ukraine",Mendel University in Brno; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv,"Priscáková, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",zuzana.priscakova@hotmail.com; xoralek@node.mendelu.cz; buy@unicyb.kiev.ua,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,727,736,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000079,0

In Malaysia, both the banking sector and the government have expended relentless efforts to ensure Malaysians have access to financing and affordable houses. These efforts are however being derailed by alarming cases of abandoned housing projects (AHPs) that have affected a substantial number of house buyers. Several reasons have been cited for the AHPs. The issues of the Islamic banking debt based home financing products have remained prominent. The literature argues that these products such as BBA and Tawarruq have embedded features of transferring risks and liabilities to home buyers. This problem becomes acute in cases of AHPs. Musharakah Mutanaqisah or Diminishing Partnership (DP) is suggested as the superior option for Islamic home financing schemes. However, there is hardly any work that has investigated the extent to which DP can provide remedy to address the problem of abandoned housing projects. The present paper adopts content analysis and it shows that DP has a bright prospect of mitigating the problem of abandoned housing projects.

For analyzing the Okun's coefficient are used four types of models such that, the difference model, the dynamic model, ECM, and VAR estimation approach, in order to consider both, the short term and the long term possible relationship. The analysis consists on quarterly data covering the period 2000-2012. The empirical results from all models do not indicate robust evidence and do not confirm an inverse linkage between unemployment rate and economic growth, as the Okun's Law suggests. Based on the VAR methodology and Engel-Granger cointegration test, it doesn't exist a causal relationship between these two variables and a change in the growth rate of real GDP doesn't cause a change in the rate of unemployment and vice-versa. The main reasons that go far to explain the regression outputs are: first, the large informal employment that accounts at about one fourth of total employment and second the structural unemployment. The study also highlights that the country's economic policies have not been suitable for fostering development and reducing unemployment, as the primary source of employment is the public sector rather than the private sector.

A number of Greek enterprises seeking to expand their business activities abroad have formed ISAs with local partners, mostly in South East Europe. There is a general agreement on the role of trust on ISAs' successful operation and positive outcomes. Furthermore, the construct of trust becomes even more important in the volatile environment of South East Europe. In this paper, three propositions are developed in order to investigate the impact of senior management commitment, control mechanisms and goal compatibility on trust among ISA partners. In addition, we suggest that trust has a positive impact on effective knowledge transfer from the partners to the ISAs. The objective of this paper is to lead to a better understanding of the above factors and to set the ground for future empirical research on the importance of trust in ISAs.

An effort on the part of the European Commission has brought significant changes. During the last two decades these changes have been applied to all member states and third countries as well. The ownership structure has changed substantially. This also has an impact on market concentration and production capacities. This paper deals with one aspect of the sugar market - sugar quotas and how they influence the market. The article focuses on the analysis of the current distribution and control of production capacities across the EU. Market concentration has been measured by the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index. This indicator helps us to identify the real power and position of countries and firms operating in the European quota sugar market. The second measure used is the Four firm (Five - firm) concentration ratio, which express the partial share in quota beet sugar production. Recently, there have been about 130 companies operating in the EU - Single Market. Approximately 75% of them are specialized only in sugar beet production. Although we can consider the number of companies operating in the EU to be quite high and would expect a high level of competition, the reality is different. The European market has been dominated by six large multinational alliances that control not just their own production capacities but also the capacities of subsidiaries. The situation in original quota A is even more complicated. Just 19 member states currently produce beet sugar. France has the dominant position in terms of quota size (22.2%), followed by Germany (21.4%) and Poland (10.4%). In the case of this market we can talk about a typical oligopoly. However, the quota sugar market within the EU is primarily controlled by companies (alliances) operating in individual countries. It is therefore necessary to liberalize the European market; otherwise the power and influence of the largest European companies will grow. This situation is especiallycritical in, for example, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary and Sweden, where the allocated quota is controlled by two, or even one subject.","[Smutka, Lubos; Benesova, Irena; Tomsik, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz; benesova@pef.czu.cz; tomsik@pef.czu.cz,"Benesova, Irena/B-3942-2011; Tomšík, Karel/JPK-6180-2023; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Tomsik, Karel/I-2507-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Tomsik, Karel/0000-0002-0396-3553",,,,,17,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,824,833,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000090,0

It has imposed a series of bans on Moldovan agri-food imports starting with the end of last year wines (September 2013), pork meat (April 2014), fresh and canned fruits and vegetables (July 2014), all kinds of meat (October 2014). On July 31, a resolution on the introduction of import duties in respect of imported products whose country of origin is the Republic of Moldova, especially beef, pork, chicken, vegetables, some fruits, cereals, sugar, wine grapes, alcohol, and furniture has been adopted. This situation increases tension among domestic farmers and food producers and sparks concerns among decision makers, due to the high concentration of some of these products on the Russian market. The present paper aims to offer: an alternative vision on the effects these measures may have on different segments of the Moldovan agri-food sector; some attempts to estimate losses in revenue from exports in the most exposed to risk sectors. Some recommendations of measure to overcome the possible negative effects have been formulated. Despite the existence of trade preferential regime between CIS countries since the early 90s of the past century, nontariff barriers remain to be a major impediment to trade among them. Particularly severe are trade embargoes applied by Russia Federation. Although, the experience showed that some of these measures have strong negative impact, other effects appear to be sometimes overstated. This does motivate Russian authorities to use them as a leverage to solve non-economic disagreements, maintaining the dependence of the country and hindering its initiative to promote proper policies to develop its national competitiveness.

In this paper, two types of layout are proposed using the Systematic Layout Planning, which is a systematic way of generating layout alternatives. The proposed layouts are evaluated using the ARENA simulation. The purpose of this paper is to present an application of VSM with simulation during the design of facility layout of an organization.

In an attempt to differentiate in the competitive market, city officials are creating urban visions by collaborating with a variety of stakeholders. However, every stakeholder perceives the visions differently, and the implementation processes are slow. The capability to update the vision can decrease the uncertainty in the success of the overall implemented solution. Therefore, this paper strives to increase understanding of the processes behind areal vision creation and investigates the effects to the resulting area. The paper presents a single intrinsic case study and takes a qualitative approach by analyzing nine thematic interviews on Suurpelto case in Espoo, Finland. The interviewees represent different stakeholders of both vision building and implementation phases and of both private and public sector. The case represents a situation where economical recession radically changed the operational environment and an essential stakeholder backed up from the project during the operational process changing the dynamics and the implementation potential of the original vision. The results indicate that trust between all the stakeholders throughout the vision and implementation phases is essential for succeeding in a project but also a means of gaining trust of the inhabitants. For the practitioners, this implies that more attention should be paid on trust building issues between the different stakeholders throughout the vision building process in order to create trustworthy environments for the potential inhabitants, businesses and other prospects. Potential future research could focus on analyzing the vision progress in a more detailed manner, especially from the perspective of inhabitants of the area. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The main goal of the paper is to review the utilization level of these basic information tools in cost controlling in entities of agricultural primary produce in Slovakia. We derived from the analysis of intra-organizational environment of selected file of entities of agricultural primary produce. Questionnaire survey was used for the purpose of acquiring the initial data. The basic file is presented by entities of agricultural primary produce classified by the legal form. The representativeness of selected file classified by legal form was tested and confirmed by Chi-square goodness of fit test. The existence of dependence between qualitative features identified in questionnaire survey was tested by means of Chi-square contingency test. The survey found out that agricultural entities apply principles of cost controlling covering intra-organizational accounting, budgets and cost calculations, but with a lot of weaknesses mentioned in the paper.

The aforementioned resulted in numerous financial scandals expressed by: large tax evasions, accounting frauds, deprivation of creditors, longtime nonpayment of salaries to employees etc. The primary exit from the aforementioned situation would be the return to the original accounting requirements defined in the first French commercial law (Ordonnance de commerce), according to which the business records need to enable clear insight into the status of property and the overall business, or accountability for operations, in order to protect the interest of numerous users outside of the company. However, in order to provide constant insight into the real economic and financial picture about the overall financial situation (business and monetary success of a company and its parts, along with all its business impacts), in the first place it is necessary to be relieved from the virtual economy, the invention of ardent advocates of economic neoliberalism and market fundamentalism, that opened a wide area for creative accounting and fraudulent financial reporting. Contrary to that, we will insist on economy of more real values, supported by arguments, or we will suggest to our accounting profession to implement the conditional accounting conservatism to include the uncertainty and risk in the financial statements in the corresponding manner.

Combined with the particularity of the county's power supply enterprise, established the capital expenditure budget management system and the cost and expense budget management system, in order to enrich the application mode of our budget management theory in the county power supply enterprise.","[Zheng ShunYuan] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Baoding, Peoples R China; [Yi Jing] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University,"Zheng, SY (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Baoding, Peoples R China.",476595841@qq.com; yijing_bj@126.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,158,162,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700031,0

This has resulted in a regulatory environment that has limited the application of GE mostly to feed and fiber and practically restricted its application in food. While agricultural biotechnology has already provided significant benefits, much of its potential has not been reached. Regulation of agricultural biotechnology reflects conflicting interests and varying political power of different groups. The relatively supportive regulation of biotechnology in the U.S. reflects that it is an American technology, and supporting groups like the farm lobby, technology manufacturers, and U.S. consumers outweigh the objections of environmentalists and other opposition to the technology. In Europe, growing concern about environmental side-effects of agriculture, the fact that GE technology was imported, and the power of environmental groups has resulted in restrictive regulation. To a large extent, the fate of GE depends on the level of goodwill it generates among voters, and as long as a large segment of the population is apprehensive about its benefits, heavy restrictions about the technology that prevent it from reaching its potential will persist.","[Zilberman, David; Kaplan, Scott] Coll Nat Resources, Berkeley, CA USA; [Graff, Gregory] Colorado State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hochman, Gal] Rudgers Univ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Zilberman, David] Coll Nat Resources, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Gianni Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Colorado State University,"Zilberman, D (通讯作者)，Coll Nat Resources, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Gianni Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zilber11@berkeley.edu,,"Graff, Gregory/0000-0002-9140-0901",,,,,62,9,9,0,27,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In addition, the positive associations between bonus and discretionary accruals, between bonus and real earnings management, and between equity compensation and real earnings management, have decreased.

We use a principal-agent model to reexamine the economic case for unilateral action by individual countries, in our case of the principal. We find that the incentive structure that arises in an incomplete information framework may lead to a more positive assessment of unilateral action than in papers that neglect private information. First, we find that a unilateral commitment to emission reductions that is made before contract negotiations always reduces aggregate emissions, in contrast to the results in the seminal contribution by Hoel. Second, we show that the principal often has an interest to unilaterally reduce emissions below the level to which she would be obliged under the standard contract solution. Hence we provide an economic rationale for overcompliance. Multilateral externalities and type-dependent outside options, which are characteristic for climate policies, play a crucial role to explain these results.","[Helm, Carsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Wirl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1,Room 4-635, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Vienna,"Helm, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",carsten.helm@uni.oldenburg.de; franz.wirl@univie.ac.at,"Wirl, Franz/P-2861-2019","Wirl, Franz/0000-0002-2168-8049",,,,,30,1,1,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We also consider whether the common factors of commodity subsectors give an advantage to the pricing of commodity futures' returns. In the cross-section of individual futures' returns we suggest that two-or three-factor models that include energy's or agriculture's common factors can explain commodity returns.

In addition, we examine the influence of various institutional factors, namely, political connections, Bumiputras directors, family firms and richest-men connections on conservatism. Prior literature presents evidence of IFRS convergence on conservatism, but limited evidence exists on the role of institutional factors on conservatism. Using a sample of 1760 firm-year observations from 2004 to 2008, we provide evidence that IFRS enhances conservatism. Firms with Bumiputras directors and family firms are more conservative post-IFRS convergence, whereas the reverse behaviour results for firms with richest-men connections. We find no evidence of politically connected firms being more conservative post-IFRS convergence. Our study provides knowledge on the role of IFRS in conditional conservatism and the role of institutional factors in this relationship. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we examine whether investors expect total industry revenue to increase following a disaster's shock to insurers' financial capital. Rather than examine insurers directly, we study insurance brokers, who earn commissions on premium revenue but do not pay losses following a disaster. We conduct an event study on insurance broker stock returns surrounding the 43 largest insured-loss catastrophes since 1970. We find that brokers earn positive abnormal returns on the day of the event, and that these returns are sustained following the top 20 largest events. We then investigate factors influencing these returns and find that returns are positively related to the size of the loss and negatively related to existing insurer capital. From this, we conclude that catastrophe shocks are expected to increase net industry revenue, benefiting brokers most immediately. This investor response is consistent with economic theories of a negative relationship between capital and insurance prices and price-inelastic demand for commercial insurance.","[Ragin, Marc A.] Temple Univ, Sch Business, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Halek, Martin] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Dept Actuarial Sci Risk Management & Insurance, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ragin, MA (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Sch Business, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",mragin@temple.edu; mhalek@bus.wisc.edu,,"Ragin, Marc/0000-0003-2370-410X",,,,,47,20,20,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

A simple model of tax transfer and redistribution is presented, with various agents facing two different unemployment probabilities. We investigate how the preferred tax rate changes with the probability of being unemployed. We show that, when the probability of unemployment for the less-skilled correlates negatively with that of the highly skilled, the relationship with the tax rate is not monotonic and depends on the level of risk aversion. This theoretical framework is confirmed in an empirical investigation based on microeconomic data, and in a robustness test based on macroeconomic data.","[Antonietti, Roberto; Fontini, Fulvio] Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy; [Farina, Francesco] Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Padua; University of Siena,"Antonietti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",,"Fontini, Fulvio/ABU-8989-2022","Fontini, Fulvio/0000-0002-7446-1585; Antonietti, Roberto/0000-0002-2172-4062",,,,,19,1,1,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Recently, one study addressed the asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes on the S & P 500 index using U.S. data and showed that exchange rate changes have asymmetric effects on the S & P 500 index in the short run but not in the long run. Suspecting that such findings could suffer from aggregation bias, in this paper we investigate the asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes on the stock price indices of eleven different sectors in the U.S. Using asymmetry cointegration and nonlinear ARDL approach, we find that changes in the nominal effective exchange rate of the dollar has significant asymmetric effects in the short run in ten sector's. These effects last into the long run asymmetric effects in six of the eleven sectors. In five of these six sectors, while dollar depreciation has a positive impact on their share prices, dollar appreciation does not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The previous papers focused on the identification of the tourist inns that currently function on the domestic market. Further, their potential as rural facilities was highlighted and their authenticity was discussed. The relevance of this research is linked to the fact that in the early 1990s tourist inns were excluded from the lists of lodging and food-serving facilities, ceasing to be officially ranked. Consequently, the inns' owners were forced to reclassify as other accepted types or, even worse, to function in the shadow economy, without any official ranking. Moreover, the absence of inns on the market and the incoherent development of certain types of lodgings in Romania, have also led to the fact that entrepreneurs and tourists tend to be confused and, sometimes, not able to differentiate one type of accommodation unit from another. The main purpose of this research is to determine the extent to which urban inns can contribute to the authenticity of the Romanian tourism. From a methodological perspective, the paper relies on both official data (collected and processed based on the official Lists of Hospitality Facilities) and on the information available on specialized websites. Thorough analyses have been run in order to identify the tourist structures pretending to be inns, to further categorize and discuss them according to various criteria. The main findings and conclusions of this paper reveal that inns have the potential to contribute to the authenticity of Romania's hospitality industry.","[Coros, Monica Maria; Pop, Cornelia] Univ Babes Bolyai, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Micu (Tautan), Diana-Roua] Groupama Asigurari SA, Bucharest, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Coros, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",monica.coros@gmail.com,"Cornelia, Pop/AAX-6815-2020; Coros, Monica Maria/M-9434-2017","Cornelia, Pop/0000-0002-8912-4303; Coros, Monica Maria/0000-0002-1966-8954",,,,,12,0,0,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,885,897,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700012,0

An element of the originality of this research is the attempt of redefining the concept of place branding so that it is more meaningful from the perspective of spatial analyses.

In line with the switching cost theory, we find that using more than a single bank, as well as the intensity (number of services used), and the scope (bank services used) of the relationship with the main bank play a role in shaping the households' decision to switch.

We investigate whether the growth of non-dealer financial firm trading affected the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) anomaly, a phenomenon that seems to offer opportunities for excess returns. We find that the growth in trading volume by non-dealer financial firms is associated with some mitigation in the UIP anomaly. In contrast, growth in dealer to-dealer and dealer-to-nonfinancial firm trading volume has no impact on the anomaly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To assess the size of the burden which a public good contribution entails for a country, we make use of a specific measure based on Moulin (Econometrica 55:963-977, 1987). In particular, we show that a Pareto optimal allocation which is not in the core can always be blocked by a group of countries with the highest Moulin sacrifices. In this sense, it is the 'overburdening' and thus 'unfair' treatment of some countries that provides the reason for core instability. By contrast, a Pareto optimal allocation is in the core if the public good contributions are fairly equally distributed according to their Moulin sacrifices. The potential implications of our theoretical analysis for global climate policy are also discussed.","[Buchholz, Wolfgang] Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Haupt, Alexander] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Grad Sch Management, Drake Circus Plymouth PL4 8AA, England; [Haupt, Alexander] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Drake Circus Plymouth PL4 8AA, England; [Peters, Wolfgang] European Univ Viadrina, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Grosse Scharrnstr 59, D-15230 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",University of Regensburg; University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Buchholz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",wolfgang.buchholz@ur.de; Alexander.haupt@plymouth.ac.uk; Peters@europa-uni.de,,,BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) through RECAP [FKZ 01LA1139A]; ECCUITY [FKZ 01LA1104B],BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) through RECAP(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); ECCUITY,"We thank the participants of a seminar at the CAU Kiel, at the meeting of the AURO in Linz and the TUB Berlin and particularly Thomas Eichner for their valuable comments.

The relationship between free float and liquidity is evident in all regions regardless of the degree of economic development or geographic location and is more pronounced when the legal structure and corporate governance environment are strong. We present evidence that free float can mitigate liquidity dry-ups when there are large shocks to market liquidity, such as during the recent financial crisis.

Recent operational risk literature reports that the attempts to estimate loss distributions by the maximum likelihood method are not always successful under the truncation approach that accounts for the existence of censored lossesthe likelihood surface is sometimes ascending with no global solution. The literature offers an alternative called the shifting approach, which estimates the loss distribution without taking into account censored losses. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the global solution to the likelihood maximization problem under the truncation approach when the true loss distribution is lognormal, and derive a practically explicit expression for the global solution. We show by a simulation study that, as the sample size increases, the capital bias by the truncation approach declines while the bias by the shifting approach does not.","[Ergashev, Bakhodir] Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC USA; [Pavlikov, Konstantin; Uryasev, Stan] Univ Florida, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Risk Management & Financial Engn Lab, 303 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sekeris, Evangelos] AON, 9841 Broken Land Pkwy,Suite 305, Columbia, MD 21046 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ergashev, B (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC USA.",bakhodir.ergashev@occ.treas.gov; kpavlikov@ufl.edu; uryasev@ufl.edu; evangelos.sekeris@aon.com,"Pavlikov, Konstantin/I-4317-2019; URYASEV, Stan/O-5231-2014","Pavlikov, Konstantin/0000-0002-3345-5058; URYASEV, Stan/0000-0001-6950-3966",,,,,21,8,8,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We use claims data from a representative sample of over 500,000 individuals covered by the National Health insurance scheme, from 2008 to 2013. These data contain individual-level information (gender, age, date of death), some clinical information and detailed information on each medical treatment (inpatient, outpatient, drugs). Medical spending in France is highly concentrated. In 2013, 10 per cent of the population accounted for 62 per cent of all health care spending. In addition, the concentration of medical expenditure increased between 2008 and 2013. The concentration of insurance reimbursement, however, is even greater, indicating that French social health insurance redistributes income from the healthy to the unhealthy. The serial correlation of health care expenditures appears relatively high between adjacent years, but not surprisingly decreases over time. Decedents have high medical expenditures - on average, eight times those of survivors - and resources devoted to health care in the last three years of life represent, on average, 22 per cent of lifetime medical spending. Decedents' expenditures decrease with age after 55 years old.","[Gastaldi-Menager, Christelle; de lagasnerie, Gregoire] CNAMTS, Paris, France; [Geoffard, Pierre-Yves] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Geoffard, Pierre-Yves] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Gastaldi-Ménager, C (通讯作者)，CNAMTS, Paris, France.",christelle.gastaldi-menager@cnamts.fr; pierre-yves.geoffard@psemail.eu; gregoire.de-lagasnerie@cnamts.fr,,,,,,,39,10,11,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Although Basel II lowers the incentives of internal ratings-based (IRB) banks to recognize income-increasing DLLPs in an opportunistic manner, it has no such impact on the remaining banks, which adopt the Standardized methodology. We use this setup in a difference-in-difference (DiD) design, where Standardized banks act as a control group. Our evidence supports the three hypotheses that, for IRB relative to Standardized banks, Basel II is associated with (i) less income-increasing DLLPs and (ii) less income-smoothing via DLLPs, which enhances the informational content of DLLPs about future loan losses and leads to (iii) higher market valuation of DLLPs.

In particular, we attempt to determine (1) whether competition can be induced among prospective sellers, (2) whether or not competition increases aggregation rates, and (3) what effects competition has on the distribution of surplus among the bargaining parties.

To do so, we make use of a laboratory experiment where all the relevant information about the project is common knowledge and landowner valuations are private information. Our results show that competition more than doubles aggregation rates, with aggregation rates of approximately 40% in the baseline, and at least 84% in the competitive treatments.

Households experiencing economic hardship may turn to receiving government assistance to alleviate the hardship or distress. Receiving government assistance may improve a household's financial situation as it could be decreasing its reliance on debt or even improving a household's ability to repay their current debt. We investigated how households' financial debt obligations were affected by receiving government assistance, as has not been previously analyzed. Given the focus of this research, we included households under 185 % of poverty threshold released by the 2012 US Census Bureau. Results from the 2010 and 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that government assistance was positively related to the odds of meeting debt-to-income ratio guidelines, implying that government assistance plays an important role in financial security of low-income households.

First, the redistributive effects of the Japanese income tax declined during 1984-2009. Second, base effects substantially exceeded rate effects over this period. Third, credit effects greatly decreased the redistributive effect, as Japanese tax credits were proportional to tax liabilities with upper limits.","[Miyazaki, Takeshi] Kyushu Univ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Japan; [Kitamura, Yukinobu] Hitotsubashi Univ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",Kyushu University; Hitotsubashi University,"Miyazaki, T (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Japan.",tmiyazak@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp; kitamura@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"Joint Usage and Research Center, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02029] Funding Source: KAKEN","Joint Usage and Research Center, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Joint Usage and Research Center, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University.",,44,5,5,2,17,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,SEP,2016,72.0,3,,,,,334,368,,10.1628/001522116X14677232484086,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EA1AQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386321100004,0

Our set of controls for background wealth is comprehensive, and include, as a novelty in this type of studies, pension wealth. The inference about the risk profile of British households depends upon the relevant measure of background wealth. We do not find support for decreasing relative risk aversion (DRRA). Constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) prevails for the case of liquid wealth, but for the broadest definitions those including home equity and pensions the evidence favours increasing relative risk aversion (IRRA).

Our results for two benchmark term structure models show that higher order ARMA processes provide a significantly better fit than standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We then explore present value models linking stock prices and dividends in the presence of cointegration. Our methods enable us to take account of the fact that the two variables are observed in fundamentally different ways by explicitly modelling the data as mixed stock-flow type, which we then compare with the (more common, but incorrect) treatment of dividends as a stock variable.

Using internal data provided by insurance companies, this article describes the relationship between the level of limited coverage and excess premiums.

Others claim that trade liberalization effectively lessens pollution by allowing a more efficient use of resources and the diffusion of clean technologies. In part because these theories generate similar predictions for industrialized countries, empirical studies have not provided conclusive evidence for either argument. To identify the role of trade, I draw on the insights of the diffusion literature and estimate a spatial regression model where trade operates as the mechanism through which pollution shifts from country to country. Using the case of per-capita carbon dioxide emissions, I find that once spatial correlation is accounted for, the EKC disappears. The effect is even stronger when looking at trade from developing countries only, providing support for the pollution haven hypothesis. I also show that the trajectory of developing countries goes above the one previously followed by industrialized countries. This suggests that developing countries carry on an additional carbon burden above the one that would be obtained in the absence of trade. These findings contribute to the literature on the non-economic effects of trade and the constraints of domestic policies when the costs of trade are low.","[Aklin, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, 4600 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Aklin, Michael] Univ Penn, Browne Ctr Int Polit, 222 Stiteler Hall,208 South 37th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Pennsylvania,"Aklin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, 4600 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Aklin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Browne Ctr Int Polit, 222 Stiteler Hall,208 South 37th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",aklin@pitt.edu,"Aklin, Michael/JEZ-7827-2023","Aklin, Michael/0000-0003-3912-082X",,,,,60,79,83,2,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In the model, a politically-inclined local government receives campaign contributions from the polluters' lobby in return for lower pollution taxes. A benevolent federal government uses IGG as an incentive to reduce the resulting distortion in the local pollution tax. IGG are formulaic transfers that are conditional on pollution levels-lower pollution in a sub-national jurisdiction relative to others translates into a higher share of the grant and vice versa. In equilibrium, the grant effect reduces the distortion created in the pollution tax by the lobby effect, and may even lead to a higher than Pigouvian tax when the local government assigns a large enough weight on social welfare and/or when the grant is large enough. Further, IGG result in the tax levels of jurisdictions becoming interdependent in an interesting way. Environmental policies in two jurisdictions may become strategic complements or substitutes depending on their relative pollution levels. The possibility of strategic substitution implies that federal welfare may not increase even when environmental policy becomes stricter in one state.","[Datt, Divya; Mehra, Meeta Keswani] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Int Studies, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Datt, D (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Int Studies, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi, India.",divya.datt@gmail.com; meetakm@mail.jnu.ac.in,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A city's greatest polluters typically reside in affluent suburban communities located along the city's periphery, while those creating the least emissions reside in central locations, and most likely experience the largest associated health burdens. Using the culturally diverse city of Leicester as a study case, and building on Mitchell and Dorling's (2003) localised form of the Polluter Pays Principle, we investigate this environmental injustice. A pattern detection analysis of localised intra-urban interactions was undertaken using a 'Local Indicators of Spatial Association' (LISA) modelling approach of high resolution census data, Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) records, road transport emission maps and geocoded hospital admissions records provided by the NHS Leicester City Primary Care Trust. Pearson's R statistics identified an inverse correlation between mobile polluters and communities characterised as either socially (-0.78) or environmentally burdened ( -0.34), confirming the existence of environmental inequalities. While some inner-city communities moderately contribute towards their environmental burden, these contributions were substantially outweighed by those made by external communities, whom appear to avoid the social, environment and physical cost of their actions. In contrast to their more affluent counterparts, residents of less affluent areas tend to use 'greener' and more active transport options, although any associated health benefits appear largely offset by increased periods of environmental exposure. Strong signs of spatial structuring within the modelling framework, suggest there may be a need to tailor travel schemes to local populaces. For example, in affluent areas where less environmentally friendly transport options tend to be adopted, options based on local carpool schemes may be more amenable than those based on enhanced public services.

Control-ownership disparity occurs when certain shareholders of a firm have actual voting power that exceeds the corresponding equity ownership. This may matter to foreign investors because the disparity gives rise to the risk of tunneling by the controlling shareholders. The empirical results show that foreign investors prefer firms with low control ownership disparity, suggesting that they are sensitive to corporate governance of firms they invest in. More interestingly, foreign portfolio investors are more sensitive to control ownership disparity than foreign strategic investors who are usually corporations in related industries. Further, the control-ownership disparity has stronger negative effects on foreign portfolio investors when they invest in Chaebol-affiliated firms than non-Chaebol firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The contention here is that a rethinking of 'normality', 'habit' and 'routine' reveals how mobilities are interdependent, imagined and embodied. We draw from Lefebvre's (1991) notions of social space and rhythmanalysis to illustrate the relationality of these aspects of mobility. In doing so, we build on recent theorisations of habit in the field of mobilities, which have opened this concept as a key site for interrogating body society relationships arguing that both 'routine' and 'normality' have similar potential in revealing the regulation and control of everyday spaces. We consider everyday embodied engagements with mobile space and how these become normalised, habitualised and routinised. This paper draws from a Research Council UK Energy Programme funded project, 'Disruption, the raw material for carbon change', which uses 'disruption' as a lens through which to reveal potential for changes in mobility practices that result in carbon reduction. Our exploration of interdependent, imagined and embodied mobilities concurs with existing scholarship in the mobilities field that argues for a rethinking of individualised conceptions of 'normality', 'habit' and 'routine' in seeking an understanding of mobilities that are socially, culturally and materially contingent.

While this has helped consolidate an emerging body of theory concerned with the social consequences of mobility, our understanding of these dynamics in the context of high vulnerability and poverty in the Global South is still relatively undeveloped. Through the case of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Colombia's capital, Bogota, this paper explores travel strategies in a context of scarce provision of transport which, when combined with acute conditions of low-income and segregation, limit vulnerable populations' access to the city. The travel practices, perceptions and priorities of low-income populations in deprived areas of the Global South are analysed, using a framework of transport-related social exclusion, to critically examine the elements that play a role in gaining access to the city. The emergence of adaptable methods, relations and transactions between demand and supply that allows deprived populations to reduce their risk of becoming socially excluded show potential for conceptual and practical development in addressing and analysing transport-related social exclusion.

We adopted news coverage and news sentiment to quantify text information from news articles and quantified the qualitative risk disclosures of individual firms in their corporate filings (i.e., Form 10-K and 10-Q). Our empirical study, based on 13 years of CDS data, provides several conclusions. First, more news coverage and negative news sentiment increase credit risk. Second, a higher overall volume of risk factor disclosure in corporate public filings is linked to a higher credit risk for debt issuers. Moreover, financial risk has the strongest effect among the five types of risk disclosures we considered. Overall, our results suggest that text information from newspapers and corporate filings contains incremental informational content for firms' credit risk evaluations. These two information sources play distinctive roles in signaling issuers' future credit conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, we know little about the determinants of this type of start-ups and, specifically, the relevance of context effects. Drawing on organizational and regional context literature, we develop and test a model that aims to explain student entrepreneurship in a contextual perspective. Based on unique micro-data and using multi-level techniques, we analyse nascent and new entrepreneurial activities of business and economics students at 41 European universities. Our analysis reveals that individual and contextual determinants influence students' propensity to start a business. While peoples' individual characteristics are most important, the organizational and regional contexts also play a role and have a differentiated effect, depending on the source of the venture idea and the stage of its development. Organizational characteristics, like the prevalence of fellow students who have attended entrepreneurship education, influence whether students take action to start a new firm (nascent entrepreneurship) but do not seem to support the actual establishment of a new firm. In contrast, the latter is less dependent on the university context but more strongly influenced by regional characteristics. Overall, our study contributes to our understanding of the emergence of start-ups in the organizational context of universities and has implications for initiatives and programs that aim at encouraging students to become entrepreneurs.","[Bergmann, Heiko] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Res Inst Small Business & Entrepreneurship, Dufourstr 40a, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Hundt, Christian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Geog, Urban & Reg Econ, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Sternberg, Rolf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of St Gallen; Ruhr University Bochum; Leibniz University Hannover,"Bergmann, H (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Res Inst Small Business & Entrepreneurship, Dufourstr 40a, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",heiko.bergmann@unisg.ch; christian.hundt@rub.de; sternberg@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,,"Bergmann, Heiko/0000-0002-4693-3231; Hundt, Christian/0000-0002-5202-830X; Sternberg, Rolf/0000-0002-7649-0419",,,,,108,132,146,7,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

A standard explanation is that an SEO communicates negative information to investors. We show that if repeated capital market transactions are possible, this same asymmetry of information between firms and investors implies that some firms also repurchase shares in equilibrium.

To increase take-up, many districts have implemented Breakfast in the Classroom (BIC), offering breakfast directly to students at the start of the school day. Beyond increasing participation, advocates claim BIC improves academic performance, attendance, and engagement. Others caution BIC has deleterious effects on child weight. We use the implementation of BIC in New York City (NYC) to estimate its impact on meals program participation, body mass index (BMI), achievement, and attendance. While we find large effects on participation, our findings provide no evidence of hoped-for gains in academic performance, or of feared increases in obesity. The policy case for BIC will depend upon reductions in hunger and food insecurity for disadvantaged children, or its longer-term effects.","[Corcoran, Sean P.] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Educ Econ, 246 Greene St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Elbel, Brian] NYU, Sch Med, Populat Hlth & Hlth Policy, 227 East 30th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Elbel, Brian] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, 227 East 30th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Schwartz, Amy Ellen] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Publ Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",New York University; New York University; New York University; Syracuse University,"Corcoran, SP (通讯作者)，NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, Educ Econ, 246 Greene St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10003 USA.",sean.corcoran@nyu.edu; brian.elbel@nyumc.org; amyschwartz@syr.edu,"Corcoran, Sean Patrick/IST-7442-2023","Corcoran, Sean Patrick/0000-0002-0640-2751; Elbel, Brian/0000-0003-1615-9430",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [1R01HD070739]; New York City Department of Education; Office of School Food,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); New York City Department of Education; Office of School Food,"This project was supported by Award Number 1R01HD070739 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development.

Among different initiatives, mandatory central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives has been one of the most prominent. Because OTC derivatives entail default management procedures that are far more complex than listed derivatives, risk management procedures have to follow suit. The recent paper by Vicente et al. (2015) propose an innovative way to calculate margin requirements by using multi-period robust optimization (RO) methods that accounts for important differences between OTC and listed derivatives default procedures. Motivated by this methodology, this paper proposes a hybrid framework to construct discrete uncertainty sets, in which each element of this set can be seen as multi-period stress scenarios, which are necessary to solve the RO problem faced by the Central Counterparty (CCP). When applied to determine the margin requirements, the present method provides both qualitative and quantitative results that outperform other robust optimization models such as Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (2000) and Bertsimas and Pachamanova (2008).

This federally-imposed constraint was lifted by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This paper examines how this credibly exogenous policy change which was little noticed outside of the municipal bond industry reduced the cost of capital, and, as a result, led to a significant increase in the use of tax-exempt debt overall and relative to other financing sources by nonprofit colleges and universities. Using two different comparison groups and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that nonprofit colleges and universities significantly increased the use of tax-exempt borrowing and altered capital structures following the policy change in 1997 with some variation by degree of constraint.","[Ely, Todd L.] Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Calabrese, Thad D.] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; New York University,"Ely, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, Denver, CO 80202 USA.;Calabrese, TD (通讯作者)，NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY USA.",todd.ely@ucdenver.edu; thad.calabrese@nyu.edu,,"Ely, Todd/0000-0003-3580-5493",,,,,27,4,4,0,9,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The results suggest that funds tend to outperform the optimized portfolio out-of-sample (when means/variances/covariances are unknown), but under-perform in-sample (when the required statistics in the optimization are known).

Its focus of attention is East Asia, where economic development is underpinned by a complex set of international flows of trade and investment. Business connectivity is a key part of these flows. The research incorporates a measure of business connections in a regression model that previously relied on GDP per head, population and distance to account for international air links. Results confirm that business connectivity is a more important influence on the level of international air links within East Asia, and plays a major role in explaining the changes in city rank over time. The paper concludes with suggestions that possible incorporation of domestic air travel (itself larger than the intra-regional flows in this region) could enrich the insight of this approach.

This approach enables us to analyze both long-run equilibrium growth path and short-run dynamics across the regions.

The Metropolitan Area of Granada (Spain) is a case in point. To address this gap, this present paper presents the results of a participatory process (MOBYPANEL) used to analyse how a set of local stakeholders perceived the opportunities offered by the implementation of an LRT to achieve sustainable mobility goals. A total of 50 stakeholders were asked to participate, assessing the suitability of LRT to promote 42 mobility policies previously selected, and the relevance of these policies in leading LRT to reach five sustainable mobility goals. The results revealed an overall high consensus among stakeholders concerning the positive role of the LRT in the successful implementation of most of the policies analysed, with some exceptions within environmental and car-charging economic measures. Also, 'accessibility', Intermodality' and 'efficient management' were, in general, more firmly considered than 'urban integration' and 'environmental quality' as goals for implementing sustainable urban mobility policies within the context of the LRT project. The study also provides a discussion on the role of the LRT as a means for sustainable urban mobility policy delivery and as an end for strategy making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, insurer's stock prices have been observed to decrease 2 days prior to downgrades, suggesting that informed trading occurs during the predowngrade period. This study examines the trading activity of short sellers surrounding insurer financial strength ratings. We show that short selling is abnormally high during the predowngrade period-indicating that short sellers can predict rating downgrades. Interestingly, we find that predowngrade short selling is driven by stocks of insurers with the most transparent balance sheets. This result suggests that while short sellers can predict rating downgrades generally, the opaqueness of an insurer's assets and liabilities can inhibit informed trading during the predowngrade period.","[Wade, Chip] Mississippi State Univ, 312 McCool Hall, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Liebenberg, Andre] Univ Mississippi, Dept Finance, Oxford, MS 38677 USA; [Blau, Benjamin M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Mississippi State University; University of Mississippi; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Wade, C (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, 312 McCool Hall, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",CWade@cobilan.msstate.edu,,"Liebenberg, Andre/0000-0001-5688-0033; Blau, Benjamin/0000-0002-5260-3378",,,,,43,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

While the market benefits of rail station access are well-documented, inconsistent and insufficient methods have led to limited agreement on the true value associated with this locational amenity. Far fewer hedonic price studies have assessed the influence of bike facility access on housing sales prices, and those that have generally analyze cross-sectional data. In this study, we estimated a spatial hedonic model using a bootstrapped pseudo panel to determine the joint impact of network proximity to bike lanes and off-street multi-use paths, as well as light rail and streetcar stations, on housing sales in Portland, Oregon, from 2002 to 2013. Our findings revealed housing sales prices increased as network distance to the nearest light rail transit and streetcar station decreased. Likewise, owner-occupied single-family and multifamily housing sales rose in conjunction with reduced street network access to regional multi-use bike paths; however, improved proximity to on-street bike lanes negatively affected housing values. In sum, we believe these findings may help to inform non-automotive transportation infrastructure financing mechanisms that rely on rising property values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To quantify this impact, a set of regression models were tested to study the relation between residential energy demand for space heating in Iceland and explanatory variables such as Heating Degree Days and GDP per capita. Considering the nonstationarity of the time-series, three methods were studied to cope with this condition: Cointegration, differencing and detrending. The evaluation statistics of the three models for the validation period showed that the modified detrending approach is the most reliable method. It became obvious that including the seasonal dummy variables and AR component significantly improve the power of the model to predict monthly energy demand for residential space heating in Iceland. The developed model can be used to project climate related changes in demand for low-geothermal heat.","[Fazeli, Reza; Davidsdottir, Brynhildur] Univ Iceland, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Hallgrimsson, Jonas Hlynur] Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Fazeli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",rfazeli@hi.is; bdavids@hi.is; jhh4@hi.is,,"Davidsdottir, Brynhildur/0000-0001-9783-9942; Fazeli, Reza/0000-0002-0322-5235",Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR); Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change,Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR); Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change,"We wish to thank the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR) for providing funds for this study.

By decomposing the pairwise relationship between oil-US dollar and gold-US dollar into short-term and long-term components, risk managers who are pursuing different decision-making horizons would be able to moderate their risk exposures according to these results. Empirical findings indicate that the pairwise relations became weaker as the time frames being observed widened, suggesting that short-term correlations were much higher after early 1990s. The Fed monetary policy is the main driver to the pairwise correlations of oil-US dollar and gold-US dollar. The dynamic interdependences also indicate that crude oil market has been dominated by the US dollar while gold leads the US dollar in the short run after early 1990s. On the other hand, we find that financial crises do accelerate interdependences between oil-US dollar and gold-US dollar, which alter the original relationship between these assets. The risk variables of TED spread and variance of S&P 500 predict the closer oil-US dollar and gold-US dollar correlations during the crisis period. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We employ a binary choice trust game and show that principals are confronted with a complex optimization problem: risk mitigation lowers the principal's cost of betrayal but if agents are inequality averse or reciprocally minded, it can also increase its likelihood. This may be exacerbated in cultures not used to fostering trust by risk mitigation. Our experiments suggest that lowering risk only increases trust in the United States but not in Jordan. In both countries, trustworthiness decreases as the principal's vulnerability decreases. We extend our findings to naturally occurring vulnerabilities in addition to the financial ones created in the laboratory. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The model's solution is employed to highlight the outcomes that we believe could be related to EMU membership and Greek government policies after assuming membership. Our finding is that intervention by the Greek government either worsened the harmful impacts of the transfers, or altered the outcomes in a deleterious fashion; the policies which were put in place were of a nature leading unavoidably to a severe economic crisis and eventual bankruptcy.

Using changes in firm-level credit ratings and credit default swap spreads to proxy for changes in credit risk, we find a positive association between GC promotions to senior management and increases in firm credit risk.

Quasi-natural experiments' evidence from transit strikes,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transit subsidies; Public transit; Traffic congestion; Congestion relief benefit; Strike,TRAFFIC CONGESTION; ROAD CONGESTION; ECONOMIES; MODEL,"One of the unanswered questions in the field of urban economics is to which extent subsidies to public transit are justified. We examine one of the main benefits of public transit, a reduction in car congestion externalities, the so-called congestion relief benefit, using quasi-natural experimental data on citywide public transit strikes for Rotterdam, a city with mild congestion levels. On weekdays, a strike induces travel times to increase only marginally on the highway ring road (0.017 min/km) but substantially on inner city roads (0.224 min/km). During rush hour, the strike effect is much more pronounced. The congestion relief benefit of public transit is substantial, equivalent to about 80% of the public transit subsidy. We demonstrate that during weekends, travel time does not change noticeably due to strikes. Furthermore, we show that public transit strikes induce similar increases in number of cyclists as number of car travelers suggesting that bicycling-promoting policies to reduce car congestion externalities might be attractive in combination with first-best congestion pricing.

Although this tendency-known as the peak-end rule-is well studied in adult humans, little work has addressed the origins of this tendency, both developmentally and evolutionarily. Here we explore whether 3 populations-human adults, human children, and capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella)-structure events in order to maximize their experience through picking sequences with the best endpoint. Experiment 1 first demonstrates that peak-end effects can be observed in phylogenetically close species; we found that capuchins preferred to receive a food reward with the tastiest part delivered at the end of the event rather than the beginning, and showed a marginal preference for a reward with a short but high peak to a reward with a longer but less intense peak. We then tested whether these 3 populations structure their sequences using high peaks and ends to maximize pleasure. We found that all 3 populations fail to construct their experiences in ways that maximize hedonic gains. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the evolutionary and developmental origins of the peak-end effect.","[Brad, Louisa C.

Corporate taxes and labor income taxes can affect both the firm owner's and the employee's incentives to commit to innovative tasks, when the former compensates the latter (a manager or a technical or R&D employee) by means of variable pay tied to measures of the company's success. Results point to complementary roles between patent box tax incentives and reductions in the tax rate levied on profit-sharing schemes, and they show that a revenue-neutral reform substituting the latter for the former is always possible. The complementarity holds, albeit with different relative importance for the two tax incentives, also with nondeductible labor costs and with a stochastic innovation value coupled with a risk-averse agent.","[d'Andria, Diego] Commiss European Communities, Edificio EXPO,C Inca Garcilasio 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain",,"d'Andria, D (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Edificio EXPO,C Inca Garcilasio 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",diego.dandria@gmail.com,,"d'Andria, Diego/0000-0002-1915-4128",German Science Foundation (DFG) [RTG 1411],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"European Commission, Edificio EXPO, c/ Inca Garcilasio 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain (diego.dandria@gmail.com).

We too find a positive relation at a quarterly horizon. However, the relation turns strongly negative at the one-year horizon used in anomaly studies. We consider several explanations for institutions' tendency to trade contrary to anomaly prescriptions.

First, early warning indicators based on credit and residential investment data show a high probability of a boom-bust cycle occurring. Second, the policy rate path that minimizes the boom-bust probability-based expected value of a social loss associated with inflation and the output gap over the two scenarios is higher than the rate path by the Taylor-type rule.

We do not find support to attribute it to legislative malapportionment during periods when democratic governments were in place; nor did we find any evidence that the tax sharing distribution pattern became less biased under centralized military governments. We argue that these results are at least partly attributable to two of Argentina's institutional characteristics: first, the predominance of the executive branch over the legislature (main fiscal decisions are the outcome of a bargaining process among executive authorities); and, second, the lack of any significant difference in the pattern of geographic representation in the executive branch under democratic and autocratic governments. Thus, the observed biases in the distribution of tax revenues among the Argentine provinces are not caused by legislative malapportionment, but are probably the result of a more structural equilibrium that transcends the geographic distribution of legislative representation and even the nature of the political regime. Our findings illustrate the importance of informal institutions and de facto mechanisms to study fiscal federalism in developing countries.","[Torre, Ivan] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Torrens, Gustavo] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Galiani, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, 4105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",galiani@econ.umd.edu,,"Torre, Ivan/0000-0003-0804-4895",,,,,34,13,13,0,6,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

We take a first step toward characterizing how this intergenerational link matters for tax policy design. We find that the utilitarian welfare-maximizing policy in this context would be more redistributive toward low-income parents than under current U.S. tax policy. The additional income under such a policy would increase the probability that low-income children move up the economic ladder, and we estimate that it would generate an aggregate welfare gain equivalent to 1.75 percent of lifetime consumption.","[Gelber, Alexander] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA USA; [Gelber, Alexander] Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA USA; [Weinzierl, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Weinzierl, Matthew] Natl Bur Econ Res, Boston, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gelber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA USA.;Gelber, A (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA USA.;Weinzierl, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.;Weinzierl, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Boston, MA USA.",agelber@nber.org; mweinzierl@hbs.edu,,,Entrepreneurship and Family Business Research Centre at Wharton; Center for Human Resources at Wharton; Mack Center at Wharton; Zicklin Center at Wharton; Risk and Decision Processes Center at Wharton; Global Initiatives Center at Wharton,Entrepreneurship and Family Business Research Centre at Wharton; Center for Human Resources at Wharton; Mack Center at Wharton; Zicklin Center at Wharton; Risk and Decision Processes Center at Wharton; Global Initiatives Center at Wharton,"We thank participants at the Cowles Summer Conference on Advances in Dynamic Taxation, the National Tax Association annual meeting, and seminars at IFS/LSE, Harvard University, Hebrew University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Stanford University.

Marginal price refers to the amount colleges charge for each additional credit taken in a semester. Institutions differ in how they price credits above the full-time minimum (of 12 credits), with many institutions reducing the marginal price of such credits to zero. We find that a zero marginal price induces a modest share of students (i.e., 7 percent) to attempt up to one additional class (i.e., three credits) but also increases withdrawals and lowers course performance. The analysis generally suggests minimal impacts on credits earned and the likelihood of meeting on-time benchmarks toward college completion, though estimates for these outcomes are less precise and more variable across specifications. Consistent with theory, the effect on attempted credits is largest among students who would otherwise locate at the full-time minimum, which includes lower-achieving and socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

To identify the behavioral and neural responses mediating framing of social interactions, participants underwent functional MRI while playing a prisoner's dilemma game. In separate neuroimaging sessions, the game was either framed as a cooperation game or a competition game. The framing of social decisions engaged the hippocampal formation, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and lateral temporal gyrus. Among these regions, the engagement of the left hippocampus was further modulated by individual differences in empathy. Social decisions not adhering to the frame were associated with stronger engagement of the angular gyrus and trend increases in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior intraparietal cortex, and temporopolar cortex. Our findings provide the first insight into the mechanisms underlying framing of behavior in social dilemmas, indicating increased engagement of the hippocampus and neocortical areas involved in memory, social reasoning, and mentalizing when participants make decisions that conform to the imposed social frame.","[Macoveanu, Julian; Skov, Martin; Siebner, Hartwig R.] Copenhagen Univ Hosp Hvidovre, Ctr Funct & Diagnost Imaging & Res, Danish Res Ctr Magnet Resonance, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Macoveanu, Julian] Rigshosp, Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Ctr Psychiat, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ramsoy, Thomas Z.] Singular Univ, Holbaek, Denmark; [Ramsoy, Thomas Z.] Neurons Inc, Holbaek, Denmark; [Skov, Martin] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Decis Neurosci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Siebner, Hartwig R.] Copenhagen Univ Hosp Bispebjerg, Dept Neurol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fosgaard, Toke R.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet; Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen; Bispebjerg Hospital; University of Copenhagen,"Fosgaard, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",tf@ifro.ku.dk,"Macoveanu, Julian/H-4256-2019; Siebner, Hartwig Roman/ISS-8209-2023; Ramsøy, Thomas Z/E-2849-2019; Fosgaard, Toke R./E-6666-2015","Macoveanu, Julian/0000-0001-6148-9477; Siebner, Hartwig Roman/0000-0002-3756-9431; Fosgaard, Toke R./0000-0003-0659-5490",,,,,41,7,10,3,47,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

I draw from critical development and science and technology studies and highlight that this imagery has been actively performed. Insiders elaborated a compelling narrative calling upon a will to improve through technology and the moral legitimacy of social entrepreneurship in development; they worked hard to establish a supportive coalition in an ever wider network. This story hinges on several assumptions, which upon closer scrutiny appear to be problematic: the unicity of smallholder farming, the attribution of inherent technical characteristics to a specific object the drip kit regardless of the context in which it is used, and the framing of social entrepreneurship and market-based approaches as alternative models even though these rather constitute a re-working of existing arrangements within the international development community. Nonetheless, the pro-poor and environmentally friendly smallholder drip irrigation narrative still continues to be successful in harnessing the support of the international development community, despite the little capacity drip irrigation has had to transform smallholder farming, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

This decision will depend in large part on how the chosen list price impacts the post negotiation final sale price of the home. In this study, we design an experiment that enables us to identify how different types of common list price strategies affect housing negotiations. Specifically, we examine how rounded, just below, and precise list prices impact the negotiation behavior of the buyer and seller and, ultimately, the final sale price of the home. Our results indicate that the initial list price strategy does play an important role in the negotiation process. Most notably, a high precise price generates the highest final sale price, smallest percentage discount off the list price, and the largest fraction of the surplus to the seller, while just below pricing leads to the lowest final price, largest percentage discount, and smallest fraction of the surplus to the seller. This pattern seems to be largely driven by sellers making persistently higher and more precise counter-offers throughout the negotiation process when the initial list price is high precise. Interestingly, these effects generally attenuate with negotiating experience. Importantly, our experimental results are generally consistent, both in direction and magnitude, with the limited transactions-based empirical studies relating to real estate listing prices.

Several approaches have been considered in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the number of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.

We show that contextual factors can explain up to 30 % of the variance in firms' productivity, more than half of which depends on the geographic location. Our results show also that African firms' productivity is positively correlated to the size of the agglomeration when they locate in larger cities specialized in different sectors, while the relation turns negative when they face direct competition from firms in the same industry. These effects are similar in the services and the manufacturing industries, even if in the latter positive spillovers are found to be conditional to the presence of backward and forward linkages with nearby firms. Finally, we are able to show that these effects are also confirmed when domestic firms locate close to foreign multinationals, especially those coming from the South.","[Sanfilippo, Marco] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Seric, Adnan] United Nations Ind Dev Org, Vienna, Austria",University of Antwerp,"Sanfilippo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.",marco.sanfilippo@uantwerp.be; a.seric@unido.org,,"Sanfilippo, Marco/0000-0001-8062-3352",,,,,46,9,9,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In particular, the Securities and Exchange Commission has articulated the growing problem of firm managers selectively emphasizing information that is favorable to their firm's financial status. In this two-experiment study, we examine whether investors are adversely influenced when firm managers provide only a partial explanation for a firm's financial outcomes, even though the investors have information about all of the causes for a firm's financial outcomes. Our results reveal that investors are misled by partial management explanations. We demonstrate that this effect occurs in situation both when qualitative information is known about the causes and when quantitative information is known about the causes. We document that one way in which this overreliance on management-provided partial information can be mitigated is when investors are provided with a quantitative analysis of the management explanation; with this quantitative analysis we observe that investors are able to distinguish between partial and complete explanations.

Most research has had a positive focus, examining the effect of debt on student choices and outcomes. However, because education financing involves many public policy choices, normative questions have become more prominent. We discuss the trade-offs involved in these choices and propose simple models to help shape these questions. We first develop an overlapping generations framework of student debt to examine the macroeconomic impact of shifting from a parent-funded to a student debt-based financing system. We then consider a framework that includes the supply-side response to different funding regimes; that is, how do enrollment and tuition decisions of schools respond to changes in education financing? We show that shifting from parent-based funding to a student loan program can lower aggregate savings, although welfare still improves if education has a higher return than physical capital investment. A public student loan program also tends to promote enrollment at the cost of higher tuition at for-profit schools and deteriorating loan performance, paid for by taxpayers. Alternative contract designs, with school participation in the lending program, tend to ameliorate these issues.","[Amromin, Gene] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Eberly, Janice] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Amromin, G (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",gamromin@frbchi.org; eberly@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Eberly, Janice/KCY-3297-2024; Amromin, Gene/B-7425-2011","Eberly, Janice/0000-0001-9305-0944;",,,,,59,5,7,2,27,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4808-3,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

However, in Romania, the concept of social responsibility has emerged after 1990, along with the set-up of many NGOs and the entrance of multinational companies. After 2000, many other Romanian business companies, both large and SMEs, started to involve in actions of social responsibility, especially for improving the environment, adopting social measures for employees etc. The main purpose of our paper is to investigate practices and actions related to social responsibility, which are undertaken by SMEs, and to reveal which factors really matter in determining different degrees of involvement in CSR actions. Nevertheless, the level of social responsibility actions undertaken by SMEs often depend on the decisions of their managers and the value orientation of the entrepreneur seems one of the most prominent factors driving CSR actions. However, the younger a firm the less likely it is that it gets involved in CSR. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the firms' age and the level of their social involvement We expect to find out that young ventures display a weaker propensity to get involved in social responsibility actions. In order to validate this hypothesis, we use survey data collected during July - September 2014, from 48 SMEs operating in Oradea, Romania. Our findings reveal that there are significant differences between newly established ventures and those with a longer history in several directions related to their CSR profile. Managers of young firms are more inclined to consider that producing social welfare is the sole responsibility of government, and therefore the firms they own and themselves are significantly less involved in CSR actions. Nevertheless, our conclusions based on both theoretical synthesis and our analysis suggest that including business ethics and social responsibility related aspects in educational programs for entrepreneurship would reinforce such approach on behalf of new firms. A strategic approach to CSR from the beginning of the activity of a company is likely to improve the impact of such initiatives on the community and contribute to deeper and earlier involvement of SMEs in social responsibility actions.","[Badulescu, Alina; Badulescu, Daniel; Saveanu, Tomina; Hatos, Roxana] Univ Oradea, 1 Univ St, Oradea 410087, Romania",University of Oradea,"Badulescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, 1 Univ St, Oradea 410087, Romania.",abadulescu@uoradea.ro; dbadulescu@uoradea.ro; tsaveanu@uoradea.ro; rhatos@uoradea.ro,"Badulescu, Alina/AAC-4228-2020; Badulescu, Alina/B-6477-2015; Saveanu, Tomina G/D-8743-2014; Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017; HATOS, ROXANA/ABX-9271-2022","Badulescu, Alina/0000-0002-0090-9340; Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149;",,,,,34,3,3,0,7,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,963,975,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300080,0

We consider short-term allocation problems, with single and multiple risky assets, and use the nonparametric approach of Brandt (1999) to directly express optimal portfolio weights as functions of aggregate liquidity shocks. We find, first, that the effect of aggregate liquidity is positive and decreasing with the investment horizon. Second, at daily and weekly horizons, this effect is weaker on allocations in large stocks and gets stronger as we move toward small stocks, regardless of the other stock characteristics, suggesting that liquidity is the main concern of very short-term investors. Third, conditional allocations in risky assets decrease and exhibit shifts toward more liquid assets as aggregate liquidity worsens. Overall, conditioning on aggregate liquidity yields empirical results that are consistent with the so-called flight-to-safety and flight-to-liquidity episodes. Finally, we propose a simple tactical investment strategy and show how aggregate liquidity information can be exploited to enhance the out-of-sample performance of long-term strategies.

We document the evolution of the unemployment risk by the age of their child and the mechanism through which mothers with young children become unemployed. Majority of women return to the labor market when their child is 3 years old. The unemployment rate among women with at least a high school diploma reaches 12% and among those with lower education is as high as 28% when their child is three. Women often become unemployed immediately after returning to the labour market. Almost 60% of women without a high school diploma and about 34% of women with higher education become unemployed immediately after the family leave. Moreover, this unemployment is not always just a brief intermission between the end of family leave (or after having returned to their previous employment) and a new job. More than half of women without high school diploma and more than a third of women with higher education are unemployed for more than six months.","[Bicakova, Alena] CERGE EI Spolecne Pracoviste UK & AV CR, Vvi, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kaliskova, Klara] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bicáková, A (通讯作者)，CERGE EI Spolecne Pracoviste UK & AV CR, Vvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",alena.bicakova@cerge-ei.cz; klara.kaliskova@vse.cz,"Bičáková, Alena/H-2912-2014; Kalíšková, Klára/H-2887-2014","Kalíšková, Klára/0000-0002-4762-086X",,,,,19,2,2,2,12,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We illustrate empirically that the volatility of the pivot points has increased markedly since the mid 1970s, and we link changes in pivot volatility to the degree of party polarization. In general, median and supermajority pivots shift considerably more than the overall mean and, when politics is polarized, the congressional median and supermajority pivots can change dramatically when a shift in control occurs. The relative volatility of median and supermajoritarian pivots varies with the degree of polarization and the extent to which there is continuity in party control.

This implies meeting expectations and needs of both. The purpose is to invest in the development of their skills, resulting in their improved performance, allowing the organizations to have return on it, by boosting its results. To that intent, organizations have to segment their talent pool, promoting organizational learning through it, providing different development plans rather than simple training. In this context, it appears the corporate universities having as core goal align talent development with business goals, helping to create the conditions for strategic agility and innovation. However these skills development plans need a maturating process, in order to ensure the retention of this talented workforce in the long-term. The main goal is to guarantee that the talent pool is committed to it, wanting to perform even more and even better for a long time. For that, they need to have a psychological relation with the organization, which is a more informal yet stronger contract. Therefore, this paper argues the relation between two main contemporaneous issues in the academies and organizations: talent and organizational commitment. To answer the main research question are the talented ones committed enough to be retained? an complementary research question arises what type of commitment have more influence in the employees retention process?. In this paper, it is considered the three-component model of organizational commitment - affective, continuance and normative - proposed by Meyer & Allen (1991) and the contextual concept of talent in EDP, the main electricity company in Portugal. It is also presented the skills-development talent programs available in EDP's corporate university Leadership School, including its eligibility criteria. Thus, in this paper, it is present the concepts and relations mentioned above through an empirical study, using a quantitative method. For that, it was applied a scale that allowed to measure the organizational commitment among the talent pool that are allocated to these EDP's programs, showing the results of these data collected. Through them it is possible, in a near future, propose some improvements to the Politics, Processes and Practices in which they are based on, achieving their more likely retention. This could increase the proficiency of organizational succession management and could also give new inputs about the best talent development practices, suggesting guidelines for new academic research.","[Caracol, Carla; da Palma, Patricia Jardim] Univ Lisbon, ISCSP, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sousa, Maria Jose] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Europeia,"Caracol, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ISCSP, Lisbon, Portugal.",carla.caracol@iscsp.ulisboa.pt; ppalma@iscsp.ulisboa.pt; maria-jose.sousa@europeia.pt,"Sousa, Maria/HCI-9642-2022; Sousa, Maria José/I-1818-2014","Sousa, Maria José/0000-0001-8633-4199",,,,,36,0,0,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,358,366,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300043,0

Our empirical analysis, based on a large sample of countries, suggests that the informal sector is a powerful buffer, which expands at times of banking crises and absorbs a large proportion of the fall in official output. To rationalise our evidence, we build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which accounts for financial and labour market frictions and for nominal rigidities. In line with the empirical literature on the shadow economy, we assume that in the informal sector access to external finance is limited, and the production technology is relatively more labour intensive. Following a banking shock in the official sector, the model predicts a large negative transmission to the unofficial economy that substantially dampens the overall effect of the shock.

According to the authors of this article the level of cooperation of competing companies also has an impact on the development of technological entrepreneurship. Methodology/methods The article uses the method of critical analysis of literature and statistical analysis of data obtained from a survey conducted in 381 Polish companies of industries leading in Podlaskie: food, wood and furniture, construction, metal and machine. The results of the survey were coded, and primary data obtained was subject to organizing, grouping and analysis using statistical tools such as: tabular form of data presentation; descriptive statistics; non parametric statistics. Scientific aim The aim of the analysis carried out in this text was to point out the influence of cooperation between operators competing in the industry on the development of technological entrepreneurship. Findings The obtained results show that in the group of the studied companies there is a small or very small degree of interest in taking up cooperation with operators competing in the industry. The higher the rating of the current level of contacts with competitive entities, the greater was also the tendency to cooperate in the future. In the context of technological entrepreneurship the available resources may be necessary for reaching the objectives of individual companies. The assessments indicated no willingness on the part of competing companies to get engaged in stronger cooperation relationship, characterized by engaging their own resources. Conclusions In order to improve cooperation between competing companies more proactive approach of the research centers and business incubators is recommended in linking the potential areas of cooperation between economic entities, for example through their participation in the results of research.","[Daniluk, Andrzej; Tomaszuk, Anna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska St 45a, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Daniluk, A (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska St 45a, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",annatomaszuk@wp.pl,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,7,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,533,541,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200066,0

The main constraints of Brazil's regulatory model are analyzed, highlighting that the last restructuring process of the electrical sector (2003-2004) has defined a commercial model where financial contracts of physical guarantee are traded instead of electricity itself, and where the power plants do not have autonomy over their own production. The already existing integration projects are also analyzed highlighting that these projects were developed under special conditions for taking advantage of specific opportunities without the support of a strategic integration policy.

We show that age, education and the prior work experience of executives create shareholder wealth while gender is not linked to measureable value effects. Our results are robust to the treatment of selection bias. By illustrating the wealth effects linked to executive appointments, our study contributes to the current debate on whether and how individual executives matter for firm performance and behaviour. The findings also shed light on the value of human capital in the banking industry. This chapter offers important insights to policymakers charged with ensuring the competency of executives in banking.

This paper discusses important challenges and relevant solutions for implementing cost-effectiveness analysis and comparing the relative cost-effectiveness of programs across settings in the context of education. Adapting development programs from one context to another requires many assumptions. Most of the discussion of those assumptions, to date, has focused on the context-specificity (or external validity) of impact estimates. This study examines the sensitivity of cost-effectiveness analysis to errors in impact estimates, as well as the sensitivity of costs to context, and explores how biases such as recall and pilot bias may lead to over- or under-estimates of cost-effectiveness. We use data on the cost-effectiveness of 27 student learning programs and 16 attendance-boosting programs across Africa and Asia to demonstrate the magnitude of these challenges, as well as potential solutions. We show that comparing Monte Carlo simulations of cost-effectiveness to certain benchmarks and adapting the largest cost elements to local prices (i.e., parameter variation analysis) can remove much of the uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates, and we propose that biases can be minimized through the use of detailed templates for cost reporting at the time of program implementation. Thus, this paper not only provides evidence of previously neglected challenges for cost-effectiveness analysis, but more importantly provides practical recommendations for undertaking this crucial stage in development planning well.

Findings show empirical support for the proposition that the adoption of relational exchange lowers ex post transaction costs.

First, it showcases the structural, geographical and socio-economic tendencies toward VSS adoption in Guatemala, Colombia and Costa Rica, and allows first insights in the additionality and effectiveness of certification schemes derived from these indicators. Second, it contributes to an up-to-date understanding of the coffee supply chain, a sector of great economic importance both to producing and consuming countries that is in constant flux and reorganization, and it explains how current VSS interact with this type of global supply chain. Finally, through the construction of a comprehensive population of certified farmers, it enables better evaluation of existing case studies, generalizability, possible biases and provides valuable information for the preparation of future impact evaluation projects.","[Grabs, Janina; Dietz, Thomas] Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany; [Kilian, Bernard; Calderon Hernandez, Daniel] INCAE Business Sch, POB 960-4050, La Garita, Alajuela, Costa Rica",University of Munster; INCAE Business School,"Grabs, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",Janina.grabs@uni-muenster.de; Bernard.kilian@incae.edu; Daniel.calderon@incae.edu; Thomas.dietz@uni-muenster.de,,"Grabs, Janina/0000-0002-1630-5672","junior research group TRANS SUSTAIN by the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft und Forschung","junior research group TRANS SUSTAIN by the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft und Forschung","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the junior research group TRANS SUSTAIN by the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Innovation, Wissenschaft und Forschung, without which the present study could not have been completed.

In Germany the related discussions led to the political decision to allocate a part of the respective budget to provide extra support for smaller farms. This paper analyses the impacts of the 2013 CAP reform for two scenarios of alternative direct payment schemes, with a specific focus on the distributional effects of the new components of the first pillar. Results on the basis of the farm accountancy data network indicate that overall direct payments reduce income inequality, while the effects differ significantly between the different payment schemes. The redistributive payment (support for the so-called, first hectares) is almost equally distributed among farms, however due to the small budget allocated the impact on the distribution of income is limited. Compared to the situation before the policy change, the 2013 CAP reform and its national implementation in Germany slightly reduce the inequality of the distribution of direct payments, but do not reduce income inequality. A full utilization of the scope for the redistributive payment could have slightly reduced income inequality, but, due to the limited correlation of land endowment and income level, would not constitute an efficient distributive policy instrument either.","[Hansen, Heiko; Offermann, Frank] Thunen Inst Betriebswirtschaft, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Offermann, F (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Betriebswirtschaft, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",frank.offermann@thuenen.de,"Offermann, Frank/G-8514-2016","Offermann, Frank/0000-0002-9866-0597",,,,,25,6,6,0,16,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Therefore, we utilize competing risk and Cox regression event history analysis on a nationally representative sample of US entrepreneurs to investigate how start-up capital structure impacts the time in gestation to particular kinds of start-up outcomes.

Estimates from difference-in-difference, triple difference, and synthetic control methods all suggest that the high-profile public official's recruitment is associated with financial benefits from the official's former employing agency; no such advantage, however, was observed for benefits from other agencies. This result offers suggestive but compelling evidence that the revolving door distorts the allocation of government resources; the financial benefits the university received are due not to the recruited official's greater competence, expertise, or knowledge but rather to his implicit collusion with the government.","[Hong, Sounman; Lim, Jeehun] Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Hong, S (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",phdsmhong@gmail.com; startingnew@nate.com,,,,,,,36,16,17,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2016,166.0,1-2,,,,,69,86,,10.1007/s11127-016-0315-x,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DG8GY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372322300004,0

The article deals with monitoring the impact of individual variables on the dependent variable - the amount of return on in-vestment (ROI). Methodology/methods The article works with the values obtained in the project We will calculate ROI, which took place in 2015 in the Czech Republic in cooperation with the Municipal Library in Prague and Pardubice University with the support of the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic. Data obtained in this project was drawn up by the cost-benefit analysis. The impact of individual determinants of the amount of ROI will be assessed by multiple regression analysis and cluster analysis. Scientific aim The article aims to determine, depending on the amount of selected indicators ROI. Estimates show a significant determinant which ones are important and have an impact on the value of ROI. The influence of regional indicators and values regarding specific libraries. Findings The article accounted the ROI of 36 libraries in the Czech Republic and their comparison for the years 2012 and 2014. Libraries were divided into groups based on similarity of values of significant indicators. Conclusions This is the first research in the Czech Republic, which was made in measuring the value of public libraries, which were determined to ROI on specific libraries for such a large sample of observations. Monitoring the impact of regional indicators points to the fact that the amount of the ROI does not affect the location of the library, the library or success does not depend on the county in which the library is located. Libraries can be divided into groups that differ significantly and according to this distribution can select different methods of public funding.","[Pichova, Simona] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53009, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Pichová, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53009, Czech Republic.",simona.pichova@upce.cz,,,Student Grant Agency of University Pardubice,Student Grant Agency of University Pardubice,This paper was realized under the financial support of Student Grant Agency of University Pardubice in year 2016.,,17,1,1,0,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,638,645,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200079,0

However, the condition of public finance deteriorated even in times of economic conjuncture, so the onset of the crisis in 2008 caught most of the developed world without financial reserves, or the so-called fiscal cushion. Thus most EU countries now fail to fulfill both the Maastricht Convergence Criteria and the Fiscal Compact Treaty, even if these are binding legal norms of the EU. Despite this, some EU countries voluntarily accepted a sort of financial debt cap, which the government of the Czech Republic accepted in February 2015 in the form of the so-called financial constitution, which contains a whole range of mechanisms at all levels of public budgets and public expenditures with a public debt in the amount of 55% of the GDP. The goal of this contribution is to analyze the content of the financial constitution, assess its structure and the aspects of its process application, and through selected public budgets also its possible influence on the whole economy.

Their weak institutional environments, however, make them prone to crises that generate incentives for governments to renege on contractual commitments to investors. To understand variation in post-crisis regulatory outcomes in such contexts, scholars must consider investors' prior choices regarding portfolio structure. Investors facing high reputational costs from exit are more likely to remain following expropriation, and those holding diverse assets in their contract jurisdiction, to secure compensation. These factors account for significant unexplained within-sector and subnational variation, for which we provide qualitative and quantitative evidence from Argentina's water and electricity sectors following the 2001 crisis.

Yet, there are several persistent barriers that hinder the attainment of EE improvements in this area. Using data from a 2008 national representative survey of Spanish households, this paper is interested in the determinants of EE-related decisions. In particular, a discrete-choice model empirically analyzes whether pro-environmental households are more likely to invest in EE and to adopt daily energy-saving habits. We show that households with eco-friendly behaviors are more likely to investment in well-differentiated EE measures as well as to steer daily habits towards energy savings. However, no effects are found for households with environmental attitudes based on stated willingness to pay to protect the environment. In addition to this, households belonging to higher income groups and education levels are more likely to invest in EE but not to adopt energy-saving habits; while households with older members are less likely to invest in EE and show fewer eco-friendly habits.","[Ramos, Ana; Labandeira, Xavier] Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Ramos, Ana; Labandeira, Xavier] Econ Energy, Vigo, Spain; [Labandeira, Xavier] FSR Climate European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Loeschel, Andreas] Univ Munster, Ctr Appl Econ Res Munster CAWM, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Loeschel, Andreas] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Universidade de Vigo; European University Institute; University of Munster; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Ramos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac CC Econ, Campus Lagoas, Vigo 36310, Spain.",anaramos@uvigo.es; xavier@uvigo.es; loeschel@uni-muenster.de,"Löschel, Andreas/AAG-6699-2020","Löschel, Andreas/0000-0002-3366-8053",,,,,47,73,74,2,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our results demonstrate that few issues were listed in this period and that approximately one-half of the total outstanding issues were absorbed by issues of the top three companies. This is because companies of medium to large size were also among the first movers; afterwards, issues were primarily launched in smaller amounts. The most frequent sectors are services (Information and Communication Technology, engineering, gaming) and building/real estate sectors. Despite the slow start, corporate finance regulations have created work in progress so that a greater use of direct financing through bonds, in addition to bank credit, is almost at hand.","[Riccio, Giuseppe] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Riccio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Cagliari, Italy.",riccio@unica.it,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-17413-6; 978-3-319-17412-9,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,179,193,,10.1007/978-3-319-17413-6_12,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000453295500012,0

Then, the future development of individual time series was forecasted for prognostic horizon of 6 periods and evaluated based on MAPE values. The analysis proved non-stationarity of almost all time series and suitability of ARIMA model utilization in agri-food prices modelling. The suitability of ARIMA models for prognostic purposes was proven in almost all analyzed time series; however, some time series should be forecasted rather using other time series model. Generally, ARIMA model might be considered as an appropriate tool for agri-food prices modelling and forecasting, even the verification and evaluation of forecast quality should not be missed out.","[Rumankova, Lenka] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Rumánková, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",rumankova@pef.czu.cz,"Rumankova, Lenka/H-4357-2018","Rumankova, Lenka/0000-0003-0734-6883",,,,,22,5,5,1,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,319,326,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000041,0

The empirical analysis reveals that DLG Awards in Silver, Gold and Gold Extra are associated with statistically significant price premia. Apparently, a successful participation in the Quality Tests raises consumers' marginal willingness to pay for a wine and producers may realize higher net prices. It is crucial here how quality is communicated to buyers in the decision-making process. Price premia due to DLG awards suggest that it is more important to establish a reputation over time than just signaling quality by showing award labels on the bottle. The quantitative results show that quality grades, regional origin, grape variety, wine style and sweetness are further product characteristics that strongly affect wine prices due to their impacts on winegrowers' marginal costs and/or on consumer preferences.","[Schaeufele, Isabel] Univ Kassel, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany; [Herrmann, Roland] Univ Giessen, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Szolnoki, Gergely] Hsch Geisenheim, Geisenheim, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Schäufele, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Fachgebiet Agrar & Lebensmittelmkt, Fachbereich Okol Agrarwissensch, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",i.schaeufele@uni-kassel.de,"Schäufele-Elbers, Isabel/GWD-1353-2022; Szolnoki, Gergely/AAA-8381-2022","Szolnoki, Gergely/0000-0002-7791-7218; Schaufele-Elbers, Isabel/0000-0003-3740-2858",,,,,45,2,2,1,14,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Thus, the emphasis is primarily not put on the rescue of financial system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Instead, the attention is paid to a role of central bank as a lender of last resort in government bond markets and quasi-fiscal motivation of the quantitative easing programs. The theoretical part of the analysis defines quasi-fiscally motivated QE program, government adjusted net debt position plus its determinants and a rate of debt monetization. Empirical analysis focuses on the case of three large economies United States, United Kingdom and Japan, empirical definition of quasi-fiscally motivated quantitative easing, net debt position of their governments as well as the explanation of significant empirical relationships between its determinants. The paper concludes that the most important factor influencing net debt position dynamics is economic growth which cannot be relied on in bust phase of debt cycle. Thus, the decisive role is played by quantitative easing and related interest transmission channel as remaining factor influencing dynamics of government financial assets and liabilities.","[Steklac, Jiri; Titze, Miroslav] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Steklác, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",xstej71@vse.cz; xtitm02@vse.cz,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Thus, the aim of this paper is to operationalise the concept of cooperative learning and to study its consequences on both the individual learning of the members of a team and on the overall performance achieved by the team as a whole. Structural equation models were used on a sample of 319 students in a marketing subject at a Spanish public university. The results obtained show that students learn better in subjects in which cooperative learning is applied, and the team's performance also improves.

Since the mid-1990s two important trade agreements, NAFTA and Uruguay Round have increased international trade for the dairy industry. As of 2015, a major transportation improvement is expected to be achieved by to the expansion of the Panama Canal. The canal is expected to lower transportation costs for many exporters. In this study, we develop a world dairy trade model to analyze dairy product export quantity from the three dairy producing US regions: west coast, gulf coast, and east coast and great lakes combined. We assess the effect of the Panama Canal expansion on the trade of the US regions. We find that the west coast, which includes California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho states, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the expansion. The competitive advantages of this region aid in harnessing the most benefits from the transportation improvements and international demand growth for dairy products.","[Vorotnikova, Ekaterina] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol Dept, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Devadoss, Stephen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, POB 42123, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Vorotnikova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol Dept, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",evorotnikova@uidaho.edu; stephen.devadoss@ttu.edu,,,,,,,29,0,1,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The model combines three blocks of macroeconomic interest consisting of money, goods and foreign exchange markets with the housing market. I identified and estimated the model using a Bayesian structural vector autoregressive framework. I also use posterior model probabilities to deal with uncertainty in the identification scheme and Bayesian Monte Carlo integration methods to obtain the correct posterior distribution for the structural parameters and to generate accurate confidence intervals for the impulse responses. The findings indicate that oil price shocks have a positive and persistent effect on housing activities. In contrast, money expansion has limited effect on housing market variables. Quantitatively, in the medium and long run, positive oil shocks explain about 28% of the variation in housing stocks and 21% of the variation in real housing prices. By contrast, money shocks explain 11% and 5% of the variation in housing stocks and housing prices, respectively (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Social network variables used include kinship relationships measured by marital status, family size, and having a genealogy; ties with friends/relatives/neighbors measured by holiday visitation, frequency of contacts, and whether and value of gifts given and received; total number and time spent in social activities, and engagement in organizations including the communist party, religious groups, and other types. We find that giving and receiving gifts has a larger impact on SWB than either just giving or receiving them. Similarly the number of friends is more important than number of relatives, and marriage is associated with higher levels of SWB. Time spent in social activities and varieties of activities both matter for SWB but varieties matter more. Participation in organizations is associated with higher SWB across such diverse groups as being a member of the communist party or a religious organization. China represents an interesting test since it is simultaneously a traditional society with long-established norms about appropriate social networks and a rapidly changing society due to substantial economic and demographic changes. We find that it is better to both give and receive, to engage in more types of social activities, and that participation in groups all improve well-being of Chinese people. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Logistic regression was used to test the hypothesis that higher levels of self-efficacy are associated with greater likelihood of saving when controlling for age and income levels. The results show that higher self-efficacy, older age, and middle incomes are associated with a higher likelihood of savings. When controlling for age and income, respondents with low self-efficacy were only 60% as likely to save as those with high self-efficacy scores. The results confirm that saving behavior is associated with general self-efficacy. Enhancing self-efficacy for middle and low income individuals may encourage saving. Implications of this research suggest a need for additional research to further explore this relationship and how it might be used to enhance outreach aimed at improving savings behavior.","[Lown, Jean] Utah State Univ, Family Consumer & Human Dev Dept, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Kim, Jinhee] Univ Maryland, Family Sci Dept, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gutter, Michael] Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Hunt, Anne-Therese] Utah State Univ, Off Methodol Data Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Lown, JM (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Family Consumer & Human Dev Dept, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",jean.lown@usu.edu; jinkim@umd.edu; msgutter@ufl.edu; annetherese.hunt@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,41,44,2,11,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using data from the Aboriginal Peoples' Surveys for 2000 and 2005, we document that economic incentives do not appear to be important in explaining the North-South gap in graduation rates. We then consider individual-specific and schooling-related determinants of high school graduation and find that these factors can explain between 31 percent and 59 percent of the North-South gap in the probability of graduation for those who had graduated by the time of the survey. Further, much of the gap is attributable to a respondent speaking/understanding or being taught an Aboriginal language.

This paper offers an explanation. In measuring the number of years between the beginning of oil production and the attainment of political independence in oil-producing countries, we found that the greater the number of years, the higher the level of democracy ceteris paribus. The types of resources exploited in the colonial period were shown to have influenced institutions' nature and the formation of elite, which acts to prevent subsequent political reforms. This pattern is mitigated in countries that started producing oil far away from their independence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For closure, we find that (1) divesting firms tend to be less profitable than non-divesting firm, (2) divested subsidiaries have characteristics suggestive of inefficiencies, and (3) divesting firms' profitability improved after the closure, albeit slowly. The results suggest that firms employ closure mainly to discontinue inefficient operations. For selloff, in contrast, we find that (4) divesting firms are no less profitable than non-divesting firms, (5) divesting firms' profitability did not change but their investment intensity increased substantially around the divestiture, and (6) divested subsidiaries had characteristics of high salability and separability. The results suggest that selloff is used to raise funds for the remaining parts of divesting firm.

Using daily data from 1987 to 2012, two regimes (low and high volatility regimes) appear to be prevalent for this system. We find evidence that among the five commodity prices the gold prices are the most informative in the group in the high volatility regime, while gold, palladium, and platinum are the most informative in the low volatility regime. Though the platinum and palladium prices impact each other, the impacts in the high volatility regime are asymmetric. In addition to its low correlation in the group, palladium's negative impact on the exchange rate and gold makes it a reliable hedge asset for investors. Gold is the least volatile variable, thus affirming its use as a safe haven asset, while silver and oil are the most volatile in the group. Understanding the dynamics of these commodity prices should help investors decide how to invest during periods of low vs. highly volatile regimes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The TFCI is an adaptation and extension of the widely-used Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) and Financial Conditions Index (FCI) to tourism stock data. However, the method of calculation of the daily TFCI is different from existing methods of constructing the MCI and FCI in that the weights are estimated empirically. Alternative versions of the TFCI are constructed, depending on the appropriate model and method of estimation, namely Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation (QMLE) of alternative conditional volatility models. Three univariate conditional volatility models are considered, namely GARCH, GJR and EGARCH, in an attempt to capture the inherent volatility in the daily tourism stock index returns. The empirical findings show that TFCI is estimated quite accurately using the estimated conditional mean of the tourism stock index returns, especially when conditional volatility is incorporated in the overall specification.

Unlike the traditional mortgage market, there were no risk-based underwriting guidelines for HECMs through 2014. In response to the relatively high default rate, a variety of policy responses were implemented, including establishing underwriting guidelines. However, there is a lack of data and analysis to inform such criteria. Our analysis follows 30,000 seniors counseled for reverse mortgages between 2006 and 2011. The data includes comprehensive financial and credit report attributes, not typically available in analyses of reverse mortgage borrowers. Using a bivariate probit model that accounts for selection, we estimate the likelihood of tax and insurance default. Financial characteristics that increase default risk include the percentage of funds withdrawn in the first month of the loan, a lower credit score, higher property tax to income ratio, low or no unused revolving credit, and a history of being past due on mortgage payments or having a tax lien on the property. Our estimate of the elasticity of default with respect to credit scores is similar to that for closed-end home equity loans, but higher than that for HELOCs. We simulate the effects of alternative underwriting criteria and policy changes on the probability of take-up and default. Reductions in the default rate with a minimal effect on participation can be achieved by requiring that participants with low credit scores set aside some of their HECM funds for future property tax and insurance payments, a form of escrowing.

Although the Chinese Government has stressed the importance of trade as the key driver of signing RMB BSAs, its validity hasn't been tested yet. This paper analyzes empirically the key determinants for China to choose its RMB BSA partners. We find that the gravity factors are predominant (closeness to China and a bigger size increase a country's likelihood of signing an RMB BSA). In addition, closer trade links also have a positive impact on China's choice of BSA partners, as claimed by the authorities. Institutional strength is not relevant although China does seem to have a preference for countries with a sovereign default history and financial closedness.","[Garcia-Herrero, Alicia; Xia, Le] BBVA, BBVA Res, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Herrero, Alicia; Xia, Le] BBVA, Int Commerce Ctr, BBVA Res, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Xia, L (通讯作者)，BBVA, BBVA Res, Madrid, Spain.",xia.le@bbva.com.hk,,,,,,,12,13,15,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Following convention, reliability has been defined as the inverse of variability. Four measures of travel time variability have been used to examine reliability: Standard Deviation, Percent Variation, Misery Index, and Buffer Index. Regression models have been used to estimate these four variables with trip data from Access Link, the paratransit service provided by NJ TRANSIT pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A number of characteristics of the pick-up and drop-off locations as well as selected characteristics of the trips were used as independent variables of the models. The statistical significance of the independent variables varied depending on which measure of reliability was estimated, but a few variables were consistently associated with reliability in all four models. These variables were trip distance, booking type, winter season, density of motor vehicle crashes in pick-up and drop-off locations, and whether pick-ups occurred in suburban bus corridors or urban core areas. Because of the significance of the variables on motor vehicle crash density in pick-up and drop-off locations, an additional regression model was used to examine the effect of crash incidents on trip duration by considering drop-offs that occurred in locations immediately after a crash. The model showed that trips take 4 to 5% longer when crashes occur in locations prior to a drop off. Planning implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first disentangle the contribution to industry-level productivity growth of within-firm productivity changes and between-firm reallocation of shares. The evidence corroborates the notion that within-firm learning prevails over market selection forces, with larger firms driving such innovation and learning processes. Second, we address the strength of selection by exploring to what extent firm growth rates are shaped by relative productivity levels as compared to variation thereof. Our key finding is that, although changes in relative efficiency have a greater impact on growth than relative efficiency levels, there is an overall weak relationship between productivity and growth and, therefore, a weak power of selection forces in all countries. The results hold across firms of different size, but we also find that selection bites more on SMEs.","[Dosi, Giovanni; Moschella, Daniele; Pugliese, Emanuele; Tamagni, Federico] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Dosi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",gdosi@sssup.it,"Tamagni, Federico/AAF-3143-2020; DOSI, GIOVANNI/B-9587-2014","Tamagni, Federico/0000-0001-6476-6388; DOSI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-0126-9349",,,,,42,40,43,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Currency carry strategies have generated about 5.4% return per annum (Sharpe ratio: 0.57) over the period December 1996 to May 2014. However, during the recent financial crisis, the carry strategy suffered losses of up to 20% on invested capital. We investigate whether investors could have used the implied option volatility index on the US equity market (the VIX) or the option implied volatility index from G7 currencies (the VXY) to time the currency carry trade. We examine a large set of timing strategies and find that for some specific settings excess returns can be as large as 2.5% per annum. However, when we take into account that we investigated many trading strategies, these excess returns turn out not to be statistically significant. Hence, our findings cast doubt on implied volatility as a stand-alone timing indicator for currency carry trading in real-life portfolio decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While some governments are facilitating land grabs' within their borders, others have restricted land acquisitions by foreigners. Drawing from the Brazilian case, I argue that such restrictive regulations may be limited in their effectiveness because they apply a state-centric geopolitical logic to a threat that is largely de-territorialized and financialized. The Brazilian government reacted to fears about land grabbing by reinstating a legal framework from the 1970s that focuses on the threat that foreigners pose to national sovereignty. This measure dampened international enthusiasm for Brazilian land, but it also triggered companies to begin searching for legal ways to get around the restrictions, often by exploiting the mismatch between the fungibility of global capital and the rigidity of the foreign/domestic dichotomy. I suggest that the semi-permeability of the new restrictions may present an opportunity for the Brazilian government to balance its conflicting commitments to smallholder farmers and export-oriented agribusiness. Regulations focused on foreign threats may be politically effective even as they impose an outdated conceptual framework on a far more complex reality.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Fairbairn, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",,,"Fairbairn, Madeleine/0000-0003-0168-4179",National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1256259]; Social Science Research Council (SSRC) International Dissertation Research Fellowship,National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Science Research Council (SSRC) International Dissertation Research Fellowship,"This paper is based on dissertation research supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship under grant number DGE-1256259, as well as by a Social Science Research Council (SSRC) International Dissertation Research Fellowship.

Using Current Population Survey data, tabulations imply that the decline was driven by an increase in the exit rate to wage and salary employment, a decline in the rate of self-employment among new entrants into this age cohort, and an increase in the share of these new entrants. Multinomial logits suggest that health insurance coverage and after-tax prices of health insurance were significantly associated with these three rates. However, counterfactual simulations suggest that only the changes in after-tax prices of health insurance were found to appreciably influence the trends in these rates, though in the opposite direction of the actual declining trend for the rate of self-employment of new entrants.","Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Heim, BT (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",heimb@indiana.edu,,,,,,,33,10,11,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

BRT projects are affordable rapid transit infrastructure, but they are also an impetus to restructure the urban bus sector in developing cities with informal mass transport. The dominant model of BRT implementation creates a market for bus service from large private companies where the government takes on the risk and brands the service as part of the city's attempt to be a 'world class' city that can attract mobile capital. However, BRT and the formalization of the bus sector can increase the power of urban residents by firmly putting transport in the public sphere; workers by increasing the incentives for collective action; and bus riders by prioritizing space for buses over cars. But these are only openings that require action to take advantage of the contradictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our model highlights important feedback effects of informational noise originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity demand and spot prices.

Since volatility reflects the extent to which the market evaluates the arrival of new information and provides useful insights into the dynamics of EMU sovereign debt markets, we analyze their spillovers. To that end, we first examine the unconditional patterns during the full sample (April 1999-January 2014) using a measure recently proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Second, we make use of a dynamic analysis to evaluate net directional volatility spillovers for each of the eleven countries under stud and to determine whether core and peripheral markets present differences both before and during the crisis periods. Finally, we apply a panel analysis to empirically investigate the determinants of net directional spillovers of this kind. Our results suggest that slightly more than half of the total variance of the forecast errors is explained by shocks across countries rather than by idiosyncratic shocks. Besides, they give further support to the idea that during the pre-crisis period, most of the triggers in the volatility spillovers were central countries - peripheral countries imported credibility from them while during the crisis, peripheral countries became the dominant transmitters.

Instead of focusing on fundamental indicators, they have the tendency to be driven by experienced gains and losses, or the emotional arousal experienced as a result of these trends. Up till now, little is known about how emotion regulation (ER) strategies, such as reappraisal or suppression, dictate the extent to which emotions are experienced, and how they impact deviations from expected value (EV)-maximizing behavior. We seek to answer these questions in this article. To this end, we conducted an experiment with 4 treatments, where participants traded stocks with higher/lower valuation and lower/higher probabilities of price increase. Skin conductance responses, heart rate measures and questionnaires were used to measure the emotional arousal and ER strategies. The results show that using ER indeed influences the level of emotional arousal experienced. First, reappraisers experienced lower levels of arousal, and suppressors higher. Second, while reappraisal reinforced the impact of emotional arousal on EV-maximizing behavior, adopting suppression strategy had no similar impact. Third, reappraisal reinforced the impact of integral arousal on EV-maximizing decisions, especially after experiencing losses. This was not observed for suppressors, whether they experienced a gain or a loss. We infer that reappraisal has an observable impact on decisions, especially after losses, and could be used to train investors to improve decision-making performance. The article concludes with theoretical implications of emotion regulation on physiological arousal, and on maximizing the expected value in a stock trading context.","[Hariharan, Anuja; Astor, Philipp J.; Weinhardt, Christof] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Informat Syst & Mkt, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Adam, Marc T.

The empirical examination was carried out by utilizing a set of panel data of 1084 manufacturing firms in Taiwan over the period of 2000-2010. Taking into account the firm heterogeneity, it is found that Taiwanese outward Fill to high-wage countries (horizontal FDI) tends to have a favorable impact on domestic employment, production and investment. At the same time, the outward Fill to low-wage economies (vertical Fill) is very likely to lead to job loss and industrial hollowing out at home. In contrast, domestic income inequality is generally aggravated by outward Fill irrespective of the wage level in destination countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

(ii) Moreover, further economic and fiscal reforms are required from 2030 to 2070 because of accelerated population aging.

It is shown that exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices, once considered near-extinct, has come back strong in recent years. This is especially true for those items that households purchase frequently. Evidence based on VARs as well as TVP-VARs indicates that a 25% depreciation of the yen would produce a 2% increase in the prices of those items. This could have an additional benefit of raising the public's expectation about future inflation, as their beliefs are often said to be influenced by their daily observations about prices of those items that they buy frequently.

The results suggest a second-best optimal gasoline tax of 40.57 cents per litre in 2006 Canadian dollars for the GTHA that is much higher than the current tax rate of 24.7 cents per litre, and also higher than recently proposed increases. The resulting value is insensitive to whether the additional revenue is used to reduce taxes on income or to incrementally fund increased public transit infrastructure (the Big Move plan). However, in the absence of a regional tax, the second-best optimal gasoline tax for Ontario as a whole of 28.51 cents per litre in 2006 Canadian dollars is slightly higher than the current tax rate and in line with proposed increases.","Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada",,"Wood, J (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,5,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

It highlights two channels of shock transmission identified in the literature: bank ownership and liquidity. We employ a unique dataset on new loan issuance to Asian borrowers and apply a recently developed method (Khwaja and Mian, 2008. Am. Econ. Rev. 98, 1413-1442) to address the identification problem in examining bank lending and shock transmission. We find that bank ownership does not play a substantial role in the transmission process. It is the liquidity channel measured by lending in foreign currencies that is mainly responsible for the transmission of the GFC to the loan market in Asia. Additionally, our results suggest that the contraction of foreign currency liquidity is partially substituted by domestic currency lending. However, the substitution occurs only within banks and not between banks, owing to high switching costs. Our results are robust according to a number of sensitivity analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It provides a holistic perspective that highlights the synergies between children's developmental domains, drawing particular attention to dimensions such as self-efficacy, self-esteem and aspirations, which have had only limited treatment in the economics literature to date, especially in developing countries. It concludes that there is strong evidence of dynamic relationships between risk factors in early childhood and later outcomes across multiple developmental domains, emphasizing the heightened effect of shocks to the care environment and the cumulative effect of multiple shocks. It also concludes that risk is distributed unevenly, with children who are both in poverty and disadvantaged socially according to, for example, their ethnicity bearing the greatest burden; within a household, gender, birth order and other factors mean that some suffer disproportionately from shortfalls and incomplete protection. However, this review finds that low endowments in early childhood can be at least partially compensated for through improved environments and investments in later childhood, emphasizing the resilience of some children. The review goes on to explore the impact on children of dramatic socio-economic changes that have occurred in recent years with rapid growth across most developing countries. It highlights four key forces for change-fall in absolute poverty, increased access to services, changing household incentives for investing in children, and changing social and cultural values-and stresses the ambiguous effects on the welfare of children and their long-term prospects. In so doing, the review aims to consolidate emerging evidence on how risks and opportunities for child development may have changed in these dynamic contexts.","[Boyden, Jo; Dercon, Stefan; Singh, Abhijeet] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Dercon, Stefan] DFID, UK Dept Int Dev, London, England",University of Oxford,"Boyden, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",jo.boyden@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,"Singh, Abhijeet/0000-0002-7205-0811",,,,,96,6,7,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

The policy implication of this result is that the use of environmental policies may favour market stability.

However, recent theorizing by scholars has introduced a more integrated approach to entrepreneurial behavior that relates both external and internal factors to entrepreneurial action by considering how uncertainty and motivation affect entrepreneurial attention and evaluation. In this paper, we consider how environmental uncertainty and complexity differentially affect the motivations of independent entrepreneurs and corporate entrepreneurs to engage in entrepreneurial action. While examining how uncertainty and complexity affect macro-level entrepreneurship, we also explore how individual differences between corporate entrepreneurs and independent entrepreneurs affect entrepreneurial decision-making. By examining the role schemas of entrepreneurs, we construct a theoretical framework to explain why corporate entrepreneurs may behave differently than independent entrepreneurs under the same set of environmental conditions. Important implications are outlined for researchers, entrepreneurs, and policy makers.","[Garrett, Robert P., Jr.] Univ Louisville, Coll Business, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Holland, Daniel V.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Logan, UT 84322 USA",University of Louisville; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Garrett, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Coll Business, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",robert.garrett@louisville.edu; daniel.holland@usu.edu,,,,,,,79,24,31,6,100,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Hayek emphasized that prices, established via the market process, help market participants to form coherent expectations about the future and coordinate plans with one another. In this paper, we elaborate on how policy shifts may undermine planning based on price signals and exacerbate uncertainty about the future, which can contribute to financial instability. Based on our postulated framework, we clarify how financial liberalization in the 1980s/1990s and the recent discretionary monetary policies in the advanced economies may have contributed to recurring episodes of financial instability in emerging markets. In particular, this paper provides an explanation for (1) why we observe financial instability mainly shortly following financial liberalization, and (2) why financial developments in the emerging markets are sensitive to unexpected monetary policy changes in the advanced countries in the current zero-interest rate environment.","[Hoffmann, Andreas; Urbansky, Bjoern] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Hoffmann, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",ahoffmann@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Foreign-named managers experience lower appreciation (greater decline) in flows following good (bad) performance. Following 9/11, flows to funds with managers with Middle-Eastern-sounding names declined abnormally. In an experimental setting in which skill differences are absent, individuals allocate 11% less money to an index fund managed by a foreign-named manager.

We find that, after holding beer purchases and overall alcohol-consumption constant, an increase in total beer purchases from containers greater than the standard size of 12oz. increases alcohol-related fatal accidents. We confirm our results persist across several investigations of robustness, as well as the use of instrument variables methods. Outcomes suggest that policy makers should consider differential excise taxes for the purchase of larger than standard size beer containers. Such a policy would likely reduce the number of alcohol-related fatal vehicle crashes and help to internalize the negative externalities associated with drunk driving. At the very minimum, these results suggest that individuals prone to dangerous levels of drunk driving are the consumers that most prefer large container size consumption. This is consistent with the idea that binge drinkers and beer drinkers are much more likely to drive while legally intoxicated.

Setting aside natural disasters, most of the great catastrophes of human history have been government failures of one sort or another. We argue that many so-called market failures are government failures because government defines the institutions in which markets succeed or fail. The concept of government failure has been trapped in the cocoon of the theory of perfect markets. Narrowly defined deviations from market perfection have been designated market failures, for which government corrections may or may not really be a solution. Government failure in the contemporary context means failing to resolve a classic market failure. We propose an alternative approach for evaluating whether government fails: the Pareto standard. If an available Pareto improvement is not chosen, or is not implemented, that is a government failure. We organize government failure into two types: substantive and procedural. Substantive failures include the inability or unwillingness to maintain order, to maintain sound fiscal and monetary policies, and to reduce risks of transaction costs, which we classify as corruption, agency and rent-seeking. Procedural failures are inadequacies of available social choice mechanisms, causing collective decisions to be arbitrary, capricious, or manipuated. We conclude with some reflections on human rationality and the implications of behavioral economics.","[Keech, William R.; Munger, Michael C.] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Munger, Michael C.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Munger, MC (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",wrk3@duke.edu; munger@duke.edu,,,,,,,155,28,31,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2015,164.0,1-2,,,,,1,42,,10.1007/s11127-015-0262-y,0.0,,,42,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CN9DH,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358746200001,0

We do not find evidence that the impoverished residents benefited from the program. Our findings are consistent with the areas becoming more attractive to high-income households. The improvements in the areas were concentrated in those portions of each zone that were relatively better-off prior to EZ designation. The results confirm the prior literature findings that the areas, on average, became more attractive but also suggest that the benefits of the program likely did not accrue to the lower-income residents of the EZ areas.

In combination with rapidly rising motorized vehicle use this leads to severe traffic congestion affecting the mobility of the urban residents. Therefore many urban governments are planning to improve their transport and mobility situations with mass rapid transit systems of which a bus rapid transit (BRT) is a rather easy system to implement at reasonable costs. However, due to high urban inequalities the effects of urban traffic and potential improvements of the urban transport system for the diverse group of urban residents can differ significantly. In our case study Kampala (Uganda) four main groups were identified through cluster analysis of socio-economic and residential data gathered through interviews: extreme poor, poor, middle income and rich. Each group experiences a different mobility with the extreme poor being the most vulnerable group. The planned BRT system aims to decrease the average travel time but risks to exclude the lowest income class since not enough attention is paid to the affordability of the system to all residents. Therefore we argue for a policy that works from bottom up and pays attention to the internal diversity of the population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining large-sample data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NI-ITS) and the 2010 US Census, this study analyzes the relationship between the complexity of commute tours and the characteristics of not just commuters and their households, but also their neighborhoods and regions. Different from most existing studies, this analysis controls more detailed individual, household, employment, and location characteristics and important interactions. In particular, by linking the restricted-use location data of households and work places from the NHTS survey to the US Census data, this study quantifies the effects of job-end population and employment densities.

This paper analyzes the interactions between these policies using a non-linear overlapping-generations model with financial frictions in the form of banking financial intermediation. The paper embeds negative externalities due to contagion effects in physical investments which creates the need for financial stability policy. We show how the monetary policy transmission mechanism depends on financial stability policy tools as well as on regulatory and institutional constraints. We find policy tradeoffs in trying to accomplish both monetary and financial stability targets. The central bank must take these tradeoffs into account when selecting the tools in its policy toolbox. Another important finding is the interchangeability of price stability and financial stability policy tools. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The alternative payment scheme that is typically preferred involves some form of capitation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the degree to which family physicians (FPs) benefited financially after having switched from the traditional FFS mode of payment to a blended scheme involving capitation. The setting is Ontario over the period 2000-2004, during which two new payment models were implemented. We utilize a special survey of FPs that is merged with unique administrative data describing their medical practices as well as with income data drawn from their tax returns. We apply the methods of the non-experimental program evaluation literature to assess the impact of a change in remuneration scheme on FPs' income levels. Applying a battery of empirical techniques, our findings support the Ontario government's claims that adopting a blended payment model would increase the incomes of FPs. We estimate that physicians who switched remuneration schemes earned incomes that were approximately 25 percent higher, ceteris paribus.","[Gray, David] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hogg, William] Univ Ottawa, Dept Family Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hogg, William] Elisabeth Bruyere Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Green, Michael E.] Queens Univ, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth Sci, Ctr Hlth Serv & Policy Res, Kingston, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Queens University - Canada,"Gray, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,"Greiver, Michelle/N-8764-2015","Green, Michael/0000-0002-5852-0143",Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario through the Primary Health Care Transition Fund; Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care; Clinical Teachers Association of Queen's University Chair in Applied Health Economics/Health Policy,"Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario through the Primary Health Care Transition Fund; Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care(Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario); Clinical Teachers Association of Queen's University Chair in Applied Health Economics/Health Policy","We gratefully acknowledge generous financial support provided by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario through the Primary Health Care Transition Fund.

We use a gravity-type model to acknowledge data reporting shortcomings. Our empirical results suggest that human trafficking occurs within well-established migrant and refugee corridors and that victims are more likely to be exploited in host countries with weak institutions. Legislation on prostitution activities does not influence victim inflows. Liberalization of border controls intensifies trafficking flows. We find no effect of host countries' acceptance rates of asylum seekers. We conclude that effective policies against human trafficking require sound institutions and a focus on the entire trafficking-chain/channel from source to host countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, in each round, group members see the groups' cumulative payoffs, which consist of an aggregation of the earnings of each member of the group in the round. Our novel experimental design incorporates two games (the Trust game and the Dictator game) whose payoffs are carefully chosen to ensure cross-game comparability. In the baseline, no comparative information is displayed; the sessions are otherwise identical. Our first set of results shows that the display is sufficient to induce an in-group bias, which can neither be attributed to mere categorization of subjeets into groups nor to a stronger sense of group identity as a result of the display. Moreover, we corroborate existing results, which find that, relative to the baseline, the display is welfare reducing in the Trust game. Our second set of results shows that when comparing the allocators' decisions across the two games, a first mover's trust is reciprocated by the second mover independently of group identity.

In particular, it is unclear what the optimal balance is between investments in traditional productive capital (which increases output but is vulnerable to climate change), and investments in adaptive capital (which is unproductive in the absence of climate change but 'climate-proofs' vulnerable capital). We develop a model of investment in adaptive and productive capital stocks, and show that while it is unlikely that the optimal strategy involves no adaptation, the scale and composition of optimal investments depends on empirical context. Application of our model to sub-Saharan Africa suggests, however, that in most contingencies it will be optimal to grow the adaptive sector more rapidly than the vulnerable sector over the coming decades, although it never exceeds 1 per cent of the economy.

We also explore market resiliency during periods of exceptionally high low-latency trading: large liquidity drawdowns in which, within the same millisecond, trading algorithms systematically sweep large volume across multiple trading venues. Although such large drawdowns incur trading costs, they do not appear to degrade the price formation process or increase the subsequent cost of trading. In an out-of-sample analysis, we investigate an exogenous technological change to the trading environment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that dramatically reduces latency and allows co-location of servers.

Instead, the polarized character of current globalization deeply affects both developed and underdeveloped economies. Current globalization is characterized by factor exchange between economies of persistently unequal development. This implies the existence of persistent extraordinary market power in transnational corporations, reflected in their disproportionate participation in income and policy. These are shown to be steady-state features of globalization in a convergence club model of development and underdevelopment including trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). Moreover, results in tax competition explain how the increased share of transnational profits under globalization leads to lower corporate taxes, more conservative policies, and weaker institutions for balancing market power. The increased level of market power under globalization poses a serious challenge for national and global governance that deeply impacts economic development, distribution, sustainability, and democracy everywhere.","Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Traceability is an ability to track any food that will be consumed throughout the processes of production, processing and distribution. The research investigates what the customer knows about the origin and treatments of purchased products and what further information would satisfy the consumer. The study explores the flow of information amongst the chain members: producers, wholesalers, small-scale retailers, and customers. Based on interviews and questionnaires, regression analysis and ordinal regression procedure were performed. Innovative solutions to make the retailing competitive should be aligned with the precise knowledge of the consumer.

Various assumptions are considered regarding the market power of the incumbent generators. The paper shows that an optimal investment in the intermittent technologies can be implemented under perfect competition, provided that a complete system of competitive spot and forward markets exists. By constrast, if a single incumbent firm owns the conventional generators and has market power, the paper shows that the investment in the intermittent technologies will in general be inappropriate. If the conventional and the intermittent generators compete on the the spot and forward markets, the competitive fringe will invest too much in the intermittent technologies, if a large fraction of the consumers are on smart meters and intervene on the spot market. However, if the incumbent firm owns the transmission and distribution network, implying that the intermittent generators can only sell their electricity to the incumbent firm, the intermittent generators will not invest enough in the intermittent technologies.","Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, UMR 5113, CNRS, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Rouillon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, UMR 5113, CNRS, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",rouillon@u-bordeaux.fr,,"Rouillon, Sebastien/0000-0003-3782-7979",,,,,21,5,5,0,7,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Nonetheless, banks were considerably overcapitalized prior to the onset of the 2007-2009 subprime crisis compared to those which had undergone the 1990-1991 recession. Therefore, if capital requirements were achieved prior to the subprime crisis, how could the Basel framework be blamed again for having accelerated if not caused another credit crunch? We find that the answer to this question lies in the relationship between the capital ratio and the leverage ratio which is governed by risk-weights categories determined by the Basel regulation. We show that changes to risk-weight categories which affect the correlation pattern between both ratios are not reflected in the subprime crisis. This minimizes the implication of the Basel II regulation in the crunch that succeeded its announcement, in contrast to Basel I. We demonstrate that these dynamics are governed by a formula linking the two ratios together which derives from the sensitivity of the risk-based capital ratio to a change in its risk-weight(s).

We find that U.S. multinationals supply equity from headquarters to their foreign operating companies through foreign holding companies located in countries that lightly tax equity distributions. We also find that foreign holding companies tend to be located in countries with less corruption and investment risk than the countries in which the operating companies they own are located. In addition, we provide empirical evidence that the Netherlands, a well-known location for international tax planning, is a particularly popular site for foreign equity holding companies. Our findings contribute to a nascent literature that examines ownership chains in multinational companies and a larger literature on subsidiary location decisions for multinationals. The findings also provide empirical evidence that could be useful to governments in developed countries as they attempt to reform international tax policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Absent interconnection, firms compete for a consumer for two reasons. The first reason is to obtain revenue from selling the product to a consumer (as in the case without network effects). The second reason is that by expanding the network by one more consumer, the product becomes more attractive to all other consumers. Interconnection eliminates the second reasonwhen firms interconnect, they are no longer concerned with consumers' following the crowd. I show that consumers and society might be worse off from interconnection. I focus on two factors that make the (post-interconnection) price increase larger: consumer expectations that are highly sensitive to prices and consumers putting a high value on small increases in network size at the equilibrium market shares. Both of these factors make firms highly competitive, but only if the firms' products' networks are not interconnected.","Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC 20552 USA",,"Alexandrov, A (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bur, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",alexei.alexandrov@cfpb.gov,,,NET Institute; Kauffman Foundation,NET Institute; Kauffman Foundation,"I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the NET Institute (www.netinst.org) and the Kauffman Foundation.

We find that the aggregate dynamics in the consumer debt market are largely explained by the behavior of consumers with mortgage debt, and the behavior of such consumers is found to be sensitive to changes in housing market conditions. Our results show that there is a significant amount of consumer-level heterogeneity as evidenced by large amounts of simultaneous debt creation and debt destruction throughout the economic cycle. Finally, we find that there are important asymmetries in the debt adjustment process: whereas consumers are able to take on large amounts of additional debt quickly, short of defaulting debt is discharged very slowly. This slow deleveraging process may help explain why total consumer debt levels have been so slow to recover in the years following the Great Recession.

Based on the political cycles theory, we argue that leaders have incentives to delay costly ratification of international environmental agreements to the post-electoral period. However, the cost of participating in these agreements is often lower for developing countries, and they may enjoy indirect advantages, which may make them more prone to ratifying in the pre-electoral period. These hypotheses are assessed empirically by studying the ratification process of 41 global environmental agreements censused in the Environmental Treaties and Resources Indicators' database from 1976 to 1999. We use a duration model in which time is measured on a daily basis, enabling us to precisely identify pre- and post-electoral periods-a significant challenge in political cycles studies. Our investigation reveals the existence of political ratification cycles that are of substantial magnitude and non-linear over the pre- and post-electoral years.","[Cazals, Antoine; Sauquet, Alexandre] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, CNRS, CERDI,UMR 6587, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Sauquet, A (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, CNRS, CERDI,UMR 6587, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France.",alexandre.sauquet@udamail.fr,,,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; Conseil Regional d'Auvergne,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Conseil Regional d'Auvergne(Region Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes),"We are indebted to the Editor in Chief of this journal, William F.

This paper examines whether this monotonic relationship still holds true when pollution-reducing environmental research and development (ER&D) is undertaken by the home firm in a duopoly market. The link between tariffs and environmental taxes is examined under three possible scenarios-namely, when the home government has: (i) a tariff instrument only; (ii) an environmental tax instrument only; and (iii) both regulatory instruments, to correct for distortions relating to trade and the environment. We find that if it is not possible to abate pollution completely through ER&D, then the monotonic relationship between tariffs and environmental taxes is sustained. However, if it is possible to fully abate pollution through ER&D, then the optimal tariff (environmental tax) may not increase monotonically with taxes (tariffs). When both environmental taxes and tariffs are employed, these two policies may be strategic substitutes. A positive relationship between tariffs and environmental taxes may not be applicable.","[Tsai, Tsung-Hsiu] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Tu, Kuang-I] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Finance, Huwei, Taiwan; [Chiou, Jiunn-Rong] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Chungli, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; National Formosa University; National Central University,"Tsai, TH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",thtsai@nuk.edu.tw; tu700124@nfu.edu.tw; jrchiou@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,12,12,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The actual financial deepening ratios (AFDR) observed in the non-consolidated balance sheet from the OECD exceeded by factors of 3.5, 2.4 and 5.1 the optimal financial deepening ratios (OFDR) obtained from the solutions of dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) models of those three advanced economies. The corresponding factors were 2.3 and 0.49 for China and India respectively. Labor intensive production technology and a low OFDR relative to a high AFDR in China allowed it to grow at 10% between 1990 and 2010 period that ended with the global financial crisis. With a reasonable OFDR and low AFDR India also managed to grow at 6.5%. Thus huge gaps between the optimal and actual financial deepening ratios led to massive macroeconomic consequences as observed after the crises in 2008. Smooth, sustainable and efficient economic growth requires adoption of strategies for separating equilibria in line of Miller-Stiglitz-Roth mechanisms avoiding problems of asymmetric information in the process of financial intermediation with as narrower gaps as possible between the AFDRs and OFDRs.","Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Bhattarai, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",K.R.Bhattarai@hull.ac.uk,"Bhattarai, Keshab/AAM-8733-2020; Bhattarai, Keshab/AFH-7332-2022","Bhattarai, Keshab/0000-0002-5398-984X",,,,,97,17,17,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Thus, we set out to identify the differences induced by cultural context on the entrepreneurial intent of business administration bachelor students, from Romania and Iceland. The study is focused on underlining the motivations that can determine students to start their own businesses and analysing the extent to which the entrepreneurial motivations have cultural determinations (the classic model Hofstede dimensions). The method employed was a questionnaire-based survey, carried-out in both targeted countries. The independent sample t-test was used to identify the significant differences between the two groups of students. Based on the Hofstede's societal culture model (1980), the research calculates an indicator called cultural distance for four cultural dimensions: individualism/collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity/femininity, in order to highlight national cultural influence on the entrepreneurial process. The results indicate that there are significant differences between Romanian and Icelandic students; however, these differences are not explained by the cultural distance calculated for the two groups.","[Brancu, Laura; Gligor, Delia; Munteanu, Valentin] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania; [Gudmundsdottir, Svala] Univ Iceland, Sch Business, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",West University of Timisoara; University of Iceland,"Brancu, L (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania.",laurabrancu@yahoo.co.uk,"Gudmundsdottir, Svala/L-1981-2015; Gligor, Delia/IAM-0489-2023","Gligor, Delia/0000-0003-1220-5604; Brancu, Laura/0000-0003-1759-4100",,,,,40,17,18,1,58,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,133,147,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800009,0

We show that the relationship between saving and inequality is negative if savers' funds are borrowed by spending households for consumption as in the USA, but positive if saving is allocated through financial systems to investing firms for production as in China. This theoretical result is largely consistent with empirical evidence found from these two increasingly integrated economies and other related countries by estimating panel-data models. The policy implication is that inequality must be reduced in order to increase saving in the USA and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and to boost consumption in China and other parts of emerging Asia.","[Huang, Bihong] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm E22 4052, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xinhua] Univ Macau E22 4067a, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Tam, Pui Sun] Univ Macau E22 4058, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yang] Univ Macau E22 4036, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Peoples R China",University of Macau; University of Macau; University of Macau; University of Macau,"Huang, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm E22 4052, Ave Univ, Taipa, Peoples R China.",bhhuang@umac.mo,"Zhang, Yang/AAW-5433-2021; Tam, Pui Sun/AAN-2474-2020","Zhang, Yang/0000-0002-7219-3409; Tam, Pui Sun/0000-0002-9790-2910; Huang, Bihong/0000-0001-6492-9845",,,,,36,7,8,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

CDS investments can modify lenders' payoffs on their loan portfolios by providing insurance on negative credit outcomes. The onset of CDS trading reduces lenders' incentives to continuously monitor borrowers and also their demand that borrowers report conservatively. Additionally, borrowers expect CDS-insured lenders to be more intransigent in renegotiations triggered by defaults and covenant violations. Since conservatism can trigger earlier covenant violations, borrowers have heightened incentives to report less conservatively in the post-CDS period. Using a differences-indifferences research design, we observe a decline in borrowing firms' reporting conservatism after CDS trade initiation. This effect is more pronounced when reputation costs lenders face from reducing monitoring are lower, when debt contracts outstanding at the time of CDS trade initiation have more financial covenants, and when lenders who monitor borrowers more regularly in the pre-CDS period enter into CDS contracts to hedge their credit exposures.

The business concept practiced by the pasar tani is to provide a niche market for the farmers or producers to market their own product directly to consumers. At the same time, the establishment of the market is also to reduce financial burden of consumers in spending for daily food and beverages consumption. In addition, the prices of the products are cheaper compared to the supermarket. In 2014, FAMA launched Jimat Belanja Dapur programme under Pasar Tani to promote healthier and more affordable products to local residents. Nevertheless, the sales statistics from the programme indicates that it is not at satisfactory level. Therefore, the objective of the study is to identify factors that cause low sales at Pasar Tani and how to solve the problem. The study is based on Pasar Tani Kluang sellers. The data were collected through interviewing the sellers that participate in the Pasar Tani programme and the FAMA representative. Findings of the study were analyzed using content analysis. The findings indicate the reduction of sales is caused by consumer spending behavior, high number of competitors and lack of promotion.

Using cluster analysis, we divided EU countries into clusters according to selected macroeconomic indicators - gross value added, total revenue, number of enterprises in the sectors and total employment in the sectors.

Purpose of Study: This paper examines possible correlations between creativity and the factor inspiration and motivation in the leadership style Developmental Leadership (DL). Hypothesis 1 stated that respondents who score high on the factor inspiration and motivation in DL were expected to have moderate to high scores on social boldness, perfectionism, abstractedness, dominance, and openness to change, and low scores on sensitivity and warmth. Hypothesis 2 stated that respondents who score high on the factor inspiration and motivation in DL were expected to have moderate to high scores on the primary factors openness to change, reasoning, rule-consciousness, social boldness, and abstractedness, and low scores on sensitivity and warmth. Methods: A personality test known as 16PF was used in order to measure the personality traits of 16 cadets at the Norwegian Military Academy. Furthermore, the developmental leadership questionnaire (DLQ) was used in order to investigate the frequency of the DL style among the cadets. Findings and Results: Our results showed that our two hypotheses did not receive any or very little support. One possible explanation for the lack of confirmation of our hypotheses could possibly be that the two used tools, i.e. the DLQ and 16PF concentrate on different things. Conclusions and Recommendations: Some of the results are quite surprising. This may be explained by the sample size, so therefore it is important to conduct studies of larger groups in order to get more conclusive answers. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The typology is based on different levels of technical and organisational interoperability, respectively, and portrays four ideal projects.

We find that non-independent advisors are not sufficient to alleviate the problem of low financial literacy. The investors with a low level of financial literacy are less likely to consult an advisor, but they delegate their portfolio choice more often or do not invest in risky assets at all. We explain this evidence with a highly stylized model of strategic interaction between investors and better informed advisors with conflicts of interests.

This paper analyzes the short-run tail risk dependence among global reinsurers and studies its relationship with systemic risk in the reinsurance industry. We measure the tail risk of each reinsurer by the Value-at-Risk and construct the tail risk network among global reinsurers based on Granger causality tests. We then explore the general property of the proposed tail risk network and investigate its contribution to systemic risk. Our results show that the tail risk interconnectedness among global reinsurers is subject to the impacts of both an insurance industry-wide shock and economy-wide shocks, where the former seems to have a larger effect than the latter. Moreover, we find that a reinsurer's role in the tail risk network as measured by degree/eigenvector centrality contributes significantly to its systemic risk, i. e., a more central network position will cause a higher level of systemic risk. We also find that there is a threshold effect of tail risk connectedness to systemic risk, i. e. when the daily network density is below its median state, the increase in the tail risk connectedness will cause a decrease in systemic risk possibly through risk diversification; when the daily network density is above its median state, the increase in the tail risk connectedness will cause the increase in reinsurer's systemic risk.","[Chen, Hua; Cummins, J.

Article attempts to answer the following questions: To what extent the economic development of the Visegrad Group members translates in achieving social goals? Can clear differences in wealth creation be identified between these countries? The study results are percent shares of workers' average productivity received as remunerations in industrial and services professions.","[Chmielak, Boguslaw Adam] Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Chmielak, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.",boguslaw.chmielak@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-549-3,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2015,5.0,,4,,,,223,229,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BK1YY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432426500028,0

Therefore, public clients have started to promote new strategies, embracing innovative approaches such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and e-Procurement. Tendering plays a key role for the success of the overall process; however, the selection of the best contractor is still a difficult task. The paper investigates how tendering can be integrated with Model Checking in order to control the compliance between the client's requirements and bidders' offers within a digital environment. The research shows that, although the BIM is still not widely adopted in tendering procedures, Model Checking tools are already available to support the jury, as well as bidders. Moreover, even though BIM can be implemented in several procurement procedures, it is more effective if a collaborative and integrated behaviour is promoted. Results can help increase public clients' awareness of the limits and potentials of an innovative approach and to set BIM requirements and guidelines. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

Commissioned by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel's administration we studied the feasibility of the transformation of 352 student residences that have become obsolete. In order to compose a thorough advice, architectural explorations and life cycle assessments have been conducted. This paper reports on the result of Life Cycle Costing on this case in particular. Through Life Cycle Costing, the initial costs of distinct transformation strategies, conventional as well as adaptable, were put in a long term perspective. By combining assessments at element and building level, it was possible to detect the particular value of the residences' load bearing structure and the conditions under which adaptable building can increase that value. These findings allowed us to formulate straightforward advises in an early project stage.

The issue of healthy inhabitants is more connected with a treatment of bad health condition than with a non-health prevention, which is believed to be caused by social and political development over the last decades. Measuring the influence of health system on inhabitants' health is very difficult due to the influences of various factors, such as wealth, socio-economic status, citizen's lifestyle, quality of environments, etc. Consequently, an amenable mortality indicator is used to evaluate the health system except of the life expectancy indicator. It defines a mortality that should not have occurred in case of effective and early treatment. It only takes into consideration those diagnoses, where effective treatment exists before a certain age limit (75 years) according to experts. The number of these deaths is standardized on 100,000 citizens. The amenable mortality indicator has a great significance for standard comparisons, however, its application also causes methodological issues, such as data quality of mortality, choice of diagnoses, weight of diagnoses, etc. In the international comparing, it is very often deduced from a fact that each country spends different amount of funds on health, while the differences may be connected with a different effectiveness of invested funds in the health systems. The article reflects on the given facts and its aim is to evaluate the development of amenable mortality in Slovakia over the last ten years, as well as to compare the development of this indicator in the EU countries Similarly, it assesses the significant methodological issues that are related to indicator's application and defines the causes of extreme differences that were found out by the results on the basis of the given outputs.

The aim of this paper is to test whether gold price, oil price, gold price volatility (GVZ) and oil price volatility (OVX) have significant effect on stock market price index (GSPC) or not. In order to carry out the task, due to the properties of the data, the ARDL co-integration approach has been used to check the long-run relationship among OVX and GVZ; as proxies of oil and gold market volatility indexes; and S&P500 market price index. Obtained results indicate the presence of long-run equilibrium among the variables under investigation and reveal that S&P500 stock market price index converges to its long-run equilibrium level by 1.2% speed of daily adjustment by contribution of oil and gold market prices and their volatilities.

In doing so we look at the evaluation of the entrepreneurial environment in nine selected countries during the period 2006 to 2013 and search for common patterns and differences. We created a set of indices, one for each initiative, reflecting the changes of evaluation in different years, and performed a correlation analysis to investigate whether the evaluation results of the respective initiatives correlate at country-level. Our findings show that despite few cases of significant correlation, there was no general common pattern in assessment either within or between the analyzed countries. Thus, each of the three initiatives reflects the state and development of the entrepreneurial environment in a more or less different way. In our paper we discuss these findings and derive implications for both entrepreneurship research as well as for the policy making community.","[Holienka, Marian; Pilkova, Anna] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Holienka, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",marian.holienka@fm.uniba.sk; anna.pilkova@fm.uniba.sk,"Pilková, Anna/AAD-9645-2019; Holienka, Marian/N-8162-2015","Holienka, Marian/0000-0002-8975-6116",,,,,21,1,1,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,1028,1038,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000111,0

However, because of limited attention and cognitive resources, people are not able to use all available information and freedom of choice effectively in order to achieve their own best interests. When cognitive resources and attention are depleted, decision making becomes shallow and intuitive, often unable to take important aspects of given situations into account - even though this information is readily available. An intuitive decision making may lead to suboptimal outcomes by overestimating the importance of the most salient cues and disregarding the less obvious future consequences. Although this creates a demand for decision making aides that could be satisfied by markets, policy regulation may be necessary in some areas.

The outlook for these variables also matters a great deal to businesses and financial market participants. The authors present a factor-augmented Bayesian vector autoregressive forecasting model that significantly outperforms both a benchmark random walk model and a pure time-series model. They then use these factors in an ordered probit model to develop the probability distribution over a 12-month horizon. One distribution assesses the probability that inflation will exceed 2.5 percent over the next year; they term this probability a price pressure measure. This price pressure measure would provide policymakers and markets with a quantitative assessment of the probability that average inflation over the next 12 months will be higher than the Fed's long-term inflation target of 2 percent.","[Kliesen, Kevin L.; Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,,,"Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016; Kliesen, Kevin L/I-5746-2016","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432; Kliesen, Kevin L/0000-0002-7166-6016; Jackson Young, Laura/0000-0002-3601-3087",,,,,20,3,3,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Exploring the shadow economy has been accompanied by efforts to its precise definition, accurate measurement and interpretation of the consequences of this phenomenon. The main problem from the perspective of economic policy due to the existence of the shadow economy is its effect on the process of creating appropriate economic policies. The high level of the shadow economy is reflected in the unreliability of macroeconomic aggregates. The implementation of economic policy decisions based on these distorted macroeconomic data, are mostly ineffective. This article aims to estimate the size of the shadow economy in the Czech Republic between 1993 and 2013 using the monetary approach. Available empirical results point to a growing trend in the size of the shadow economy in the Czech Republic since 1993 to 2013, when its size in 2013 was estimated at 16% of GDP.","[Jajkowicz, Ondrej] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Jajkowicz, O (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",ondrej.jajkowicz@vsb.cz,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,278,289,,,,,,12,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300030,0

One of these ways is to implement the concept of socially responsible behaviour with an emphasis on the application of green marketing.

The basic structure of taxes did not originally contain any advantages for certain activities or groups of taxpayers, representing some ideal theoretical tax construction. As a normative structure of Russian income authors consider taxation in various degrees (different rates applied) of different types of income, and the taxation of one part of the total income according to the model Schantz-Haig-Simons. The authors propose an algorithm for tax expenditures estimating. A method of tax expenditures estimation according to the analyzed tax incentive for the estimated period is proposed. The initial requirements for assessing the tax incentives efficiency are formulated. It is proposed to distinguish between four types of effects (fiscal, social, economic, budget, and ecological) and the same types of efficiency. The ways to calculate these types of efficiency are suggested.

Thus, the intention of this study is to review the literature on entrepreneurial attitude, competitive intelligence and innovative performance and to propose a conceptual model linking these three variables within the Malaysian SME context.","[Mohsin, Ainul Abdul; Halim, Hasliza Abdul; Ahmad, Noor Haslina] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Mohsin, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town, Malaysia.",ainabdulmohsin@hotmail.com; haslizahalim@usm.my; hazlina@usm.my,"Abdul Mohsin, Ainul/ABH-2388-2021; Ahmad, Noor Hazlina/E-3589-2012; Halim, Hasliza Abdul/E-3592-2012","Abdul Mohsin, Ainul/0000-0002-8220-6322; Abdul-Halim, Hasliza/0000-0003-3708-7114",,,,,46,9,10,4,54,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,15,22,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_2,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400002,0

Therefore, before employing asset pricing models for the cost of capital calculations and stock performance predictability, we need to test the random walk properties of stock prices. EMH is closely related to random walk hypothesis that implies unpredictability of stock returns behavior on financial markets. The measure of the random walk content of stock returns is computed with detrended fluctuation analysis of Peng et al. (1994). According to the EMH, the returns within time series present uncorrelated values and are not predictable on a historical basis. The detrended fluctuation analysis is implemented to check the possible correlations in price returns within the studied time series. We measure scaling exponents (core measurement in DFA methodology) of financial markets for China and Germany, which are considered as emerging and developed economies. Since developing economies are supposed to be less efficient then developed ones, we check if the difference in presumed efficiency levels are reflected in the levels of scaling exponents. The expectation is to understand whether both of the markets could be the platform for applying classic asset pricing models, that require financial markets being efficient.","[Mukhacheva, Galina] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Mukhacheva, G (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",385254@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,414,420,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200055,0

For identification, it uses matched bank-firm-level data, covering mainly small and medium-sized firms in Eastern Europe and Turkey, and exploits the Lehman failure. The paper finds that internationally borrowing domestic and especially foreign owned banks contract their credit more during the crisis than locally funded domestic banks do. Firms dependent on credit and with a relationship with internationally borrowing domestic or foreign banks suffer more in their financing and real performance, especially when single-bank, small or with limited tangible assets. Moreover, firms in countries with lower financial development, more reliance on foreign funding and slower contract enforcement are more affected. Overall the results suggest the existence of spillovers to the real sector through an international banking channel but with heterogeneous effects across firms and countries.","[Ongena, Steven] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Banking, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ongena, Steven] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ongena, Steven; Peydro, Jose-Luis; Van Horen, Neeltje] CEPR, London, England; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [Van Horen, Neeltje] De Nederlandsche Bank, Res Dept, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Ongena, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Banking, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Peydró, José-Luis/F-3923-2018","Peydró, José-Luis/0000-0002-4542-7353; Ongena, Steven/0000-0002-8381-0062",European Banking Center; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-32434],European Banking Center; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Steven Ongena is Professor of Banking in the Department of Banking and Finance at the University of Zurich and the Swiss Finance Institute, and Research Fellow of CEPR.

Samsung and LG has strong R&D capabilities and engaged in useful networking and their failure to succeed in the complex product system sector can be attributed to inappropriate support from government and their failure to establish a large demand base.

The results of the author's measurement of the TCC for the Czech Republic are following (% of tax revenue): VAT 4,5; CIT 5,5; PIT on employees 3,0; PIT on self-employed 34,4; SSC 1,5-3,5. The econometric analysis of the factors affecting the level of TCC shows the regressive character of these costs. However the decreasing of a relative value of TCC gradually slows down for large taxpayers. The analyses also show statistical significance of the relationship between TCC and costs for external tax advisory. Hiring external actors is therefore more expensive than similar activities ensured by own employees (in-house service). Firms that consider the tax system is complex have on an average higher relative TCC than others. The opposite relationship was identified for tax administration: firms that are less satisfied with administrators have lower relative TCC.","[Pavel, Jan; Vitek, Leos] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",jan.pavel@vse.cz; leos.vitek@vse.cz,"Pavel, Jan/E-5003-2017; Vitek, Leos/H-5125-2018","Vitek, Leos/0000-0002-2540-7291; Pavel, Jan/0000-0001-7028-0640",,,,,36,7,7,1,20,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This paper identifies and explores three strategic models of HSR development: (1) exclusive corridors (e.g., Japan), (2) hybrid networks both national (e.g., France and Germany) and international (e.g., European Union), and (3) comprehensive national networks (e.g., China and Spain). Evaluations of these models yield outcomes that range from generally positive assessments of the corridor and national hybrid models to more concerns and uncertainties about the international hybrid and comprehensive national network models. When applying these lessons to the United States, contextual differences can make direct applications problematic. At the same time, though, certain elements of these three models that have been proven to be successful elsewhere may be adaptable to the U.S. and other newcomers to HSR development.

It can significantly influence the bank's profitability and is closely related to the bank's liquidity and interest rate risk. For these reasons, the bank's credit risk management is priority concern not only of the banks themselves but also of the banking supervision. Therefore banks are trying to reduce this risk by precise assessment of client's creditworthiness. The aim of this article is credit risk evaluation in the corporate segment in assessing credit transactions by the bank and suggestion of other possibilities for measuring credit risk. We went through studies focused on bankruptcy of corporate entities which were done in different countries and selected six of them where linear regression was used. We have chosen these studies because their objective is similar or the same as our planned research. We found that logistic regression improved assessment done by discriminant analysis in all cases and also confirmed well known relations - higher profitability, higher liquidity and higher volume of assets means lower risk of default, while higher indebtedness, higher leverage means higher risk of default.","[Pokorna, Martina; Sponer, Miroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Pokorná, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",136615@mail.muni.cz; sponer@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,455,461,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200061,0

The results show that the international trade has significant positive effect on industry innovation, while financial constraints have significant negative effects. Finally according to the results of empirical study, this paper puts forward the following Suggestions: it is beneficent to continue implementing the policy of reform and opening up. The government attaches great importance to support the high technology industry and promote the high technology industry products export; and the government should deepen reform of the financial system and construct multi-channel financing system to provide an opportunity for the development of enterprise. Innovation is an important source and inherent power which maintains sustainable economic development of a country or region, and vital index which measures the economic strength of a country, and it is also a crucial embodiment of the core competitiveness of enterprises. A number of literatures on international trade have studied the influence of international trade to the improvement of innovative capability; there are also a lot of literatures have studied on the impact of financing constraints on the ability of innovation. But there is still little research integrating them in a theoretical framework. Obviously, innovation is not only due to the financing support, also thanks to the international trade, so this article combines International trade with financing constraints on the basis of former research and builds a new theoretical framework. Under this unified framework, it is a bit better to reflect the relative contributions value of the two factors which influence the innovation ability.","[Qiu Kai-xin; Dong Nan-nan] Ningbo Univ, Reg Res & Dev Inst, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University,"Qiu, KX (通讯作者)，Ningbo Univ, Reg Res & Dev Inst, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",453661731@qq.com; 183878119@qq.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,1092,1097,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700214,0

Sea transport companies attempt to meet these requirements by optimizing the shipping routes between ports, setting the ship capacity according to the consignment and typology of goods, sending the river-sea ships on voyages with potential for profit on some transport routes, and completing the voyage within the shortest possible time, with minimum risks and expenses etc. Through the current scientific research, the author wishes to address all these challenges and use particular case studies to highlight how the Romanian water transport between two ports-a sea port, Constanta, and an inland port, Galati-can be optimized The author's calculations based on three different scenarios using ships of different cargo-carrying capacities indicate the optimum ratio between the shipped quantity, the costs of each voyage and the potential profit. The author has con-ducted a careful analysis of the various costs associated with the perfectly safe operation of seagoing and river-sea ships.

However, most of the existing literature on exportation by agri-food firms examines single-stage decision making processes based on the decision of whether or not to export, which export mode to use (direct versus indirect export), or both of them simultaneously, with three independent alternatives. This article researches the impact of internet use on entry mode decisions of exporting agri-food firms. In this new context, we propose that the Internet influences the entry mode decision and that the decision regarding exporting and the choice of export channels are nested decisions. The results show a positive effect of internet use on the propensity to export. The empirical evidence of the paper also supports the existence of a nested structure.","[Serrano, Raul] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Campus Paraiso, Dept Business Adm, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Acero, Isabel] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Campus Rio Ebro, Dept Business Adm, Zaragoza 50018, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Acero, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Campus Rio Ebro, Dept Business Adm, Maria de Luna S-N,Edificio Lorenzo Normante, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.",raser@unizar.es; iacero@unizar.es,"Serrano, Raul/H-7441-2015; Acero, Isabel/H-6626-2015","Acero, Isabel/0000-0001-5068-8438","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER [ECO2012-36290-C03-01, ECO2012-33286]; Regional Government of Aragon; FSE [S125]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Regional Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); FSE(European Social Fund (ESF)),Financial support for this paper has been provided by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER (project ECO2012-36290-C03-01 and project ECO2012-33286) and the Regional Government of Aragon and FSE (project S125: Compete Research Group).,,61,1,1,0,14,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

It played an important part in all economic crises since civil governments came into power again after the third, last putsch in 1980. But in opposite to all the economic crises before, the current one is almost exclusively based on corruption. On December 17, 2013 Turkey's officials and the public were shocked by surprise, when the first arrests took place. Later on, even the prime minister seemed to be involved, as on 24 February, 2014 voice recordings of him are circulated in the internet in which he orders his son to dispose large sums of cash. As the ongoing crisis is caused predominantly by one factor, corruption, it will be interesting to see, how this factor can directly influence the economic situation of a country. The paper, therefore, will investigate how the sudden discovery of corruption in December 2013 impacted Turkey's economy, particularly foreign direct investment and forced the immediate restructuring of the political economy in order to rebuild lost trust.

The collected data shows that in the Czech Republic there is a little competition at the level of use of online tools for marketing communication and the appropriate interconnection of these tools still leads to a competitive advantage. In the area of internal communication the Czech organizations still highly prefer the e-mail and telephone communication compared to the Western Europe countries. The main trends (in 2017) in the field of internal communication are predicted as social media and various elements of mobile communication.","[Smutny, Zdenek; Cermak, Radim; Tomanek, Martin] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smutny, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",zdenek.smutny@vse.cz,"Smutny, Zdenek/L-7498-2016","Smutny, Zdenek/0000-0002-6646-2991",IGA [VSE IGS F4/18/2014],IGA(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This paper was prepared thanks to the IGA grant VSE IGS F4/18/2014.,,14,1,1,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-550-9,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2015,5.0,,5,,,,192,198,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BK1YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432426600025,0

The information needs to be collected, stored, processed, integrated, extracted, visualized and interpreted, something that requires advanced information systems and deep domain knowledge. BIM repositories will become a necessity for the ability to manage changes and consolidations/synchronizations of heterogeneous applications. Integrated planning, integrated design with multiple alternatives and functional, spatial interfaces, and integrated supply chains with system performance requirements and specifications, the important functionalities of IDDS, Integrated Design and Delivery Solutions, are examples on possible usages of a BIM repository.

The European Union decided to adopt IFRS, too, starting with the financial year of 2005. Since Romania adhered to the EU in 2007, the state was obliged to transpose international standards in its legislation also. The process of IFRS adoption in Romania is slow, by implementing the practices on a slow pace. The regulations issued by the Ministry of Economics and Finance comprised under its provisions more and more companies. Romanian companies that have securities traded on a stock market are obliged to use IFRS as an accounting base.

Hierarchical and non hierarchical cluster techniques were employed to classify consumers with similar consumption behaviour. Three groups of tourists were identified: (a) those interested in the vacation activities, (b) those interested in cultural issues, (c) those interested in travel connection.

The unemployment rate differed significantly among Hungarian NUTS 3 regions during the period 2005 and 2013. According to previous studies high unemployment is caused by drop in economic performance or by some structural problems in the region. We can see that the development of the Hungarian national unemployment rate was correlated with the economic cycle. We used Hungarian Labour Office's monthly data during the observed period between the years 2005 and 2013. These data were seasonally adjusted using Demetra +. We have applied 2005 registered unemployment methodology. In total, we had 108 observations. We also applied the Hodrick-Prescott filter for estimating the natural rate of unemployment. This method is often used for estimating the potential output and is possible to use in the case of unemployment. Our empirical results show that in most regions the real unemployment rate was lower than the natural rate of unemployment during the pre-crisis period.

Traditional pre-merger planning and analysis usually focus on legal and financial aspects. Nevertheless, numerous merging banks fail to anticipate intercultural aspects that could affect the real value of such transactions. However, banks also need to understand that cultural factors can critically affect the achievability of all planned targets. Incorporating cultural due diligence into the pre-merger phase of M&As is key to success. The biggest challenge in cross-border banking M&As is to know how far to pursue integration and how far to maintain cultural diversity as a synergy driver. In some cases, clashes of cultures within the merged entity appear to have been the reason for bank M&A failure, but few studies have analyzed these specific aspects. Our paper analyses the intercultural issues impact on the outcomes of international banking M&As in order to avoid the M&As disasters.","[Warter, Iulian; Warter, Liviu] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Warter, I (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",iulian@warter.ro; liviu@warter.ro,,,,,,,31,3,3,1,17,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,367,376,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600035,0

Rating and credit risk are closely linked. In general, we can define credit risk as the probability of loss from a debtor's default. While rating is like a meter, by which it should be possible to compare two borrowers and determine, which of them has more likely, that in the end he pays for his obligation. In the rating process are systematic processed information about enterprise's developments from its past and the future outlook. The rating of the enterprise is carried out by taking into account quality criteria (soft facts) and quantitative criteria (hard facts). Hard facts are calculated from the financial statements of the company through the implementation of financial-economic analysis. So, hard facts provide a reliable statement about of the financial stability of the company and its financial health. The values of indicators which are achieved are combined according to their significance and then they are transferred to the internal rating scale. Then this value is used to express quantitative rating of enterprise. Present contribution is going to deal with calculation of hard facts and quantitative criteria for rating measurement. Rating assignment is going to be carried out on a model example. Hard facts are going to be determined based on the financial statements of the selected company and the rating is going to be assigned according to the rating scale which is going to be established for model example.

Previous studies, based on the assumption of non-separability between public and private consumptions, obtain a large public consumption multiplier, a small fraction of non-Ricardian households and, consequently, a relatively small multiplier for public transfers. We provide motivations for assuming separability and, on these grounds, we estimate a relatively large share of non-Ricardian households. As a result, we obtain that both multipliers are large. We also find that, in spite of their potentially strong effects, fiscal policies were substantially muted during the EMU years. This result is confirmed even for the post 2007 period. In fact fiscal policies did not complement the monetary policy stimulus in response to the financial crisis. Further, we cannot detect any substantial aggregate effect of austerity measures. Finally, the post-2007 surge in expenditure-to-GDP ratios was apparently determined by non-policy shocks that reduced output growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, urban cycling, especially during the morning and evening commute, may be associated with health and safety risks due to potentially high levels of exposure to air pollution, road noise, and high traffic density. Few studies have, however, measured cyclists' exposure to noise and air pollution simultaneously. The objective of this research is to evaluate cyclists' exposure to air pollution and noise in central city neighbourhoods of Montreal andto identify the impact on exposure of associated local factors such as weather conditions, the day and time, the type of road, bicycle path or lane used and the characteristics of the immediate environment around the cyclist's route. A total of 85 bicycle trips were analyzed, representing 422 km of travel and nearly 25 h of data collection. The mean exposure levels were 70.5 dB(A) for noise and 76 mu g/m(3) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). A very weak negative correlation was found between the two measures of exposure (R-2 = -0.07, p = 0.005). The results of the spatial regression models show that the morning commute and trips on collector roads and on street bike lanes and shared bike lanes have significant and positive impacts on exposure to air pollution and noise. On the other hand, some factors are only significant for one or the other of the two types of exposure. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The increase is concentrated among firms with greater institutional ownership and share turnover, firms with options trading, and growth firms.

Locus of control is a psychological concept that captures individuals' beliefs about the causal relationship between their own behavior and life events. We find that households with an internal reference person (a main respondent who believes that he/she can generally control relevant aspects of life) save more in terms of levels and, in some cases, as a percentage of their permanent incomes. Although the locus-of-control gap in savings rates is largest among rich households, the gap in wealth accumulation is particularly large for poor households. Finally, our findings indicate that households with an internal reference person are in a better position to save in forms that are harder to access (such as pension wealth) than otherwise similar households with an external reference person.

I find that the average energy price elasticity of energy intensity is about -0.39 for the manufacturing sector, with a 95 percent CI of -0.43 to -0.34. The calculated average elasticities of substitutions indicate that both capital and labour are complementary with energy while both materials and services inputs are substitutes. The industry-specific estimates, however, reveal widespread differences in terms of both the magnitude of the elasticities and the patterns of the relationships among the inputs.","[Gamtessa, Samuel F.] Univ Regina, Dept Econ, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Regina,"Gamtessa, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Regina, Dept Econ, Regina, SK, Canada.",,,"Gamtessa, Samuel/0000-0002-1145-2104",,,,,31,0,0,0,5,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

In circumstances where cash incomes are extremely low, a significant proportion of the population are not engaged in waged labour and the exchange of goods or services is augmented through barter or work exchange, the role of money is likely to be different from that within an urban developed setting. As such, ability to pay using money may be impaired and downwardly biased when compared with other mediums of exchange. In recognition of this several studies have used hypothetical labour contributions as payment vehicles and a common finding is that households are more often willing to contribute labour than they are money. In this paper we present the results of a split sample DCE using money and labour contributions as payment vehicles for improved drinking water quality in Kandal Province, Cambodia. We find little differences between the payment vehicles in terms of attribute non-attendance, marginal utilities of attributes or derived welfare values. We argue that this provides support for the use of WTP in rural developing areas where there are functioning labour markets.","[Rigby, D.; Russell, N.] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Polya, D.

We estimate the micro-level interactions between corruption and institutional obstacles and test the hypothesis that corruption 'greases the wheels' of firm performance when bureaucratic procedures are more severe and hampering innovation. Accounting for endogeneity and simultaneity, the paper uses a conditional recursive mixed-process model (CMP). The results show that corruption has a direct negative effect on the likelihood that a firm is an innovator, but a positive effect when interacted with institutional obstacles. This provides support for the hypothesis that corruption serves as a mechanism to bypass the bureaucratic obstacles related to obtaining the necessary business permits and licenses for product innovation. These effects also resonate into firm growth, through their effect on product innovation.","[Goedhuys, Micheline; Mohnen, Pierre; Taha, Tamer] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, SBE, Tongersestr 35, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Goedhuys, M (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",Goedhuys@merit.unu.edu,"Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379; Goedhuys, Micheline/0000-0003-4222-2106",,,,,60,52,57,2,46,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Responding to high charge-off rates for these loans and concern for systemic risk, the National Credit Union Administration imposed in 2013 new rules on federally insured credit unions that limited the purchase of loan participations from a single originator to the greater of $5 million or 100% of net worth. This study uses a difference-in-difference framework to examine the effect the policy had on returns. As a result of the policy change, credit unions with a high share of net worth in loan participations earned, on average, a return on assets 47 basis points less than their counterparts. Further, we find evidence that suggests these lower returns were driven by a decline in participation loans with recourse provisions, liquidity issues, and relatively higher interest expenses.

We contribute to the literature on HGFs, which is largely absent of cross-national institutional studies, by examining the institutional conditions driving HGFs in 26 transition countries over a long period comprising three panels between 1998 and 2009. Using an institutional hierarchy approach, we test for the influence of formal and informal institutions on HGF prevalence in countries. Our analysis relies first on a principal component analysis to identify institutional factors. Second, we use GLS estimation to test the influence of these three factors on HGF prevalence in a country, followed by a robustness check. Our results show that interaction effects, rather than direct effects, are useful in explaining systematic variations in HGFs prevalence in transition economies. We find that the interaction between formal and informal institutions positively influences HGFs. Further, we find that in fast-reforming transition economies, more burdensome formal institutions discourage HGFs but in slow-reforming transition economies, informal institutions encourage HGFs.","[Krasniqi, Besnik A.] Univ Prishtina, Prishtina, Kosovo; [Desai, Sameeksha] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Krasniqi, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Prishtina, Prishtina, Kosovo.",besnik.krasniqi@uni-pr.edu,"Krasniqi, Besnik A./F-4077-2011","Krasniqi, Besnik A./0000-0003-2440-3974",,,,,143,90,98,5,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Open spaces improve the quality of the environment, quality of life, and promote social interaction and inclusion. There is evidence of positive impacts on health. This research analyses the potential accessibility to open spaces in two Chilean cities, Valdivia and Temuco. Analysis of accessibility is based on patterns of daily mobility by travelers while considering their trips and transport modes, in particular walking. Statistical analysis of trip length forms the basis of an adaptive threshold for the calculation of a cumulative potential measure of accessibility. The analysis shows that, for these two cities, variations in accessibility tend to be driven by age and gender, and less by income. There are also variations between the two cities, with Temuco showing better levels of accessibility, as a consequence of residents generally undertaking longer walking trips. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, the objectives of our research are the following: (i) to identify and critically analyse the key financial and non-financial reporting frameworks applicable in tourism, and respectively (ii) to identify the general trend and specific features of the financial and non-financial reporting of companies that manage major amusement parks in Europe. To achieve these objectives, we analysed the most recent sets of annual reports and other reports containing non-financial information, published by a number of five companies that hold the top 20 amusement parks in Europe. We followed a set of non-financial indicators that we selected based on the following reporting frameworks: Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), European Federation of Financial Analysts (EFFAS), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), European Tourism Indicators System (ETIS). The results obtained indicate the following existing trends: (i) in terms of financial reporting, there is symmetry for four of the 13 analysed aspects, others being reported differently and (ii) in terms of non-financial reporting, the degree of symmetry for the information disclosed is much lower that of financial reporting, only two of the 46 selected non-financial indicators (customer satisfaction and number of customers) being consistently reported by all the investigated companies.","[Calu, Daniela Artemisa; Dumitru, Madalina; Glavan, Mariana Elena; Guse, Raluca Gina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",madalina.dumitru@cig.ase.ro,"Dumitru, Madalina/C-3885-2011; Calu, Daniela Artemisa/N-5763-2017; Guse, Raluca Gina/GVT-2621-2022","Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302; Calu, Daniela Artemisa/0000-0002-2306-5275; Guse, Raluca Gina/0000-0001-5424-3364",,,,,39,5,5,2,22,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,1015,1033,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700021,0

The required R&D expenditures however are substantial and fall on self-interested countries. Thus, the prospects of successful innovation critically depend on innovation incentives. This paper focuses on a specific mechanism for strategic distortions in this R&D game. In this mechanism, the outlook of future conflicts surrounding technology deployment directly impacts on the willingness to undertake R&D. Apart from free-riding, a different deployment conflict with distortive effects on innovation can occur. Low deployment costs and heterogeneous preferences might give rise to 'free-driving' (Weitzman, ML (2015). Avoting architecture for the governance of free-driver externalities, with application to geoengineering. The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 117(4), 1049-1068): The country with the highest preference for technology deployment, the free driver, may dominate the deployment outcome to the detriment of others. The present paper develops a simple two stage model for analyzing how technology deployment conflicts, free-riding and free-driving, shape R&D incentives of two asymmetric countries. The framework gives rise to rich findings, underpinning the narrative that future deployment conflicts extend to the R&D stage. While the outlook of free-riding unambiguously weakens innovation incentives, the findings for free-driving are more complex, including the possibility of excessive R&D as well as incentives for counter-R&D.","[Heyen, Daniel] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Heyen, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.",D.Heyen@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,5,5,0,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

This growth is stimulated by three recent economic trends which are likely to influence the efficiency and the management of fiscal policy. First, the increasing integration in international financial and goods markets led researchers to reconsider its impact on the effects of fiscal policy by relaxing the purchasing power and the interest rate parity assumptions which are retained in the early open-economy general equilibrium models. Second, the public debt crisis seen in most of the developed countries led to the analysis of a fiscal policy based on a better management of government expenditures and to the specification of a debt-financed fiscal policy that internalizes the necessity of a sustainable deficit. Third, the creation of European monetary union and the recent global economic crisis raised interest on the gains from fiscal stabilization as well as cooperation and stimulated research on the optimal combination of dynamic fiscal and monetary policies.","[Zeyneloglu, Irem] Galatasaray Univ, Dept Econ, Galatasaray Ctr Econ Res GIAM, 36 Ciragan Ave, TR-34357 Istanbul, Turkey; [Koenig, Gilbert] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, UMR 7522, CNRS, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",Galatasaray University; Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Koenig, G (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA, UMR 7522, CNRS, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",izeyneloglu@gsu.edu.tr; koenig@unistra.fr,"ZEYNELOGLU, IREM/AAC-2480-2020","ZEYNELOGLU, IREM/0000-0001-5637-1992",,,,,49,0,0,0,7,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We also find that this responsiveness is not associated with a lower quality of patents measured in terms of citations. A higher responsiveness from R&D to patenting is found in the fields of chemical engineering, chemistry (science), electrical engineering, electronics, and photonics, information technology, medicine, and microbiology than in other patenting fields.

Results show a strong positive impact of green innovation on long-run job creation, substantially bigger than the effect of other innovations. Our findings are robust to a number of additional tests including controls for patents' quality and cost differential between generic and green innovation and endogeneity.","[Gagliardi, Luisa] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Gagliardi, Luisa] Bocconi Univ, Res Ctr Reg Econ Transports & Tourisms, CERTeT, Milan, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni] Natl Res Council Italy, Res Inst Sustainable Econ Growth, IRCrES CNR, Via Bassini 15, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni] OFCE SciencesPo, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Miriello, Caterina] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Energy & Environm Econ & Policy, IEFE, Via Guglielmo Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Bocconi University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR); Bocconi University,"Miriello, C (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Energy & Environm Econ & Policy, IEFE, Via Guglielmo Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",l.gagliardi@lse.ac.uk; giovanni.marin@ircres.cnr.it; caterina.miriello@unibocconi.it,"Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561",EMInInn (Environmental Macro Indicators of Innovation) FP7 project [283002],EMInInn (Environmental Macro Indicators of Innovation) FP7 project,"We thank participants of seminars at SERC WiP Seminars, Dept. of Geography and Environment, LSE (November 2013), IEFE-FEEM (Milan, December 2013), CSIC-UPV (Valencia, January 2014), OFCE-SKEMA (Sophia Antipolis, May 2014), and at the IAERE Conference (Milan, February 2014), the Royal Economics Society Conference (Manchester, April 2014), the EU-SPRI Conference (Manchester, June 2014), the WCERE Conference (Istanbul, June 2014), the International Schumpeter Society Conference (Jena, July 2014), the 55th Riunione Annuale della Societa Italiana degli Economisti (Trento, October 2014) for useful comments and fruitful discussion.

The empirical results show that financial factors, such as the relation with the respective equity market, volatility, the relative size of the real estate sector, and trading turnover all play an important role in the degree of comovement present. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of macroeconomic variables in the relations observed.

I draw upon feminist social theory and political ecology to unravel processes of social exclusion that legitimated violent action against a social group rendered both invisible and wholly othered within a remarkably short period of time. The discursive production of less-than-human milling subjects first the Ghanaian galamsey miners, then the Chinese operators enables a highly politicized landscapes of power characterized by authoritative ordering of unruly mining spaces. The making of demonized, unworthy Chinese miners epitomized the forceful disciplining of these spaces in the absence of more inclusive and genuine development policies. Observed processes of subject-making seem to propagate the sector's informality and perpetuate the distance from the state's idealized depiction of a responsible modern miner. The case study demonstrates that exclusion and exploitation of those targeted as not belonging nourishes elite capture and pervasive rent-seeking. Understanding the processes of subjection at work further suggests that better regulation of ASM in itself will be insufficient to move beyond the current impasse and support true partnerships and genuine politics of recognition and belonging.

We illustrate that information disclosure is attained when the firm is regulated through the use of a quantity rather than a price instrument. To do so, we argue that increased convexity obtained under complete information is a sufficient condition. As a policy implication, we suggest a new argument which favors the use of quantities over prices. These implications are more pronounced once we allow for multiple firms.","[Antoniou, Fabio] Humboldt Univ, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Tsakiris, Nikos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Ioannina, Greece",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Ioannina,"Antoniou, F (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",fabio.antoniou@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; ntsak@cc.uoi.gr,"Antoniou, Fabio/ABH-5736-2020","ANTONIOU, FABIO/0000-0002-6943-8057",,,,,37,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In particular, it investigates how the distribution of NIH funding is stirred towards institutions located in swing-voter US states during presidential elections. In doing so, it fills a gap left in the literature on the political economy of the NIH, which previously focused on the role of membership in the Committees on Appropriations in both chambers of the US Congress. First, it is found that NIH funded performers in states where the Presidential Electoral Importance (PEI) increases by 1 %, receive, on average 0.7-0.8 % more funding. Second, this effect is robust to three additional checks. Third, I run heterogeneity tests, where the direction and change of the elasticity coefficient fit plausible assumptions on the mechanism of presidential influence on NIH funding in swing-voter states. I finally estimate, that the average lower bound of the overall impact of PEI on the NIH budget is between 2 and 3 %. It reaches a maximum of 10 % for specific states, fiscal years, and presidential mandates.","[Batinti, Alberto] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Batinti, A (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",a.batinti@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,4,5,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2016,168.0,3-4,,,,,239,263,,10.1007/s11127-016-0358-z,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DZ9BP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386168500004,0

Evidence from Panel Data,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,water supply; sanitation; aid; effectiveness; panel data,GROWTH; EDUCATION,"A voluminous academic literature exists on the effectiveness of foreign aid in general. However, relatively less work has been done on the impact of sector-specific foreign aid. This paper focuses on the impact of aid disbursements on outcomes in the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Sector. Despite the considerable increase in aid flows to the WSS sector over the last few years, it is only recently that the literature has started to focus on assessing aid effectiveness in this sector. We contribute to the growing interest in sector specific aid effectiveness literature by conducting an empirical analysis for a large panel of countries to assess the effectiveness of aid disbursements on improved access to WSS facilities. Our empirical results suggest that aid disbursements produce a strong, positive, and significant effect on improved access to WSS, and our results are robust to multiple specifications and estimation procedures. We also find strong evidence of non-linearities governing the relationship between aid flows and outcomes, in that aid disbursements are effective only in lower middle-income-countries rather than low-income-countries or upper middle-income countries. These results tend to suggest that a country needs to meet a certain development or income threshold before aid can prove to be effective and that aid flows tend to have diminishing returns. Finally, we also find that aid disbursements produce favorable effects in enhancing access to WSS facilities in rural as opposed to urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This led to a reassessment of the pre-crisis period of economic growth and stability in the EMU, shifting attention to the macroeconomic imbalances that emerged between member states, especially those in current account balances. This paper uses macroeconomic data on OECD economies and a new statistical approach for causal inference in observational studies-the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of the EMU on the current account balances of individual member states. This 'counterfactuals' approach provides strong evidence that the introduction of the EMU was responsible for the divergence in current account balances among member states in the run-up to the euro crisis. The results suggest that the EMU effect operated through multiple channels and that fundamental changes to the institutional framework of the EMU may be required to safeguard the currency union against a reemergence of dangerous external imbalances in the future.

This study investigated the extent to which individuals voluntarily changed jobs as a strategy to cope with job insecurity, taking into account the family context. We tested whether job insecurity promoted voluntary turnover. Family factors were expected to either hamper or stimulate turnover, and to affect the relationship between job insecurity and turnover. Using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel (2004-2013), we showed that men facing job insecurity were more likely to experience voluntary turnover. For women this was only true when they did not have preschool-aged children at home and experienced low levels of economic hardship. Moreover, family factors influenced voluntary turnover differently for men and women: Economic hardship increased the odds of voluntary turnover for men, whereas a partner's job insecurity lowered the odds for women.","[Lebert, Florence; Voorpostel, Marieke] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Ctr Expertise Social Sci, FORS, Geopolis, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Lebert, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Swiss Ctr Expertise Social Sci, FORS, Geopolis, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",florence.lebert@fors.unil.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This study has been realized using the data collected by the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), which is based at the Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences FORS.

Since 2003, the central government has increased the share of land use quotas allocated to the central and western regions to support their development. As a result, the relative decline in land supply in the eastern regions has raised housing prices and consequently increased wages, damaging the competitiveness of the Chinese economy. On the basis of city level panel data from 2001 to 2010, we used the per capita land supply as the instrument variable for housing prices and analyzed the sub-samples along the border between the inland and the eastern regions. We found that land supply policies have led to the rapid growth of housing prices and increased wages in the cities where land supply has been restricted, mainly in eastern region. This study indicates that regardless of the geographical advantages of the east region, land supply policies have had a negative impact on the efficiency and competitiveness of the Chinese economy.

Theoretically informed by family stress theory, this study examines the influence of changing subjective reports of economic hardship over time on the risk for IPV. Specifically, we test two hypotheses: (1) change in economic hardship significantly predicts IPV; and, specifically, (2) increased economic hardship or unstable economic conditions increases the risk of IPV. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study, we assess the incidence of IPV for 941 women in committed relationships. Results from our logistic regression analyses suggest that after controlling for numerous demographic factors, women who never experienced economic hardship had lower odds of experiencing IPV than those who did. Further, women who experienced high levels of economic hardship over time had the highest odds of experiencing IPV. However, the effects of changing economic hardship on IPV were attenuated once maternal depression and parenting stress were controlled. Results are discussed in terms of practice and policy implications.","[Lucero, Jessica L.; Lim, Sojung] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Santiago, Anna Maria] Michigan State Univ, Sch Social Work, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Michigan State University,"Lucero, JL (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",jessica.lucero@usu.edu,"Santiago, Anna/Y-2139-2019",,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD36916, R01HD39135, R01HD40421]",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The authors thank the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) through Grants R01HD36916, R01HD39135, and R01HD40421, as well as a consortium of private foundations for their support of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study.",,60,36,44,0,26,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

The number of brands is lower (resp. higher) with asymmetric information than with complete information when contracts are linear (resp. with two-part tariffs).

This paper uses US and German Government yields to test three factor Gaussian models that do and that do not rule out negative yields, namely affine models, quadratic models, extensions of the Black and Black-Karasinski models. Quadratic models and a Vasicek-type model best fit observed yields when the stochastic factors driving the short rate are correlated. However the Black-Karasinski model for the US and the Black model for both US and Germany can best fit yields when interest rates are lowest, i.e. after 2008, despite the restriction of independent factors driving the short rate. A new linear quadratic model whereby the central tendency of the short rate is a non-negative quadratic function of Gaussian factors performs particularly well for German yields. All models fit German yields better than US yields. All models fit the one year yield worse than longer term yields. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Focusing on the interaction between externalities and land use patterns, we examine the efficiendes of first-best policies and second-best pricing and place-based strategies using numerical simulations. A first-best policy must combine both Pigouvian congestion tolling (PCT) and Pigouvian labor subsidies (PLS) instruments, or design an optimal toll (or subsidy) internalizing agglomeration externalities (or congestion externalities). We also examine second-best pricing policies if only one instrument is adopted. Congestion pricing policies alone (e.g., a partial PCT or a flat-rate toll) can improve social welfare only in heavy-congestion cities, and their welfare gains may be insignificant (e.g., below 10% of the welfare improvement achieved by first-best policies). In contrast, second-best labor subsidy policies alone are a more effective alternative to first-best policies. As to place-based policies, the firm duster zoning (FCZ) regulation is more efficient than the urban growth boundary (UGB) policy. UGBs only have small effects on the agglomeration economy but could worsen land market distortions via residential rent-escalation effects. These findings suggest that it is important to internalize business land use decisions and relax monocentricity assumptions, in order to appreciate the interplay of both urban externalities, since spatial adaptations to policy interventions can distort system efficiencies.

Through the lens of the model, we find that the total banking system capital shortfall under stressful macroeconomic conditions began to rise 4 years before the financial crisis, peaking in the fourth quarter of 2008. The capital gap has since fallen sharply, and is now significantly below pre-crisis levels. In the cross-section, banking firms estimated to be most sensitive to macroeconomic conditions also have higher capital ratios, consistent with a precautionary view of bank capital, though this behavior is evident only since the crisis. We interpret our results as evidence that the resiliency of the U.S. banking system has improved since the financial crisis, and also as an illustration of the value of stress testing as a macroprudential policy tool.

Some of these revenues could be used to cover investment needs for infrastructure providing access to water, sanitation, electricity, telecommunications, and transport. In this way, emission pricing could promote sustainable socio-economic development by safeguarding the stability of natural systems which constitute the material basis of economies, while at the same time providing public goods that are essential for human well-being. For a scenario that is consistent with limiting global warming to below 2 degrees C, we find that domestic carbon pricing (without redistribution of revenues across countries) has substantial potential to close existing access gaps for water, sanitation, electricity, and telecommunication. However, for the majority of countries carbon pricing revenues would not be sufficient to pave all unpaved roads, and for most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa they would be insufficient to provide universal access to all types of infrastructure except water. If some fraction of the global revenues of carbon pricing is redistributed, e.g., via the Green Climate Fund, more ambitious infrastructure access goals could be achieved in developing countries. Our paper also bears relevance for the design of climate finance mechanisms, as it suggests that supporting carbon pricing policies instead of project based finance might not only permit cost-efficient emission reductions, but also leverage public revenues to promote human development goals.

We consider whether LLP is determined by non-discretionary incurred loss variables only, or also by discretionary LLP (DLLP) that smooths reported earnings, signals favourable future earnings, or anticipates future losses. In a sample of 5187 bank-quarter observations from 2006 to 2010, our results show that LLP increases substantially, consistent with it being pro-cyclical, although LLP/equity levels remain modest. LLP severely and negatively impacts reported earnings, especially during 2009-2010. We also find that DLLP is used for smoothing and signalling, primarily where the two incentives reinforce each other, but smoothing occurs more frequently. Further, DLLP anticipated next quarter's losses in 2006-2008 but not in 2009-2010. The market positively values the use of DLLP in 2006-2008 to reduce reported earnings of poorly performing banks, and in 2009-2010 to smooth reported earnings of better performing banks.

The incidence and extent of foreign investment projects in energy efficiency, CO2 reduction and non-CO2 gas reduction projects are higher for the countries with lower per capita GDP, most likely due to capital constraints. There is no evidence that the number of sub-regional projects impinged on investment flows.

Our paper offers a novel informational justification for imposing limits on campaign spending and encouraging diversity in the supply of political information.","[Akoez, Kemal Kivanc] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Arbatli, Cemal Eren] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Fac Econ, Moscow, Russia",New York University Abu Dhabi; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Aköz, KK (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",kka227@nyu.edu,"Akoz, Kemal Kivanc/AAG-1125-2019; ARBATLI, CEMAL EREN/F-6856-2016","ARBATLI, CEMAL EREN/0000-0001-5812-2455",,,,,27,1,2,1,14,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

By integrating the gravity model of investment with the state-specific process of bank deregulation that occurred in the United States from the 1980s through the 1990s, we develop a bank-specific, time-varying measure of deregulation-induced competition. We find that an intensification of competition reduced abnormal accruals of loan loss provisions and the frequency with which banks restate financial statements. The results suggest that competition reduces bank opacity, potentially enhancing the ability of markets to monitor banks.

We show that the magnitude and statistical significance of this effect is influenced by the expected length of a future career. By using incumbent age as a proxy for expected career length, we find that the lame-duck effect is statistically observable only among those politicians with long careers ahead. Using data on US governors from 1950 to 2005, we find evidence that the influence of term limits is heterogeneous, primarily influencing young incumbents who hope to have long careers and thus have stronger incentives to remain accountable to voters. Indeed, we find little evidence of a lame-duck effect among older incumbents, suggesting that their already-shortened time horizons may offset the term limit effect.","[Leguizamon, J.

We find that uncertainty due to anticipative learning induces a decrease in total emissions, but not necessarily in individual emissions. Further, the effect of structural uncertainty on total and individual emissions depends on the beliefs distribution and bias.

A key aim of these policies was to boost the quantity of bank credit to the non-financial corporate and household sectors. In the previous decades, however, policy makers had not focused on bank credit. Indeed, over the past half century, different variables were raised to prominence in the quest to achieve desired nominal GDP outcomes. This paper conducts a long-overdue horse race between the various contenders in terms of their ability to account for observed nominal GDP growth, using a half-century of UK data since 1963. Employing the 'General-to-Specific' methodology, an equilibrium-correction model is estimated suggesting a long-run cointegrating relationship between disaggregated real economy credit and nominal GDP. Short-term and long-term interest rates and broad money do not appear to influence nominal GDP significantly. Vector autoregression and vector error correction modelling shows the real economy credit growth variable to be strongly exogenous to nominal GDP growth. Policy-makers are hence right to finally emphasise the role of bank credit, although they need to disaggregate it and specifically target bank credit for GDP-transactions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

I argue that competition effects may be reverted and overpricing may increase rather than decrease after competitors arrive, when retail investors fail to detect implications of credit risk differences on certificates' values. Using difference-in-differences estimations on matched samples, I find that overpricing of master certificates decreases after the competing products have been issued, but only when the master issuer's credit risk is lower than that of the duplicate issuer, while it increases when the credit risk difference is positive. These findings are robust to controlling for retail investors' demand in various ways. Thus, the study indicates that retail investors' failure to detect the value implications of issuers' credit risk can undermine product competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, since these consumptions represent an economic and health costs, public policies are implemented in order to discourage teenagers from experiencing and using these substances. These policies primarily use tax increases, consumption restrictions or informing the public about its dangers. In other words, they aim to increase the costs borne by the consumer rather than to decrease its benefits, such as pleasure associated with substance. However, these policies are currently failing to reverse the upward trend in teenagers drug use. In this article, we highlight the importance of considering full spectrum of pleasure associated with drug use, especially the distortion that may exist between expected and experienced pleasure during the first consumption. To do so, we use a theoretical framework of teenagers' drug experimentation in order to define new avenues for public policies.

The cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are significantly positive in response to unexpected dividend increase for non-SEO firms, but they are not significantly different from zero for SEO firms. For non-SEO firms, there is a significant positive relation between future earnings and unexpected dividend increases, but the relation is not significant for SEO firms. However, when considering additional refinancing costs for SEO firms caused by the mandatory dividend policy, higher dividend payments are associated with lower future earnings.

In a setting where investment is endogenous and unobservable to financiers, we show that a bank-secured credit contract is time-inconsistent. Upon being granted credit, the entrepreneur has an incentive to alter the original input combination, jeopardizing the bank's revenues. Anticipating the entrepreneur's opportunism, the bank offers an unsecured credit contract, reducing the surplus from the venture. One way for the entrepreneur to commit to the contract terms is to purchase inputs on credit from the supplier. The supplier observes the input investment and acts as a guarantor that inputs will be purchased as contracted, thus facilitating access to secured bank financing. The commitment role of trade credit still holds in a multi-period extension that investigates the impact of bank relationship lending on secured debt and trade credit. Our model provides novel testable predictions on optimal financial contracts in both one-period and repeated lending relationships.

Numerous studies have investigated ballot order effects in candidate elections, but there is little evidence for direct democracy elections, and identification of causal effects is challenging. This paper offers two strategies for identifying the effect of ballot order in proposition elections, using data from California during 1958-2014 and Texas during 1986-2015. The evidence suggests that propositions are not advantaged by being listed at the top compared to the bottom of the ballot. Approval rates are lower with more propositions on the ballot.","[Matsusaka, John G.] Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Gould Sch Law, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Southern California,"Matsusaka, JG (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Gould Sch Law, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA.",matsusak@usc.edu,,,USC,USC,"For helpful comments and suggestions, I thank Odilon Camara, Dan Klerman, and participants at the Initiatives and Referendums Conference at USC in November 2012 and the CLASS workshop at USC.

In this paper, 114 airports are grouped according to their cargo business characteristics. Applying a hierarchical cluster analysis, the paper uses absolute (cargo tonnage) and relative measures (share of cargo work load units, of freighter movements and of international cargo) to establish the reliance of different airport types and groupings on air cargo. Eight distinct clusters are identified which show clear differences in the characteristics of the sample with regard to cargo activities. Geographic patterns of these airports are also revealed. For example, North American and European airports are characterised by features unique to these regions. Airports that are highly dependent on air cargo tend to benefit from a central location within networks of cargo airlines, while other airports with high cargo volumes generate these as a result of significant belly-capacity of passenger operations. Understanding the heterogeneity of cargo airports is important for future benchmarking studies in this field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of commuting, neighborhood and travel preferences may induce self-selection effects in choices about residential location, work location, and commuting mode. Presumably, such self-selection effects may vary across different job markets. To date, however, no study has been done in developing countries. Therefore, this study aims to fill this research gap by using data collected in Hanoi, Vietnam. A joint model with the above three choices is built by incorporating self-selection effects, where effects of land use attributes are emphasized. Choices of labor-intensive workers (11,344) and knowledge-intensive workers (12,360) are compared. The statistical significance of multiple self-selection effects is confirmed, which suggests that the joint estimation of the above three choices is a useful approach. As for the magnitude of influence of self-selection effects, self-selection seems to be more influential in knowledge-intensive workers' residential location and work location choices. As for land use attributes, different types of households, and labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive workers show different responses to different types of land in location choices (especially the work location choice). Effects of land use diversity and population density on the commuting mode choice are mixed. Additionally, the centralization of knowledge-intensive employment and decentralization of labor-intensive employment are captured. These findings may be useful for city planners in Hanoi in designing land use patterns in the future in order to keep knowledge-intensive workers working and living close together.

We addressed the issue by using the collective model of labor supply. Most empirical studies based on the collective approach were restricted to the identification of the sharing rule guiding individual allocations up to a constant. We suggested using individual welfare satisfaction data as an additional source of identification. An empirical example was given using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. The sharing rule was found to be related to the spouses' wage and age differences and number of children. Sharing varied with the level of household income: In low-income households, sharing was equal; in middle (high) income households men held a slight (strong) advantage.","[Radchenko, Natalia] Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW,Kreeger 104, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Radchenko, N (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW,Kreeger 104, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",nataliar@american.edu,,,,,,,60,6,6,2,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Incorporating a participation decision into a standard New Keynesian model with matching frictions, we show that market tightness becomes endogenously more volatile because both the opportunity cost of home production and the reservation wage vary with participation. The model can simultaneously explain the low volatility of participation, the high volatility of unemployment, and a procyclical workers' outside option of working. A policy of strict inflation targeting is close to optimal, and increasing the response of the interest rate to inflation does not have a large impact on the volatility of unemployment because of the endogenous response of participation.

We investigate this prediction empirically based on three different approaches. First, we show that initial ratings disagree with bond spread levels during boom periods in the way that rating agencies hold a systematically more optimistic view. Second, we reveal that boom bond ratings tend to be more heavily downgraded from an ex post perspective; and, third, we demonstrate that boom ratings are inflated compared with conflicts-free benchmark ratings. In several robustness tests we show that the observed boom bias does not result from changes in credit-worthiness, adjustments in rating standards, competitive pressure, or market supply, but rather from rating agencies' incentive conflicts.","[Dilly, Mark; Mahlmann, Thomas] Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany",,"Dilly, M (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany.",,,,Roland Berger Strategy Consultants,Roland Berger Strategy Consultants,"We would like to thank an anonymous referee, Martin Hibbeln and Deyan Radev as well as the session participants of the 2013 German Finance Association Conference and the 2013 Paris Finance Meeting for helpful comments, Doug Richardson of the Investment Company Institute for sharing historical fund flow data, and Peter R.

The aim of the article is to highlight the process of integration from the perspective of productive employment and its main determinants, in Romania, in the period following accession to the EU and integration into the European economic structures, the 2007-2014 period respectively. The results of this paper highlight a low level of productive employment in Romania determined mainly by low labour productivity, low wages, high vulnerable employment, high and inefficient employment in agriculture and a low level of employment in knowledge-intensive activities. The existence of large gaps, in terms of productive employment and economic development, between Romania and the developed EU countries, as well as the existence of the highest in-work poverty risk in EU emphasizes the need to accelerate productivity growth, which requires a real structural transformation, a shift from low-productivity sectors to high-productivity sectors.

The employer is required to perform accommodations for them at the workplace such as adjusting job application procedures. It is our view that the legislation is important and necessary because it helps people with disabilities to become integrated and to contribute at work and in society. Nevertheless, to a degree, it 'mistreats' the employer by not requiring applicants to disclose the accommodations that helped them with their scholastic or selection tests achievements. Thus, the employer is denied the ability to make well-informed, realistic selection decisions, and at the same time - it creates a high potential for job failure.

We examine whether the tournament theory or the team-cohesiveness hypothesis dominates the relation ship. We also use the relative position of team payroll as one of the control variables and compare our findings with the results based on the absolute level of team payroll. This study applies a dynamic panel estimation approach. Our evidence overall supports the team-cohesiveness hypothesis over the tournament theory. We find that greater wage disparity is negatively related to team performance. Our findings also suggest that salary structure is not a robust incentive design for team performance in MLB. A different treatment of payroll variables alters the role of salary dispersion. When we take the payroll level as a control variable, salary dispersion shows a negatively significant effect on team performance, while it has an insignificant effect on team performance when the payroll's relative position is used as a control variable.

These two factors reflect different information about future economic activity, which is smoothed out by the term spread. The paper shows that the slope factor has predictive power on future economic activity over longer horizons ahead, and thus may be interpreted as reflecting future business cycle conditions. On the other hand, the curvature factor, which enters the term spread with opposite sign than the slope factor, has predictive power on shorter movements of future economic activity which may be associated with changes in the current stance of monetary policy. These results hold for a number of world developed economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Employing a disability framework, the associations between wealth status and four health outcomes, active disease, physical impairment, functional limitation and disability, were tested. Older adults from the three wealthiest quintiles (richest, richer and middle) were less likely to report the four health outcomes than the poorest one. Economic inequalities were largest for functional impairment and disability. Age advancement had a significant impact on each of the health outcomes.

Whether the labor market rewards a shareholder-friendly or management-friendly reputation is determined in equilibrium and depends on aggregate governance. We show that directors' desire to be invited to other boards creates strategic complementarity of corporate governance across firms.

To achieve these planning targets would require a relatively modest drop in the share of agriculture in GDP, but a dramatic fall in its share in employment by 2025. Tanzanian planners assume that labour is locked in agriculture because agricultural productivity is low, from which they conclude that, to release labour to fuel the expansion of manufacturing, it is imperative to raise agricultural productivity by appropriate land policies, leveraging private investment and developing public-private partnerships. We argue that, analytically, this planning argument leaves out the possibility that causality may run the other way - from high labour retention in agriculture to low agricultural productivity - and that, empirically, the observed patterns inherent in actual processes of economic transformation in Tanzania do not tally well with the assumptions of planners. More specifically, in so far as labour flows out of agriculture, it flows towards informal-sector activities, both rural and urban, rather than towards formal manufacturing.","[Wuyts, Marc] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Wuyts, Marc; Kilama, Blandina] REPOA, 157 Migombani St,Regent Estate POB 33223, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Wuyts, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.;Wuyts, M; Kilama, B (通讯作者)，REPOA, 157 Migombani St,Regent Estate POB 33223, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",mewuyts@gmail.com; bkilama@repoa.or.tz,,,,,,,34,7,8,2,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Furthermore, the modest level of cheating appeared to be insensitive to the gain from cheating, which leads Ariely to conclude that contrary to Becker's (1968) simple model of rational crime, real life cheaters would not cheat more in response to an increase in the gain from cheating. The present paper shows, first, that Ariely's claim with regard to Becker's model is incorrect, as this model cannot predict at all how the level of rational crime responds to an increase in the gain from crime. Second, the paper offers an extended version of Becker's model which allows for such prediction, showing that an increase in the gain from crime can rationally decrease the number of crimes committed. Third, the paper suggests a simple model of rational cheating adjusted to Ariely's experiment setup which rationalizes his results. Finally, the paper reports the results of an experiment which offered participants an opportunity to cheat in a perfectly safe environment, revealing, contrary to Ariely's findings, that when really feeling safe, many people would cheat by a large extent.

We find that international sourcing has a significant negative influence on financial leverage. The negative influence is stronger in industries that have high R&D intensities and are financially constrained. However, the negative relation is mitigated when suppliers are from countries with strong legal environments and when the supplier markets are more competitive. Overall, our findings suggest that relationship-specific investments, supplier market characteristics, and financial market conditions are key determinants of the sourcing-leverage relation.","[Eun, Cheol S.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Wang, Lingling] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Tulane University,"Wang, LL (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",lwang1@tulane.edu,,"Wang, Lingling/0000-0002-6008-4037",,,,,68,2,2,3,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In contrast to Rothschild and Stiglitz (), the equilibrium can be efficient; that is, it can coincide with the equilibrium under full information. Furthermore, we show that pooling, semipooling, and separating equilibria can exist. Specifically, there exist separating equilibria that predict a positive correlation between the level of insurance coverage and risk type, as in the standard economic models of adverse selection, but there also exist separating equilibria that predict a negative correlation between the level of insurance coverage and risk type. Since optimal choice of regretful customers depends on foregone alternatives, the equilibrium includes a contract that is offered but not purchased.","[Huang, Rachel J.] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Finance, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan; [Huang, Rachel J.] NCCU, Coll Commerce, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan; [Muermann, Alexander] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Muermann, Alexander] Vienna Grad Sch Finance, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Tzeng, Larry Y.] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Finance, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Larry Y.] NCCU, Coll Commerce, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Central University; Vienna University of Economics & Business; National Taipei University,"Muermann, A (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.;Muermann, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Grad Sch Finance, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",alexan-der.muermann@wu.ac.at,"Huang, Rachel J/D-8876-2014","Muermann, Alexander/0000-0002-6132-053X",National Institutes of Health-National Institute on Aging [P30 AG12836]; Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program [R24 HD-044964],National Institutes of Health-National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Security at the University of Pennsylvania; National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program,"We thank two anonymous reviewers, as well as Roland Eisen, Wanda Mimra, Harris Schlesinger, and seminar participants at the Wharton School Applied Economics workshop, the Goethe University Frankfurt, the Munich Behavioral Insurance Workshop, the Risk Theory Society meeting, the EGRIE meeting, the Symposium on Finance, Banking and Insurance, and the ARIA meeting for their valuable comments.

Career-conscious directors, measured by age and the director's reputation value, are more likely to dissent; dissension is eventually rewarded in the marketplace in the form of more outside directorships and a lower risk of regulatory sanctions.

How significant is the impact of coups on aid flows? These questions have become increasingly important over the past three decades as the concept of political conditionality has gradually permeated the donor community, pushing for stringent actions to be taken against democratic transgressions like coups. I argue that the end of the Cold War was a historical juncture that reshaped the international donor community's aid-based sanctioning policy toward coups. However, I also posit that the U.S. does not comply with the growing international norm of political conditionality due to its geopolitical interests trumping its rhetorical commitment to penalizing coups. This paper exploits exogenous variation in the success and failure of coups to estimate the causal effect of coup-led regime change on aid flows. My empirical evidence supports the preposition that since the end of the Cold War, the donor community on average has reduced the amounts of aid disbursements in response to coups d'etat although the U.S. has been inconsistent in applying aid sanctions against coups both during the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. While demonstrating a genuine shift in the international community's collective responses toward coups since the end of the Cold War, my findings also attest to potential heterogeneity across major bilateral donors, which may undermine the overall effectiveness of aid and political conditionality.

In a two-country model of trade, productivity growth is generated by firm-level investment in process innovation, and the location of economic activity is determined by relative market size, trade costs and imperfect knowledge diffusion. Equilibrium features the partial concentration of manufacturing and the full concentration of innovation in the larger country. Increased economic integration raises the concentration of manufacturing in the larger country, and when monopoly power is strong, leads to decreased product variety, accelerated productivity growth and greater national welfare. With weak monopoly power, however, it raises product variety and dampens productivity growth, but may benefit or hurt welfare.","[Davis, Colin] Doshisha Univ, Inst Liberal Arts, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan; [Hashimoto, Ken-ichi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan",Doshisha University; Kobe University,"Hashimoto, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan.",cdavis@mail.doshisha.ac.jp,,,"JSPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03367, 24730209, 15K03444] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",They acknowledge financial support from JSPS through a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) and a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B).,,28,3,3,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper provides evidence on this assertion and tests whether investors misprice these components of earnings. Consistent with predictions, we find greater persistence in the industry-wide component of earnings that is not fully recognized in stock prices. We show that these effects are partially driven by the market's inability to recognize the differential persistence of industry-wide earnings in homogenous industries or in the presence of a large business shock. Finally, we show that industry-wide cash flows is the most persistent component of earnings while firm-specific accruals is the least persistent, suggesting that economic fundamentals and accounting constructs are jointly informative about firms' future earnings. The market predictably misprices these components, however, significantly underweighting the persistence of industry-wide cash flows and overweighting the persistence of firm specific accruals.

The review finds that little more, if anything, has been learned about the macroeconomics of mitigating climate change over the long run since the 2007 IPCC report. Furthermore, while the 2014 report is quite self-critical about the serious weaknesses in its methodologies, the self-criticisms are not explicitly taken into account when the net macroeconomic costs of mitigation are reported. Nor do the research teams that run the integrated assessment models relied on in the report utilize any systematic methodology for assessing the inherent uncertainty in the macroeconomic results reported. Thus, the basic quantitative findings are misleading - and, perhaps, even deceptive - in part because they appear to preclude the possibility of large macroeconomic benefits from mitigating climate change.","[Rosen, Richard A.] Tellus Inst, Boston, MA 02116 USA",,"Rosen, RA (通讯作者)，Tellus Inst, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",rrosen@tellus.org,,,,,,,23,13,14,3,23,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

A short-term investor stores cash because of a need to pay cash at some future date. If a short-term investor buys bonds, then a deadline for retrieving cash lowers the resale price of bonds for the investor through bilateral bargaining in the bond market. Ex-ante, this hold-up problem explains the use of a repo by a short-term investor, the existence of a haircut, and the vulnerability of a repo market to counterparty risk.

Seaports are no exception. As complex clusters of industrial activity and gateways for distribution networks, they are vulnerable to external and internal shocks disrupting supply chains. This evolution forces stakeholders to ponder on sustainable development, and to foster adaptive capabilities and create opportunities. The development and further substantiation of the notion of 'resilience' underlined the need to study how clusters and networks (should) respond to major disturbances. In this paper, we scrutinize the concept of port resilience by revisiting the Panarchy and adaptive cycle theorem of Holling (2001). The objective is to determine if this framework can be applied to a port development context. The paper outlines the literature on Panarchy and adaptive cycles and links it to ports. It also provides an overview of the general theorem and explains the value for maritime research. The framework is linked to a set of cases on port infrastructure and development.

The arguments of the authors are supported by Setterfield's (1998a, 2008) concept of hysteresis as path-dependence in the long-run outcome of systems with direct shocks. The paper shows that extension of Lavoie's PKA model by deep endogeneity of the parameter gamma causes the fulfillment of the necessary condition of hysteresis Setterfield's condition (a) ensuring deep endogeneity of the alleged exogenous parameter and, by means of this, path dependence in the long-run output but not the fulfillment of the sufficient condition of hysteresis - condition (c) ensuring the presence of adjustment asymmetry and, by means of this, irreversibility. Thus, deep-endogenisation of the parameter gamma does not bring about Setterfield's hysteresis and, in effect, does not cause irreversibility.","[Chytil, Zdenek; Maslo, Lukas] Vysoka Skola Ekon, CR-13067 Prague, Czech Republic",,"Chytil, Z; Máslo, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, CR-13067 Prague, Czech Republic.",zdenek.chytil@vse.cz; xmasl14@vse.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Under the influence of globalization and European integration, there is a revival of interest in economic ethics as precondition of successful integration of culturally varied economic subjects. The economic ethics addresses the issue of what the economic activity should be like to contribute to the realization of the primary goal of humanism as all-European value. The main issue of economic ethics is solving the conflict between the internal logic of the economic activity, which is directed at making profits, and universal moral demands of a democratic society. The economic activity as a partial area of the society is assigned to the field of heteronomous morality, which formulates standards regulating conduct in a specific area. At the same time, however, the economic activity is analysed as a part of the general moral space in which universal autonomous morality should apply. Heteronomous morality is based on ethics of utilitarianism and autonomous morality on ethics of deontology. There are two basic directions of development of economic ethics: ethics of personal moral responsibility and institutional ethics. Economic activity rooted in economic ethics is seen as important but not sufficient precondition of the European integration. Its crucial prerequisite should be human-focused approach corresponding to arising of European demos sharing humanism as all-European value.","[Feber, Jaromir] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Social Sci, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Petrucijova, Jelena] Univ Ostrava, Fac Social Sci, F Sramka 3, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; University of Ostrava,"Feber, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Social Sci, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",jaromir.feber@vsb.cz; jelena.petrucijova@osu.cz,"Petrucijova, Jelena/D-9655-2014","Petrucijova, Jelena/0000-0003-2214-6038",,,,,21,1,1,1,5,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

While land use regulation is found to significantly reduce residential development, estimates from fixed effects regressions are about 50-75% smaller than those from pooled regressions. Using the two-way fixed effects model, the implementation of an additional regulation is found to reduce residential permits by an average of 4%, which comes through reductions in both multifamily and single-family permits. Of the regulations measured, those categorized as zoning and general controls have the strongest effects. The partial effects of individual regulations show that while some significantly reduce development, others have a large positive impact.

This paper provides new evidence of the dynamic effects of aid on the real exchange rate, using an identification strategy that exploits the long delays between the approval of aid projects and the subsequent disbursements on them. These disbursement delays enable the isolation of a source of variation in aid inflows that plausibly is uncorrelated with contemporaneous macroeconomic shocks that may drive both aid and the real exchange rate. Using this predetermined component of aid as an instrument, there is little evidence that aid inflows lead to significant real exchange rate appreciations.","[Jarotschkin, Alexandra] Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France; [Kraay, Aart] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Paris School of Economics; The World Bank,"Jarotschkin, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ EHESS, Paris, France.",,,,Knowledge for Change Program (KCP) of the World Bank,Knowledge for Change Program (KCP) of the World Bank,"Financial support from the Knowledge for Change Program (KCP) of the World Bank is gratefully acknowledged.
