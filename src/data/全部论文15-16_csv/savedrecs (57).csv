The tests are (quasi-)likelihood ratio tests based on a Gaussian likelihood, but as usual the asymptotic results do not require normally distributed innovations. Our tests differ from existing tests in two respects. First, instead of basing our tests on the conditional (with respect to the initial observations) likelihood, we follow the recent unit root literature and base our tests on the full likelihood as in, e.g., Elliott et al. (1996). Second, our tests incorporate a sign restriction which generalizes the one-sided unit root test. We show that the asymptotic local power of the proposed tests dominates that of existing cointegration rank tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Boswijk, H.

We find that incentives have large influences: in the control, 17% of children prefer the healthy snack, whereas introduction of small incentives increases take-up of the healthy snack to 75%. There is some evidence that the effects continue post-treatment, consistent with a model of habit formation. We find little evidence that the framing of incentives (loss vs. gain) matters. Educational messaging alone has little effect, but we observe a combined effect of messaging and incentives: together they provide an important influence on food choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To determine the overall health status of the model organism, following hematological indicators of blood were analyzed: number of white blood cells, number of red blood cells, level of hemoglobin and hematocrit. There were non-significant differences in the investigated parameters of white and red blood cells, hemoglobine and hematocrit between groups of animals fed respective diets at day 29. No clinical signs of disease were observed during the entire experiment and hematological analysis gave results within the reference range, that gave evidence of the animals being in a good state of health. The level of oxidative stress of organism was measured via chemiluminiscence of leukocytes. There was no difference between fish oil diet and control group in the level of integral intensity of spontaneous CL as well as after stimulation by Zymozan. But the level of integral intensity of activated CL by PMA was increased by diet enriched with 2.5% fish oil compared with control group fed with diet enriched with 2.5% palm oil.

This study proposes an integrating theoretical framework for testing the relationships among store image, perceived PLB quality, retailer awareness, retailer perceived quality, and retailer loyalty. The result of a survey among consumers of 6 hypermarkets in China confirms that perceived PLB quality and store image jointly affect retailer loyalty through retailer awareness and retailer perceived quality. Particularly, store image has a direct and significant effect on retailer loyalty, whereas the direct effect of perceived PLB quality is not significant. Additionally, the total effect of store image on retailer loyalty is much stronger than that of perceived PLB quality. Thus, in order to build strong retailer equity, retailers should combine quality management of private label brand with store image strategy to form high-level retailer associations.","[Wu Jin-feng; Zhang Xi] Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Management, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Wuhan Textile University,"Wu, JF (通讯作者)，Wuhan Text Univ, Sch Management, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,809,817,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600107,0

We develop a novel model where a brand-name producer competes in prices with several generics producers in a market with brand-biased and brand-neutral consumers. Comparing with coinsurance, we show that reference pricing, contrary to policy makers' intentions, discourages generic entry, as it induces the brand-name producer to price more aggressively. Thus, the net effect of reference pricing on drug prices is ambiguous, implying that reference pricing can be counterproductive in reducing expenditures. However, under price regulation, we show that reference pricing may stimulate generic entry, since a binding price cap weakens the aggressive price response by the brand name producer. This may explain mixed empirical results on the competitive effects of reference pricing. Finally, we show that reference pricing may be welfare improving when accounting for brand preferences despite its adverse effects on entry and prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Survey data were collected from 775 GPs and 1379 Danish citizens eliciting preferences for a consultation. Sequential models allowing for within-person preference heterogeneity and heteroskedasticity between best and worst choices were estimated. We show that GPs do not always act as perfect agents and that this non-alignment stems from GPs being both unable and unwilling to do so. Unable since GPs have imperfect information about patients' preferences, and unwilling since they are also motivated by other factors than user orientation.

The validity of a network meta-analysis, however, can be threatened by inconsistency in evidence within the network. One particular issue of inconsistency is how to directly evaluate the inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence with regard to the effects difference between two treatments. A Bayesian node splitting model was first proposed and a similar frequentist sidesplitting model has been put forward recently. Yet, assigning the inconsistency parameter to one or the other of the two treatments or splitting the parameter symmetrically between the two treatments can yield different results when multi-arm trials are involved in the evaluation. Objectives: We aimed to show that a side-splitting model can be viewed as a special case of design-by-treatment interaction model, and different parameterizations correspond to different design-by-treatment interactions. Methods: We demonstrated how to evaluate the side-splitting model using the arm-based generalized linear mixed model, and an example data set was used to compare results from the arm-based models with those from the contrast based models. Results & Conclusions: The three parameterizations of side-splitting make slightly different assumptions: the symmetrical method assumes that both treatments in a treatment contrast contribute to inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence, whereas the other two parameterizations assume that only one of the two treatments contributes to this inconsistency. With this understanding in mind, meta-analysts can then make a choice about how to implement the side-splitting method for their analysis.","[Tu, Yu-Kang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tu, Yu-Kang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Med, 17 Xu Zhou Rd, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Tu, YK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Med, 17 Xu Zhou Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",yukangtu@ntu.edu.tw,"Tu, Yu-Kang/C-7303-2009","Tu, Yu-Kang/0000-0002-2461-474X",Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 103-2314-B-002-032-MY3],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This study was partly funded by a grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (grant no.

This consistency property severely restricts the set of admissible inequality measures. We show that, within a more general setting of separate measures for attainments and shortfalls, the consistency property is a combination of two conditions. The first is a compelling rationality condition that says that the attainment measure should rank attainment distributions as the shortfall measure ranks shortfall distributions. The second is an overly demanding condition that says that the attainment measure and the shortfall measure should be identical. By dropping the latter condition, the restrictions on the admissible inequality measures disappear.

The asymptotics is based on a study of the volatility as a process of the model parameters. The proof makes use of stochastic recurrence equations for this random function and uses exponential inequalities to localize the problem. Our results show why the asymptotics for this specification is quite complex although it is a rather standard parametric model. Nevertheless, our theory does not yet treat all standard specifications of the mean function. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite growing efforts to engage patients in research and regulatory activities, the pharmaceutical industry has yet to maximize patient involvement in the drug development process. Objective: To gain a better understanding of the present state of patient involvement in drug development. Methods: Through a semistructured interview methodology, we sought to identify opportunities, barriers, and examples of patient involvement in the drug development process. Telephone interviews were conducted with six senior leaders of evidence generation within the pharmaceutical industry and four patients. These interviews were supplemented with interviews with a research funder, a regulator, a patient advocacy group, and a caregiver. Results: Although our interviewees spoke of the potential benefits of aligning research around the needs of patients, there were few examples they could share to suggest this was occurring at scale. A number of barriers were identified including the added burden associated with adverse event reporting, concerns about patient representativeness or their ability to participate in drug development conversations, and the costs in time and resources involved relative to returns on investment. Conclusions: As health care systems continue to evolve and establish patients as the primary stakeholder in their health care decision making, the pharmaceutical industry will need to be innovative to demonstrate the value of their products relative to the outcomes experienced by patients. Pharmaceutical companies should recognize the value of involving patients across the entire product life cycle and work to transform present perceptions and practices throughout their organizations.","[Lowe, Maria M.; Blaser, David A.; Wicks, Paul] PatientsLikeMe, 160 2nd St, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Arcona, Steve; Ko, John; Sasane, Rahul] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",Novartis,"Lowe, MM (通讯作者)，PatientsLikeMe, 160 2nd St, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA.",mlowe@patientslikeme.com,"Wicks, Paul/C-6128-2011","Wicks, Paul/0000-0002-2293-9284",Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis),"This work was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

In the standard model of tax evasion without moral costs, higher-income taxpayers evade more, relative to their incomes, than lower-income taxpayers, and evasion makes the tax system regressive. With moral costs, equity of the tax system depends on the degree of morality. As the level of morality in society increases, it increases moral costs of evasion and evasion become inferior. Higher-income taxpayers evade less and pay more taxes, and evasion makes the tax system progressive for a high level of morality. The opposite holds true and evasion makes the tax system regressive for a low level of morality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) recent decision not to recommend bevacizumab for advanced ovarian cancer was not based on evidence related to the unlicensed lower dosage (7.5 mg/kg) of the drug despite its use in the English National Health Service (NHS) and the ICON7 trial. Objective: To report on the findings of an analysis that considered whether the lower dose is cost-effective. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis is assessed from the perspective of the English NHS and health outcomes expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The analysis focuses on a clinically predefined high-risk subgroup of the ICON7 trial. The price at which the lower dose of bevacizumab could be considered cost-effective for the English NHS is presented for a range of scenarios to inform decisions about price negotiations by international health systems. Results: In the base-case analysis, bevacizumab has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 48,975 pound per additional QALY, which is above NICE's standard cost-effectiveness threshold (20,000- pound 30,000 pound per QALY). The official price of bevacizumab in 2013 was between 2.31 pound and 2.63 pound per milligram. A price reduction of between 46% and 67%, dependent on the NICE threshold, would be required for the product to be cost-effective in the high-risk subgroup. Conclusions: The lower dose of bevacizumab for advanced ovarian cancer is not cost-effective based on the product's list price and using NICE's cost-effectiveness thresholds. Significant price discounts would be needed to make the drug affordable to the NHS.","[Hinde, Sebastian; Epstein, David; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Epstein, David] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Granada, Spain; [Cook, Adrian; Embleton, Andrew] UCL, Med Res Council Clin Trials Unit, London, England; [Perren, Timothy] St James Univ Hosp, St James Inst Oncol, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Granada; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; University of London; University College London; Saint James's University Hospital,"Hinde, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Sebastian.hinde@york.ac.uk,"Epstein, David/I-2839-2019; Perren, Timothy/D-5387-2013","Epstein, David/0000-0002-2275-0916; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Hinde, Sebastian/0000-0002-7117-4142; Perren, Timothy/0000-0001-8472-8856; Embleton-Thirsk, Andrew/0000-0001-9402-8132",Medical Research Council (MRC) [ICON7]; Roche,Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Roche(Roche Holding),"This work was funded as part of ICON7, an Medical Research Council (MRC)-sponsored, academic led, and Roche-supported trial to investigate the use of bevacizumab and to support licensing.",,22,19,20,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2016,19.0,4.0,,,,,431,439,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.01.013,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DO9GU,27325335.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378094200017,0

For many adults walking is the only regular physical activity. We use a sample of nearly 1 million people in 323 small areas in England between 2005 and 2011 matched to quarterly crime data at the small area level. Within area variation identifies the causal effect of local violent crime on walking and a difference-in-difference analysis of two high-profile crimes corroborates our results. We find a significant deterrent effect of violent crime on walking that translates into a drop in overall physical activity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A joint central limit theorem for the LS estimators of both the VAR slope parameters as well as the unconditional innovation variance parameters is obtained from a weak vector autoregressive moving average model set-up recently proposed in the literature. Our results are important for correct inference on VAR statistics that depend both on the VAR slope and the variance parameters as e.g. in structural impulse responses. We also show that wild and pairwise bootstrap schemes fail in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity if inference on (functions) of the unconditional variance parameters is of interest because they do not correctly replicate the relevant fourth moments' structure of the innovations. In contrast, the residual-based moving block bootstrap results in asymptotically valid inference. We illustrate the practical implications of our theoretical results by providing simulation evidence on the finite sample properties of different inference methods for impulse response coefficients. Our results point out that estimation uncertainty may increase dramatically in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity. Moreover, most inference methods are likely to understate the true estimation uncertainty substantially in finite samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: In April 2013, 3397 US women, aged 40 to 69 years, completed an online survey that included 30 paired comparisons. Specifically, respondents were shown two menopausal symptoms described using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and asked, Which do you prefer? From their choices, we estimated a generalized linear model to assess the values women place on symptom relief in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Approximately half the respondents (1753 of 3397 [52%]) always preferred a reduced lifespan (up to 90 days) instead of experiencing menopausal symptoms at their worst for 30 days. For most of the symptoms (248 of 263 [94%]), including low-grade events, QALYs were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The value women placed on relief ranged widely by symptom domain: the relief from depression, problems with memory, headache, pain in abdomen, problems with anger, and vomiting were the most valuable. Conclusions: Overall, the value women place on menopausal symptom relief is surprisingly high. As the first national study to directly ask women about their preferences and to estimate the value of menopausal symptom relief on a QALY scale, this work provides critical evidence for health outcomes research in midlife women and can be applied in the evaluation of treatments that reduce or eliminate menopausal symptoms. This work also provides proof-of-concept for an approach to value Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events responses on a QALY scale.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Hlth Outcomes & Behav, Tampa, FL USA; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Mitchell, Sandra A.] NCI, Outcomes Res Branch, Healthcare Delivery Res Program, Div Canc Control & Populat Sci, Rockville, MD USA",H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI),"Craig, BM (通讯作者)，H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, MRC CANCONT, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",benjamin.craig@moffitt.org,,"Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316",Dr. Craig's support account at Moffitt Cancer Center,Dr. Craig's support account at Moffitt Cancer Center,Funding support for this research was provided by Dr. Craig's support account at Moffitt Cancer Center.,,47,15,15,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2016,19.0,2.0,,,,,158,166,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.11.002,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DH8WY,27021749.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373078800006,0

Application of health technology assessment (HTA) prior to healthcare financing decisions can improve the allocative efficiency of scarce resources. However, few CEE countries have a clear roadmap for HTA implementation. Examples from high-income countries may not be directly relevant, as CEE countries cannot allocate so much financial and human resources for substantiating policy decisions with evidence. Our objective was to describe the main HTA implementation scenarios in CEE countries and summarize the most important questions related to capacity building, financing HTA research, process and organizational structure for HTA, standardization of HTA methodology, use of local data, scope of mandatory HTA, decision criteria, and international collaboration in HTA. Although HTA implementation strategies from the region can be relevant examples for other CEE countries with similar cultural environment and economic status, HTA roadmaps are not still fully transferable without taking into account country-specific aspects, such as country size, gross domestic product per capita, major social values, public health priorities, and fragmentation of healthcare financing.

The visual survey in Veneto showed that the disease is present in about 70% of the investigated vineyards, with a general low occurrence of symptomatic plants. However, the increase of the number of symptomatic grapevines in 8 much damaged vineyards was around 25% per year. The virus occurs in more than 80% of the plants.

The test statistic, which is built upon a second order U-process, introduces 'correction terms' based on control functions that purge the endogeneity. The test has a non-standard asymptotic distribution from which asymptotic critical values can directly be derived. Furthermore, the test statistic is extended to accommodate multivariate (exogenous) regressors. Consistency against general alternatives is proved and the finite sample properties of the test are examined in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is used to formally assess the monotonicity of the reservation wage as a declining function of elapsed unemployment duration, which has implications for underlying job search models. This relationship is difficult to measure due to the simultaneity of both variables. Results for UK data indicate that reservation wage functions do in fact not decline monotonically thereby contradicting some partial equilibrium job search models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Due to organic growing the demand for mildew resistance within the same wine profile has increased. Cross breeding can provide such new genotypes which combine traits from different sources by parenthood. Linkage of traits with chromosomes or markers allows to predict some aspects of the phenotype. Equipped with chromosomal assisted selection the development of new varieties could be much easier and faster. On the base of two segregating populations derived from crosses of Gruner Veltliner with Malverina and Seyval blanc we could define correlation of chromosomes with some traits. Mainly ampelographic descriptors and resistance against mildew could be aligned. As a quality parameter of the wine Rotundone analyses were performed and could be attributed to chromosome 5 and 9. Selection supported by the composition of the parental chromosomes enables breeding with some arguments of design. The limits for free choice were the availability of sufficient different genotypes with a broad spectrum of chromosomal combinations. Recently released descendent cultivar Donauveltliner was selected due to the high rate of Traminer alleles.,"[Regner, Ferdinand; Hack, Robert; Nauer, Stefan; Zoech, Barbara] Hohere Bundesiehranstalt & Bundesamt Wein & Obstb, Wiener Str 74, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria",,"Regner, F (通讯作者)，Hohere Bundesiehranstalt & Bundesamt Wein & Obstb, Wiener Str 74, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria.",,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,1,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1014.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701014,0.0,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700014,0

We re-examine this question, augmenting the NYRBS with data from the State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (SYRBS), and use a variety of identification strategies to control for state-level time-varying unmeasured heterogeneity. Consistent with CDJ, we find that PI laws have no effect on minor teen females' abstinence decisions. However, when we exploit additional state policy variation unavailable to CDJ and use non-minor teens as a within-state control group, we find evidence to suggest that PI laws are associated with an increase in the probability that sexually active minor teen females use birth control.

Despite a number of successful applications in high dimensions, it is well known that importance sampling strategies are subject to an exponential growth in variance as the dimension of the integration increases. We solve this problem by recognising that the EIS framework has an offline sequential Monte Carlo interpretation. The particle EIS method is based on non-standard resampling weights that take into account the construction of the importance sampler as a sequential approximation to the state smoothing density. We apply the method for a range of univariate and bivariate stochastic volatility specifications, We also develop a new application of the EIS approach to state space models with Student's t state innovations. Our results show that the particle EIS method strongly outperforms both the standard EIS method and particle filters for likelihood evaluation in high dimensions. We illustrate the efficiency of the method for Bayesian inference using the particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings and importance sampling squared algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The most common form of adulteration is by the addition of apple juice. The adulterated samples can be identified by specific analysis, since apple juice has some compounds that grape has not. A more simplified and assessible way to determine this kind of adulteration is the phlorizin analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Phlorizin is a phenolic compound that has been used to identify adulterations in juices. Besides phlorizin, it can be seen that adulteration by quantifying the levels of sorbitol, present in apples, but absent in healthy grapes. The content of this compounds in grape juices can vary due to the variety of grape and harvest. This study aimed to analyze phlorizin and sorbitol, in 141 experimental samples of Vitis labrusca grape juices, harvest 2016, of 9 varieties and 43 commercial samples (different vintages).

Traditional wine producing countries have experienced strong, recent growth in new categories like flavoured wines, while New world countries create publicity for such innovations and traditional categories like organic wines. Ironically, the amount of publicity afforded such categories is contradictory to market trends, which illustrate growth in categories like Prosecco and red wine blends. Categories like organic, natural and orange wine have numerous endorsers, but actual sales figures suggest such wines are yet to capture the interest of the greater market. With this divergence between publicity and market behaviour being echoing across the globe, wine producers need to be able to determine whether a new category represents an opportunity to consider a strategic change in business direction. Although publicity has been shown to effect a change in wine consumer behaviour, the conditions surrounding a new wine category's growth from fad, trend and fashion are analysed for the purpose of strategic management. This study extends findings from historical narratives through the use of empirical evidence from both European and New World wine markets. The evidence is contrasted with a contemporary phenomenological experience expressed by influencers within both of those markets, as a means to illustrate the disparity between the contemporary appeal of popular publicity, and the challenges faced by wine producers having to respond to the market reality. This study illustrates that implementing strategic decisions on whether to engage in a new trend, depends on the innovative category being consistent with existing strategy and able to impact the market without reliance on external publicity.","[Wilson, Damien] Sonoma State Univ, Wine Business Inst, 1801 E Cotati Ave, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA",California State University System; Sonoma State University,"Wilson, D (通讯作者)，Sonoma State Univ, Wine Business Inst, 1801 E Cotati Ave, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA.",,,,,,,,20,4,4,3,10,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3008.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703008,0.0,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700086,0

We investigate the inference without imposing stationary conditions on the target multivariate time series, the regressors and the underlying factors. Furthermore we deal with the endogeneity that there exist correlations between the observed regressors and the unobserved factors. We also consider the model with nonlinear regression term which can be approximated by a linear regression function with a large number of regressors. The convergence rates for the estimators of regression coefficients, the number of factors, factor loading space and factors are established under the settings when the dimension of time series and the number of regressors may both tend to infinity together with the sample size.

The expansion of PCI treatment for AMI patients raises two questions: How did PCI utilization rates vary across European regions, and which healthcare system and regional characteristic variables correlated with the utilization rate? Were the differences in use of PCI associated with differences in outcome, operationalized as 30-day mortality? We obtained our results from a dataset based on the administrative information systems of the populations of seven European countries. PCI rates were highest in the Netherlands, followed by Sweden and Hungary. The probability of receiving PCI was highest in regions with their own PCI facilities and in healthcare systems with activity-based reimbursement systems. Thirty-day mortality rates differed considerably between the countries with the highest rates in Hungary, Scotland, and Finland. Mortality was lowest in Sweden and Norway. The associations between PCI and mortality were remarkable in all age groups and across most countries. Despite extensive risk adjustment, we interpret the associations both as effects of selection and treatments. We observed a lower effect of PCI in the higher age groups in Hungary.

Using residents of Alberta as a control group in a difference-in-differences framework, we find visual and regression-based evidence that Ontario's cellphone ban significantly reduced overall and handheld cellphone use. We also find that the policies significantly increased hands-free cellphone use. The reductions in overall and handheld use are driven exclusively by women, whereas the increases in hands-free use are much larger for men. Our results provide the first direct evidence that cellphone bans have the unintended effect of inducing substitution to hands-free devices.

This paper extends Pesaran and Shin's (1998) autoregressive distributed-lag approach into quantile regression by jointly analyzing short-run dynamics and long-run cointegrating relationships across a range of quantiles. We derive the asymptotic theory and provide a general package in which the model can be estimated and tested within and across quantiles. We further affirm our theoretical results by Monte Carlo simulations. The main utilities of this analysis are demonstrated through the empirical application to the dividend policy in the US.

While historically, researchers have found evidence of volume offsetting, more recent studies have called into question its magnitude and existence. This study is the first to propose and empirically evaluate an alternative hypothesis of offsetting, namely the alteration of billed or provided services as a means of intensity offsetting'. Evaluating both forms of offsetting, it finds strong evidence of intensity offsetting and little to no evidence of volume offsetting. Simulating a 10% reduction in the Medicare fee schedule, this study estimates that across different procedures between 22% and 59% of a fee reduction will be offset through alterations in service intensity.

The risk estimates from these models are used to determine the daily capital charges (DCC) and associated capital costs of ADIs, depending in part on the number of previous violations, whereby realized losses exceed the estimated VaR In this paper we define risk management in terms of choosing sensibly from a variety of risk models and discuss the optimal selection of the risk models. Previous approaches to model selection for predicting VaR proposed combining alternative risk models and ranking such models on the basis of average DCC, or other quantiles of its distribution. These methods are based on the first moment, or specific quantiles of the DCC distribution, and supported by restrictive evaluation functions. In this paper, we consider robust uniform rankings of models over large classes of loss functions that may reflect different weights and concerns over different intervals of the distribution of losses and DCC. The uniform rankings are based on recently developed statistical tests of stochastic dominance (SD). The SD tests are illustrated using the prices and returns of VIX futures. The empirical findings show that the tests of SD can rank different pairs of models to a statistical degree of confidence, and that the alternative (recentered) SD tests are in general agreement.

We provide bounds on the computational resources needed to transform a game from one form of representation to another one.

Objective: We evaluated the costeffectiveness of rTMS versus pharmacotherapy for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder who have failed at least two adequate courses of antidepressant medications. Methods: A 3-year Markov microsimulation model with 2-monthly cycles was used to compare the costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of rTMS and a mix of antidepressant medications (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). The model synthesized data sourced from published literature, national cost reports, and expert opinions. Incremental cost utility ratios were calculated, and uncertainty of the results was assessed using univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with pharmacotherapy, rTMS is a dominant/cost-effective alternative for patients with treatment-resistant depressive disorder. The model predicted that QALYs gained with rTMS were higher than those gained with antidepressant medications (1.25 vs. 1.18 QALYs) while costs were slightly less (AU $31,003 vs. AU $31,190). In the Australian context, at the willingness-to-pay threshold of AU $50,000 per QALY gain, the probability that rTMS was cost-effective was 73%. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the superiority of rTMS in terms of value for money compared with antidepressant medications. Conclusions: Although both pharmacotherapy and rTMS are clinically effective treatments for major depressive disorder, rTMS is shown to outperform antidepressants in terms of cost-effectiveness for patients who have failed at least two adequate courses of antidepressant medications.

Methods: A probabilistic decision-analytic Markov model was developed with three health states (poor health, average health, and death) based on a cutoff score of the Physical Component Summary of the short-form 36 health survey. To assess the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY), a societal perspective was adopted. The model consisted of cycles of 3 months and a time horizon of 4 years. Data for the model were derived from a randomized controlled trial, in which 162 patients with UPS were randomized either to cognitive-behavioral group training or to the wait-list control. Data were assessed at baseline and after the training of 3 months or after a wait list period of 3 months. In addition, the training group was followed in an uncontrolled phase and assessed at 3 months and 1 year after the training. Results: After 4 years, the group training was in terms of cost-effectiveness dominant compared with the wait-list control; there was a positive effect of 0.06 QALYs and a (sic)828 reduction in costs. The cost-effectiveness improved with a longer time horizon. A threshold of (sic)30,000/QALY was passed after 18 months. The group training was cost saving after 33 months. Conclusions: Cognitive-behavioral group training is a cost-effective treatment compared with the wait-list control for patients with UPS.

Evidence from Medicare Part D,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Medicare Part D; CESD score; Difference-in-difference; Antidepressants; Prescription drug coverage,NONADHERENCE; DEPRESSION; IMPACT; IMPLEMENTATION; DISORDERS; INSURANCE; ADULTS,"The introduction of the Medicare Prescription Drug program (Part D) in 2006 resulted in a significant increase in access to coverage for older adults in the U.S. Several studies have documented the impact of this program on prescription drug utilization, expenditures and medication adherence among older adults. However, few studies have evaluated the extent to which these changes have affected the health of seniors. In this study we use data from the Health and Retirement Study to identify the impact of the Medicare Part D program on mental health. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find that the program significantly reduced depressive symptoms among older adults. We explore the mechanisms through which this effect operates and evaluate heterogeneity in impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both lagged dependent variables and conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form are allowed in the model. We estimate the model under the null hypothesis of linearity to obtain the restricted residuals which are then used to construct the test statistic. We show that after being appropriately centered and standardized, the test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed under both the null hypothesis and a sequence of Pitman local alternatives by using the concept of conditional strong mixing that was recently introduced by Prakasa Rao (2009). To improve the finite sample performance, we propose a bootstrap procedure to obtain the bootstrap p-value. A small set of Monte Carlo simulations illustrates that our test performs well in finite samples. An application to an economic growth panel dataset indicates significant nonlinear relationships between economic growth, initial income level and capital accumulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In its most recent funding announcement to state and local health department grantees, CDC required that health departments allocate the majority of funds to four HIV prevention interventions: HIV testing, prevention with HIV-positives and their partners, condom distribution and policy initiatives. Objective We conducted a systematic review of the published literature to determine the extent of the cost-effectiveness evidence for each of those interventions. Methodology We searched for US-based studies published through October 2012. The studies that qualified for inclusion contained original analyses that reported costs per quality-adjusted life-year saved, life-year saved, HIV infection averted, or new HIV diagnosis. For each study, paired reviewers performed a detailed review and data extraction. We reported the number of studies related to each intervention and summarized key cost-effectiveness findings according to intervention type. Costs were converted to 2011 US dollars. Results Of the 50 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 33 related to HIV testing, 15 assessed prevention with HIV-positives and partners, three reported on condom distribution, and one reported on policy initiatives. Methodologies and cost-effectiveness metrics varied across studies and interventions, making them difficult to compare. Conclusion Our review provides an updated summary of the published evidence of cost effectiveness of four key HIV prevention interventions recommended by CDC. With the exception of testing-related interventions, including partner services, where economic evaluations suggest that testing often can be cost effective, more cost-effectiveness research is needed to help guide the most efficient use of HIV prevention funds.","[Huang, Ya-Lin A.; Lasry, Arielle; Hutchinson, Angela B.; Sansom, Stephanie L.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div HIV AIDS Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Preven, 1600 Clifton Rd NE,Mailstop E-48, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA,"Huang, YLA (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div HIV AIDS Prevent, Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Preven, 1600 Clifton Rd NE,Mailstop E-48, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",yhuang@cdc.gov,,,,,,,69,14,16,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Nutritional support may reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in hospitalised patients who are at risk of pressure ulcer and malnutrition. Objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nutritional support in preventing pressure ulcers in high-risk hospitalised patients, and to assess the value of further research to inform the decision to implement this intervention using value of information analysis (VOI). Methods The analysis was from the perspective of Queensland Health, Australia using a decision model with evidence derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Resources were valued using 2014 prices and the time horizon of the analysis was one year. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate net monetary benefits (NB) and to calculate VOI measures. Results Compared with standard hospital diet, nutritional support was cost saving at AU$425 per patient, and more effective with an average 0.005 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. At a willingness-to-pay of AU$50,000 per QALY, the incremental NB was AU$675 per patient, with a probability of 87 % that nutritional support is cost-effective. The expected value of perfect information was AU$5 million and the expected value of perfect parameter information was highest for the relative risk of developing a pressure ulcer at AU$2.5 million. For a future trial investigating the relative effectiveness of the interventions, the expected net benefit of research would be maximised at AU$100,000 with 1,200 patients in each arm if nutritional support was perfectly implemented. The opportunity cost of withholding the decision to implement the intervention until the results of the future study are available would be AU$14 million. Conclusions Nutritional support is cost-effective in preventing pressure ulcers in high-risk hospitalised patients compared with standard diet. Future research to reduce decision uncertainty is worthwhile; however, given the opportunity losses associated with delaying the implementation, implement and research'' is the approach recommended for this intervention.","[Tuffaha, Haitham W.; Chaboyer, Wendy; Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Tuffaha, Haitham W.; Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Roberts, Shelley] Griffith Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Chaboyer, Wendy] Griffith Univ, Res Ctr Hlth Practice Innovat, NHMRC Ctr Res Excellence Nursing Intervent Hospit, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Tuffaha, HW (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",haitham.tuffaha@griffith.edu.au,"Chaboyer, Wendy/F-9588-2018; Tuffaha, Haitham W/P-2676-2016; Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021; Gordon, Louisa/P-1427-2016","Tuffaha, Haitham W/0000-0003-2993-3480; Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Gordon, Louisa/0000-0002-3159-4249; Chaboyer, Wendy/0000-0001-9528-7814; Roberts, Shelley/0000-0002-7779-8415",,,,,51,14,14,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

It takes into account that the predicted market shares are approximated by Monte Carlo integration with R draws and that the observed market shares are approximated from a sample of N consumers. The estimated parameters are root T consistent and asymptotically normal as long as R and N grow fast enough relative to T. Both approximations yield additional bias and variance terms in the asymptotic expansion. I propose a bias corrected estimator and a variance adjustment that takes the leading terms into account. Monte Carlo simulations show that these adjustments should be used in applications to avoid severe undercoverage caused by the approximation errors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast for a large class of second order nonstationary time series, including locally stationary time series, this property does not hold. In this paper these starkly differing properties are used to define a global test for stationarity based on the OFT of a vector time series. It is shown that the test statistic under the null of stationarity asymptotically has a chi-squared distribution, whereas under the alternative of local stationarity asymptotically it has a noncentral chi-squared distribution. Further, if the time series is Gaussian and stationary, the test statistic is pivotal. However, in many econometric applications, the assumption of Gaussianity can be too strong, but under weaker conditions the test statistic involves an unknown variance that is extremely difficult to directly estimate from the data. To overcome this issue, a scheme to estimate the unknown variance, based on the stationary bootstrap, is proposed. The properties of the stationary bootstrap under both stationarity and nonstationarity are derived. These results are used to show consistency of the bootstrap estimator under stationarity and to derive the power of the test under nonstationarity. The method is illustrated with some simulations. The test is also used to test for stationarity of FTSE 100 and DAX 30 stock indexes from January 2011 December 2012. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To elicit through a discrete choice experiment the Belgian adult population's (18-75 years; N = 750) preferences for prioritizing health care and investigate whether these preferences are different for prevention versus cure. Methods: We used a Bayesian 0-efficient design with partial profiles, which enables considering a large number of attributes and interaction effects. We included the following attributes: 1) type of intervention (cure vs. prevention), 2) effectiveness, 3) risk of adverse effects, 4) severity of illness, 5) link between the illness and patient's health-related lifestyle, 6) time span between intervention and effect, and 7) patient's age group. Results: All attributes were statistically significant contributors to the social value of a health care program, with patient's lifestyle and age being the most influential ones. Interaction effects were found, showing that prevention was preferred to cure for disease in young adults, as well as for severe and lethal disease in people of any age. However, substantial differences were found in the preferences of respondents from different age groups, with different lifestyles and different health states. Conclusions: Our study suggests that according to the Belgian public, contextual factors of health gains such as patient's age and health related lifestyle should be considered in priority setting decisions. The studies, however, revealed substantial disagreement in opinion between different population subgroups.","[Luyten, Jeroen; Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Luyten, Jeroen] Univ Leuven, Inst Philosophy, Ctr Econ & Eth, Leuven, Belgium; [Luyten, Jeroen] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kessels, Roselinde; Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Fac Appl Econ, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Kessels, Roselinde; Goos, Peter] Univ Antwerp, StatUa Ctr Stat, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Goos, Peter] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econometr, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Goos, Peter] Univ Leuven, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Biosyst, Leuven, Belgium; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ New S Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; KU Leuven; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Luyten, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",jeroen.luyten@uantwerpen.be,"Luyten, Jeroen/V-1124-2019; Goos, Peter/AAP-7890-2020; Kessels, Roselinde/N-8479-2016; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Luyten, Jeroen/0000-0003-1770-6352; Kessels, Roselinde/0000-0002-4534-0047; Luyten, Jeroen/0000-0001-6398-4025; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Goos, Peter/0000-0002-3854-6506",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [G098911N]; Pfizer's European HTAcademy prize competition,Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Pfizer's European HTAcademy prize competition,"Source of financial support: We acknowledge funding from the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO, project no G098911N and Roselinde Kessels' postdoctoral fellowship) and Pfizer's European HTAcademy prize competition (2011).",,73,51,53,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,224,233,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.12.007,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773558.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300013,0

We focus on drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria in middle and low-income countries (MLICs), with robustness checks to other therapeutic categories and the full income range of countries. We examine the effects of per capita income, income dispersion, competition from originator and generic substitutes, and whether the drugs are sold to retail pharmacies versus tendered procurement by non-government organizations. The cross-national income elasticity of prices is 0.27 across the full income range of countries but is 0.0-0.10 between MLICs, implying that drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income countries. Within-country income inequality contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Although generics are priced roughly 30% lower than originators on average, the variance is large. Additional generic competitors only weakly affect prices, plausibly because generic quality uncertainty leads to competition on brand rather than price. Tendered procurement that imposes quality standards attracts multinational generic suppliers and significantly reduces prices of originator and generic drugs, compared with their respective prices to retail pharmacies.

We use data from South Korea, where daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and parents-in-law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a parent-in-law with functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that parent-in-law, but a parent-in-law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter-in-law's health. We compare results for the daughter-in-law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of the instruments for the daughter sample.

These two approaches can be subject to different sorts of bias: Prospective evaluations may be biased by scale recaljbration (a changed understanding of the response scale), and retrospective evaluations may be biased by recall bias (a wrong assessment of former QOL). Methods: On the basis of an analysis of the literature, we present an overview on possible biases in prospective and retrospective measurement of QOL and how these biases are named and defined in the literature. Results: The definitions of different biases are inconsistent. Many authors do not clearly distinguish measurement bias from true change. furthermore, some consider only scale recalibration or only recall bias. Conclusions: Much of the current discussion on bias in prospective and retrospective QOL measurement suffers from unclear definitions, especially of response shift and recall bias, or from neglecting one of the possible biases. We suggest more elaborate definitions for different types of bias and recommend taking both kinds of bias into consideration when measuring change in QOL. The relevance of the different biases depends on the type of study, and so either prospective or retrospective assessment may be more appropriate.

As the higher return may result from the momentum effect, we further compare the returns of the net inflow of cash both in good state and bad state by controlling the momentum factor.

The simulation results show that Chinese import and export trade and functional income have a positive relationship with the exchange rate fluctuations. The rising exchange rate is more favorable to the increase of imports and exports in services trade. The decreasing exchange rate is more conductive to the increase of imports and exports in agriculture trade and industry trade.

This introduces new sources of uncertainty (less important in a randomized controlled trial than in daily practice), which may affect priorities for further research. Objectives: This article focuses on determining the impact of including these uncertainties at the time a decision is made, and whether more complex models are always needed to address prioritization of additional research. Methods: We constructed a typical decision model for chronic progressive diseases with four health states and parameters related to transition and exacerbation probabilities, costs, and utilities. Different scenarios are built on the basis of three additional uncertainties: persistence, compliance, and broadening of indication. Persistence refers to treatment duration. Compliance describes the fraction of treatment benefit obtained because of not taking the medication as prescribed. Broadening of indication reflects a shift in the severity distribution at treatment start These uncertainties were parameterized in the model and included in the value-of-information analysis. Results: The most important parameters were transition probabilities. Broadening of indication had little impact on the overall uncertainty. Compliance and persistence were important when establishing priorities for further research. Major differences with respect to the reference scenario were due to the parameterization of compliance in the decision model. Conclusions: The usual practice of modeling only randomized controlled trial data at the time the decision on conditional reimbursement is made can lead to wrong decisions. Additional uncertainties arising from outcomes studies should be anticipated at an early stage and included in the model because this can have a strong impact on the prioritization of further research.

The factors of credibility include the features of sources, real-name certification, fans' amount, attention's amount, sources' professional degree, the years of application and intimacy between generators and other users. So the credibility algorithm of information sources is constructed. The algorithm is more important to compute the credibility of information source, which is a very important parameter of the information dissemination model of micro-blog community based on SIR model, and supply the theoretical tool of information credibility in Micro-blog.","[Wang Bo; Zhang Yu-wang; Shao Li] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Wang, B (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303069]; Humanities and Social Science Foundation Youth Project of Ministry of Education of China [13YJC630158, 14YJC860022]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2012M510932]; natural science foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China [F201209]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Foundation Youth Project of Ministry of Education of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); natural science foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71303069), the Humanities and Social Science Foundation Youth Project of Ministry of Education of China (13YJC630158, 14YJC860022), The China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (2012M510932), The natural science foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China(F201209)",,38,1,1,2,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,142,146,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600020,0

Thus, in most cases, they admit several resolute refinements, each of them naturally interpreted as a tie-breaking rule, satisfying different properties. In this paper we look for classes of social choice correspondences which admit resolute refinements fulfilling suitable versions of anonymity and neutrality. In particular, supposing that individuals and alternatives have been exogenously partitioned into subcommittees and subclasses, we find out arithmetical conditions on the sizes of subcommittees and subclasses that are necessary and sufficient for making any social choice correspondence which is efficient, anonymous with respect to subcommittees, neutral with respect to subclasses and possibly immune to the reversal bias admit a resolute refinement sharing the same properties.

To overcome the innate endogeneity, we propose a generalized Yule-Walker estimation method which applies the least squares estimation to a Yule-Walker equation. The asymptotic theory is developed under the setting that both the sample size and the number of locations (or panels) tend to infinity under a general setting for stationary and alpha-mixing processes, which includes spatial autoregressive panel data models driven by i.i.d. innovations as special cases.

However, functional data observed over time with serial dependence remains a less studied area. Motivated by Bosq (2000), who first introduced the functional autoregressive models, we propose a convolutional functional autoregressive model, where the function at time t is a result of the sum of convolutions of the past functions and a set of convolution functions, plus a noise process, mimicking the vector autoregressive process. It provides an intuitive and direct interpretation of the dynamics of a stochastic process. Instead of principal component analysis commonly used in functional data analysis, we adopt a sieve estimation procedure based on B-spline approximation of the convolution functions. We establish convergence rate of the proposed estimator, and investigate its theoretical properties. The model building, model validation, and prediction procedures are also developed.

The Urolift System uses implants to retract the prostatic lobe away from the urethral lumen. The clinical evidence used in the manufacturer's submission shows that Urolift is effective for the treatment of BPH. Urolift delivers a weighted mean International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) improvement of between 9.22 and 11.82 points. These Urolift improvements are greater than a published 'marked improvement' in IPSS score of 8.80. Comparison with randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) and HoLEP (Holmium Laser Enucleation of Prostate) show that Urolift does not yield better clinical outcomes from baseline compared to TURP and HoLEP in terms of IPSS, QoL (Quality of Life) and Qmax (maximum urinary flow). However, Urolift appears to have the advantage in terms of minimal and mild complications, and this may be of interest to patients and urologists. The economic case for Urolift was made using a very detailed and thorough de novo cost model. The base case posed by the manufacturer placed Urolift at almost cost-neutral (3 pound cost incurring, based on 2014 prices) compared to TURP, and 418 pound cost incurring compared to HoLEP. In an additional scenario comparing day-case Urolift with in-patient TURP, the estimated per-patient savings with Urolift were 286 pound compared with monopolar TURP (mTURP) and 159 pound compared with bipolar TURP (BiTURP). NICE guidance MTG26 recommends that the case for adoption of Urolift was supported by the evidence, when implemented in a day-case setting.","[Ray, Alistair; Morgan, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Wilkes, Antony; Carolan-Rees, Grace] Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Carter, Kimberley] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England",Cardiff University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Ray, A (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",alistair.ray@wales.nhs.uk,"Carolan-Rees, Grace/H-6169-2012","Ray, Alistair/0000-0001-6728-6187; Morgan, Helen E/0000-0003-2470-9746; Carolan-Rees, Grace/0000-0003-1787-2123",,,,,36,21,22,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The ICEpop CAPability instrument for adults (ICECAP-A) and the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) are measures potentially suitable for the economic evaluation of treatments for substance use disorders. Evidence for their validity in this context is, however, lacking. Objectives: To assess the construct validity of the ICECAP-A and the EQ-5D-5L in terms of convergent and discriminative validity and sensitivity to change on the basis of standard clinical measures (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure, Treatment Outcomes Profile, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Leeds Dependence Questionnaire, and Social Satisfaction Questionnaire). Methods: A secondary analysis of pilot trial data for heroin users in opiate substitution treatment was conducted. Baseline convergence with clinical measures was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Discriminative validity was assessed using one-way analysis of variance and stepwise regressions. Sensitivity to changes in clinical indicators was assessed at 3 and 12 months using the standardized response mean statistic and parametric and nonparametric testing. Results: Both measures had the same level of construct validity, except for clinical indicators of well-being, for which the ICECAP-A performed better. The ICECAP-A was sensitive to changes in both health and well-being indicators. The EQ-5D-5L had lower levels of sensitivity to change, and a ceiling effect (27%), particularly evident in the dimensions of self-care (89%), mobility (75%), and usual activities (72%). Conclusions: The findings support the construct validity of both measures, but the ICECAP-A gives more attention to broader impacts and is more sensitive to change. The ICECAP-A shows promise in evaluating treatments for substance use disorders for which recovery is the desired outcome.","[Goranitis, Ilias; Frew, Emma] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Public Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Coast, Joanna] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Day, Ed; Copello, Alex; Seddon, Jennifer; Bennett, Carmel] Birmingham & Solihull Mental Hlth NHS Fdn Trust, Res & Innovat Dept, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Day, Ed] Kings Coll London, Addict Dept, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Copello, Alex] Univ Birmingham, Sch Psychol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Freemantle, Nick] UCL, Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, London, England",University of Birmingham; University of Bristol; University of London; King's College London; University of Birmingham; University of London; University College London,"Frew, E (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Public Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",E.Frew@bharn.ac.uk,"Day, Ed/E-2798-2015; Frew, Emma/AAO-5141-2021","Day, Ed/0000-0002-7106-7013; Frew, Emma/0000-0002-5462-1158; Copello, Alex/0000-0003-3788-7197; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166; Seddon, Jennifer/0000-0001-9040-0902",NIHR under its Research for Patient Benefit programme [PB-PG-0610-22392]; National Institute for Health Research [PB-PG-0610-22392] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [PB-PG-0610-22392] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),NIHR under its Research for Patient Benefit programme; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This study was funded by the NIHR under its Research for Patient Benefit programme (grant reference no.

To account for the burden of treating Medicaid patients, providers claim that they must cost-shift by raising the rates of individuals covered by private insurance. Previous investigations of cost-shifting has produced mixed results. In this paper, I exploit a disabled Medicaid expansion where crowd-out was complete to investigate cost-shifting. I find that hospitals reduce the charge rates of the privately insured. Given that Medicaid is expanding in several states under the Affordable Care Act, these results may alleviate cost-shifting concerns of the reform. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Predictions from theory provide a means of learning about the roles of information, self interest and regret in explaining differences in attitudes to legalization between those who currently use, those who have used in the past and those who have never used. Our empirical investigation suggests that users have a greater awareness of cannabis not being as harmful as abstainers think it is. This may explain why individuals are more inclined to be in favor of legalizing cannabis once they have used it themselves.

In this note, we provide a new and simple proof of Afriat's Theorem, the explicit steps of which help to more deeply understand the driving force behind one of the more curious features of the result itself, namely that a concave rationalization is without loss of generality in a classical finite data setting. Our proof stresses the importance of the non-uniqueness of a utility representation along with the finiteness of the data set in ensuring the existence of a concave utility function that rationalizes the data.

The ACC/AHA guidelines development process has evolved considerably over the last 30 or more years. Guidelines now focus on clinical conditions, such as angina, instead of procedures, such as bypass surgery. There is a formal organizational structure, with dedicated staff, a standing committee on practice guidelines, and specific panels of volunteer experts on each topic. This process tightly manages conflicts of interest and strives for evidence-based, as opposed to opinion-based, guidelines, with a clear citation of the supporting evidence. Traditional clinical guidelines consider only what is best for the individual patient, and have explicitly not considered the cost to society. Nevertheless, in many guidelines development meetings, high cost was implicitly considered: if a procedure was extremely costly, the evidence needed to be very strong. The Guidelines Committee recognized that cost considerations ought to be made more transparent, and that the evidence on economic value should be explicitly cited when available. These considerations were formalized by a recent white paper on incorporating economic considerations into ACC/AHA guidelines. In considering value, it is necessary to assess the quality of the evidence as well as to define levels of value. The next ACC/AHA guideline will incorporate value as a part of its recommendations. This will be an evidence-based process in which published economic assessments relating to key questions will be reviewed.","[Hlatky, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, HRP Redwood Bldg,Room 150,259 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Hlatky, MA (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Sch Med, HRP Redwood Bldg,Room 150,259 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hlatky@stanford.edu,,"Hlatky, Mark/0000-0003-4686-9441",,,,,3,10,10,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,516,519,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.019,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565266.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600003,0

Conjoint analysis methods, particularly discrete choice experiments (DCEs), have been increasingly used to quantify preferences of patients, caregivers, physicians, and other stakeholders. Recent consensus-based guidance on good research practices, including two recent task force reports from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, has aided in improving the quality of conjoint analyses and DCEs in outcomes research. Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding good research practices for the statistical analysis of data from DCEs persists. There are multiple methods for analyzing DCE data. Understanding the characteristics and appropriate use of different analysis methods is critical to conducting a well-designed DCE study. This report will assist researchers in evaluating and selecting among alternative approaches to conducting statistical analysis of DCE data. We first present a simplistic DCE example and a simple method for using the resulting data. We then present a pedagogical example of a DCE and one of the most common approaches to analyzing data from such a question format conditional logit. We then describe some common alternative methods for analyzing these data and the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative. We present the ESTIMATE checklist, which includes a list of questions to consider when justifying the choice of analysis method, describing the analysis, and interpreting the results.","[Hauber, A.

Physician recommendations of the vaccine are far from universal. Several states have enacted policies that mandate HPV vaccination or distribute educational materials. Objectives To provide policy makers, physicians, and researchers information on the relative importance of physician recommendations and early state-level policies to promote HPV vaccinations among targeted age groups. Methods We first use probit models to determine the strongest correlates of immunization in a nationally representative US sample of teenagers. We then use instrumental variable probit models to determine the direct role that physician recommendations play in vaccination using plausibly exogenous physician encounters that are likely not the result of more health-conscious parents seeking out information on the vaccine. Results We show that children in the targeted age range who are more likely to encounter physicians for reasons other than seeking out the vaccine, such as through mandatory wellness exams or previous asthma diagnoses, are significantly more likely to get the vaccine. There is no consistent evidence that the state policies we analyze have been effective. Conclusion Encouraging recommendations by physicians may be the most effective path toward increasing HPV vaccination. State-level mandates and policies are yet to exhibit effectiveness.","[Moghtaderi, Ali] George Washington Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Adams, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Bolton Hall 802,3210 N Maryland Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",George Washington University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Adams, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Bolton Hall 802,3210 N Maryland Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",sjadams@uwm.edu,,,,,,,38,8,12,2,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Agencies could measure sampling error using established statistical principles, but it is more challenging to measure nonsampling errors. This paper considers error due to survey nonresponse. The standard practice has been to use weights and imputations to implement assumptions that nonresponse is conditionally random. I review modern research deriving interval estimates that make no assumptions about the values of missing data. To demonstrate the implications for official statistics, I use data from the U.S. Current Population Survey to form interval estimates for median household income, the family poverty rate, and the unemployment rate. I then explore some of the middle ground between interval estimation making no assumptions and point estimation assuming that nonresponse is conditionally random. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This is partly not only due to new additions in the list of recommended vaccines but also due to the use of new, safer, but more expensive technologies in vaccine production and distribution. In recent years, many states have mandated that recommended childhood vaccines be covered by private health insurance companies. Currently, there are 33 states with such a mandate. In this paper, I examine whether the introduction of mandates on private insurers affected immunization rates. Using state and time variation, I find that mandates increased the immunization rate for three vaccinesthe diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, polio, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccinesby about 1.8 percentage points. These results may provide a lower bound for the expected effect of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates coverage of childhood vaccines for all private insurers in the USA. I also find evidence that the mandates shifted a significant portion of vaccinations from publicly funded sources to private ones, with a decline in public health clinic visits and an increase in vaccinations at hospitals and doctor's offices.

Prior research agrees that in the first year, CDHPs reduce spending. There is little research and in it results are mixed regarding the impact of CDHPs over the longer term. We add to this literature with an intent-to-treat, difference in -differences analysis of health care spending over up to three years post CDHP offer among 13 million person-years of data from 54 large US firms, half of which offered CDHPs. To strengthen the identification, we balance observables over time within firm, by developing weights through a machine learning algorithm, generalized boosted regression. We find that spending is reduced for those in firms offering CDHPs in all three years post offer relative to firms continuing to offer lower-deductible plans. The reductions are driven by spending decreases in outpatient care and pharmaceuticals, with no evidence of increases in emergency department or inpatient care over the three-year window.

Methods: From the model comprising of seven attributes with three levels, six unique profiles were selected representing process-related factors and health outcomes in Parkinson disease. A Web-based survey (N = 613) was conducted in a general population to estimate process-related utilities using profile-based BWS (case 2), multiprofile-based BWS (case 3), TTO, and VAS. The rank order of the six profiles was compared, convergent validity among methods was assessed, and individual analysis focused on the differentiation between pairs of profiles with methods used. Results: The aggregated health-state utilities for the six treatment profiles were highly comparable for all methods and no rank reversals were identified. On the individual level, the convergent validity between all methods was strong; however, respondents differentiated less in the utility of closely related treatment profiles with a VAS or TTO than with BWS. For TTO and VAS, this resulted in nonsignificant differences in mean utilities for closely related treatment profiles. Conclusions: This study suggests that all methods are equally able to measure process-related utility when the aim is to estimate the overall value of treatments. On an individual level, such as in shared decision making, BWS allows for better prioritization of treatment alternatives, especially if they are closely related. The decision-making problem and the need for explicit trade-off between attributes should determine the choice for a method.","[Weernink, Marieke G. M.; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

Antimicrobial activities against spoilage wine microorganisms were carried out in both culture media and wines. In addition, in vitro simulations (static and dynamic) were conducted to monitor the passage of Ag-NPs through the buco-gastrointestinal tract and also to assess their effects on the gut microbiota and intestinal epithelial cells. Both Ag-NPs proved to be highly efficient for the control of wine undesirable bacteria in culture media and microvinification assays, and to a lesser extent, for reducing Brettanomyces populations in wine. Furthermore, undigested Ag-NPs as their corresponding digests after gastrointestinal simulation were not toxic to intestinal microbiota either epithelial cells, at least at the conditions used in these experiments.","[Gil-Sanchez, I.; Bernaldez, A.; Tatnargo, A.; Cueva, C.; Gonzalez de Llano, D.; Bartolome, B.; Moreno-Arribas, M.

Methods: We simulated prospective monitoring of a new drug (A) versus an alternative drug (B) with respect to two beneficial and three harmful outcomes. We generated data for 1000 iterations of six scenarios and applied four BRA metrics: number needed to treat and number needed to harm (NNTINNH), incremental net benefit (INB) with maximum acceptable risk, INB with relative-value-adjusted life-years, and INB with quality-adjusted life-years. We determined the proportion of iterations in which the 99% confidence interval for each metric included and excluded the null and we calculated mean time to alerting. Results: With no true difference in any outcome between drugs A and B, the proportion of iterations including the null was lowest for INB with relative-value-adjusted life-years (64%) and highest for INB with quality-adjusted life-years (76%). When drug A was more effective and the drugs were equally safe, all metrics indicated net favorability of A in more than 70% of the iterations. When drug A was safer than drug B, NNTINNH had the highest proportion of iterations indicating net favorability of drug A (65%). Mean time to alerting was similar among methods across the six scenarios. Conclusions: BRA metrics can be useful for identifying net favorability when applied to prospective monitoring of a new drug versus an alternative drug. INB-based approaches similarly outperform unweighted NNTINNH approaches. Time to alerting was similar across approaches.","[Gagne, Joshua J.; Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Choudhry, Niteesh K.; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Rogers, James R.; Schneeweiss, Sebastian] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Gagne, Joshua J.; Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Choudhry, Niteesh K.; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Rogers, James R.; Schneeweiss, Sebastian] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Kahler, Kristijan H.; Martin, Diane] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Novartis,"Gagne, JJ (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Suite 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",jgagne1@partners.org,"Bykov, Katsiaryna/JRZ-1072-2023","Bykov, Katsiaryna/0000-0003-3336-5412; Schneeweiss, Sebastian/0000-0003-2575-467X",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),This study was funded by an unrestricted research grant from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation to the Brigham and Women's Hospital.,,22,2,2,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,1057,1062,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.08.015,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686791.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500015,0

We define four notions of potential games, ordinal, generalized ordinal, best-response, and generalized best-response potential games, and characterize them using cycle conditions. We study Nash equilibria of potential games and show that the set of Nash equilibria remains the same when every player's preferences are replaced with the smallest generalized (best-response) potential relation or a completion of it. Similar results are established about strict Nash equilibria of ordinal and best-response potential games. Lastly, we examine the relations among the four notions of potential games as well as pseudo-potential games. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The decision maker is endowed with two binary relations over alternatives, a preference and a similarity. In every choice problem she includes in her choice set all alternatives which are similar to the best feasible alternative. Hence she can, by mistake, choose an inferior option because it is similar to the best. We characterize this boundedly rational behavior by suitably weakening the rationalizability axiom of Arrow (1959). We also characterize a variation where the decision maker chooses alternatives on the basis of their similarities to attractive yet infeasible options. We show that similarity-based mistakes of either kind lead to cyclical behavior. Finally, we reinterpret our procedure as a method for choosing a bundle given a set of individual items, in which the decision maker combines the best feasible item with those that complement it.

One issue with the validity of network meta-analysis is inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence within a loop formed by three treatments. Recently, the inconsistency issue has been explored further and a complex design-by-treatment interaction model proposed. Objective: The aim of this article was to show how to evaluate the design-by-treatment interaction model using the generalized linear mixed model. Methods: We proposed an arm based approach to evaluating the design-by-treatment inconsistency, which is flexible in modeling different types of outcome variables. We used the smoking cessation data to compare results from our arm based approach with those from the standard contrast-based approach. Results: Because the contrast-based approach requires transformation of data, our example showed that such a transformation may yield biases in the treatment effect and inconsistency evaluation, when event rates were low in some treatments. We also compared contrast-based and arm-based models in the evaluation of design inconsistency when different heterogeneity variances were estimated, and the arm-based model yielded more accurate results. Conclusions: Because some statistical software commands can detect the collinearity among variables and automatically remove the redundant ones, we can use this advantage to help with placing the inconsistency parameters. This could be very useful for a network meta-analysis involving many designs and treatments.","[Tu, Yu-Kang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, 17 Xu Zhou Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Tu, Yu-Kang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Med, 17 Xu Zhou Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Tu, YK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, 17 Xu Zhou Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.;Tu, YK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Med, 17 Xu Zhou Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",yukangtu@ntu.edu.tw,"Tu, Yu-Kang/C-7303-2009","Tu, Yu-Kang/0000-0002-2461-474X",Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 103-2314-B-002-032-MY3],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This project was partly funded by a grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (grant no.

We study this link in an endogenous growth model with physical and human capital. We show that for two economies differing uniquely in factor substitutability, the one with the higher elasticity of substitution will have higher long-run growth. This is due to the efficiency effect of a higher factor substitution. Furthermore, if the initial ratio of physical to human capital is below (above) its steady-state value, the economy with the higher elasticity of substitution will have a higher (lower) steady-state physical capital income share.

Hsiao et al. (2012) propose a method that offers more flexibilities by allowing the influence of the unobservable latent factors to vary cross-section. This paper relaxes the linear conditional mean assumption in their method by extending it to a semi-parametric setting. The asymptotic distribution properties of the average treatment effect estimator is derived and studied. The semi-parametric model and the Hsiao et al. (2012) are both applied to study the macroeconomic effect of the 2008 Chinese Economic Stimulus Program. The estimation results show the fiscal stimulus plan had raised the annual real GDP growth in China by about 3.2%, but only temporarily. These results are robust to linear setting, semiparametric setting, and various control group selections. The temporary boost in economic activities of the stimulus plan is also evident in the estimation of other economic indicators such as real investment, real consumption, real export, and real import.

Given their appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the objective was to systematically identify and critically evaluate the structures and assumptions used in health economic models of disease modifying therapies for ARMS in the United Kingdom. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Web site were searched systematically on March 3, 2014, to identify articles relating to health economic models in ARMS with a UK perspective. Data sources, techniques, and assumptions of the included models were extracted, compared, and critically evaluated. Results: Of 386 results, 26 full texts were evaluated, leading to the inclusion of 18 articles (relating to 12 models). Early models varied considerably in method and structure, but convergence over time toward a Markov model with states based on disability score, a 1-year cycle length, and a lifetime time horizon was apparent. Recent models also allowed for disability improvement within the natural history of the condition. Considerable variety remains, with increasing numbers of comparators, the need for treatment sequencing, and different assumptions around efficacy waning and treatment withdrawal. Conclusions: Despite convergence over time to a similar Markov structure, there are still significant discrepancies between health economic models of ARMS in the United Kingdom. Differing methods, assumptions, and data sources render the comparison of model implementation and results problematic. The commonly used Markov structure leads to problems such as incapability to deal with heterogeneous populations and multiplying complexity with the addition of treatment sequences; these would best be solved by using alternative models such as discrete event simulations.","[Allen, Felicity; Adlard, Nicholas] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England; [Montgomery, Stephen; Maruszczak, Maciej; Kusel, Jeanette] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, Cambridge, England",Novartis; Costello Medical Consulting,"Adlard, N (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, 200 Frimley Business Pk, Frimley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England.",nicholas.adlard@novartis.com,"Montgomery, Stephen/B-5683-2011","Montgomery, Stephen/0000-0002-8481-5850",Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),"This work was funded by Novartis, the manufacturers of fingolimod, one of the disease-modifying therapies covered in this review.",,46,17,17,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,925,938,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.006,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409621.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800023,0

Our identification strategy exploits the exogenous location of public hospitals in court districts with and without schedules for noneconomic damages. We perform difference-in-differences analysis on the entire sample and on a subsample which only considers the nearest hospitals in the neighborhood of court district boundaries. We find that the increase in medical malpractice pressure is associated with a decrease in the probability of performing a C-section from 2.3 to 3.7 percentage points (7-11.6%) with no consequences for medical complications or neonatal outcomes. The impact can be explained by a reduction in the discretion of obstetric decision-making rather than by patient cream skimming.

Which initial treatment, secondary therapy, and whether antivirals should be given alone or in combination are questions of considerable uncertainty. Objective: The aim of this model was to undertake a comprehensive economic evaluation of all antiviral treatments for CHB to recommend the most cost-effective therapeutic sequence. Methods: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of all clinically relevant antiviral treatment sequences for nucleos(t)idenaive adults with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-negative CHB. Relative rates of HBeAg seroconversion and viral suppression were obtained from a network meta analysis Data on mortality, antiviral drug resistance, durability of response, adverse events, and costs were obtained from published literature. Results are reported in terms of lifetime costs, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and expected net benefit. Results: In the base-case analysis, pegylated interferon alpha-2a (peg-LEN alpha-2a) followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was most effective and cost-effective in HBeAg-positive patients, with a cost of 7488 per QALY gained compared with no treatment. In HBeAg-negative patients, peg-IFN alpha-2a followed by entecavir was most effective and cost-effective, with a cost of 6981 per QALY gained. The model was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Peg-LEN alpha-2a followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir is the most effective antiviral treatment strategy for people with both variants of CHB. At a cost of less than 10,000 per QALY gained, these sequences are considered cost-effective in England and Wales. The results of this analysis were used to inform 2013 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline recommendations.","[Bermingham, Sarah L.] Symmetron Ltd, Toronto, ON M5V 1V1, Canada; [Hughes, Ralph; Fenu, Elisabetta] Royal Coll Physicians, Natl Clin Guideline Ctr, London NW1 4LE, England; [Boxall, Elizabeth] Birmingham Heartlands Hosp, Virol Lab, Hlth Protect Agcy, Microbiol Serv Div, Birmingham B9 5ST, W Midlands, England; [Kennedy, Patrick T.] Barts & London Queen Marys Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Dusheiko, Geoff] Royal Free Hosp, UCL Inst Liver & Digest Hlth, London NW3 2QG, England; [Hill-Cawthorne, Grant] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Marie Bashir Inst Infect Dis & Biosecur, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Thomas, Howard] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Sect Hepatol & Gastroenterol, London, England",Royal College of Physicians; University of Birmingham; Health Protection Agency; Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School; University of Sydney; Imperial College London,"Bermingham, SL (通讯作者)，Symmetron Ltd, 20 Camden St, Toronto, ON M5V 1V1, Canada.",s.l.bermingham@gmail.com,"haghighi, atefeh/L-9749-2017; fooladi, parisa/L-9748-2017; Hill-Cawthorne, Grant/B-8039-2009","Hill-Cawthorne, Grant/0000-0002-3828-5473",National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,"The National Care Guideline Centre (S.L.B., R.H., L.M.S., and E.F.) is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

Methods: Data on adult patients with moderate RA (3.2 < Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints [DAS28] <= 5.1) were retrospectively analyzed from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register comparing a nonbiologic-treated group (nBG) using at least one traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug to a biologic group (BG) treated with ETN. The HRQOL was assessed by using the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index score. To mitigate confounding, we controlled for drivers of progression. Appropriate univariate, multivariate, and regression analyses were used Results: A total of 1754 patients with RA were assessed (211 BG and 1543 nBG). Compared with the nBG, the BC tended toward higher disease activity, such as significantly higher tender joints and DAS28. The BG compared with the nBG had 1) a greater reduction in DAS28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores; 2) disease remission occurring more often (odds ratio = 2.7; P = 0.006); and 3) progression occurring in fewer patients (odds ratio = 0.3; P = 0.002). BC patients had a higher incidence of other serious infection and other central nervous system related events, with no significant differences in associated hospitalization rates or deaths. Conclusions: Among patients with moderate RA from a clinical practice registry, ETN-treated patients had significantly higher disease activity at the time of biologic initiation but significantly reduced disease activity and better HRQOL after 6 months compared with nBG patients, although the possibility of unmeasured confounding remains. The ETN group reported significantly higher incidences of other serious infections and other central nervous system related events without higher hospitalization rates.","[Kotak, Sameer; Mardekian, Jack; Koenig, Andrew] Pfizer, Collegeville, PA USA; [Horowicz-Mehler, Nathalie] Quintiles, Hawthorne, NY USA; [Shah, Ankit; Gemmen, Eric] Quintiles Outcome, Rockville, MD USA; [Burgess, Andrew; Kim, Joseph] Quintiles Outcome, Reading, Berks, England",Pfizer; IQVIA; IQVIA; IQVIA,"Horowicz-Mehler, N (通讯作者)，Quintiles Advisory Serv, 60 East 42nd St,Suite 2230, New York, NY 10165 USA.",Nathalie.Horowicz-Mehler@quintiles.com,,,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),This study was sponsored by Pfizer.,,14,10,12,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,817,823,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.005,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409609.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800011,0

Objective: We aim to demonstrate how these principles and assessments can be applied in practice through the use of a seven point checklist of assessment. Methods: The value of access to a technology and the value of additional evidence are explored through the application of the checklist to the case studies of enhanced external counterpulsation for chronic stable angina and clopidogrel for the management of patients with non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. Results: The case studies demonstrate the importance of considering 1) the expected cost-effectiveness and population net health effects; 2) the need for evidence and whether the type of research required can be conducted once a technology is approved for widespread use; 3) whether there are sources of uncertainty that cannot be resolved by research but only over time; and 4) whether there are significant (opportunity) costs that once committed by approval cannot be recovered. Conclusions: The checklist demonstrates that cost-effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for approval. Only in Research may be appropriate when a technology is expected to be cost-effective due to significant irrecoverable costs. It is only approval that can be ruled out if a technology is not expected to be cost-effective.

A time trade-off (TTO) approach is commonly used to elicit preferences from the public. However, there are issues regarding how best to measure worse-than-dead states; at present, extreme valuations are rounded up to more acceptable values. TTO elicitation is also cognitively demanding for respondents and is therefore expensive to investigate. Objectives: To describe how the analytic hierarchy process approach could be used to generate utilities from the ordinal relationships between the health states instead of the ordinal relationships between health states, allowing potentially useful preference data to be incorporated rather than excluded as they are at present. It was applied to the Measurement and Valuation of Health study data set, measuring health state preferences for the United Kingdom. Methods: The analytic hierarchy process approach was explained. five approaches to structure pairwise comparisons of health state preference were described (two concave, two convex, and one linear). Results: All approaches described predicted the rankings of health states well However, utilities derived followed an unconventional, bunched shape compared with the original Measurement and Valuation of Health TTO study. An approach was identified by optimizing the parameters, minimizing the sum of squared errors between the ordinal health state ranking' approach and the original TTO-derived utilities. Conclusions: This approach outlined offers the potential to convert ordinal preference data into cardinal utilities. It is simpler than TTO studies to carry out and removes the need to directly alter results of the preference ranking exercise.","[Reddy, Brian P.; Adams, Roisin; Walsh, Cathal; Barry, Michael] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Walsh, Cathal] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Stat, Dublin, Ireland; [Barry, Michael] Univ Limerick, HRI, MACSI, Limerick, Ireland; [Kind, Paul] Univ Leeds, Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; University of Limerick; University of Leeds,"Reddy, BP (通讯作者)，St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, James St, Dublin 8, Ireland.",reddybr@tcd.ie,"Kind, Paul/E-9715-2015; Walsh, Chloe/AAM-1093-2020","Kind, Paul/0000-0003-2377-1652; Walsh, Cathal/0000-0001-6599-9562; Barry, Michael/0000-0002-6232-3003; Reddy, Brian/0000-0003-0033-517X",Health Research Board [HRA-2014-PHR-516]; [HRB-RL-2013-4],Health Research Board;,This work was funded primarily by the Health Research Board through Health Research Award HRA-2014-PHR-516.

Methods A cost-effectiveness study was conducted. The perspective is that of a UK NHS clinical genetics service provider (with respect to both costs and outcomes). A cohort of patients (n = 1590) referred for array-CGH testing of undiagnosed learning disability and developmental delay by a single NHS regional clinical genetics service (South East Thames Regional Genetics Service), were split into a before-and-after design where 742 patients had array-CGH as a second-line test (before group comparator intervention) and 848 patients had array-CGH as a first-line test (after group evaluated intervention). The mean costs were calculated from the clinical genetics testing pathway constructed for each patient including the costs of genetic testing undertaken and clinical appointments scheduled. The outcome was the number of diagnoses each intervention produced so that a mean cost-per-diagnosis could be calculated. The cost effectiveness of the two interventions was calculated as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to produce an incremental cost-per-diagnosis (in 2013 GBP). Sensitivity analyses were conducted by altering both costs and effects to check the validity of the outcome. Results The incremental mean cost of testing patients using the first-line testing strategy was GBP241.56 (95 % CIs GBP256.93 to GBP226.19) and the incremental mean gain in the percentage diagnoses was 0.39 % (95 % CIs 2.73 to 3.51 %), which equates to an additional 1 diagnosis per 256 patients tested. This cost-effectiveness study comparing these two strategies estimates that arrayCGH first-line testing dominates second-line testing because it was both less costly and as effective. The sensitivity analyses conducted (adjusting both costs and effects) supported the dominance of the first-line testing strategy (i.e. lower cost and as effective). Conclusions The first-line testing strategy was estimated to dominate the second-line testing strategy because it was both less costly and as effective. These findings are relevant to the wider UK NHS clinical genetics service, with two key strengths of this study being the appropriateness of the comparator interventions and the direct applicability of the patient cohort within this study and the wider UK patient population.","[Sagoo, G.

The theory can simultaneously accommodate models with multiple random variables, multiple confidence levels, and multiple lags of the associated quantiles. The proposed framework can be conveniently thought of as a vector autoregressive (VAR) extension to quantile models. We estimate a simple version of the model using market equity returns data to analyze spillovers in the values at risk (VaR) between a market index and financial institutions. We construct impulse-response functions for the quantiles of a sample of 230 financial institutions around the world and study how financial institution-specific and system-wide shocks are absorbed by the system. We show how the long-run risk of the largest and most leveraged financial institutions is very sensitive to market wide shocks in situations of financial distress, suggesting that our methodology can prove a valuable addition to the traditional toolkit of policy makers and supervisors.

Vaccine-preventable diseases have been on the rise in Europe and the USA in the last few years. Cases of measles and pertussis have all been increasing at alarming rates. The article begins with a discussion of the use of immunization exemptions across the states and a brief history of US immunization policy. A review of the literature confirms that socioeconomic status and other demographic characteristics can be important predictors of childhood vaccine uptake. Aim Given the seriousness of this public health issue, the primary objective of this research is to analyze the determinants of a child in the USA being fully vaccinated. Methods A range of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, along with data from the National Immunization Survey, are used to develop an immunization prediction model. Logistic regression is the chosen method in determining whether a preschool-age child in the USA today is likely to be vaccinated based on various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results Model results reveal a number of significant socioeconomic and demographic characteristics that contribute to the likelihood of a child being immunized. The overall logistic regression model was highly significant at the 5 % level and model parameters are significant. Significant variables in the model include categories of educational attainment, first born child, race and ethnicity, age of mother, and census region. This model does not definitively reveal that later born children are less likely to get fully vaccinated than first born children but does confirm the significance of geography in immunization outcomes. All levels of education were found to be significant along with all census regions. Conclusions Overall, these models reveal that demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are predictors of childhood immunization and if leveraged appropriately can assist policy makers and public health officials to understand immunization rates and craft policy to improve them.","[Crouch, Elizabeth] Univ S Carolina, Inst Families Soc, Div Policy & Res Medicaid & Medicare PRMM, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Dickes, Lori A.] Clemson Univ, Strom Thurmond Inst, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Clemson University,"Crouch, E (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Inst Families Soc, Div Policy & Res Medicaid & Medicare PRMM, 1600 Hampton St,Suite 507, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",crouchel@mailbox.sc.edu,,,,,,,42,10,17,0,11,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Methods In a prospective trial, 356 diabetic patients due for a DFE at an urban eye clinic were randomly assigned to usual care (UC; reference case), mailed intervention (MI), or telephone intervention (TI). UC patients (n = 119) received a standard form letter. MI patients (n = 117) received a personalized letter encouraging scheduling of an eye examination with an educational brochure about diabetic eye disease. TI patients (n = 120) received personal calls (up to three attempts) to schedule a follow-up with standard form letter. The primary outcome was obtaining a DFE within 90 days of suggested return. Costs (US$2013) included time costs for staff, phone charges, supplies, and postage. Since TI involved greater cost components compared to MI, univariate sensitivity analysis examined the impact of reducing phone costs. Results Patients were mostly female (66 %) and African American (70 %) with a mean age of 61 years. TI patients were more likely to schedule DFE [65 vs. 42 %; relative risk (RR) 1.54; CI 1.20-1.96; P < 0.001] versus UC patients. Obtaining a DFE within 90 days of suggested return was also significantly higher among TI patients compared to UC patients (51 vs. 36 %, RR 1.41; CI 1.05-1.89; P = 0.024). MI patients were slightly less likely to schedule DFE versus UC patients (38 vs. 42 %, RR 0.90; CI 0.66-1.22; P = NSS) and obtain a DFE (32 vs. 36 %; RR 0.90; CI 0.63-1.28; P = NSS). The total cost of TI was US$798.28 or US$6.65/patient and the cost/follow-up DFE was US$26.05. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the cost/follow-up can be greatly reduced but remains greater compared to UC (US$2.76 if US$0.25/call, US$11.13 if $1/call; US$22.29 if US$2/call). Conclusions Personal phone assistance in scheduling DFE follow-up is more effective but also more costly. Follow-up research has been initiated to determine whether automated phone reminders can achieve similar effectiveness at a lower cost.","[Pizzi, Laura T.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Jefferson Sch Pharm, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Zangalli, Camila S.; Murchison, Ann P.; Hale, Nicole; Hark, Lisa; Haller, Julia A.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Wills Eye Hosp, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Dai, Yang] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Jefferson Med Coll, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Leiby, Benjamin E.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Sidney Kimmel Med Coll, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA",Jefferson University; Jefferson University; Jefferson University; Jefferson University,"Pizzi, LT (通讯作者)，Thomas Jefferson Univ, Jefferson Sch Pharm, 901 Walnut St,Suite 911, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",laura.pizzi@jefferson.edu,,,NCCDPHP CDC HHS [5U58DP002655-04] Funding Source: Medline,NCCDPHP CDC HHS,,,19,10,11,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

However, little is known about the factors influencing the competition between biosimilars and their reference products (REF). Objectives The aim of this study was to analyse key global erythropoietin (EPO) markets and factors affecting biosimilar EPO (BIOSIM-EPO) uptakes, and to identify countries where BIOSIM-EPOs have gained significant market shares. Methods Inclusion criteria for countries in the study were a biosimilar regulatory framework similar to the EU framework, and biological market value higher than US$2.5 billion. Factors evaluated included EPO market size, EPO retail/hospital distribution mix, national incentives to use biosimilars and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences. IMS Health provided EPO consumption in volumes, values, and EPO ex-manufacturer prices from 2007 to 2012. Results Japan: large-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (6.8 % in 2012). France: large-sized market, dominant retail distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (5.8 %). Spain and Italy: medium-sized market, dominant hospital distribution, no incentives, moderate BIOSIM-EPO uptakes (11.5 and 8.6 %). Germany: small-sized market, dominant retail distribution, presence of incentives, high BIOSIM-EPO uptake (30.4 %). UK: small-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (2.0 %). BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences play no role at a global level (-10.8 % in Germany and -26.9 % in Japan). Conclusions EPO markets have proven to be highly country-specific. EPO market sizes, EPO retail/hospital distribution mixes and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences may not be determining factors of BIOSIM-EPO uptakes. Prescription and substitution incentives to use BIOSIM-EPO appear to be determining factors in Germany. The heterogeneity of national EPO markets makes it impossible to outline country profile types with significant BIOSIM-EPO penetrations.","[Bocquet, Francois; Le Pen, Claude] Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ & Management Hlth Org, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Bocquet, Francois; Paubel, Pascal] Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Pharm, Paris, France; [Bocquet, Francois; Paubel, Pascal] Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM, Hlth Law Inst,UMR S 1145, Paris, France; [Bocquet, Francois; Fusier, Isabelle; Cordonnier, Anne-Laure; Sinegre, Martine] Gen Agcy Equipment & Hlth Prod AGEPS, Therapeut Evaluat Unit, AP HP, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); AGEPS Agence Generale des Equipements et Produits de Sante - APHP,"Bocquet, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ & Management Hlth Org, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",francois.bocquet@parisdescartes.fr,"BOCQUET, François/D-2374-2017; Bocquet, François/GWZ-5108-2022; Bocquet, François/M-6525-2015",,,,,,61,16,17,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The shift away from not-covered antibiotics, particularly from those without covered equivalents, indicates a change in the physicians' prescribing decisions.

An experiment was conducted to explore the differences in episodic memory performance between patients with Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. In the experiment, participants carried out a place-object word pair recall task. Different consistency of word pairs and delays before recall was allowed were investigated. Overall, Alzheimer's disease patients showed impairments in episodic memory performance. The results showed better performance for consistent word pairs, and for immediate recall.

In this paper correlations between yields and satellite indicators of crop water use or evapotranspiration (ET) were studied for the period 2002-2014. Correlations were studied for winter wheat at district scale in Vysocina, Jihomoravsky and Olomoucky regions since winter wheat is one of the traditional and most important crops grown in these regions. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) was used for these correlations as an ET-based index. Time series of Pearson correlation coefficient (r) computed between ESI and winter wheat yields at district scale were analysed. Strongest correlations are associated with districts within the Southern Moravian lowlands in Jihomoravsky and Olomoucky region, where frequency of occurrence of severe drought was highest over the period of record. Severe drought resulted in significant yield impacts, particularly in years 2003 and 2012. Correlations tend to be lower over the highlands districts of Vysocina and surroundings. In these districts, yields are more temperature than moisture limited and were more stable over the period of record.","[Jurecka, Frantisek; Hlavinka, Petr; Semeradova, Daniela; Trnka, Miroslav; Zalud, Zdenek] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Jurecka, Frantisek; Hlavinka, Petr; Semeradova, Daniela; Trnka, Miroslav; Zalud, Zdenek] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Czech Globe, Vvi, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Anderson, Martha; Gao, Feng; Yang, Yun] ARS, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Hain, Christopher] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",Mendel University in Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Jurecka, F (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",frantisek.jurecka@centrum.cz,"Hlavinka, Petr/G-3661-2014; Hain, Christopher/ABE-7127-2020; Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Gao, Feng/HGB-3697-2022; Zalud, Zdenek/G-3203-2014; Semerádová, Daniela/H-4094-2013","Hlavinka, Petr/0000-0002-5604-5502; Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379; Gao, Feng/0000-0002-1865-2846; Zalud, Zdenek/0000-0003-1882-9901; Semerádová, Daniela/0000-0002-2699-7924",,,,,10,2,2,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,54,59,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100008,0

These results would provide theoretical guideline for project managers to manage complexity and risk.","[Luo Lan] Nanchang Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [He Qing-hua] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Res Inst Complex Engn & Management, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Shu Long-long] Nanchang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Nanchang University; Tongji University; Nanchang University,"Luo, L (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",,"luo, lan/JTT-0853-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71390523],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71390523).,,28,0,0,1,15,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1697,1702,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600226,0

We estimate the effects of these laws on injuries requiring emergency department treatment. Using hospital-level panel data and triple difference models, we find helmet laws are associated with reductions in bicycle-related head injuries among children. However, laws also are associated with decreases in non-head cycling injuries, as well as increases in head injuries from other wheeled sports. Thus, the observed reduction in bicycle-related head injuries may be due to reductions in bicycle riding induced by the laws.

Objectives: This article analyses the strategies currently approved in Italy and proposes a novel model called success fee to improve payment-by-result schemes and to guarantee patients rapid access to novel therapies. Methods: A review of the existing risk-sharing schemes in Italy has been performed, and data provided by the Italian National report (2012) on drug use have been analyzed to assess the impact on drug expenditure deriving from the application of traditional performance based strategies since their introduction in 2006. Results: Such schemes have poorly contributed to the fulfillment of the purpose in Italy, producing a trifling refund, compared with relevant drugs costs for the National Health System : 121 million out of a total of 3696 million paid. The novel risk-sharing agreement called success fee has been adopted for a new high-cost therapy approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pirfenidone, and consists of an ex post payment made by the National Health System to the manufacturer for those patients who received a real benefit from treatment Conclusions: Success fee represents an effective strategy to promote value-based pricing, making available to patients a rapid access to innovative and expensive therapies, with an affordable impact on drug expenditure and, simultaneously, ensuring third-party payers to share with manufacturers the risk deriving from uncertain safety and effectiveness.

Voting is restricted to those schedules that are selfishly optimal for some individual. The analysis extends that of Brett and Weymark (2016) by adding a minimum-utility constraint to their incentive-compatibility and government budget constraints. It also extends the analysis of Roell (2012) and Bohn and Stuart (2013) by providing a complete characterization of the selfishly optimal tax schedules. It is shown that individuals have single-peaked preferences over the set of selfishly optimal tax schedules, and so the schedule proposed by the median skill type is a Condorcet winner.

J,"Narayana, MR",,,,"Narayana, Muttur Ranganathan",,,India's Proposed Universal Health Coverage Policy: Evidence for Age Structure Transition Effect and Fiscal Sustainability,APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CARE,"Background India's High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage in 2011 recommended a universal, public-funded and national health coverage policy. As a plausible forward-looking macroeconomic reform in the health sector, this policy proposal on universal health coverage (UHC) needs to be evaluated for age structure transition effect and fiscal sustainability to strengthen its current design and future implementation. Objective Macroeconomic analyses of the long-term implications of age structure transition and fiscal sustainability on India's proposed UHC policy. Methods A new measure of age-specific UHC is developed by combining the age profile of public and private health consumption expenditure by using the National Transfer Accounts methodology. Different projections of age-specific public health expenditure are calculated over the period 2005-2100 to account for the age structure transition effect. The projections include changes in: (1) levels of the expenditure as gross domestic product grows, (2) levels and shape of the expenditure as gross domestic product grows and expenditure converges to that of developed countries (or convergence scenario) based on the Lee-Carter model of forecasting mortality rates, and (3) levels of the expenditure as India moves toward a UHC policy. Fiscal sustainability under each health expenditure projection is determined by using the measures of generational imbalance and sustainability gap in the Generational Accounting methodology. Results Public health expenditure is marked by age specificities and the elderly population is costlier to support for their healthcare needs in the future. Given the discount and productivity growth rates, the proposed UHC is not fiscally sustainable under India's current fiscal policies except for the convergence scenario. However, if the income elasticity of public expenditure on social welfare and health expenditure is less than one, fiscal sustainability of the UHC policy is attainable in all scenarios of projected public health expenditures. These new results strengthen the proposed UHC policy by accounting for age structure transition effect and justifying its sustainability within the framework of India's current fiscal policies. Conclusion The age structure transition effect is important to incorporate the age-specific cost and benefit of the proposed UHC policy, especially as India moves toward an ageing society. Fiscal sustainability is essential to ensure that the proposed UHC is implementable on a long-term basis and within the framework of current fiscal policies.","[Narayana, Muttur Ranganathan] Inst Social & Econ Change, Ctr Econ Studies & Policy, Nagarabhavi PO, Bengaluru 560072, Karnataka, India",,"Narayana, MR (通讯作者)，Inst Social & Econ Change, Ctr Econ Studies & Policy, Nagarabhavi PO, Bengaluru 560072, Karnataka, India.",mrnarayana@yahoo.com,,,"Centre for Economics and Demography of Ageing (University of California, Berkeley); East West Center (Hawaii); Institute for Social and Economic Change (Bengaluru, India)","Centre for Economics and Demography of Ageing (University of California, Berkeley); East West Center (Hawaii); Institute for Social and Economic Change (Bengaluru, India)","An early version of this article was presented for the International Symposium on Demographic Change and Policy Response (13-14 November 2014, Beijing, China).

Conversely, in this paper a zero long-run value allows a solution without stagnation. We prove that a less than exponential but unbounded growth can be attained, even without technological progress. The growth rate of consumption decreases asymptotically towards zero, although so slowly that consumption grows unboundedly. The asymptotic convergence towards a non-hyperbolic steady-state which saving rate matches the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the speed of convergence towards this equilibrium are analyzed.

(2006), uses the minimum description length (MIDI.) principle to estimate the number and locations of structural breaks in a non-stationary time series. Consistency of this model selection procedure has been established when using conditional maximum (Gaussian) likelihood variance estimates. In contrast, the estimate of the number of change-points is inconsistent in general if Yule Walker variance estimates are used instead. This surprising result is due to an exact cancellation of first-order terms in a Taylor series expansion in the conditional maximum likelihood case, which does not occur in the Yule Walker case. In order to simplify notation and make the arguments more transparent, we only treat in detail the simple case where the time series follows an AR(p) model with no change-points.

After accounting for the endogeneity of depression through a correlated random effects panel data specification, we found that exhibiting depressive symptoms reduces the likelihood of employment. We did not, however, find evidence of a causal relationship between depressive symptoms and hourly wages or weekly hours worked. Our estimates are substantially smaller than those from previous studies and imply that depressive symptoms reduce the contemporaneous probability of employment by 2.4 percentage points. In addition, we examined the effect of depression on work impairment and found that exhibiting depressive symptoms increases annual work loss days by about 1.4 days (33%), which implies that the annual aggregate productivity loses because of depression-induced absenteeism range from $900m to $1.9bn in 2009 USD.

When we study co-movements between such series we usually analyze the joint process sampled at a common low frequency. This has consequences in terms of potentially mis-specifying the co-movements and hence the analysis of impulse response functions-a commonly used tool for economic policy analysis. We introduce a class of mixed frequency VAR models that allows us to measure the impact of high frequency data on low frequency and vice versa. Our approach does not rely on latent processes/shocks representations. As a consequence, the mixed frequency VAR is an alternative to commonly used state space models for mixed frequency data. State space models are parameter-driven whereas mixed frequency VAR models are observation-driven models as they are formulated exclusively in terms of observable data and do not involve latent processes as well as shocks and thus avoid the need to formulate measurement equations, filtering, etc. We also propose various parsimonious parameterizations, in part inspired by recent work on MIDAS regressions. We also explicitly characterize the mis-specification of a traditional common low frequency VAR and its implied mis-specified impulse response functions. The class of mixed frequency VAR models can also characterize the timing of information releases for a mixture of sampling frequencies and the real-time updating of predictions caused by the flow of high frequency information, Various estimation procedures for mixed frequency VAR models are also proposed, both classical and Bayesian. Numerical and empirical examples quantify the consequences of ignoring mixed frequency data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on Lewbel (1998), a special regressor is additively separable in the latent payoff and conditionally independent from the error term. We find that with median-independent errors a special regressor does not increase the identifying power by a criterion in Manski (1988) or lead to positive Fisher information for the coefficients, even though it does help recover the average structural function. With conditionally symmetric errors, a special regressor improves the identifying power, and the information for coefficients is positive under mild conditions.

Following selection for medical technologies guidance, the company developed a submission of clinical and economic evidence for evaluation. TURis is a bipolar surgical system for treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic enlargement. The comparator is any monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (mTURP) system. Cedar, a collaboration between Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cardiff University and Swansea University in the UK, acted as an External Assessment Centre (EAC) for NICE to independently critique the company's submission of evidence. Eight randomised trials provided evidence for TURis, demonstrating efficacy equivalent to that of mTURP for improvement of symptoms. The company presented meta-analyses of key outcome measures, and the EAC made methodological modifications in response to the heterogeneity of the trial data. The EAC analysis found that TURis substantially reduced the relative risks of transurethral resection syndrome (relative risk 0.18 [95 % confidence interval 0.05-0.62]) and blood transfusion (relative risk 0.35 [95 % confidence interval 0.19-0.65]). The company provided a de novo economic model comparing TURis with mTURP. The EAC critiqued the model methodology and made modifications. This found TURis to be cost saving at 70.55 pound per case for existing Olympus customers and cost incurring at 19.80 pound per case for non-Olympus customers. When an additional scenario based on the only available data on readmission (due to any cause) from a single trial was modelled, the estimated cost saving per case was 375.02 pound for existing users of Olympus electrosurgery equipment and 284.66 pound per case when new Olympus equipment would need to be purchased. Meta-analysis of eight randomised trials showed that TURis is associated with a statistically significantly reduced risk of transurethral resection syndrome and a reduced need for blood transfusion-two factors that may drive cost saving for the National Health Service. The clinical data are equivocal as to whether TURis shortens the hospital stay. Limited data from a single study suggest that TURis may reduce the rate of readmission after surgery. The NICE guidance supports adoption of the TURis technology for performing transurethral resection of the prostate in men with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic enlargement.","[Cleves, Andrew; Carolan-Rees, Grace] Cedar Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff Medictr, Heath Pk Campus, Cardiff CF14 4UJ, S Glam, Wales; [Dimmock, Paul; Hewitt, Neil] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England",Cardiff University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Cleves, A (通讯作者)，Cedar Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff Medictr, Heath Pk Campus, Cardiff CF14 4UJ, S Glam, Wales.",andrew.cleves@wales.nhs.uk,"Carolan-Rees, Grace/H-6169-2012; Dimmock, Paul/KCK-8972-2024","Carolan-Rees, Grace/0000-0003-1787-2123",,,,,43,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Health SWAps aim to give increased control to recipient governments, allowing greater domestic influence over how health aid is allocated and facilitating allocative efficiency gains. This paper assesses whether health SWAps have increased recipient control of health aid via increased general sector-support and have facilitated (re)allocations of health aid across disease areas. Using a uniquely compiled panel data set of countries receiving development assistance for health over the period 1990-2010, we employ fixed effects and dynamic panel models to assess the impact of introducing a health SWAp on levels of general sector-support for health and allocations of health-sector aid across key funding silos (including HIV, maternal and child health' and sector-support'). Our results suggest that health SWAps have influenced health-sector aid flows in a manner consistent with increased recipient control and improvements in allocative efficiency.

The introduction of shared-care models is coupled with mixed evidence in relation to both patient health status and cost of care. Professional interactions among health providers are critical to a successful and efficient shared-care model. Objective This article investigates whether the strength of formal professional relationships between general practitioners (GPs) and specialists (SPs) in shared care affects either the health status of patients or their pharmacy costs. In strong GP-SP relationships, the patient health status is expected to be high, due to efficient care coordination, and the pharmacy costs low, due to effective use of resources. Methods This article measures the strength of formal professional relationships between GPs and SPs through the number of shared patients and proxies the patient health status by the number of comorbidities diagnosed and treated. To test the hypotheses and compare the characteristics of the strongest GP-SP connections with those of the weakest, this article concentrates on diabetesa chronic condition where patient care coordination is likely important. Diabetes generates the largest shared patient cohort in Hungary, with the highest frequency of specialist medication prescriptions. Results This article finds that stronger ties result in lower pharmacy costs, but not in higher patient health status. Conclusion Overall drug expenditure may be reduced by lowering patient care fragmentation through channelling a GP's patients to a small number of SPs.","[Lubloy, Agnes; Kereszturi, Judit Lilla] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst Finance & Accounting, Dept Finance, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Benedek, Gabor] Thesys SEA Pte Ltd, 89 Neil Rd, Singapore 088849, Singapore; [Benedek, Gabor] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Math Econ & Econ Anal, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Corvinus University Budapest,"Lublóy, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst Finance & Accounting, Dept Finance, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",agnes.lubloy@uni-corvinus.hu,,"Kereszturi, Judit Lilla/0000-0003-1407-242X",AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),DoktorInfo Ltd has played no role in study design; in the analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of this article; or in the decision to submit it for publication.

The approach develops estimation strategies in conjunction with the country-product-dummy method to derive a range of multilateral index number methods for the compilation of PPPs at the basic heading level as well as at higher levels of aggregation. At the basic heading level our approach generates Jevons geometric index, arithmetic and harmonic indexes as well as the Dutot index. At higher levels of aggregation, a weighted stochastic model with alternative stochastic specifications and the method of moments (MOM) are used to derive the Geary--Khamis, Ikle, Rao and other multilateral index number methods employed in international comparisons. Expressions for computing standard errors for PPPs based on these formulae are also derived. Existence of solutions to the estimating equations derived from the weighted method of moments or the maximum weighted likelihood is also discussed.

However the tools to assess it are lacking. Several theoretical frameworks have been developed to define social sustainability and its implementation. The attributional approaches, pathways or capabilities methods have emerged, based on a functional unit of a good or service along the supply chain. This paper proposes a new method to assess social economic and territorial performances of a food chain as a whole on a Territory. It is divided into four components: (i) dignity and well-being of workers, (ii) contribution to local life, (iii) fairness and integrity of business practices, and (iv) creation of material and intangible wealth. 50 criteria are used according to international, national or sectoral references. This generic method applicable to any sector of processed food products aims to identify where are the areas of improvement to qualify the sector as socially sustainable. An application to the wine Beaujolais and Burgundy wine was performed from surveys of 35 production and trade operators in 2014. The results show that the sector is particularly effective for the promotion of the territory, local life participation, loyalty and integrity of business practices; some improvement is still possible for the welfare of workers and the creation ofmaterial wealth. This method can be coupled with the environmental performance determined by the life cycle analysis in order to assess the sustainability in its entirety.","[Beber, Caetano; Padilla, Martine; Razes, Maylis] CIHEAM IAMM, 3191 Route Mende, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Fort, Fatiha; Rastoin, Jean-Louis] Montpellier SupAgro, UMR 1110 MOISA, Pl Viala, F-34000 Montpellier, France",CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Beber, C (通讯作者)，CIHEAM IAMM, 3191 Route Mende, F-34090 Montpellier, France.",,"Beber, Caetano Luiz/JFS-7444-2023; Beber, Caetano Luiz/AGH-3629-2022; Beber, Caetano Luiz/AAK-8402-2020","Beber, Caetano Luiz/0000-0002-5036-4932; Beber, Caetano Luiz/0000-0002-5036-4932",,,,,16,1,1,2,13,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3009.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703009,0.0,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700087,0

There are personalized trading restrictions connecting prices with both portfolio constraints and consumption possibilities, a setting which has not thoroughly been addressed by the literature. Our approach is general enough to be compatible with incomplete market economies where there exist wealth-dependent and/or investment-dependent credit access, borrowing constraints precluding bankruptcy, or assets backed by physical collateral. To prove equilibrium existence, we assume that both investment on segmented assets is not required to obtain access to credit and transfers implementable in segmented markets can be super-replicated by investing in non-segmented markets. For instance, this super-replication property is satisfied if either (i) all individuals have access to borrow at a risk-free rate; or (ii) financial contracts make real promises in terms of non-perishable commodities; or (iii) promises are backed by physical collateral.

Nevertheless, the presence of virus in a seed, does not always lead to seedling infection. In grapevine, seed transmission has been reported for many nepoviruses, but little is known about the other virus associated diseases such as Leafroll, Rugose wood complex and Fleck diseases, that are considered by Italian legislation on certification of grapevine propagation material, together with infectious degeneration. Thus, the aim of this study is monitoring the virological condition of seedlings obtained by crosses between infected parentals, analyzing the sanitary status of seedlings after the transfer in experimental fields. In this study, 50 progeny plants from three different traditionally crossbreed seeded and seedless table grape cultivars were investigated for the detection of nine grapevine viruses. It was observed that the viral state of parentals was quite compromised, while viruses were not detected in any of the 150 progeny plants, demonstrating that the main grapevine viruses are at low risk for seed transmission. These results could make it possible to reduce the precautions to obtain propagation material free from infectious diseases and also suggest to consider reproduction as a new procedure of sanitation in breeding programs.","[Gasparro, Marica; Caputo, Angelo Raffaele; Forleo, Lucia Rosaria; Perniola, Rocco; Alba, Vittorio; Milella, Rosa Anna; Antonacci, Donato] Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Unita Ric Uva Tavola & Vitivinicoltura Ambiente M, Via Casamassima 148, I-70010 Turi, BA, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Gasparro, M (通讯作者)，Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Unita Ric Uva Tavola & Vitivinicoltura Ambiente M, Via Casamassima 148, I-70010 Turi, BA, Italy.",,"Gasparro, Marica/AAP-9506-2021; Alba, Vittorio/AAC-5455-2021","Alba, Vittorio/0000-0001-5317-0589",,,,,43,4,5,0,3,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1039.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701039,0.0,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700039,0

It is not easy to predict the final pH of a mixed tartaric acid and calcium sulphate addition and to determine the necessary doses to reach the final pH required by the winemaker because there are several interrelated chemical equilibra implied (tartaric acid dissociation, calcium tartrate and potassium bitartrate precipitation etc.). To predict the effect on pH, several chemical modeling approaches have been described in the literature. It is noteworthy to mention the simplified model where the acidity of wine is considered to be due to a monoprotic acid. In this work the prediction of pH at industrial scale was confirmed and its practical application was facilitated by linear regression lines prepared with pilot scale data. Additionally, sensory analysis of wines acidified with calcium sulphate and tartaric acid alone and mixed indicates that there are great differences among them in taste and that mixed acidification is the preferred by the tasters. That confirms the good comprehension of the chemical equilibria involved in this practice and supply very useful information for its final approval in OIV.","[Gomez, J.; Lasanta, C.] Univ Cadiz, Fac Sci, Dept Chem Engn & Food Technol, Puerto Real 11510, Spain; [Cubillana-Aguilera, L.

Methods: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the three competing strategies using parameters from existing literature as well as a Markov model developed to simulate the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation from a single computed tomography (CT) study in the course of diagnosis. The simulation model was applied to a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 boys and girls, age 10 years, presenting with acute abdominal pain to emergency departments in the United States. Results: The integrated strategy, the CDR followed by staged imaging, was found to be the most cost-effective approach. Cost savings accrued from the reduction in CT utilization for low-risk patients compared with the other two strategies. The addition of ultrasound (US) to the CDR strategy reduced CT utilization by an additional 10.9%, its main cost advantage, with negligible change in net health benefits from false-negative US results, and associated morbidity or mortality. Conclusions: Results suggest that the integration of staged imaging with the CDR for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children is a cost-effective and cost-saving approach.

As a robustness check, we also use a different database regarding a different health issue, access to clean water.

CED can be defined as temporary coverage for a novel health product during collection of the additional evidence required to determine whether definitive coverage is possible. The principle refinements to the scheme include a more precise definition of what may be considered an innovative product, the possibility for device manufacturers to request CED either independently or in partnership with hospitals, and the establishment of processing deadlines for health authorities. In the long term, these modifications may increase the number of applications to the CED scheme, which could lead to unsustainable funding for future projects. It will also be necessary to ensure that the study conditions required by national health authorities are suitable for medical devices and that processing deadlines are met for the scheme to be fully operational. Overall, the modifications recently applied to the French CED scheme for innovative medical devices should increase the transparency of the process, and therefore be more appealing to medical device manufacturers.

It starts with a parallel between the development of empirical frameworks for static and dynamic analysis of industries: both adapted their frameworks from models taken from economic theory. The dynamic framework has had its successes: it led to developments that have enabled us to control for dynamic phenomena in static empirical models and to useful computational theory. However when important characteristics of industries were integrated into that framework it generated complexities which both hindered empirical work on dynamics per se, and made it unrealistic as a model of agent behavior. This paper suggests a simpler alternative paradigm, one which need not maintain all the traditional theoretical restrictions, but does maintain the core theoretical idea of optimizing subject to an information set. It then discusses estimation, computation, and an example within that paradigm.","[Pakes, Ariel] Harvard Univ, Econ, Littauer 117, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Pakes, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Littauer 117, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",apakes@harvard.edu,,,,,,,43,4,5,0,1,BIRKHAUSER BOSTON,CAMBRIDGE,"675 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139-2333 USA",,,978-3-319-28014-1; 978-3-319-28012-7,ANN INT SOC DYN GAME,,,2016,14.0,,,,,,43,75,,10.1007/978-3-319-28014-1_3,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6CK,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389946800003,0

Objectives: The objective was to conduct an economic evaluation of cinacalcet on the basis of the EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (EVOLVE) trial from a US payer perspective. Methods: We developed a semi-Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet in addition to conventional therapy, compared with conventional therapy alone, in patients with moderate-to-severe sHPT receiving hemodialysis. We used treatment effect estimates from the unadjusted intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and prespecified covariate-adjusted ITT analysis as our main analyses. We assessed model sensitivity to variations in individual inputs and overall decision uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cinacalcet was $61,705 per life-year and $79,562 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using the covariate-adjusted ITT analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 73.2% chance of the ICER being below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000. Treatment effects from unadjusted ITT analysis yielded an ICER of $115,876 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the treatment effect on mortality. Conclusions: In the unadjusted ITT analysis, cinacalcet does not represent a cost- effective use of health care resources when applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. When using the covariate-adjusted ITT treatment effect, which represents the least biased estimate, however, cinacalcet is a cost-effective therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe sHPT on hemodialysis.","[Belozeroff, Vasily; Dehmel, Bastian] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Chertow, Glenn M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Graham, Christopher N.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Parfrey, Patrick S.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, Canada; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Amgen; Stanford University; Research Triangle Institute; Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Glasgow,"Belozeroff, V (通讯作者)，Amgen Hlth Econ, One Amgen Ctr Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA.",vasilyb@amgen.com,"Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Chertow, Glenn/0000-0002-7599-0534; Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),The EVOLVE trial and the economics analysis presented in this article were funded by Amgen Inc.,,43,15,17,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,1079,1087,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.08.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686794.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500018,0

Managed care organizations, particularly health maintenance organizations (HMOs), now face quality and coverage mandates that restrict them from using their most aggressive strategies for managing costs. This paper examines the effect of this backlash on managed care's ability to contain costs among short-term, non-federal hospitals between 1998 and 2008. The results show that the impact of increased HMO penetration on inpatient costs reversed over the study period, but HMOs were still effective at containing outpatient costs. These findings have important policy implications for understanding the continuing role that HMOs should play in cost containment policy and for understanding how effective the latest wave of cost containment institutions may perform in heavily regulated markets.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to introduce an analysis approach based on individual-level longitudinal survey data that estimates the burden of diabetes in patients with coronary heart disease in terms of quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost. Methods: Data from two postal surveys (2006, N = 1022; 2010-2011, N = 716) of survivors from the KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry in Southern Germany were analyzed. Accumulated QALYs were calculated for each participant over a mean observation time of 4.1 years, considering the non informative censoring structure of the follow-up study. Linear regression models were used to estimate the loss in (quality-unadjusted) life-years and QALYs between patients with and without diabetes, and generalized additive models were used to analyze the nonlinear association with age. The cross-sectional and longitudinal association with quality of life (QOL) and QOL change and the impact on mortality were analyzed to enhance the understanding of the observed results. Results: Diabetes was associated with a reduced QOL at baseline (cross-sectional: beta = -0.069; P < 0.001), but not with a significant longitudinal QOL change. Mortality in patients with diabetes was increased (hazard ratio = 1.68; P < 0.005). This resulted in a loss of 0.14 life-years (P = 0.003) and 0.37 QALYs (P < 0.001). Results from generalized additive models indicated that the burden of diabetes is less pronounced in older subjects. Conclusions: The application of the proposed approach provides confounder-adjusted BOD estimates for the studied time horizon and can be used to compare the BOD across different chronic conditions. Curative efforts are needed to diminish the substantial diabetes-related QALY gap.","[Laxy, Michael; Hunger, Matthias; Stark, Renee; Holle, Rolf] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Laxy, Michael; Holle, Rolf] German Ctr Diabet Res, Neuherberg, Germany; [Meisinger, Christa; Kirchberger, Inge; Heier, Margit] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Epidemiol 2, Neuherberg, Germany; [Meisinger, Christa; Kirchberger, Inge; Heier, Margit; von Scheidt, Wolfgang] Augsburg Hosp, KORA Myocardial Infarct Registry, Augsburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Klinikum Augsburg,"Laxy, M (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",michael.laxy@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Laxy, Michael/IZE-7508-2023; Heier, Margit/AAT-5280-2020; Holle, Rolf/D-9333-2013; Meisinger, Christine/B-5358-2014","Laxy, Michael/0000-0001-8775-7417; Meisinger, Christa/0000-0002-9026-6544",Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; State of Bavaria; German Federal Ministry of Health; German Center for Diabetes Research - Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung),Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; State of Bavaria; German Federal Ministry of Health; German Center for Diabetes Research - Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The KORA (Cooperative Research in the Region of Augsburg) research platform was initiated and financed by Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and by the State of Bavaria.

Methods: The PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases were searched to identify eligible model based CEAs of cervical screening programs using human papillomavirus testing. The eligible CEAs were reviewed to investigate what screening strategies were chosen for analysis and how this choice might have influenced estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Selected examples from the reviewed studies are presented to illustrate how the omission of relevant comparators might influence estimates of screening cost-effectiveness. Results: The search identified 30 eligible CEAs. The omission of relevant comparator strategies appears likely in 21 studies. The ICER estimates in these cases are probably lower than would be estimated had more comparators been included. Five of the 30 studies restricted relevant comparator strategies to sensitivity analyses or other subanalyses not part of the principal base-case analysis. Such exclusion of relevant strategies from the base-case analysis can result in cost-ineffective strategies being identified as cost-effective. Conclusions: Many of the CEAs reviewed appear to include insufficient comparator strategies. In particular, they omit strategies with relatively long screening intervals. Omitting relevant comparators matters particularly if it leads to the underestimation of ICERs for strategies around the cost-effectiveness threshold because these strategies are the most policy relevant from the CEA perspective. Consequently, such CEAs may not be providing the best possible policy guidance and lead to the mistaken adoption of cost-ineffective screening strategies.","[O'Mahony, James F.; Normand, Charles] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Naber, Steffie K.; de Kok, Inge M.

These questionnaires comprise many detailed items resulting in lengthy administrations. Objectives: We set out to find the minimal number of items needed to retrieve 80% and 90% of the costs as measured by the Treatment Inventory of Costs in Patients with psychiatric disorders (TIC-P). Methods: The TIC-P is a validated patient-reported outcome measure concerning the utilization of medical care and productivity losses. The present study focused on direct medical costs. We applied data of 7756 TIC-P administrations from three studies in patients with mental health care issues. Items that contribute least to the total cost were eliminated, providing that 80% and 90% of the total cost was retained. Results: Average medical costs per patient were 658 over the last 4 weeks. The distribution of cost was highly skewed, and 5 of the 14 items of the TIC-P accounted for less than 10% of the total costs. The 80% Mini version of the TIC-P required five items: ambulatory services, private practice, day care, general hospital, and psychiatric clinic. The TIC-P Midi 90% inventory required eight items. Both had variance between the three samples in the optimal choice of the items. Conclusions: The number of items of the TIC-P can be reduced considerably while maintaining 80% and 90% of the medical costs estimated by the complete TIC-P. The reduced length makes the questionnaire more suitable for routine outcome monitoring.","[Timman, Reinier; Busschbach, Jan J.

The production process of a unique homogeneous good generates pollution, thus the increases in output associated with economic growth tend to rise the stock of pollution. Pollution is a negative production externality which thus feeds back on the economy lowering the level of output; in order to compensate for such a negative effect associated with economic development, pollution is reduced by publicly funded abatement activities. We firstly consider a Solow-type framework in which economic and environmental policies are completely exogenous, and then we move to a Ramsey-type context in which they are endogenously determined. We analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the model economy through numerical simulations, and we consider two different specifications Of the production function (a globally concave and a convex-concave technology) in order to stress the role that eventual poverty traps might play on both economic and environmental outcomes. We show that in the convex-concave technology framework, whenever rich regions are substantially rich diffusion can help poor regions to escape their poverty traps; if however they are not rich enough diffusion might condemn also rich regions to collapse. However, even if rich regions are particularly rich whenever the pollution externality is strong, the whole spatial economy might be doomed to collapse. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of malaria-specific knowledge has been commonly assumed to be an important barrier to engagement in behaviors that prevent malaria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that accounts for the endogeneity of maternal knowledge in household's ownership of insecticide-treated nets (ITN), child's use of ITN, and household's protection against mosquitos (HSP). We account for the endogeneity of maternal knowledge through discrete factor and standard instrumental variable estimators. We find significant causal effects of maternal knowledge on the child's use of ITN and HSP but no significant effect on ownership of ITN. The causal effects of maternal knowledge on the use of ITN and HSP are strikingly larger in magnitude than the effects in the reduced form models.
