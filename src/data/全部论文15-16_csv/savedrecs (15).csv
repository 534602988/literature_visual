In 2015, over 1 mil. people refugees, displaced persons and other international migrants have made their way to the EU. The EU has confronted the problem of illegal and extensive international migration. Recently it has been even more in the public focus of international organizations and separate countries as the influx of refugees has rapidly increased due to economic problems and wars in the Middle East. Most people have developed an attitude towards refugees and refugee crisis, as the topic has received a lot of publicity and media coverage. Therefore, a research concerning the socio-demographic factors influencing attitudes towards refugees is relevant offering an insight to the background of people's attitudes. Research results show that attitude towards refugees is highly associated with income level, country of residence, employment status and family structure but not with age, gender, education level and place of living. The results of research can be useful for understanding and perhaps solving many unwanted social problems, for example racism and discrimination based on religion or social status. Knowing the factors influencing the attitude formation eases the creation of multicultural society with a very diverse population in globalization context.","[Butkus, Mindaugas; Matuzeviciute, Kristina] Siauliai Univ, Dept Econ, Visinskio Str 19, Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Maciulyte-Sniukiene, Alma] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol, Sauletekio Ave 11, Vilnius, Lithuania",Siauliai University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Butkus, M (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Dept Econ, Visinskio Str 19, Shiauliai, Lithuania.",mindaugo.butkaus@gmail.com; alma.m@splius.lt; matuzeviciute@gmail.com,"Mačiulytė-Šniukienė, Alma/ABH-7320-2020; Butkus, Mindaugas/E-3973-2017","Butkus, Mindaugas/0000-0003-2381-5440",,,,,21,5,5,1,26,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,286,294,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800037,0

Cultural tourism as a form of tourism which is dominated by interest in material and intangible cultural certainly in the area of Slavonia and Baranja has potential for further growth and development. For many years Slavonia and Baranja suffers a period of stagnation in the economic, social and cultural terms (according to the Croatian Employment Service in 2016, the number of unemployed persons amounted to 74,257 which is almost 26.67% of the total unemployed in Croatia). The main reasons are the negative demographic trends and a continuous process of depopulation (according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the rate of natural increase in 2014 in Viroviticko-podravska county is -408, Pozesko-slavonska county is -294, Brodsko-Posavska county is -545, Osijeckobaranjska county is -1260, Vukovarsko-srijemska county -619). Also, there is emigration of the labor force (according to the Central Bureau of Statistics in 2014 from Slavonia and Baranja moved the 4860 working-age population) and high unemployment especially the young population (according to the Croatian Employment Service, the number of unemployed young people aged 20 24 years at the level of Slavonia and Baranja is 9380). We also note the lack of vision and strategy development, market unprepared and insufficient marketing presentation of Slavonia and Baranja and its primary attractions (archaeological sites, ecologically preserved area, gastronomic oenological offer), and the slow modernization of tourism infrastructure (accommodation and catering facilities, roads, railways, themed trails, attractions, as a function of selective tourism). Certainly tourism -Cultural tourism is one of the activities that in Slavonia and Baranja can have a powerful effect on stopping the degradation process, reducing the economic and social gap, increase the level of employment and brand identity on the tourist map of the Croatian, and that is the purpose of this paper is to prove. Aims of the paper: To investigate the current offer of cultural tourism in the region of Slavonia and Baranja, detect strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, determine the potential for further development of cultural tourism, as well as the channels through which they share cultural tourism Slavonia and Baranja be present on the domestic and foreign markets target groups.","[Cucic, Drazen] Fac Econ Osijek, Dept Natl & Int Econ, Osijek, Croatia; [Ricl, Jesenka] Croatian Soc Cultural Tourism, Osijek, Croatia; [Marsic, Mirta Bijukovic] Univ JJ Strossmayer, Dept Cultural Studies, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Cucic, D (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Dept Natl & Int Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",dcucic@efos.hr; jesenkaricl@gmail.com; mbmarsic@kulturologija.unios.hr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,885,890,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600088,0

To identify personality types, Rotter's locus of control concept as well as Fromm's personality theory is applied. Some methodological issues related to propensities are presented.

The Moravian-Silesian Region is highly affected by mining activities, therefore the use of these brownfields, i.a. for cogeneration units, appears to be economically and environmentally appropriate.

Although China has gradually liberalised its economy since the end of the 1970s, which was in compliance with its economic reforms, a new situation in China's trade and investment relations with the third countries occurred after China's entrance into the World Trade Organization (WTO). The object of the paper is to compare the development of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in China and the EU after China's entrance into the WTO and to specify the Chinese-EU investment relations. Data about investment flows point out a different development in both countries in 2001-2015. The EU and China are an important source to each other as well as recipients of FDI. Despite the growing values of China's FDI flows, the untapped potential between China and the EU is obvious. The cultivation of the investment area in China and the new investment policy in the EU should help them to fulfil their long-term strategies and investment plans.","[Fojtikova, Lenka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Havlickovo Nab 38a, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Fojtíková, L (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Havlickovo Nab 38a, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz,"Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023",,Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,This paper was supported by the Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness - Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.,,32,10,10,0,14,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,144,155,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200015,0

They have implemented fundamental reforms of their whole institutional systems and finally joined the European Union in the year 2004. During this process the most significant changes, which were directly influenced by opening of these economies in the reality of globalisation, have been seen on the labour markets. From the policy point of view the labour markets are always considered as crucial for social and macroeconomic stability of economies. This forces the economists to constant empirical research in this field. In this context the aim of the article is to conduct comparative analysis of the unemployment phenomena in the four countries. For this purpose wavelet analysis was applied. In the research a discrete wavelet transformation was used, which has been recently effectively used for analysis of macroeconomic indicators. The empirical research was conducted for the years 1998-2016 and it was based on the Eurostat data. In the research the following hypothesis was verified: the phenomenon of unemployment in the case of Poland, Slovakia and Hungary is formed in a quite similar way, whereas in Czech Republic the situation on the labour markets is mainly determined by factors of different nature.","[Hadas-Dyduch, Monika] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econometr Sand Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Hadas-Dyduch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",monika.dyduch@ue.katowice.pl; adam.balcerzak@umk.pl; michal.pietrzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Hadaś-Dyduch, Monika/G-7959-2015; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Hadaś-Dyduch, Monika/0000-0001-9281-7488; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,26,11,11,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,595,+,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800074,0

More recently, this argument has been challenged by showing that knowledge spillovers mainly flow through social networks, which may or may not be localized at various geographic scales. We further scrutinize the conjecture of geographically bounded knowledge spillovers by focusing on knowledge flows between academia and industry. Looking into citations to non-patent literature (NPL) in 2385 Dutch polymer patents, we find that citation lags are shorter on average if Dutch rather than foreign NPLs are cited. However, when excluding individual and organizational self-citations, geographically proximate NPLs no longer diffuse faster than foreign NPLs. This suggests that knowledge is not 'in the air' but transferred by mobile individuals and/or direct university-industry collaboration. Our findings moreover suggest an important role of international conferences in the diffusion of recent scientific knowledge.","[Heinisch, Dominik; Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Heinisch, Dominik; Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, Int Ctr Higher Educ Res INCHER Kassel, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Nomaler, Onder; Lintsen, Harry] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Buenstorf, Guido] Leibniz Inst Econ Res Halle IWH, Halle, Germany; [Frenken, Koen] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Frenken, Koen] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden",Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel; Eindhoven University of Technology; Utrecht University; Lund University,"Buenstorf, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.;Buenstorf, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Int Ctr Higher Educ Res INCHER Kassel, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.;Buenstorf, G (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Econ Res Halle IWH, Halle, Germany.",buenstorf@uni-kassel.de,"Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201; Buenstorf, Guido/0000-0002-2957-5532",,,,,38,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

During this period the economy shrunk to nearly half their size. In 2015, the intensive tensions between new Syriza-led government in Greece and European authorities led to liquidity crisis and introduction of capital controls. As a result, the speculations over Greek's exit from Eurozone and the return of own national currency intensified. In the theory, the devaluation might support aggregated demand through a reduction of foreign trade deficit if the Marshall-Lerner condition holds. With respect to huge imbalances in the Greece economy, the potential devaluation of (re)new(ed) national currency would have to be enormous to restore the economic balance. Unfortunately, the empirical evidence shows less convincing results, especially in the case of developing countries that were hit by crisis. Since the troubles of Greek economy have not been solved yet, the potential external devaluation of (re)new(ed) national currency is still considered to be a theoretical alternative to the internal devaluation applied through fiscal austerity.

Increasing levels of health insurance losses could increase the scale of potential malpractice claims, boosting medical malpractice losses, or could embody an improvement in medical care quality, which will reduce malpractice losses. Our results for a state panel data set from 2002 to 2009 demonstrate that health insurance losses are negatively related to medical malpractice insurance losses. An additional dollar of health insurance losses is associated with a $0.01-$0.05 reduction in medical malpractice losses.

It is obvious that effective information technology management required for substantial improvement of productivity is impossible without integration of KM principles into the organizational culture. This paper aims to examine the impact of organizational culture development on the enhancement of KM performance in Russian manufacturing companies which take advantage of global market integration. Recent literature emphasizes that there is a strong positive relation between organizational culture on the one hand, and knowledge generation, distribution and application on the other within manufacturing companies. We focused on analyzing data from companies' annual reports and from 140 completed copies of a questionnaire that was specially designed to test the aforementioned hypothesis. The results show that organizational culture development is a significant challenge that must be tackled over several directions: successful implementation of KM approach assumes reduction of control-oriented culture domination, along with monitoring over personnel attitudes and change of value perspectives. From the practical point of view this paper suggests a support for KM initiatives in manufacturing companies and sheds some light on the nature of KM development barriers related to organizational culture.","[Kelchevskaya, Natalya; Chernenko, Ilia; Kolyasnikov, Maxim] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, 19 Mira Str, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Kelchevskaya, N (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, 19 Mira Str, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",n.r.kelchevskaya@urfu.ru; i.m.chernenko@urfu.ru; m.s.kolyasnikov@gmail.com,"Chernenko, Ilia M/O-4190-2015; Kelchevskaya, Natalia/R-6547-2016; Kolyasnikov, Maxim/O-5920-2015","Kelchevskaya, Natalia/0000-0001-7278-026X;",,,,,14,1,1,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,847,854,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800105,0

First, why was Greece bailed-out in 2010? Second, why the Greek economy collapsed despite the largest bail-out in global financial history? Third, was the electoral mandate of the Syriza government for ending austerity while remaining in the eurozone contradictory? There are conflicting answers to all three questions and the paper compares the answers of the so called dominant narrative to those provided by the counter-narrative of the eurozone crisis. The paper reaches the following conclusions. First, the primary motivation for the bail-out of Greece was the maintenance of European and global financial stability. Second, although programme implementation was less successful in Greece than in other programme countries the catastrophic collapse of the Greek economy had more to do with the programme itself than its implementation. Third, the meaning of democratic decision-making in the Euro-group needs re-appraisal and must go beyond seeing the Greek demand of a policy reversal in the eurozone as simply a clash of democratic mandates in a 19 member monetary union. Political unity will not only improve efficiency but also democracy and accountability in eurozone policymaking.","[Kitromilides, Yiannis] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Kitromilides, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,39,2,2,1,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63.0,2,,,SI,,175,194,,10.2298/PAN1602175K,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,DM2YK,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376213800003,0

An exponential GARCH (EGARCH) event study framework is used to analyse the stock returns. The results show that large price shocks, positive and negative, are likely to be followed by positive market returns. Moreover, the results show an increase in the beta of stocks in the years following a large price shock. The overall results therefore support the Uncertain Information Hypothesis. However, beginning in 2008, return patterns more closely reflect those hypothesised by the Efficient Market Hypothesis, possibly due to increased participation by international investors. The observed returns following large price increases and decreases can be partially explained by changes in the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate and the trading behaviour of foreign investors.","[Kolaric, Sascha; Kiesel, Florian; Schiereck, Dirk] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Kolaric, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, Darmstadt, Germany.",kolaric@bwl.tu-darmstadt.de,,"Kiesel, Florian/0000-0001-7380-5190; Kolaric, Sascha/0000-0003-2656-9206",,,,,35,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The resulting BMA framework can find a parsimonious PVAR specification, thus dealing with over parameterization concerns. We use these methods in an application involving the euro area sovereign debt crisis and show that our methods perform better than alternatives.

Unlike previous cost-push explanations such as an overheated labour market and oil prices, this article suggests that social benefit expenditures are a potential cause of stagflation. We investigate the impact of social benefit expenditures on stagflation in the U.S. over the 1950-2014 period by employing an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration, which was developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith. The influence of social benefit expenditures on economic growth and inflation and unemployment rates is estimated. The empirical results from the U.S. suggest that economic growth responds negatively to social benefit expenditures, while inflation and unemployment rates are both positively associated with social benefit expenditures. Thus, government-led rigid welfare could contribute to stagflation in the U.S. Instead of increasing people's happiness, the over-burdened welfare system could push people into economic malaise. This stagflation risk shouldn't be ignored. These results are important for U.S. policymakers and can inform other governments characterized by high levels of well-being.","[Li, J.

According to monetary theories, it was primarily designed to influence the monetary multiplier. However, both academics and practitioners have long questioned whether such a requirement has an impact on commercial bank bond holdings and the output of real economy through price fluctuations in the bond market. In this paper, we set up a macroeconomic equilibrium model that includes central banks, commercial banks, and enterprises, covering a wide range of credit markets, bond markets, and commodity markets. In order to explore the transmission effect of the reserve requirement ratio policy through the bond market, we introduced the method of limit solutions using non-homogeneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients. We empirically examine the existence and effectiveness of transmission mechanisms by applying the TRAMO technique and a cointegration test based on large sample data from China. The results show that the adjustment of the reserve requirement ratio affects the asset structure of commercial banks, bond market prices, and ultimately the real economy.","[Ma, Li] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Wuhan University; Feng Chia University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",National Social Science Key Project [15AJL003]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Chinese Education Ministry [13YJA790083],National Social Science Key Project; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Chinese Education Ministry,"This paper is the staged achievement of the Design of Chinese monetary policy under the new normal (sponsored by the National Social Science Key Project, No 15AJL003), and the Research on the new trends and transmission mechanism of open market operations in post crisis era (sponsored by the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Chinese Education Ministry, No 13YJA790083)",,24,2,2,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

These two ranges identify two fundamentally different notions, the micro and macro Frisch elasticity, respectively. Due to the different definitions, there are two restrictions in the micro Frisch elasticity that are relaxed in the macro Frisch elasticity. First, the micro Frisch elasticity focuses only on prime-aged married males who are the head of their household, while the macro Frisch elasticity represents the whole population. Second, the micro Frisch elasticity only incorporates intensive margin fluctuations in hours, while the macro Frisch elasticity includes both intensive and extensive margin fluctuations. This paper finds that relaxing these two restrictions causes estimates of the Frisch elasticity to increase from 0.2 to between 2.9 and 3.1, indicating that these two restrictions can explain the gap between the microeconometric estimates and the calibration values. However, this paper demonstrates that these estimates of the macro Frisch elasticity are sensitive to the estimation procedure and also the exclusion of older individuals, implying that calibration values used for macroeconomic models should be selected carefully.

Economic globalization may be a principal determinant of unsustainable development: it may generate sustainable processes of production and environmental preservation in one industry/area to the detriment of another industry/area. Governance reactions to globalization should focus on the mutuality of governance mechanisms even beyond established multilevel governance systems. We attempt to address these increasing aspects by elaborating on worldwide interregional connectedness related to globalizing output and trade. We develop primary empirical research for our principal case study that determines that the expansion of international networks of output and trade creates significant challenges for successful environmental state governance. The environmental state's strengths to regulate for sustainability are confronted by mechanisms of economic globalization that require intricate kinds of shared interdependency throughout distant areas.

Using a bivariate asymmetric GJR-GARCH model, we first document that OTC (exchange traded) trading volume shows consistent bi-(uni) directional Granger causality to our volatility estimates, consistent with greater responsiveness of the OTC (exchange traded) market to changes in market-wide (idiosyncratic) risks. Second, we report significant contemporaneous and lagged positive causality of OTC derivatives volume on spot/futures volatility confirming that the Sequential Information Arrival Hypothesis (SIAH) applies. Third, we find that the one-way causality from OTC to futures volumes is mainly driven by heterogeneous investor beliefs: trading volume provides an indication on how (private) information is dispersed and held at different levels rather than proxying information signal itself. After rejecting execution venues' substitutability, we advocate for systematic clearing and netting of OTC positions through a unique clearing house and reporting rules to identify speculation in line with Mifid (Art. 59) proposals.

The features of investment in human capital are defined such as return from investments to the human capital, wear and tear of human capital, the nature of investments into the person, investments effectiveness, and the process of investing. There are some levels of human capital formation, for example, physiological, intellectual and spiritual. Besides differentiation of the categories capital and potential it is expedient to consider the property rights which can arise on intangible objects at the certain individual. The average return of receiving the higher economic education is calculated. The article describes the features of tangible and intangible alienation of human capital at the different levels.

Estimating the causal relationship between family size and economic status is complicated because the same factors that increase family size may also affect the labour market outcomes of women. The birth of twins is used as an instrument to address this problem. Amongst women with children under age 13, the IV estimates indicate that a larger family induced by a twin birth adversely affects women's labour supply and earnings. Amongst women with older children, the IV results show no evidence of a causal effect, despite significant OLS relationships. Finally, we compare these results to estimates produced using a twins' sex composition instrument. Estimates using this instrument are very close to the estimates using twin births and imply that the labour market consequences of childbearing disappear over time.","[Silles, Mary A.] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Silles, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",M.Silles@hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,8,10,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The problem of competitiveness within this stream of economic theory is mainly approached as the need to find the answers why some countries develop faster and become richer than others, i.e. how an economy gains the ability of sustainable growth, which makes it more competitive than others. In contrast to this point of view, the neoclassical economic theory shifts the focus of the research of growth and competitiveness from the national economy to the field of resource allocation and enterprise efficiency. The logic is simple-competitive enterprises make competitive economy and vice versa, competitive economy creates an environment that encourages the competitiveness of enterprises. The research concept of this paper is based on the synthesis of these two approaches. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the importance of innovative activity in improving competitiveness. The paper provides a comparative analysis of the competitiveness of the Balkan countries, with special attention to determining the correlation between the indicators of innovative activities and the competitiveness of the observed countries. For the purpose of this analysis, a method of dependency analysis has been applied, as well as correlation analysis. Then, the analysis of the results of empirical survey on innovation activities of enterprises in Serbia is performed.

Since the outset of the euro zone (EZ) crisis, a new Berlin-Frankfurt axis is providing leadership in reforming the EZ's governance. But, in doing so, it is Germanizing EZ peripheral economies. If the process is successfully completed, the EZ would become a more powerful actor in the IMS and the euro would be more attractive for international investors. However, it is unclear if this stronger EZ would be a stabilizing or a destabilizing force for the IMS. On the one hand, a more German euro-zone could have a structural current account surplus, and that could be deflationary and problematic. On the other hand, this reborn EZ will be much more inclined to regulate financial markets (following the ordoliberal German tradition) and, to some extent, to manage exchange rates. Finally it is unclear to what extent the EZ would be willing to politically promote the international role of the euro.","[Steinberg, Federico] Real Inst Elcano, Madrid, Spain; [Steinberg, Federico] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Steinberg, F (通讯作者)，Real Inst Elcano, Madrid, Spain.;Steinberg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",fsteinberg@rielcano.org,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,3,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The ideological confrontation of the two systems had ended at the beginning of the 1990(s). However, the battle of the chief weapons exporters for this very profitable field of the global trade is hardly over. The yearly foreign sales of the arms producing industries are counted in tens of billions dollars. The global economic recession of the last few years only serves to exacerbate the competition within these markets. The advantage in the WME production acquired by the US and Russia in the course of the 40-years long arms race of the 20th century gave them the position of the main players in the global WME markets. As a result, for almost a quarter of a century the US and Russia has been the chief exporters of the WME. This article is devoted to the analysis of the state and behavior of the military expenses of the two countries the US and Russia. The amount of the military expenses directly corresponds to the scale of the military production and the volumes of the arms sales in the global market. This topic of research has long and truly held an important place within the scientific interests of the author of this article (2005, Tulyakova, 2015). Using the vast statistical data of the international and national analytical centers, the article analyses the export behavior of the US and Russia in value terms at the beginning of the new century, as well as the physical flow of weapons, the commodity structure of the sales of both countries, and compares the groups of their partner-countries in regards of the WME sales. The completed research leads to the conclusion that the export positions of both countries are comparable, despite the notable difference in GDP and GDP per capita.","[Tulyakova, Irina R.] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Tulyakova, IR (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",irinatulyakova@mail.ru,"TULYAKOVA, IRINA/G-3032-2015","TULYAKOVA, IRINA/0000-0001-9947-4959",,,,,14,2,2,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2236,2244,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800278,0

Workers, who are imperfectly mobile across sectors, vote on whether to subsidize ailing sectors, thereby redistributing income but also distorting the labor allocation. We present three main findings. First, redistributive policies are more likely to arise in a small open than in a closed economy for a broad range of parameters. Second, if a redistributive policy is adopted in both situations, income differences across sectors tend to be lower in the open economy. Third, the possibility to redistribute income across sectors raises the political support for trade liberalization in the first place. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agents can choose whether to provide labor or to become firm owners and compete in the industry. The idea that entry is determined through occupational choice has major implications for the economy's dynamics. Particularly, the results show that economic dynamics are governed by endogenous volatility in the determination of both the number of industry entrants and in the growth rate of output. Consequently, we argue that occupational choice and the structural characteristics of the endogenous market structure can act as both the impulse source and the propagation mechanism of economic fluctuations.","[Varvarigos, Dimitrios] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Gil-Molto, Maria Jose] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Leicester; University of Sheffield,"Varvarigos, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",dv33@le.ac.uk,"Gil-Molto, Maria J./ABB-4010-2020; Gil-Molto, Maria Jose/JNE-2374-2023","Gil-Molto, Maria J./0000-0001-6247-1228; Varvarigos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0337-9493",,,,,35,2,2,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The content analysis focused on the disclosures made by 41 corporations and 82 foundations. A total of 131 collaboration cases available on the websites and 95 cases disclosed in relation to CSR were examined. The research allowed to identify the key factors determining the amount of information on philanthropic partnerships displayed by corporations and charities on their websites and in CSR reports. In the case of corporations, the NGO being a corporate foundation and belonging to the group of biggest donors were the most important factors. As far as NGOs are concerned, the major factors were the NGO being, or not, a corporate foundation and the amount of donations as a percentage of its total revenue.","[Waniak-Michalak, Halina; Michalak, Jan] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Accounting, Social Sci Econ, Matejki 22-26 St, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Waniak-Michalak, H; Michalak, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Accounting, Social Sci Econ, Matejki 22-26 St, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",hwaniak@uni.lodz.pl; janwmichalak@gmail.com,"Waniak-Michalak, Halina/ABH-4130-2020; liang, lemmy/G-5232-2017","Waniak-Michalak, Halina/0000-0003-1857-4339; Michalak, Jan/0000-0003-2722-0233",,,,,64,8,8,2,43,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, the firm usually has to make a decision about its future production and hence its supply at the moment when neither the price nor the market demand is known yet. In this case, firms are often recommended to keep inventory as a buffer stock to cover the fluctuations in future market demand. Keeping high inventory as well as providing insufficient supply is penalized by the increased costs which decrease the competitiveness of the firm on the market. The main goal of this paper is to derive the optimal production strategy of the demand following firm. The optimal production strategy should lead to a firm supply, which could satisfy the demand and will be not connected with keeping too much inventory. The dynamic optimization problem of the firm is solved. As there are different expectations about the growth of the aggregate demand during the phases of expansions and contractions in the economy, the optimal production strategy of the firm varies with the cyclic movement of the demand. The proposed firm strategy is to supply an amount of good according to the last growth of market demand, the change in the consumer confidence and the level of firm inventory. The strategy was tested on the aggregate data of the Czech economy.","[Zavacka, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Závacká, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",jana.zavacka1@vsb.cz,"Závacká, Jana/L-2475-2015",,Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava [SP2016/116]; Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava within Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava; Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava within Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,"The paper was funded by Student Grant Competition of VSB-TU Ostrava within the project SP2016/116, and within Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness - Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.",,11,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,832,841,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200088,0

Such instability is closely associated with the presence of structural breaks in relevance to policy events on Australian carbon policies. The study makes use of weekly Australian wholesale electricity prices spanning the period from June 8th, 2008 to March 30th, 2014 along with linear and non-linear unit root testing methodologies. The results provide supportive evidence that the Australian electricity market can be described as a less stable electricity market, which implies that a high degree of market power is exercised by generators across regional markets.

A substantial literature on optimal redistribution in the absence of risk has evolved since Mirrlees's original contribution. The literature on the income tax as a social insurance device is more limited. It has largely assumed that households are ex ante identical so unequal earnings are due to risk alone. We provide a general treatment of the optimal income tax under risk when households differ in ability. We characterize optimal marginal tax rates and interpret them in terms of redistribution, insurance, and incentive effects.

D is called a revenue equivalence domain if every implementable allocation rule satisfies the revenue equivalence property. We introduce the notions of monotonic transformations in differences, which can be interpreted as extensions of Maskin's monotonic transformations to quasilinear environments, and show that if D admits these transformations then it is a monotonicity and revenue equivalence domain. Our proofs are elementary and do not rely on strenuous additional machinery. We illustrate monotonic transformations in differences for settings with finite and infinite allocation sets.

We analyze a moral-hazard model in which, given the endogenous audit probability, taxpayers may choose to comply or not with their tax obligation. The main result is that the imposition of a minimum tax, whereby taxpayers need to pay a tax on wealth no lower than a certain amount, can be Pareto efficient. The result hinges upon a critical level of wealth endowment: wealthy economies should ask for a minimum tax payment from all taxpayers; poor economies should only rely on income taxation, and allow taxpayers to be able to get away with their tax obligations. Minimum taxation, therefore, is like a luxury good and only rich economies can afford it.","[Caserta, Maurizio; Reito, Francesco] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, I-95100 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Reito, F (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95100 Catania, Italy.",reito@unict.it,,,,,,,16,1,2,1,16,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We analyze two contrasting driving forces: On the one hand, online consumers cannot physically inspect the products prior to purchase. This provides the firm with the incentive to hide low-quality products online. On the other hand, consumer reviews and the larger market size may attract higher qualities to the online market. Using a simple yet flexible framework, we show that the firm's choice of a marketplace can disclose or hide product quality. If marginal cost is convex in quality, the firm's choice will be characterized by a cut-off quality level, below which the firm will choose the online market. If marginal cost is concave in quality, both high-end and low-end qualities may choose the online market, leaving the physical market to intermediate qualities. Overall, we show that consumer reviews can alleviate, but do not eliminate, the lemons problem. The pooling result in the case of concave-in-quality marginal cost provides a caveat for empirically testing the effectiveness of online consumer-review mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our method departs from the original one, in that we run statistical tests of equality in probabilities, instead of computing conditional probabilities. We estimate a matrix of Revealed Relatedness Indexes using 2005 data and we then investigate which upscale products in which Portugal didn't develop comparative advantage are more related to products in which the country is currently specialized.

Understanding public attitudes about water management and, especially water conservation, may become increasingly salient as even humid regions attempt to shift to demand side management. Using the contingent valuation method we estimate the willingness to pay for water conservation measures. Our analysis finds that younger individuals, individuals with higher education and higher income are more likely to say they are willing to pay for these measures. We also find that valuations depend on how the water source is managed. People who are on municipal water or a shared well are willing to pay more for public water conservation measures than individuals who have their own well or access to a spring. In addition we find that older individuals and respondents who have ancestors in the area are less willing to pay for water conservation methods. Lastly, using bivariate probit analysis that focuses on averting behavior and our contingent valuation question, we find that there are some unmeasured characteristics of respondents that make them more likely to participate in private averting behavior and increase theft willingness to pay for public water conservation measures.

Problem-solving abilities therefore become a basic competence to survive in modern societies. In the problem-solving process, the development of creativity is required to break through dilemmas. School education aims to cultivate students' decision-making and problem-solving competence. Nonetheless, the educational approaches and contents in Taiwan stress too much on mastery learning, and ignore the development of curiosity and creative potential. Aiming at the students in the department of business management in national universities in Taiwan, total 300 copies of questionnaires are distributed, and 187 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 62%, in which each retrieved copy is regarded as a valid sample. The research findings show that Curriculum Design presents partially positive effects on Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration in Creative Potential Developing and Background Variables reveal significant moderating effects on the correlations between Curriculum Design and Creative Potential Developing.","[Lin, Pao-Cheng] Taoyuan Innovat Inst Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Lin, Pei-Kuan] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan",Asia University Taiwan,"Lin, PK (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.",pclin@tiit.edu.tw; linpk@asia.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The overall goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of computing technologies to raise educational performance and non-cognitive outcomes and identify what program components are most effective in doing so. To achieve this aim we pool the data sets of five separate studies about computer technology programs that include observations of 16,856 students from 171 primary schools across three provinces in China. We find that overall computing technologies have positive and significant impacts on student academic achievement in both math and in Chinese. The programs are found to be more effective if they are implemented out-of-school, avoiding what appear to be substitution effects when programs are run during school. The programs also have heterogeneous effects by gender. Specifically, boys gain more than girls in Chinese. We did not find heterogeneous effects by student initial achievement levels. We also found that the programs that help students learn math but not Chinese have positive impacts on student self-efficacy.

We estimate single-equation models as well as bivariate probit models that address the potential endogeneity of PPD. We find that this relatively prevalent mental illness reduces the probability the couples are married (by 22-24 %) as well the probability that they are living together (married or cohabiting) (by 24-26 %) 3 years after the birth of the child. Models stratified by relationship status at the time of the birth indicate that PPD makes it more likely that unions dissolve (particularly among baseline cohabitors) and less likely that unions are formed (particularly among baseline non-cohabitors). The findings contribute to the literature on the effects of mental illness on relationships, to the broader literature on socioeconomic status and health, and to the more specific scientific and policy literatures on the effects of PPD on families.","[Reichman, Nancy E.] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Corman, Hope; Noonan, Kelly] Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences; Rider University,"Reichman, NE (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",nancy.reichman@rwjms.rutgers.edu; knoonan@rider.edu,,,Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University,Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University(Princeton University),"We are grateful to the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University for funding support, to Tatana Cepkova, Victoria Halenda and Farzana Razack for excellent research assistance, and Cynthia Bansak, Karen Conway and participants at UNH Dept. of Econ.

The theoretical part of the study firstly highlights the differences between trade-off theories and pecking order theories. In the empirical part there are then proved some significant relationships between financial indicators (debt/equity ratio and return on equity) of homogenous data sample from the Czech branch of building area. The aim of the study is to prove the differences between the capital structure development that are based on the type of the Czech companies' ownership in the selected NACE industrial branch and to point out some other particularities. The contribution of the paper is a comparison of the theory as well as practice of this issue in the Czech Republic. For pooled sample there are used selected financial indicators of 57 building companies, all with turnover of more than CZK 1.5 billion. The choice of this criterion was a result of a change in efficiency in Czech economy observed in the selected period. We can assume that this factor will have low influence on the selection of financial resources of large corporations. We may even say that for large companies the availability of financial resources remain unchanged. We have obtained annual data from 2004 to 2011. Due to such short estimation period, but the width of pooled sample on the other hand, it is used generalized method of moments (GMM) panel regression. There are also arguments of motivation to analyse business branch of building specifically. Moreover, an analysis is split according to ownership of companies into two categories, for the Czech and foreign owners. Based on the recent literature there has been made and tested three hypotheses. Results of the article have clearly proved the separation of managers from owner's positions. On the top of that, domestic companies are not pushed to distribute the realized profit so much as foreign owners that prefer the return of their means invested into business. There is also a suggestion of future interests in research focused on other Czech business branches, too.","[Ruckova, Petra; Heryan, Tomas] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Rucková, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Opava, Czech Republic.",ruckova@opf.slu.cz; heryan@opf.slu.cz,"Ruckova, Petra/AAA-6030-2021; Heryan, Tomas/J-6424-2015","Ruckova, Petra/0000-0001-8558-6212; Heryan, Tomas/0000-0003-2027-7149",,,,,15,4,4,1,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our study employs newly constructed financial condition indices that incorporate banking variables extensively. We apply a non-linear Logistic Vector Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LVSTAR) model for investigating instabilities in the link between the financial sector and economic activity. The LVSTAR model allows for non-linear dynamics and regime changes between low and high stress regimes. It can also replicate the regime-specific amplification effects shown by our theoretical model. The amplification effects, however, change over time. Specifically after the Lehman collapse, we observe the presence of strong non-linearities and amplification mechanisms for some euro area countries. Thus, these strong amplification effects appear to be related to rare but large events, and to a low-frequency financial cycle. Prior to the financial crisis outbreak we find corridor stability even if the financial sector shock takes place in a high stress regime. More important seems to be the shock propagation over time in the economy. Only with the occurrence of rare but large events we find strong endogenous feedback loops and a loss of stability as described by the high stress regime of our theoretical model. The economy leaves the corridor of stability and is prone to adverse feedback loops. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the impact of regional corruption on the management quality of firms within the manufacturing sector in Central and Eastern Europe. The empirical challenge is that bureaucrats' bribing practices may evolve in response to firm behaviors, and that regional corruption is measured with error. To identify causal effects, our preferred specifications use a difference-in-differences methodology. We measure the manufacturing industries' exposure to corruption using their level of dependence to contract institutions. Controlling for regional and manufacturing industry - country fixed effects, we find that firms in more contract dependent industries, located in more corrupt regions, tend to have lower management quality, a more centralized decision-making process, and a lower level of education among administrative staff. In more corrupt regions, contract dependent firms are also characterized by lower investment in R&D, and smaller product markets. We show that our findings are not likely to be driven by omitted variables, outliers, or reverse causality. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (4) (2015) 1014-1034.

When these sources are connected through a network, then proper aggregation of this information by an individual involves taking into account the structure of this network The inability to aggregate properly may lead to various types of distortions. In our experiment, four agents all want to find out the value of a particular parameter unknown to all. Agents receive private signals about the parameter and can communicate their estimates of the parameter repeatedly through a network, the structure of which is known by all players. We present results from experiments with three different networks. We find that the information of agents who have more outgoing links in a network gets more weight in the information aggregation of the other agents than under optimal updating.

Building on the narrative approach by Romer and Romer (1989, 2010) and augmented by Mertens and Ravn (2013), we use financial news to identify structural shocks in a vector autoregressive model of daily sovereign CDS premia for eleven European countries. To estimate how these shocks transmit across borders, we use data on cross-country bank exposures to sovereign debt. Our results indicate that cross-border financial exposures constitute important transmission channels: a reduction of exposure to overall Greek debt by one standard deviation is associated with a reduction in the response of the sovereign CDS to a shock to Greek sovereign risk by about three quarter in the average country. Decomposing these effects, we find that exposures to sovereign debt constitute significant transmission channels, while we find no robust support for transmission through bank-to-bank lending.

This externality can enable an incumbent to use loyalty discounts to effectively divide the market with its rival and raise prices. If loyalty discounts also include a buyer commitment to buy from the incumbent, then loyalty discounts can also deter entry under conditions in which ordinary exclusive dealing cannot. With or without buyer commitment, loyalty discounts will increase profits while reducing consumer welfare and total welfare as long as enough buyers exist and the entrant does not have too large a cost advantage. These propositions are true even if the entrant is more efficient and the loyalty discounts are above cost and cover less than half the market. We also prove that these propositions hold without assuming economies of scale, downstream competition, buyer switching costs, financial constraints, limits on rival expandability, or any intra-product bundle of contestable and incontestable demand.

This paper takes a closer look at the determinants of current accounts in the European economies. The standard set of the determinants discussed in the past literature is extended by factors that seem to have played an important role in Europe over the last decades. Such factors relate particularly to the dynamics of consumption and connected to this credit concession to the private sector, as well as to the increasingly preponderant presence of low-productive and non-tradable construction activities in the economic structure. Additionally, the growth of per capita output played a significant role in explaining current account positions. This evidence speaks in favour of the catching up still going on within Europe.","Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Gehringer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",agnieszka.gehringer@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,46,12,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2015,42.0,4,,,,,769,793,,10.1007/s10663-014-9276-9,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CR6UV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361484200005,0

We present experimental evidence on its validity in the domain of objective probabilities. Our battery of lottery pairs includes simple one-stage lotteries, two-stages compound lotteries, and their actuarially equivalent one-stage lotteries. We find violations of ROCL and that behavior is better characterized by a source-dependent version of the Rank-Dependent Utility model rather than Expected Utility Theory. Since we use the popular 1-in-K random lottery incentive mechanism payment procedure in our main test, our experiment explicitly recognizes the impact that this payment procedure may have on preferences. Thus we also collect data using the 1-in-1 payment procedure. We do not infer any violations of ROCL when subjects are only given one decision to make. These results are supported by both structural estimation of latent preferences as well as non-parametric analysis of choice patterns. The random lottery incentive mechanism, used as payment protocol, itself induces an additional layer of compounding by design that might create confounds in tests of ROCL. Therefore, we provide a word of caution for experimenters interested in studying ROCL for other purposes, such as the relationship between ambiguity attitudes and attitudes toward compound lotteries, to carefully think about the design to study ROCL, payment protocols and their interaction with the preferences being elicited.

We formally study re-election concerned politicians in a federal setting with term limits. The theory presented highlights an important aspect of federalism, that voters participate in elections for office holders at multiple levels of government. We augment a standard model of political career concerns to allow for multilevel governance, and to provide a central office holder with the ability to make transfers to a local politician. We find that when elections are staggered, an equilibrium exists with positive transfers. These transfers are made to sabotage political challengers. These transfers are non-partisan and are an artifact of the electoral dynamics as generated by the electoral calendar and politicians' career concerns. We test the implications of the theory using data on transfer receipts of U.S. governors, confirming the importance of election timing and term limits as determinants of transfers.","[Hickey, Ross] Univ British Columbia Okanagan Campus, IKBSAS Unit ART 229 8, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia Okanagan,"Hickey, R (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia Okanagan Campus, IKBSAS Unit ART 229 8, 3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",ross.hickey@ubc.ca,,"Hickey, Ross/0000-0002-3953-9869",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I am grateful to the editor for helpful comments and suggestions, and to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for financial support.

A dataset of 18 industrial countries is used for the analysis. Panel VAR models are estimated for the groups of countries classified by country characteristics. The primary empirical findings are as follows. First, positive government consumption shocks lead, if anything, to real exchange rate depreciation, but the direction of the current account response varies across samples. In particular, positive government consumption shocks lead to real exchange rate depreciation under a floating exchange rate regime. Second, international capital mobility has a significant impact on the effects of government consumption shocks. The depreciation of the real exchange rate and the improvement of current account are larger in countries with low international capital mobility than those with high capital mobility. Third, albeit less robust, the depreciation of the real exchange rate and the improvement of the current account are larger in countries under more flexible exchange rate regimes than those under less flexible exchange rate regimes. In addition, the current account improves more in countries with high trade openness than those with low trade openness. Standard theories do not fully explain these empirical patterns. Thus, these findings suggest a need for further theoretical development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the financialization of commodity markets led to an increase in correlations and in the probability for joint extremes. However, we identify structural breaks in commodity markets that temporarily led to a breakdown of expected statistical patterns and of traditional dependence structures among commodities.

Bubbles are modeled using mildly explosive bubble episodes that are embedded within longer periods where the data evolve as a stochastic trend, thereby capturing normal market behavior as well as exuberance and collapse. Both the PWY and PSY estimates rely on recursive right-tailed unit root tests (each with a different recursive algorithm) that may be used in real time to locate the origination and collapse dates of bubbles. Under certain explicit conditions, the moving window detector of PSY is shown to be a consistent dating algorithm even in the presence of multiple bubbles. The other algorithms are consistent detectors for bubbles early in the sample and, under stronger conditions, for subsequent bubbles in some cases. These asymptotic results and accompanying simulations guide the practical implementation of the procedures. They indicate that the PSY moving window detector is more reliable than the PWY strategy, sequential application of the PWY procedure, and the CUSUM procedure.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand; Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Yale University; University of Auckland; University of Southampton; Singapore Management University; Macquarie University,"Phillips, PCB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, Box 208281, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",peter.phillips@yale.edu,"PHILLIPS, Peter Charles Bonest/D-1444-2009; YU, Jun/D-1455-2009","Yu, Jun/0000-0003-2360-5873; Shi, Shuping/0000-0001-8571-3066; Phillips, Peter C B/0000-0003-2341-0451","NSF [SES 09-56687, SES 12-58258]; Financial Integrity Research Network (FIRN); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 [MOE2011-T2-2-096]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1258258] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Financial Integrity Research Network (FIRN); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The current article and its empirical companion Testing for Multiple Bubbles: Historical Episodes of Exuberance and Collapse in the S&P 500 build on work originally circulated in the paper Testing for Multiple Bubbles and its technical supplement.

Moreover, we recover distributions of the underlying true causes from their error-laden measurements to deliver consistent estimators. We obtain uniform convergence rates and asymptotic normality for estimators of covariate-conditioned average marginal effects, faster convergence rates for estimators of their weighted averages over instruments, and root-n consistency and asymptotic normality for estimators of their weighted averages over control variables and regressors. We investigate their finite-sample behavior using Monte Carlo simulation and apply new methods to study the impact of family income on child achievement measured by math and reading scores, using a matched mother-child subsample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Our findings suggest that these effects are considerably larger than previously recognized, and depend on parental abilities and family income.

The politics of anti-corruption policies in India: A subnational study,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corruption; Elections; Institutions; India,RENT-SEEKING; INSTITUTIONS; GOALS; REDISTRIBUTION; PARTIES; ECONOMY,"This paper extends political budget cycles theory to corruption, where an incumbent government considers controlling corruption based purely on political considerations. Using panel data on 30 Indian states during the 1988-2009 period, I investigate whether the timing of elections affects the incumbent government's efforts to control corruption. Consistent with the idea that an incumbent politician might exert greater effort to control corruption during election years, I find that scheduled elections (as opposed to unscheduled elections) are associated with an increase in the number of corruption cases registered by the respective state's anti-corruption agencies, although the substantive impact is small. Furthermore, I find this effect in 'swing states' where margin of victory for the incumbent in previous elections has been narrow. On the other hand, there is no effect of scheduled elections on corruption cases being investigated by anti-corruption agencies. Thus, the argument that Indian politicians engage in 'cheap talk' on controlling corruption, especially during election periods is suggestive at best.

Neither method assumed a priori causality and forecasts were generated without additional assumptions about regressors. Tendency survey data was used within the Bayesian averaging of classical estimates (BACE) framework and dynamic factor models (DFM). Two methods for regressor selection were applied within the BACE framework: frequentist averaging (BA) and frequentist (BF) with a collinearity-corrected version of the latter (BFC). Since models yielded multiple forecasts for each period, an approach to combine them was implemented. Results were assessed using in-and out-of-sample prediction errors. Although results did not vary significantly, best performance was observed from Bayesian models adopting the frequentist approach. Forecast of the unemployment rate were generated with the highest precision, followed by rate of GDP growth and CPI. It can be concluded that although these methods are atheoretical, they provide reasonable forecast accuracy, no worse to that expected from structural models. A further advantage to this approach is that much of the forecast procedure can be automated and much influence from subjective decisions avoided.","[Bialowolski, Piotr] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Warsaw, Poland; [Kuszewski, Tomasz; Witkowski, Bartosz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Bialowolski, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Warsaw, Poland.",piotr.bialowolski@sgh.waw.pl,"Bialowolski, Piotr/AAI-8393-2020","Bialowolski, Piotr/0000-0003-4102-0107; Witkowski, Bartosz/0000-0003-0940-0265; Kuszewski, Tomasz/0000-0001-7334-3926",National Bank of Poland,National Bank of Poland,"The authors would like to thank the National Bank of Poland for financing this work within its scientific grant framework - grant Prognozowanie podstawowych wskaznikow makroekonomicznych z wykorzystaniem usredniania bayesowskiego oraz modeli czynnikowych w oparciu o dane z testow koniunktury.

Cooking technologies, such as manufactured fuel-efficient cookstoves, that mitigate the negative effects of traditional cookstoves exist, but adoption rates are low. The international development community debates whether this low adoption of fuel-efficient cookstoves is due to a lack of adequate product information or due to household financial constraints. We ran Vickery second-price auctions in rural Uganda to elicit willingness to pay for fuel-efficient cookstoves, comparing the effect of informational marketing messages and time payments on willingness to pay. A randomized trial tested the following marketing messages: This stove can improve health, This stove can save time and money, and both messages combined. None of the messages consistently increased willingness to pay. In a second experiment we compared willingness to pay for two different contracts, one with payment due within a week and one with equal installment payments over 4 weeks. Consistent with household financial constraints, time payments raised willingness to pay by 40%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, given the inherently risky environments in which farmers in the developing world operate, poor households are thought to be caught in a risk-induced poverty trap; specifically, poorer households that are unable to insulate themselves from consumption risk avoid these risks by opting for lower return, lower risk agriculture, and thus do not benefit from technological innovation. Using a series of laboratory experiments in a South African setting, this paper examines whether the provision of a framed index insurance product induces individuals to opt into riskier but potentially more profitable activities. To do so, we use a simple gambling task with real monetary prizes to elicit subjects' risk preferences. Elicited risk preferences are applied to the uptake of credit and insurance in a series of framed insurance simulation games. Experiment participants are small-scale and subsistence urban food growers. Overall, the results of the experiment lend empirical weight to the poverty-trap argument. Firstly, a high degree of risk aversion is evident among the sample. Secondly, risk-averse individuals are more likely to opt into traditional agriculture (reflected as traditional seeds in the experiment) and are less likely to use modern farming inputs that require financing (high-yield varieties) despite the availability of insurance. The results indicate that the provision of index insurance is not a panacea for the problem of promoting technology diffusion to small-scale farmers in the developing world, but that residual production risk and basis risk must be considered in the contract design.

Attitudes to tax evasion and to benefit fraud,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,3040; 2340; Benefit fraud; Fiscal morale; Tax evasion; Value function,PROSPECT-THEORY; WELFARE-STATE,"In neoclassical economics the decision to evade tax is analysed in the same way as the decision to commit benefit fraud. Both decisions depend on the net expected utility that a 'representative individual' will derive from the gamble. If the financial loss a community experiences when there is tax evasion is equal to the financial loss experienced when there is benefit fraud, there is no reason to expect any difference in individuals' attitudes towards these crimes. However, in practice, individuals are far more condemnatory of benefit fraud than of tax evasion. Prospect theory is applied to explain this difference of attitude as well as why individuals are more likely to commit tax evasion than benefit fraud. Moreover, when comparing attitudes and behaviour towards public finance crimes in different countries, the salience of the public finances in individuals' lives, together with the perceived prevalence of illegal behaviours, is important. A comparison of attitudes in Italy and in the UK indicates that Italians are more likely to more heavily punish these crimes and to commit these crimes. The present study sheds insight when explaining why 'gamekeepers' who call for the harshest punishments are the individuals who are more likely to act as 'poachers' themselves. There is a distinction between what individuals wish for themselves in a 'private-person' role and what they wish for others in a 'public-citizen' role - would-be poachers are harsh gamekeepers.

Our main objective in this paper is then to propose an equilibrium unemployment approach to retirement decisions that allows us to derive the positive and normative features of retirement decisions when search and matching frictions are considered. Two main conclusions emerge: the retirement decision of unemployed workers depends on the labor-market frictions whereas that of employed workers does not; the existence of search externalities makes the retirement age of unemployed workers intrinsically suboptimal. Considering Social Security policy issues, we show that the complete elimination of the implicit tax on continued activity is not necessarily welfare-optimizing in a second best world where the labor market equilibrium suffers from distortions.

Post-Soviet Armenia has few formal barriers to gender equality but is also characterized by a patrilineal kinship system and traditional gender roles. In contrast to research conducted in Western countries, we find that girls increase their performance more than boys in response to competition in a running task. We find no gender differences in the other three tasks we explore: skipping rope, a mathematical task, and a verbal task. We also find no difference in the willingness to compete in either the mathematical or the verbal task. In line with previous research, we find that boys are less altruistic and more risk taking than girls, and that the latter gap appears around the age of puberty. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper advances an explanation for these results by separating credit to the private sector into credit to firms and credit to households. The empirical analysis shows that credit to firms is responsible for the positive growth effect, while the higher occurrence of crises is mainly due to credit to households. The events of the last decade, where fast credit expansion led to crises and very little growth, can be understood as a shift in the composition of credit towards its household component.","Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Angeles, L (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",luis.angeles@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Angeles, Luis/0000-0002-9254-4608",,,,,19,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The desired response is that individuals accumulate private assets for retirement. Whether this actually takes place, is of paramount relevance for scientists and policy makers. We take Germany as an example: Twenty years of pension reform have transformed the monolithic German pension system into a multipillar system. Formerly generous public pension benefits are gradually being reduced, whereas substantial incentives are granted to occupational and private saving schemes. Has this transition worked out? We survey the reform steps and households' reactions: How did individuals adjust their labor market behavior? How did private and occupational pension plans take off? How do behavioral adjustments vary in the population? Most Germans adapted to the new situation. Both actual and expected retirement decisions changed and the share of households without supplementary pensions decreased from 73% to 39% in little more than a decade. This is a remarkable success. Nonetheless, households with low education, low income and less financial education did neither adjust their retirement behavior nor pick up supplementary pension plans and are thus likely to face difficulties in bridging the gap arising in future pension income.","[Boersch-Supan, Axel] Tech Univ Munich, Munich Res Inst Econ Aging MEA, MPISOC, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Boersch-Supan, Axel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bucher-Koenen, Tabea; Coppola, Michela; Lamla, Bettina] MPISOC, Munich Res Inst Econ Aging MEA, Cologne, Germany; [Bucher-Koenen, Tabea] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",Technical University of Munich; National Bureau of Economic Research; Tilburg University,"Bucher-Koenen, T (通讯作者)，MPISOC, Munich Res Inst Econ Aging MEA, Cologne, Germany.",bucher-koenen@mea.mpisoc.mpg.de,,,,,,,81,16,18,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We characterize growth equilibria and find that a balanced growth path not necessarily exists if households are subject to ad hoc borrowing constraints. Growth, inequality, and risk are positively related in our model, but we also identify a hump-shaped relationship between welfare and risk, indicating a tradeoff relationship between risk-pooling and growth in the determination of welfare. The growth rate responds to changes in the wealth distribution and displays transitional dynamics towards the balanced growth path. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Two cohorts of anonymous, patient, and risk-neutral buyers arrive over two periods. Buyers in the first cohort arrive in period one, are privately informed about the distribution of their values, and then privately learn the value realizations in period two. Buyers in the second cohort are last-minute shoppers that already know their values upon their arrival in period two. The seller can fully commit to a long-term contract with buyers in the first cohort, but cannot commit to the future contractual terms that will be offered to second-cohort buyers. The expected second-cohort contract serves as an endogenous type-dependent outside option for first-cohort buyers, reducing the seller's ability to extract rents via sequential contracts. We derive the seller-optimal equilibrium and show that, when the seller cannot condition on future contractual terms (either explicitly or implicitly), she endogenously generates a commitment to maintaining high future prices by manipulating the timing of contracting.

We show that in a New Keynesian model, unilateral trade liberalization reduces welfare due to terms-of-trade deterioration, creating an incentive for a trade agreement. For realistic parameter values, the value of an agreement, which cuts tariffs by one percentage point, is 0.5-2% of consumption, much larger than in trade models. The intuition for this result hinges on endogenous labor supply. (C) 2015 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Both agents with lower wealth and those with greater ability tend to supply more labor, implying that labor supply decisions may have an equalizing or unequalizing effect depending on the relative importance of the two sources of heterogeneity. Moreover, these decisions are central to the extent of mobility observed in an economy. The relationship between mobility and inequality is complex. For example, a reduction in the interest rate and an increase in the wage rate reduce capital income inequality and allow upward mobility of the ability-rich. However, the increase in the labor supply of high-ability agents in response to higher wages raises earnings dispersion and thus has an offsetting effect. As a result, high mobility can be associated with an increase or a decrease in overall income inequality.","[Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] EHESS, Marseille, France; [Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Turnovsky, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",sturn@u.washington.edu,,,French National Research Agency [ANR-08-BLAN-0245-01]; University of Washington; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-BLAN-0245] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); University of Washington(University of Washington); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This paper is a revised version of a plenary address presented to the 17th International Conference on Macroeconomic Analysis and International Finance held in Rethymno, Crete, 2013.

Such a model, parametrized and validated using a variety of data restrictions, can rationalize observations about input choices and size patterns typical of many developing countries. Using counterfactual experiments, we show that firms' optimal responses to the tax environment are effective in reducing efficiency losses. As a consequence, tax distortions only account for 13% of the gap in output per worker between an undistorted economy and the benchmark. Credit constraints account for 44% of this gap. However, the interaction between the cost of capital and credit constraints appears to be the most important source of misallocation and can explain up to 85% of the difference in output per worker between the benchmark and first-best.

In any period, the risky arm yields either a success or a failure, and the first success reveals the risky arm to dominate the safe one. When payoffs are public information, the ensuing free-rider problem is so severe that equilibrium experimentation ceases at the same threshold belief at which a single agent would stop, even if players can coordinate their actions through mediated communication. When payoffs are private information and the success probability on the risky arm is not too high, however, the socially optimal symmetric experimentation profile can be supported as a sequential equilibrium for sufficiently optimistic prior beliefs, even if players can only communicate via binary cheap-talk messages.

The analysis highlights a form of acyclicity in the interim belief structure of global games, which allows us to formalize a selection criterion, iterated generalized half-dominance. This criterion is shown to be a unique global game selection when noise distributions satisfy a regularity condition. A similar logic also applies to the perfect foresight dynamics of Matsui and Matsuyama (1995); an iterated generalized half-dominant equilibrium is a unique globally stable state when agents are patient enough. The criterion is especially useful for games with more than two asymmetric players, and can be easily applied to local interaction games with an arbitrary network structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Despite sound fundamentals and a substantial reduction in its traditional external vulnerabilities, the Brazilian real has been one of the most volatile currencies over recent years. The article argues that this has been the result of the surging exposure of foreign investors in an increasingly complex set of very short-term domestic currency assets. Following a Minskyan analysis, we demonstrate that the changing nature of Brazil's external vulnerability confirms both the inherent and endogenous instability of international capital flows and DECs' subordinate role in the international financial system.

While it has frequently been thought of as a substitute to pretrial bargaining and litigation, in fact, parties may be able to reach a settlement privately while engaged in the arbitration process. Consequently, the institutional design may influence the bargaining. We develop a theoretical model of pre-arbitration bargaining that is able to identify the impact of the institutional features on its success. A detailed data set from arbitration proceedings in Italy is analyzed. The exogenous heterogeneity in the composition of the panel of arbitrators allows us to illustrate its effect on bargaining. We show that the number of arbitrators used interacts with their experience and independence to reduce uncertainty and facilitate settlement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The ability to forecast prices enables economic agents to make optimal decisions for the present and future. In this article, we investigate if and how gasoline prices can be forecast in retail gasoline markets that are subject to high-frequency, asymmetric price cycles known as Edgeworth Price Cycles. We examine a series of purchase timing derision rules and a series of feasible forecasting algorithms for updating those rules over time. We find that, in the presence of cycles, agents in our five Australian markets can systematically reduce purchase prices below market average the equivalent of 11 to 15 U.S. cents per gallon, using simple decision rules and feasible forecasting algorithms.

Reclassification risk arises because the health conditions of individuals evolve over time, while a typical health insurance contract only lasts for one year. Thus, a change in the health status can lead to a significant change in the health insurance premium. We measure welfare gains from introducing explicit insurance against this risk in the form of guaranteed renewable health insurance contracts. We find that in the current institutional environment individuals are well-sheltered against reclassification risk and they only moderately gain from having access to these contracts. More specifically, we show that employer-sponsored health insurance and public means-tested transfers play an important role in providing implicit insurance against reclassification risk. If these institutions are removed, the average welfare gains from having access to guaranteed renewable contracts exceed 4% of the annual consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

When integrated with the inefficient retailer, the monopoly producer does not foreclose the rival retailer due to an output-shifting effect. This effect can induce the integrated firm to engage in below-cost pricing at the wholesale level, thereby rendering integration procompetitive. Output shifting arises with homogeneous and differentiated products. Moreover, we show that integration with an inefficient retailer emerges in a model with uncertainty over retailers' costs, and this merger can be procompetitive in expectation.","[Reisinger, Markus] WHU, Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany; [Tarantino, Emanuele] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; University of Mannheim,"Reisinger, M (通讯作者)，WHU, Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany.",markus.reisinger@whu.edu; tarantino@uni-mannheim.de,"Tarantino, Emanuele/AAI-9650-2021","Tarantino, Emanuele/0000-0003-4179-8488",,,,,39,26,28,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

By studying the probability density function of recurrence intervals, we find symmetric profiles for both the positive and negative occurrence thresholds, which can be fitted with stretched exponential functions. The probability density function further scales with the mean interval as the unified functional form for different thresholds. We further study the dependence of the conditional probability density function and the scaled mean condition recurrence interval on the previous recurrence interval, and demonstrate the existence of short memory in recurrence intervals. The result from detrended fluctuation analysis exhibits long-term correlations, where the detrended fluctuation function decays as an exponential function, with an exponent between 0.5 and 1. Based on the results of the analysis of recurrence intervals, we construct a hazard function and define a loss probability in order to evaluate risk in financial markets. To our surprise, a crossover is found in the loss probability plot of the stock index and its futures market, which sheds light on the issue of value at risk (VaR) overestimation (underestimation) based on recurrence interval analysis of complex financial markets. The study would enable one to improve risk estimation and is useful for management of risks in financial markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I consider a principal agent model with linear production and exponential utility, whose explicit solution allows me to show how allocations are distorted for incentive reasons, and how access to hidden savings further alters allocations. I solve the model by applying a stochastic maximum principle, where the co-state variables from the agent's optimization problem become state variables for the principal's problem of choosing an optimal contract. I show that the main effect of moral hazard is a distortion on the effort margin, with a smaller effect on the intertemporal consumption allocation. Access to hidden savings shuts down the intertemporal distortions and increases the effort distortion. I also show how the optimal contracts can be implemented via a constant equity share, a constant flow payment, and a constant tax on savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This changing pattern posed several fundamental questions and uncertainties regarding the broader picture of energy efficiency and environmental protection. One of them refers to absolute changes in energy use efficiency in the transport sector over time and the ways of measuring efficiency. Traditional scientific approaches conceptualized to measure efficiency of energy use do not address annual dynamics of changes in the energy use in a given sector per capita. Thus, they are not precise enough for political and methodological purposes as they do not reflect the exact amount of energy consumed in the respective countries and societies. This paper shows a possible solution to this problem and a new perspective on measuring energy efficiency by using the product generational dematerialization (PGD) indicator. The PGD indicator allows for measuring energy efficiency as a dynamic change of consumption and population occurring simultaneously. Thus, it provides an extension to the traditional methodology commonly used for measuring efficiency. To visualize a practical application of this approach, the paper provides an example of evaluating energy efficiency in the transport sector in the EU-27 in 2000-2010. The results of the analysis show a clear materialization tendency in the transport sector (the energy consumption change exceeded the population growth) until 2007 and a reverse tendency (dematerialization) between 2008 and 2010.

To test this hypothesis, we first consider a natural experiment that introduced a performance leaderboard into computer-based high school courses. The result was a 24 percent performance decline. The decline appears to be driven by a desire to avoid the leaderboard; top performing students prior to the change, those most at risk of appearing on the leaderboard, had a 40 percent performance decline, while poor performing students improved slightly. We next consider a field experiment that offered students complimentary access to an online SAT preparatory course. Sign-up forms differed randomly across students only in whether they said the decision would be kept private from classmates. In nonhonors classes, sign-up was 11 percentage points lower when decisions were public rather than private. Honors class sign-up was unaffected. For students taking honors and nonhonors classes, the response depended on which peers they were with at the time of the offer, and thus to whom their decision would be revealed. When offered the course in a nonhonors class (where peer sign-up rates are low), they were 15 percentage points less likely to sign up if the decision was public. But when offered the course in an honors class (where peer sign-up rates are high), they were 8 percentage points more likely to sign up if the decision was public. Thus, students are highly responsive to their peers are the prevailing norm when they make decisions.","[Bursztyn, Leonardo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bursztyn, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,UCLA Anderson Price Center; California Center for Population Research,UCLA Anderson Price Center; California Center for Population Research,"We thank Nava Ashraf, Ernesto Dal Bo, Leigh Linden, Aprajit Mahajan, Torsten Persson, Bruce Sacerdote, Noam Yuchtman, numerous seminar participants, and Lawrence Katz, Andrei Shleifer, and four anonymous referees for comments and suggestions.

We analyze the reaction of present debt accumulation to past debt stock, incorporating the possibility of endogenously determined structural breaks in this reaction function.

We review previous experiments that have directly manipulated cognitive load and summarize their findings. We report the results of two new experiments where participants engage in a digit-memorization task while simultaneously performing a variety of economic tasks including: (1) choices involving risk, (2) choices involving intertemporal substitution, (3) choices with anchoring effects, (4) choices over healthy and unhealthy snacks, and (5) math problems. We find that higher cognitive load reduces numeracy as measured by performance in math problems. Moreover, within-subject analysis indicates that cognitive load leads to more risk-averse behavior, more impatience over money, and (nominally) more likelihood to anchor. We do not find any evidence that cognitive load increases impatience over consumption goods or unhealthy snack choices. Exploiting the panel nature of our data set, we find that those individuals who are most sensitive to cognitive load, as measured by a large drop in their own math performance across 1- and 8-digit memorization treatments, are driving much of the effect.

Capital flows drive exchange rates by altering the balance sheets of financiers that bear the risks resulting from international imbalances in the demand for financial assets. Such alterations to their balance sheets cause financiers to change their required compensation for holding currency risk, thus affecting both the level and volatility of exchange rates. Our theory of exchange rate determination in imperfect financial markets not only helps rationalize the empirical disconnect between exchange rates and traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, it also has real consequences for output and risk sharing. Exchange rates are sensitive to imbalances in financial markets and seldom perform the shock absorption role that is central to traditional theoretical macroeconomic analysis. Our framework is flexible; it accommodates a number of important modeling features within an imperfect financial market model, such as nontradables, production, money, sticky prices or wages, various forms of international pricing-to-market, and unemployment.","[Gabaix, Xavier; Maggiori, Matteo] Harvard Univ, NYU, Stern Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; New York University,"Gabaix, X (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, NYU, Stern Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Gabaix, Xavier/B-8227-2008; PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,"NSF [0820517, 1424690]; Dauphine-Amundi Foundation; NYU CGEB; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1424690, 0820517] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Dauphine-Amundi Foundation; NYU CGEB; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the NSF (0820517,1424690), the Dauphine-Amundi Foundation, and the NYU CGEB.

This introductory review highlights common themes among the papers, chiefly the primacy of economic growth in driving social as well as economic policies, the interconnection between different policy arenas, the persistence of a particular development model despite sharp changes in policy direction, and the dominant role of the state. The authors collectively conclude that economic policy was both innovative and effective in the first two to three decades of independence, particularly in simultaneously delivering on both rapid economic growth and improved social welfare. In more recent decades, economic growth and social welfare for a significant minority of residents have begun to diverge. Looking ahead, there appears to be a consensus that slower GDP growth, higher productivity, a relative shift from manufacturing to services and from a global to a regional market orientation, and more vibrant and innovative local private entrepreneurs, are necessary for continued economic development. There is also consensus that public policy must pay greater attention to directly meeting the growing social needs of the population, especially the poor, low-income, elderly and other vulnerable groups.","Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lim, LYC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,4,6,6,0,25,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the impact of financial frictions on the U.S. business cycle. The analysis compares the original Smets and Wouters model (2003, 2007) with an alternative version augmented with the financial accelerator mechanism a la Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1996, 1999). Both versions are estimated using Bayesian techniques over a sample extended to 2012. The analysis supports the role of financial channels, namely the financial accelerator mechanism, in transmitting dysfunctions from financial markets to the real economy. The Smets and Wouters model, augmented with the financial accelerator mechanism, is suitable to capture much of the historical developments in US. financial markets that led to the financial crisis. The model can account for the output contraction in 2008, as well as the widening in corporate spreads, and supports the argument that financial conditions have amplified the U.S. business cycle and the intensity of the recession.

In a first-best allocation of resources, unemployment benefits should provide perfect insurance against the unemployment risk, layoff taxes are necessary to induce employers to internalize the social cost of dismissing an employee but should not be too high in order to allow a desirable reallocation of workers from low to high productivity jobs, hiring subsidies are needed to partially offset the adverse impact of layoff taxes on job creation, and both unemployment benefits and hiring subsidies should be almost exclusively financed from layoff taxes. I obtain an optimal rate of unemployment which is, in general, different from the output maximizing rate of unemployment. When workers have some bargaining power, which prevents the provision of full insurance, it is optimal to reduce the rate of job creation below the output maximizing level in order to lower wages and increase the level of unemployment benefits. Thus, layoff taxes should typically exceed hiring subsidies which generates enough surplus to finance at least some of the unemployment benefits. The inclusion of moral hazard does not change this conclusion, unless workers have low bargaining power. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A set of different specifications for the monetary policy reaction function are empirically evaluated using monthly data for 1998-2014. Overall, the performance of the estimated policy rules is surprisingly good. Chinese monetary policy displays countercyclical reactions to inflation and leaning-against-the-wind behaviour. The paper shows a notable increase in the overall responsiveness of Chinese monetary policy over the course of the estimation period. The central bank interest rate is unresponsive to economic conditions during the earlier years of the sample, but response becomes significant in later years. This finding comports with the view that the monetary policy of the People's Bank of China has come to place greater weight on price-based instruments. A time-varying estimation procedure suggests that the two monetary policy objectives are generally assigned to different instruments. The money supply instrument continues to be utilized to control the price level.

Results show that outsider governors appointed by the federal government spend more on public goods (in this case, education) than governors who had originally been elected, and then were reappointed by the federal government, when there is competition in the legislature (as measured by party share). But in cases where the ruling party is strong (virtual monopoly) or when party share is low enough that governors can do little to raise party support, governors with local ties spend more on public goods. This non-monotonic (inverted U-relationship) between expenditures on public goods and party share suggests that formal mechanisms of accountability (administrative subordination to the central government) work worse under political monopoly, while informal mechanisms (such as local ties and strong networks) work worse under political competition to encourage public goods spending.

We examine the applicability of Basu's insight in an environment in which the type of the bribeharassment or nonharassmentis endogenously determined, and it is not feasible to legalize the giving of nonharassment bribes. We find that in such an environment Basu's proposal, in and of itself, yields mixed results: in one case it reduces even the prevalence of nonharassment bribes, and improves social welfare. However, in another case it is shown to be counter-productive, i.e., it reduces social welfare while failing to eliminate bribery. Our analysis finds parameter values that determine which of the two cases will prevail, and points to additional policies aimed at strengthening the legal institutions which, in conjunction with Basu's proposal, will help reduce bribery.","Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Oak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Level 3,10 Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",mandar.p.oak@gmail.com,,"Oak, Mandar/0000-0002-7018-8737",,,,,14,15,18,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Despite being a late starter (1971) and given a number of obstacles, not least the high degree of openness of the Singapore economy to trade and capital flows, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has built up a high degree of credibility within a relatively short space of time and delivered low and stable inflation. Although financial development has been government made rather than market-driven, proactive and sensible policies have built on Singapore's long history as a regional trading hub to turn Singapore into a premier financial center in terms of foreign exchange trading, offshore money market intermediation and asset management. Nonetheless, some challenges remain: How monetary policy can deal with asset price bubbles and deflationary pressures and steer a careful course to maintain price stability without jeopardizing Singapore's transitory restructuring process to achieve sustainable economic growth.","Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Wilson, P (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",peterwilson@smu.edu.sg,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,18,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The article has two core objectives. First, I argue that, based on earlier findings, a different interpretation of Sraffa's contribution to economics is possible from those that have been predominant so far and that hold that Sraffa's approach is primarily a contribution to the theory of relative prices. I consider the two main interpretations of Sraffa's price system in this regard. Whilst these differ in important aspects, I argue that they share a core feature, namely, an approach to prices based on the concept of economic or social order understood as a final outcome independent of the possible process through which this outcome can be achieved. Second, I am interested in highlighting a number of connections between Wittgenstein's works post-Tractatus and certain developments contained in Sraffa's Unpublished Papers. Taking Wittgenstein post-Tractatus as the starting point, I proceed to argue that core concepts employed by Wittgenstein are compatible with and reinforce an interpretation of Sraffa's contribution in terms of a morphological and comparative analysis of the economic foundations of surplus-based societies. From this perspective, the notions of 'surveyable representation' and 'snapshot' are employed to characterise an analysis in which agents are guided by social rules, and the concept of mechanical causality is discarded. This convergence of Sraffa's and Wittgenstein's approaches does not, however, exclude differences concerning the social facts investigated and the use of analytical tools such as mathematics.","[Arena, Richard] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Arena, Richard] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, MSHS Sud Est Reseau Natl MSH, CNRS, Nice, France; [Arena, Richard] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Arena, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Nice, France.",arena@unice.fr,,,,,,,69,4,5,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We attempt a more direct study of network efficiency by examining routing games in a flow over time model. Flows over time are commonly used in transportation research. We show that in this model, by reducing network capacity judiciously, the network owner can ensure that the equilibrium is no worse than a small constant times the optimal in the original network, for two natural measures of optimality.

This result is robust if we instrument the bonus share in the capital market divisions with the strength of incentive pay in unrelated bank divisions like retail banking. Moreover, pre-crisis incentive pay appears too strong for an optimal trade-off between trading income and risk, which maximizes the net present value of trading income.

Comparing households with and without children finds that the mandate substantially affected banking behavior, with an 8.6 percent relative increase in transaction account ownership. When households transition into account ownership, results indicate large increases in credit card ownership (89%), and household durable goods (55%). Similar changes are not seen in loan use, weekly expenditures, or vehicle ownership. Additional evidence from a panel dataset indicate declines in the use of fringe bank credit, informal loans, and debt after households transition into bank account ownership. In total, evidence suggests that an important effect of owning a bank account is improved access to credit cards which enables durable good consumption.","[Fitzpatrick, Katie] Seattle Univ, 901 12th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122 USA",Seattle University,"Fitzpatrick, K (通讯作者)，Seattle Univ, 901 12th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",fitzpatk@seattleu.edu,"Fitzpatrick, Katie/AAJ-8660-2020","Fitzpatrick, Katie/0000-0003-0652-4334",Brookings Institution; FDIC's Center for Financial Research; Filene Research Institute,Brookings Institution; FDIC's Center for Financial Research; Filene Research Institute,"I owe special thanks to Rebecca Blank, Mike Brewer, Stacy Dickert-Conlin, Jane Dokko, Gary Engelhardt, William Gale, Hilary Hoynes, Jeffrey Kling, and Jeffrey Kubik for helpful guidance and comments.

We find that foreign firms charge about 28% higher prices than Chinese exporters after controls for firm productivity and product-destination-year fixed effects. We provide evidence that the multinational price premium is significantly correlated with the knowledge-based intangible assets within multinationals. The multinational price premium is substantially higher for firms with headquarters in more innovative countries and for firms that have technicians and managers sent from their parent companies. The price premium is even higher for majority- or wholly owned affiliates than for minority-owned affiliates. Our results imply that in addition to generating efficiency gains, multinationals can also enhance the capability of foreign affiliates to produce quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use non-linear difference-in-differences methods to estimate the quantile treatment effects of the reform. We find that the effects of the child care expansion were positive in the lower and middle parts of the earnings distribution of exposed children as adults, and negative in the uppermost part. We complement this analysis with local linear regressions of the child care effects by family income. We find that most of the gains in earnings associated with the universal child care program relate to children of low income parents, whereas upper-class children actually experience a loss in earnings. In line with the differential effects by family income, we estimate that the universal child care program substantially increased intergenerational income mobility. To interpret the estimated heterogeneity in child care effects, we examine the mediating role of educational attainment and cognitive test scores, and show that our estimates are consistent with a simple model where parents make a tradeoff between current family consumption and investment in children. Taken together, our findings could have important implications for the policy debate over universal child care programs, suggesting that the benefits of providing subsidized child care to middle and upper-class children are unlikely to exceed the costs. Our study also points to the importance of universal child care programs in explaining differences in earnings inequality and income mobility across countries and over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

If a player uses a partner strategy, both players can fairly share the social optimum; but a co-player preferring an unfair solution will be penalized by obtaining a reduced payoff. A player using a competitive strategy never obtains less than the co-player. A player using a zero-determinant strategy unilaterally enforces a linear relation between the two players' payoffs.

The effect even prevails in markets with complete and symmetric fundamental information. We further show that (ii) in treatments with the joint inflow of cash and traders, prices crash to fundamentals towards maturity of the asset. The analysis of traders' beliefs reveals that (iii) despite fundamental values staying constant, beliefs about fundamentals co-move with upwardly trending prices.

The present-value model of consumption implies that the excess-consumption-assets ratio can be expressed as a function of the present discounted value of expected excess-consumption growth rate and expected asset returns. Because expected returns and expected excess-consumption growth rate are unobserved variables, we use an unobserved-component approach to extract them from the observed history of realized returns and excess-consumption growth rate.

However, because of demand-side or supply-side heterogeneities, the probability of switching among sectors differs across people. This paper reveals these differences through restoring a long-period, individual-level panel dataset from China's Urban Household Survey for 1986-2009. We find that both for people who started working for the first time and those who switched jobs, the sector choice depends on personal characteristics. In particular, women and people with higher educational attainment or a previous white-collar job are more likely to join the tertiary sector and less likely to join the primary sector. These effects are substantial even if the macroeconomic variables used in conventional structural change theories are controlled. They are also robust in various periods and at more detailed industry levels. Our research suggests that it is important to pay greater attention to the labor composition when making policy related to economic structural change.","[Mao, Rui] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Finance, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Beijing Normal University,"Xu, JW (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Finance, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",rmao@zju.edu.cn; jianweixu@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation [71403237]; Project of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education in China [14YJC790089]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ14G030008]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [14JGC100]; Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department [Y201430552]; Collaborative Innovation Center for Rural Reform and Development,National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education in China; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Beijing Social Science Foundation; Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department; Collaborative Innovation Center for Rural Reform and Development,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 71403237), the Project of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education in China (Grant No. 14YJC790089), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. LQ14G030008), the Beijing Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 14JGC100), and the Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department (No. Y201430552).

However, caution was soon expressed that correlating series with secular' trends was likely to be misleading. After some discussion of methods, linear detrending by least-squares estimation became the default method. By the 1920s, however, some voices of dissent expressed the view that linear detrending was likely to be inappropriate in some, even many, cases. This led to a number of innovative methodological developments, including rolling window estimation, moving integration, non-linear trends, structural breaks, sigmoid-type smooth adjustment functions, the beginnings of stochastic trend modelling and the construction of smoothers' and filters. Although generally failing to have an impact at the time, all substantially predate their current use in econometrics. This paper establishes precedence for these ideas and recreates some of the empirical examples and early simulations.","[Mills, T. C.] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Patterson, K.

First, it employs the VARMA-AGARCH model developed by McAleer et al. (2009) within the context of BEKK framework using West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent as proxies for oil market and S&P stocks as a proxy for US stock market. Secondly, it modifies the model to include endogenously determined structural break using the general structure for analyzing breaks with unit roots in Perron (2006). Third, it uses the adopted model to compute optimal portfolio weight and hedge ratios between oil price and US stocks using different sample data based on the break date. On average, our empirical evidence suggests a significant positive return spillover from US stock market to oil market and bidirectional shock spillovers between the two markets. In addition, there is significant own asymmetric shock effect in both markets while volatility spillover from oil market to stock market became pronounced after the break which coincides with the period of global economic slowdown. Similarly, the results of portfolio management differ across the sample data. More importantly, we find that ignoring structural break when it exists may exaggerate hedging effectiveness.

This paper examines whether off-shoring research and development, design, and engineering activities provides any gains in terms of firm-level innovation output. The effects of trade in innovative tasks on the probability of firms being innovative and the share of innovative product sales in total turnover are examined using an instrumental variable approach. The data in use come from a recent survey, which provides cross-section observations for more than 14,750 firms in 7 European countries. The results suggest that those firms that off-shore their innovative activities are 60% more likely to successfully innovate. Also, off-shoring innovative activities increases the share of innovative product sales in total turnover up to 35%. Furthermore, firms in this sample appear to gain from trade in innovative tasks when such trade is in product innovation, but not when such trade is in process innovation.","[Tabrizy, Saleh S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 3210 N Maryland Ave,Bolton Hall 881, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Tabrizy, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 3210 N Maryland Ave,Bolton Hall 881, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",sahabeh2@uwm.edu,"Tabrizy, Saleh S./AAD-5409-2020","Tabrizy, Saleh S./0000-0003-2537-8686",,,,,36,0,0,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The paper then empirically studies the determinants of labor market duality. The main result of the paper is that the level of employment protection affects duality. In particular, a higher level of employment protection of regular workers increases duality, while a higher level of protection of temporary workers reduces it.

I find lower labor market attachment for married women without young children who co-reside with their mothers (those women most likely to care for their elderly mothers) and for married women with young children who live more than half a day away from their mothers (those women least likely to benefit from the availability of family provided childcare). I find no effect of proximity for single women with children on the extensive margin, but do find that they work fewer hours if they live far from their mothers. The results hold only for proximity to living mothers (as opposed to proximity to widowed fathers), suggesting that it is the mothers themselves, and not merely the home location, that drives the results. I incorporate IV estimation using province of birth and whether one was born in the same province of either parent to estimate proximity, and find consistent results. To the extent that the positive effect of close proximity is related to the availability of grandchild care, policies that impact the labor force behavior of grandmothers may also impact the labor force behavior of their daughters. Regional patterns in proximity suggest that national childcare and labor market policies may yield different results across the country.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Compton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",Janice.Compton@ad.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,36,12,13,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Because money demand is a function of the liquidity of assets and commodities, monetary aggregates provide information on trade inefficiencies and are thus instructive for the conduct of monetary policy. We also show that assets that promise higher payoffs in liquidity constrained states in the future are relatively more expensive. This generates a term premium in the yield curve, even in absence of aggregate real uncertainty. The term premium is also higher than what would be calibrated in a representative agent model because monetary costs affect individual agents' marginal utilities even if aggregate income is unaffected.

How is business actually done? The Doing Business project surveys experts concerning the legally required time and costs of regulatory compliance for various aspects of private enterprise-starting a firm, dealing with construction permits, trading across borders, paying taxes, getting credit, enforcing contracts, and so on-around the world. The World Bank's firm-level Enterprise Surveys around the world ask managers at a wide array of firms about their business, including questions about how long it took to go through various processes like obtaining an operating license or a construction permit, or bringing in imports. This paper compares the results of three broadly comparable indicators from the Doing Business and Enterprise Surveys. Overall, we find that the estimate of legally required time for firms to complete a certain legal and regulatory process provided by the Doing Business survey does not summarize even modestly well the experience of firms as reported by the Enterprise Surveys. When strict de jure regulation and high rates of taxation meet weak governmental capabilities for implementation and enforcement, we argue that researchers and policymakers should stop thinking about regulations as creating rules to be followed, but rather as creating a space in which deals of various kinds are possible.","[Hallward-Driemeier, Mary] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Pritchett, Lant] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Practice Int Dev, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The World Bank; Harvard University,"Hallward-Driemeier, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mhallward@worldbank.org; Lant_Pritchett@harvard.edu,,,,,,,64,73,103,2,39,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Lacking or incomplete transfers of acquired social rights are feared to negatively impact individual labor market decisions as well as capacity to address social risks with consequences for economic and social outcomes. The paper gives a fresh and provocative look on the international perspective of the topic that has so far been dominated by social policy lawyers working within the framework of bilateral agreements; the input by economists has been very limited. It offers an analytical framework for portability analysis that suggests separating the risk pooling, (implicit or actual) pre-funding, and redistributive elements in the benefit design, and explores the proposed alternative approach for pensions and health care benefits. This promising approach may serve both as a substitute and complement to bi- and multilateral agreements.

These social preference theories are now widely used to model situations where decision makers do not influence the earnings of others, for example the labor market. Outcome-based social preference models make predictions in these settings as well. We therefore test these models in a novel experimental situation where participants face risky decisions that affect only their own earnings. In the social (individual) treatment participants do (not) observe the earnings of others. In the social treatment gambles therefore not only affect absolute but also relative earnings. All outcome-based social preference models predict a treatment difference. We find that decisions are generally the same in both treatments, which suggests these models are less general applicable than their formulation suggests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find that a temporary 10% appreciation of the real exchange rate that is unrelated to commodity prices or interest rate differentials lowers the level of real GDP over the subsequent one-to-two years by 0.3% and year-ended inflation by 0.3 percentage points. The mining, manufacturing, personal services, construction and business services industries are the most exchange rate sensitive sectors of the economy. In the context of the boom in Australia's terms of trade over the past decade, we use our model to explore how the Australian economy might have evolved under alternative scenarios. These suggest that exchange rate movements over the past decade have had a stabilising effect on the domestic economy and can largely be explained by economic fundamentals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We apply two methods for the estimation of the cyclical components from the data: the approach based on the structural time series models and the ARIMA-model-based approach combined with the canonical decomposition and a band-pass filter. We examine the extracted cycles drawing on two wavelet concepts: wavelet coherence and wavelet phase angle. In contrast to the analysis in the time or frequency domains, wavelet analysis allows for the identification of possible changes in cyclical patterns over time. From the findings of our study, we can infer that the USA and Germany differ with respect to the lead-lag relationship of real wages and the business cycle. In the USA, both real wages are leading the business cycle in the entire time interval. The German consumer real wage is, on the other hand, lagging the business cycle. For the German producer real wage, the lead-lag pattern changes over time. We also find that real wages in the USA as well in Germany are procyclical or acyclical until 1980 and countercyclical thereafter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (1997) aggregate instability is driven by self-filling beliefs in the presence of multiple equilibrium paths. However, I find the existence of an indeterminate balanced growth path with a continuum of competitive equilibrium paths when productive public spending on aggregate production is endogenously financed by a predetermined rate of income taxes under balanced budget rules. In this economy, local and global indeterminacy emerges when labor supply is highly elastic and a slope of aggregate (not necessarily individual) labor demand is positive by the productivity of public spending, independent of the usual indeterminacy conditions under fiscal policies such as types of distortionary taxes, sources of government revenue, composition of government expenditure, countercyclical taxation, and predetermined public spending.","Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 001 Hoeki Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",econhyun@khu.ac.kr,,,Kyung Hee University; National Research Foundation by Korean Government [2014S1A3A2044459],Kyung Hee University; National Research Foundation by Korean Government,"Professor, Department of Economics, Kyung Hee University, 001 Hoeki-Dong, Dongdaemoon-Gu, Seoul 130-701, Korea Phone: +82-2-961-9375.

The answer is that, although Marx's theory offers important insights to understanding the ultimate causes of capitalist crises, it is not able to provide a fully satisfactory explanation of typical crises of contemporary capitalism. In particular, Marx's analysis cannot account for the long periods of stagnation following the eruption of financial and economic crises. In Marx's analytical context, crises are followed by recovery and growth in a relatively short span of time. It is argued that the main reason for Marx's inability to explain crises of contemporary capitalism is that he developed his analysis by considering free-competitive economies, whereas modern economies are characterized by monopolistic competition. A more satisfactory explanation of the current crisis requires going beyond Marx's original contributions.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Sardoni, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,22,3,3,2,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Our data show clearly that measures correlate not only within decision contexts or measurement methods, but also across contexts and methods.

Existing portability rules do not fully address these problems. In this article, we try to clarify the implications of mobility for typical systems covering health costs and the requirements which have to be met to ensure full portability. When individuals are internationally mobile, compensating payments are needed based on changes in expected net costs in both of the health funds involved.

We assert that the trading behavior of informed and uninformed traders will be affected when public information is released. We test this assertion empirically by analyzing the relation between daily volume and first-order return autocorrelation in the Taiwan FX market. We find that a high degree of uninformed trading occurs on Mondays and Thursdays, coinciding with the days that most of the relevant information is released.

We combine a quantile analysis with matching techniques to analyse the negative impact of unemployment along the well-being distribution of a comprehensive well-being variable. In our analysis of British Household Panel Survey data (1996-2008) we focus on transitions into unemployment and find that average effects of unemployment on a comprehensive well-being variable are less strong than on typical life satisfaction measures. The effect of unemployment on a broad mental well-being variable (GHQ-12) is reversed and mentally less well-off individuals suffer from unemployment more strongly than those scoring high in mental well-being.,"[Binder, Martin] Bard Coll Berlin, D-13156 Berlin, Germany; [Binder, Martin] Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst Bard Coll, Blithewood, New York, NY 12504 USA; [Coad, Alex] Univ Sussex, Sci & Technol Policy Res Unit, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] RATIO, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Coad, Alex] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark",University of Sussex; Aalborg University,"Binder, M (通讯作者)，Bard Coll Berlin, D-13156 Berlin, Germany.",m.binder@berlin.bard.edu,"Binder, Martin/AAF-6448-2020; Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Binder, Martin/0000-0002-5053-3804; Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528",ESRC-TSB-BIS-NESTA [ES/J008427/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC-TSB-BIS-NESTA; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Thanks for helpful comments on a different draft to Matias Ramirez, Rose Cairns, Ben Martin, Paul Nightingale, Tommaso Ciarli, Ohid Yaqub and Satoko Yasuda.

The model is simulated for a sample of Sub-Saharan African countries using the country-specific financial development and the country-specific joint distribution between productivity and taxes. We find that the simulated output and TFP are highly correlated with those in the data and the model accounts for 48% of the variation of output in the data.

Sraffa's parsimonious argumentation offers a strong incentive to generalise his framework and suggest the idea of a classical system of prices whose prices of production would be a special case. To elaborate a clear notion of a classical system of prices relevant for the study of a priori different authors is the first objective of this article. In this view, the basic elements of a classical system of prices are distinguished: technique of production, rule of imputation of the price of surplus and conditions of reproduction. Even if this may help to have a fresh look on some authors like Petty or Cantillon, it is certainly (with the obvious exception of Ricardo and Torrens) about Quesnay and his Tableau Economique that the idea of a classical system of prices is the most fruitful. To suggest a renewed reading of the Tableau is the second objective of the present article.","[Cartelier, Jean] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Cartelier, J (通讯作者)，17 Rue Victor Masse, F-75009 Paris, France.",jean.cartelier@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Firms characterized by a more central position in a spatial network are more powerful in terms of having a stronger impact on their competitors' prices and on equilibrium prices. These propositions are derived from a simple theoretical model and investigated empirically for the retail gasoline market of Vienna, Austria. We compute a measure of network centrality based on the locations of gasoline stations in the road network. Results from a spatial autoregressive model show that prices of gasoline stations are more strongly correlated with prices of central competitors. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agents have connection demands in form of pairs of locations they want to have connected. Connections between locations are costly to build. The problem is to allocate costs of networks satisfying all connection demands. We use a few axioms to characterize allocation rules that truthfully implement cost minimizing networks satisfying all connection demands in a game where: (1) a central planner announces an allocation rule and a cost estimation rule; (2) every agent reports her own connection demand as well as all connection costs; (3) the central planner selects a cost minimizing network satisfying reported connection demands based on the estimated costs; and, (4) the planner allocates the true costs of the selected network. It turns out that an allocation rule satisfies the axioms if and only if relative cost shares are fixed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The model keeps the architecture of the general-disequilibrium model of Barro and Grossman (1971) but takes a matching approach to the labor and product markets instead of a disequilibrium approach. On the product and labor markets, both price and tightness adjust to equalize supply and demand. Since there are two equilibrium variables but only one equilibrium condition on each market, a price mechanism is needed to select an equilibrium. We focus on two polar mechanisms: fixed prices and competitive prices. When prices are fixed, aggregate demand affects unemployment as follows. An increase in aggregate demand leads firms to find more customers. This reduces the idle time of their employees and thus increases their labor demand. This in turn reduces unemployment. We combine the predictions of the model and empirical measures of product market tightness, labor market tightness, output, and employment to assess the sources of labor market fluctuations in the United States. First, we find that product market tightness and labor market tightness fluctuate a lot, which implies that the fixed-price equilibrium describes the data better than the competitive-price equilibrium. Next, we find that labor market tightness and employment are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor market fluctuations are mostly due to labor demand shocks and not to labor supply or mismatch shocks. Last, we find that product market tightness and output are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor demand shocks mostly reflect aggregate demand shocks and not technology shocks.","[Michaillat, Pascal] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Michaillat, P (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,"Michaillat, Pascal/0000-0003-2381-7470","ESRC [ES/K008641/1, ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1, ES/K008641/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,81,41,45,0,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Non-quasi-linear preferences describe environments where payments influence agents' abilities to utilize objects or derive benefits from them. The minimum price Walrasian (MPW) rule is the rule that assigns a minimum price Walrasian equilibrium allocation to each preference profile. We establish that the MPW rule is the unique rule satisfying strategy-proofness, efficiency, individual rationality, and no subsidy for losers. Since the outcome of the MPW rule coincides with that of the simultaneous ascending (SA) auction, our result supports SA auctions adopted by many governments.","[Morimoto, Shuhei] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Serizawa, Shigehiro] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Kobe University; Osaka University,"Morimoto, S (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",morimoto@people.kobe-u.ac.jp; serizawa@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Serizawa, Shigehiro/A-9300-2012",,"JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (JSPS KAKENHI) [25.2188]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [13J02188, 15H03328, 15H05728] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (JSPS KAKENHI); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are very grateful to the co-editor and four anonymous referees for their many detailed and helpful comments.

We report evidence that the response of real wages to monetary policy shocks is slightly procyclical. Using state-level structural vector autoregression models, we find disparity even resulting in some states exhibiting strong procyclical responses and others countercyclical real wage responses. This heterogeneity can be explained by cross-state differences in unemployment, agriculture share in state GDP, the unionization rate, and the importance of intermediate goods in state production.

Banks are now poised to play a pivotal role in the economic transformation of the economy as envisaged in the Financial Sector Blue Print 2011-20 of BNM. Using the data envelopment analysis technique, the technical efficiency of 19 commercial banks (8 domestic banks and 11 foreign banks) operating in Malaysia during 2005-12 is evaluated. Then, using bootstrap-corrected efficiency scores, the drivers of bank efficiency were estimated using the Tobit regression approach. Results clearly show that three large domestic banks are not only more efficient than their counterparts, but are also more efficient than the foreign banks. Bank size and return on assets are found to be the significant drivers of technical efficiency of Malaysian banks. Capital adequacy and the advances to deposit ratio also have a role in driving technical efficiency. The results also indicate that banks that are more effective in managing credit risk, as reflected in a lower level of non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets, and have lower levels of personnel expenses to total assets, are more efficient. The findings have significant implications at the individual bank level and also at the policy level.","[Saha, Asish] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Nor Hayati] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Banking & Risk Management, Kedah, Malaysia; [Dash, Umakant] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Saha, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia.",,"Dash, Umakant/K-9963-2017","Dash, Umakant/0000-0001-5348-9530; Saha, Asish/0000-0002-6262-3655",,,,,60,12,12,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Using a calibrated microfounded endogenous growth model with physical and human capital accumulation and Bulgarian data, a computational experiment is performed to quantify the dynamic welfare effect of progressive income taxation vis-a-vis flat income taxation. The model demonstrates that significant welfare gains, measured in terms of per-period consumption, can be realized with the introduction of flat income taxation. In addition, these welfare gains increase proportionally with the length of the time horizon considered.

It is shown that when money is a vital form of liquidity to meet uncertain consumption needs, the welfare costs of inflation can be extremely large. With log utility and parameter values that best match both the aggregate money demand curve suggested by Lucas (2000) and the variance of household consumption, agents in our model are willing to reduce consumption by 3-4% to avoid 10% annual inflation. The astonishingly large welfare costs of inflation arise because inflation increases consumption risk by eroding the buffer-stock-insurance value of money, thus hindering consumption smoothing at the household level. Such an inflation-induced increase in consumption risk at the micro level cannot be captured by representative-agent models or the Bailey triangle. Although the development of financial intermediation can mitigate the problem, with realistic credit limits the welfare loss of moderate inflation still remains several times larger than estimations based on the Bailey triangle. Our findings provide a strong justification for adopting a low inflation target by central banks, especially in developing countries where money is the major form of household financial wealth.

We observe that the relationship is non-linear for all the three measures of RISK in 2001 and 2012. Since we get different results for different measures of risk, we lay more emphasis on RISK2 as the better measure of risk here. From the graphical plots, we find that the relationship between leverage and RISK2 appears to be a polynomial of degree 5 or more. Thus, it invalidates the previous argument of a quadratic relationship between leverage and risk. We then check if the quadratic specification between leverage and risk, as proposed in the existing studies, is appropriate by applying Hardle and Mammen's test. We observe that the relationship varies over the measures of risks and it differs between group-affiliated firms and stand-alone firms. Moreover, the relationship changes over time. Thus, our findings raise questions about the predictions of Castanias, Kale et al. and others on the relationship between capital structure and business risk as a U-shaped one. We conclude that the generalization of a U-shaped relationship between capital structure and business risk is not true.","[Chakraborty, Indrani] Inst Dev Studies Kolkata, Salt Lake City, India",,"Chakraborty, I (通讯作者)，Inst Dev Studies Kolkata, DD-27-D,Sect 1, Kolkata 700064, India.",indrani.c61@gmail.com,,,,,,,64,10,10,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

On average, a male in the treatment class scores between 3.17 and 4.05 percentage points higher on the final grade than a male in the control class, ceteris paribus.

Agents adapt to changing environments within one generation by using their respective learning strategy. The frequency of the agent types adapts between generations according to the agents' acquired wealth. During the course of evolution, social learning becomes dominant, resulting in three major effects: First, for better or worse, the decisions of social learners are more exaggerated than those of individual learners. Second, social learners react with a delay to changes in the environment. Third, the behavior of social learners becomes more and more detached from reality. We argue that our model gives insights into economic systems and markets. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Answering this question is of general economic interest as it applies to all markets with information asymmetries. Employing a difference-in-differences approach as well as a propensity score matching approach we find significant Michelin treatment effects on food and decor quality. Based on these changes, we find a Michelin-induced price increase of approximately 30% per Michelin star. To examine whether the improved food and nonfood quality is based on restaurant investments or is merely imagined, we analyze nonfood investments by referring to Wine Spectator wine list awards. Our analysis suggests that Michelin-reviewed restaurants are significantly more likely to invest in their wine list than others. As a result, Michelin reviewed restaurants are more likely to improve food and nonfood (esp. decor) quality leading to significant price increases. However, while restaurants that increase prices only due to decor and service improvements are more likely to go out of business, food improvements appear to secure a restaurant's survival.

This article uses a difference-in-difference-in-difference empirical strategy to investigate the impact of mandated insurance coverage for diabetes on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among educated women, who have high rates of coverage through private insurance that is subject to insurance mandates, diabetes mandates are associated with a reduction in low birth weight and premature birth prevalence. These gains are concentrated among older women and are larger for African-Americans. There is a weaker effect on the prevalence of high birth weight, potentially because of the deleterious effects of an increased probability of pregnancy weight gain in excess of 35 pounds among diabetic women in states with mandates.","[Grecu, Anca M.] Seton Hall Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Stillman Sch Business, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Spector, Lee C.] Ball State Univ, Dept Econ, Miller Coll Business, Muncie, IN 47304 USA",Seton Hall University; Ball State University,"Grecu, AM (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Stillman Sch Business, Jubilee Hall 674,400 South Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",anca.cotet@shu.edu; 00lcspector@bsu.edu,,"Grecu, Anca/0000-0003-3028-254X",,,,,69,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Investigating the role of the federal funds market and unconventional monetary policy for the propagation of aggregate real and financial shocks, I find that federal funds market participation is irrelevant in response to standard supply and demand shocks, whereas it matters for uncertainty shocks, i.e. mean-preserving spreads in the cross-section of liquidity risk. Liquidity injections by the central bank can absorb the effects of financial shocks on the real economy, although excess reserves might increase and federal funds might be crowded out, as a side effect.

From this identification we propose a general class of PID-based monetary policy rules that include as limiting cases the original Taylor rule as well as lagged and forward-looking extensions of thereof. The effectiveness of parsimonious extensions of the Taylor rule are consistent with the well-known effectiveness and parsimony of PID control. We find that for the same reason encountered in other PID control applications-noisy data-most monetary policy rules fall in the proportional-integral subset of PID control known as PI control. We estimate both PID and PI monetary policy rules using the historical analysis approach of Taylor and compare the performance of our PI rule to other policy rules using a recently-developed macroeconomic-model comparison methodology. A key feature of PID control is its remarkable effectiveness for systems where the equations of motion are not known. Thus, PID-based rules both link monetary policy with a tradition of practical control in the absence of known dynamical equations and provide baseline rules for monetary policy in the face of macroeconomic model uncertainty.","[Hawkins, Raymond J.] Univ Arizona, Coll Opt Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Speakes, Jeffrey K.; Hamilton, Dan E.] Calif Lutheran Univ, Sch Management, Thousand Oaks, CA USA",University of Arizona; California Lutheran University,"Hawkins, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Coll Opt Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",rhawkins@optics.arizona.edu; jspeakes@callutheran.edu; dhamilto@callutheran.edu,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

This result indicates that since developing countries, particularly Asian countries, have experienced a relatively rapid decrease in tariff rates, the increase in VFDI through tariff reduction led to the recent surge of FDI in developing countries.","[Hayakawa, Kazunobu] Japan External Trade Org, Inst Developing Econ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Matsuura, Toshiyuki] Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Hayakawa, K (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org, Inst Developing Econ, 16th Floor,Nantawan Bldg,161 Rajadamri Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",kazunobu_hayakawa@ide-jetro.org; matsuura@sanken.keio.ac.jp,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23730249, 22330087]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285058, 23730249, 22330087] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant-in-aid for Young Researcher B 23730249 to T.M., Grant-in-aid for Scientific Research B 22330087 to K.H. and T.M.).",,22,8,8,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Forward-looking youths consistently decide between crime and legal activities depending on their endowment of work- and crime-specific human capital, which in turn is shaped by their history of past choices. The model explicitly recognizes the contrasting levels of punishment of the juvenile and adult criminal systems. In order to evaluate whether the model explains the evolution of crime, I calibrate it and test whether it can account for the observed variations in juvenile crime levels across changes in economic and legal conditions. The model is able to reproduce 91 percent of the recent increase in juvenile crime in Uruguay by affecting key model parameters in line with observed facts (a decrease in the relative returns of legal activities and the introduction of a lenient juvenile crime regulation and enforcement strategy). Counterfactual model results predict that a reduction in the age of criminal majority would significantly lower juvenile crime involvement. However, if the transmission of crime-related skills in correctional facilities were strong enough, harsher punishments to juveniles would increase the likelihood of criminal involvement later in life.

The problematic orientation of Neoclassical growth theory is discussed, pointing out its limited macroeconomic perspective, the weak consideration of technological change and of demand, the lack of attention to institutional settings. An explanation of economic development has to consider the key role of innovation and the process of creative destruction, in the context of Schumpeterian insights and evolutionary perspectives. I argue that economists need to consider three somewhat separate bodies of research on economic development. One is the evolutionary analysis that follows Schumpeter. A second is the research on technological advance as an evolutionary process. The third is focused on institutions and how they mold the development process, and how they themselves evolve. Moreover, the role of demand in shaping growth dynamics and business cycles-stressed by Keynes and post-Keynesian approaches-has to be integrated in such evolutionary perspectives in ways that are only now starting to emerge.","Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University,"Nelson, RR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA.",rrn2@columbia.edu,,,,,,,14,2,2,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Particularly, we attempt to answer two questions. Firstly, are Chinese-owned (henceforth foreign) firms more productive than local ones? Secondly, does the presence of foreign firms generate technology spillovers on domestic firms operating in the same industry? Our empirical results show that foreign firms are more productive and that their presence has different spillover effects on the productivity of domestic firms. In particular, we find that domestic firms with higher absorptive capacity experience positive spillovers, while those with low absorptive capacity witness negative spillover. We also find that small firms and non-exporting firms benefit more from spillovers than do other types of domestic firms. In this study, instrumental variables are used to address the potential endogeneity between foreign firm presence and domestic firm productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The CNH market - the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market - is found to exert an effect on Asian currencies that is distinct from that of the onshore (CNY) market. Changes in the RMB/USD rates in both markets have a statistically and economically significant impact on changes in Asian currency rates against the US dollar, after controlling for other major currency moves and the transmission of China's monetary policy to the region. The continuing growth of the offshore renminbi market points to rising influence of the CNH market, but how long the independent impact will last will likely depend on China's progress in liberalising its capital account. The findings also suggest that China's regional influence is increasingly transmitted through financial channels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes a 'generational approach' that allows for more realistic assumptions concerning currency growth and note replacement. The paper shows that Menzies' claim that the case for polymer banknotes becomes stronger with higher currency demand is an artefact of his model. In most scenarios, the number of notes in circulation does not affect the relative cost effectiveness of paper and polymer; and when it does, the impact goes in the other direction. A second finding is that the 'note life over unit-cost rule of thumb' can be misleading. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While the underlying ideas of both models are similar with respect to expectation-based reference points, the different results come from the concept of Personal Equilibrium in Koszegi and Rabin (2006). The experimental results show some support for the simpler good deal model for a number of different real consumption goods though the support is weaker for goods that either have a salient market price or no market price outside of the experiment.

Following a top down process, this focus culminates at the branch level, where banks' front office employees are seen as a driving-force for building customer loyalty. At the same time, however, the difficulty in identifying and operationalizing the factors or determinants that most contribute to creating and maintaining bank customer loyalty has long been recognized. In this sense, based on the integrated use of cognitive maps and measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH), this study proposes a multiple criteria framework for bank customer loyalty measurement and management. The results show that our framework allows bank customers with higher rates of customer loyalty to be identified and, from a benchmarking perspective, indicates what best practices should be followed to boost long-term relationships. Implications for scholars and practitioners are discussed.","[Ferreira, Fernando A.

All our major results can be computed via explicit expressions. It is shown that the bank will control its risk to be below the risk limit through setting a loan limit and the firm can make the loan limit increase by buying a deductible insurance policy. It is also shown that the repayment demand level needed to avoid bankruptcy will not be affected by the insurance policy. We derive the firm's optimal ordering quantity and insurance coverage level under a downside risk measurement and a variance risk measurement separately. It is shown that the firm should pay more attention to whether to buy insurance or not under the downside risk measurement and how much insurance coverage to buy under the variance risk measurement. Under the downside risk measurement, once the firm decides to buy insurance, the optimal coverage level is independent of the bank's risk limit. We also show that the insurance contract has a more obvious effect on the profit increases when the selling price is high or the bank's risk limit is low.","[Wang, Wenli] Taiyuan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jianwen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Taiyuan University of Science & Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Wang, WL (通讯作者)，Taiyuan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China.",wangwenli276@aliyun.com,"Luo, Jianwen/AAF-8896-2020","Luo, Jianwen/0000-0002-1594-3867","Natural Science Foundation of China [71372107, 71273159]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are very grateful for the kindly comments of the reviewers, which helped to significantly improve the quality of the paper.

It shows how the mechanism of the finance-investment-saving-funding Keynesian circuit (FISF) works in open economies. This is undertaken in an attempt to demonstrate that real exchange rate changes affect the FISF circuit in that they trigger the substitution between national and foreign savings. Thus, domestic investment causes savings, but the distribution of aggregate savings between its national and foreign components depends on the level of the real exchange rate. Finally, we show that if government budget deficits change relative prices in an economy, this worsens the current account balance by triggering substitution between national and foreign savings. Thus, the constraint on investment (and on growth) that can emanate from this process is one that emerges from external forces.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Cunha Resende, Marco Flavio] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Econ, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",University of Cambridge; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,Ministry of Education-Brazilian Government from CAPES,Ministry of Education-Brazilian Government from CAPES,"Philip Arestis is professor in the Department of Land Economy at the University of Cambridge.

We consider monthly measures of realized and implied volatility from the stock and bond markets. In a dynamic factor framework, we extract the common long-run component of volatility that is likely to be linked to economic fundamentals. Based on powerful in-sample predictive ability tests, we find that the stock volatility measures and the common factor significantly improve macroeconomic forecasts of conventional financial indicators, especially over short horizons. A real-time out of sample assessment yields similar conclusions under the assumption of noisy revisions in macroeconomic data. In a nonlinear extension of the dynamic factor model, we identify two distinct volatility regimes, and show that the high-volatility regime provides early signals of the Great Recession, which was associated with severe financial distress and credit disintermediation.

Banks mobilize unsecured deposits by offering deposit rates, which they invest either in a prudent or a gambling asset. Limited liability along with high return of a successful gamble induce moral hazard at the bank level. We show that when the market power that the banks enjoyed in the deposit market is low, banks invest in the gambling asset. On the other hand, for sufficiently high levels of market power, all banks choose the prudent asset to invest in. We further show that a merger of two neighboring banks increases the likelihood of prudent behavior. Also, introduction of a deposit insurance scheme exacerbates banks' moral hazard problem if the insurance premium is sufficiently low. Finally, we introduce a loan market where the borrowers of the banks choose the investment strategy prior to the deposit contracts. We show that as the market power that the banks enjoy in the loan market increases the borrowers tend to take more risk.","[Dam, Kaniska] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Escrihuela-Villar, Marc] Dept Econ Aplicada, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Baleares, Spain; [Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Theory, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The results indicate that policy variables, such as the reserve requirement ratio, the interest rate spread and open market operations by the People's Bank of China, are effective in improving the cost efficiency of banks, but shadow banking variables may reduce cost efficiency. Among the various bank types, city commercial banks appear to be the most efficient and foreign banks are the least efficient. The present study suggests that policy-makers can have a positive influence on bank cost efficiency by adjusting macro policy variables on different types of banks and by requiring more information on the shadow banking activities to improve monitoring.","[Ding, Ning] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Fung, Hung-Gay] Univ Missouri, Finance, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Fung, Hung-Gay] Univ Missouri, Coll Business Adm, Chinese Studies, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Jia, Jingyi] So Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Ding, N (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Dalian, Peoples R China.",dingning610@hotmail.com; fungh@msx.umsl.edu; jjia@siue.edu,"jia, jingyi/ABF-1704-2020",,China National Social Science Foundation [14BJY173],China National Social Science Foundation,We thank the Editor for helpful comments.

The goal is to evaluate the performance of alternative exchange rate policies in sudden stop-prone economies. The key element of the analysis is a pecuniary externality arising from frictions in the international credit markets, which creates a trade-off between price and financial stability. The main result is that depreciating the exchange rate during a financial crisis has a positive impact on welfare, because the stimulus provided by a depreciation sustains asset prices, value of collateral, and access to the international credit markets.

We develop a framework to study the strategic implications of a meritocratic notion of desert under which team members care about receiving what they feel they deserve. Team members find it painful to receive less than their perceived entitlement, while receiving more may induce pleasure or pain depending on whether their preferences exhibit desert elation or desert guilt. Our notion of desert generalizes distributional concern models to situations in which effort choices affect the distribution perceived to be fair; in particular, desert nests inequity aversion over money net of effort costs as a special case. When identical teammates share team output equally, desert guilt generates a continuum of symmetric equilibria. Equilibrium effort can lie above or below the level in the absence of desert, so desert guilt generates behavior consistent with both positive and negative reciprocity and may underpin social norms of cooperation.

This paper studies the role of short-term cross-border labor movements for innovation by estimating the recent impact of U.S. business travel to foreign countries on their patenting rates. Business travel is shown to have a significant effect up and beyond technology transfer through international trade and foreign direct investment. On average, a 10 % increase in business travel leads to an increase in patenting by about 0.2 %, and inward business travel is about one fourth as potent for innovation as domestic R&D spending. We show that the technological knowledge of each business traveler matters by estimating a higher impact for travelers that originate in U.S. states with substantial innovation, such as California. This study provides initial evidence that international air travel may be an important channel through which cross-country income differences can be reduced.","[Hovhannisyan, Nune] Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA; [Keller, Wolfgang] Univ Munich, CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Keller, Wolfgang] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Keller, Wolfgang] CEPR, London, England; [Keller, Wolfgang] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Loyola University Maryland; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Keller, W (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",nhovhannisyan@loyola.edu,,,,,,,41,52,60,4,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Some cartels may find it advantageous to eliminate cross-hauling and divide markets geographically. We exploit a quasi-natural experiment associated with increased antitrust enforcement to determine if market division strategies were used in seven recently-prosecuted international cartels. Since antitrust activity is unlikely to affect spatial patterns of demand and supply (other than through its effect on the competitive environment), enforcement-induced changes are ideally suited to study the effect of competition on trade patterns. Analyzing the cartels individually and as a group, we find no significant change in spatial patterns of trade following cartel breakup; in particular, there is no systematic change in the effect of distance on trade. These results suggest that cross-hauling is not uncommon under collusion and hence that the existence of cross-hauling by itself does not provide evidence of effective competition.

We use rich monthly administrative data from a 70% random sample of all hospitalizations during the years 2007-2011 in Germany in order to evaluate the short-term impact of this policy on alcohol-related hospitalizations. Applying difference-in-differences methods, we find that the policy change reduces alcohol-related hospitalizations among adolescents and young adults by about 7%.

On the contrary, some economists believe that this crisis is the consequence of major deficiencies in the architecture of economic policy making in the Euro zone that did not allow a proper response to a global systemic crisis of the financial markets that started in the United States. The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the public debt dynamics in the EU, differentiating the case of Euro zone peripheral countries. We used quarterly data from 2000 to 2011 to estimate a small-scale model that takes into account the interactions between key variables. Our results do not support entirely the official view. We conclude that the cause of the adverse debt dynamics unravelling after 2007 was a sharp GDP contraction, coupled with a substantial increase in the interest cost of debt finance due to higher self-fulfilling solvency risks perceived by creditors, interacting with a higher sensitiveness of Euro zone peripheral countries to fundamentals.","[Mota, Paulo R.; Costa Fernandes, Abel L.] Univ Porto, Sch Business & Econ, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Mota, Paulo R.; Costa Fernandes, Abel L.] Univ Porto, Sch Business & Econ, NIFIP Ctr Res Publ Finance & Monetary Policy, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Nicolescu, Ana-Cristina] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; West University of Timisoara,"Mota, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Sch Business & Econ, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",mpaulo@fep.up.pt; abelf@fep.up.pt; cristina.nicolescu@feaa.uvt.ro,"NICOLESCU, ANA-CRISTINA/GOH-0345-2022; ANA-CRISTINA, NICOLESCU/AAD-2003-2022; Mota, Paulo/AAG-2886-2019","NICOLESCU, ANA-CRISTINA/0000-0003-0659-4789; ANA-CRISTINA, NICOLESCU/0000-0003-0659-4789; Mota, Paulo/0000-0001-7028-4545",,,,,40,3,5,0,25,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However among compliant regions, a small economy also receives a significant spillins effect when a large economy takes some regulatory actions that affect, particularly, the world prices of traded commodities. This externality can have notable impacts on the efficiency and pollution abatement opportunities of the small compliant regime with a trivial converse effect. In some cases, these impacts on the efficiency and emissions abatement can be in opposite directions. We capture these findings by incorporating two protection polices (i.e., border tax adjustment and free emissions allocations to emission-intensive and trade exposed industries) in a multi-region analytical and numerical general equilibrium modeling framework. These results convey that the large economies hold leading strategic positions towards a cooperative global climate change movement because of their policies' influences on the small economies.

However, a clear disadvantage of the wavelet-based approach is the increased complexity of the technique, as compared to the other two classes of LTSC models, and the resulting need for dedicated numerical software, which may not be readily available to practitioners in their work environments. To facilitate this problem, we propose here a much simpler, yet equally powerful method for identifying the LTSC in electricity spot price series.

However, stochastic modeling with large market models comes with high computational and management costs for data storage, analysis and manipulation. Gaussian Quadratures (GQ), are efficient sampling methods requiring few points to approximate the central moments of the joint probability distribution of stochastic variables and therefore reduce computational costs. For symmetric regions of integration, the vertices of Stroud's n-octahedron (Stroud, 1957) are GQ formulas of degree 3 with a minimal number of points which can make the stochastic modeling with large economic models manageable. However, we have the conjecture that rotations of Stroud's n-octahedron have an effect on the accuracy of approximation of model results; thus, we test eight different rotations using the European Simulation Model (ESIM). It was found that the 45 rotation yields higher accuracy than the 0 degrees rotation. With the 45 degrees rotation and in models with large regions or variables which strongly determine the outcome of model results such as soft wheat in ESIM, the arrangement of the stochastic variables (A1 or A2) in the covariance matrix or the selected method to introduce correlation (via the Cholesky decomposition -C- or via the diagonalization method -D-) may have a significant effect on the accuracy of the quadratures. With the 45 degrees rotation and with markets where the effect of the different regions or variables on model outcomes are more homogenous as in the case of rapeseed in ESIM, the selection of the arrangements A1 or A2 and the method of introducing correlation C or D may not have a significant effect on the accuracy of the quadratures.

The recently formalized fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive (VAR) model is employed to explain both the cointegration dynamics between daily high and low stock prices and the long memory of their linear combination, i.e., the range. Daily high and low stock prices are of particular interest because they provide valuable information about range-based volatility, which is considered a highly efficient and robust estimator of volatility. We provide a comparison of the Czech PX index with other world market indices: the German Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX), the U.K Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100, the U.S. Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 and the Japanese Nihon Keizai Shimbun (NIKKEI) 225 during the 2003-2012 period, that is, before and during the financial crisis. We find that the ranges of all of the indices display long memory and are mostly in the non-stationary region, supporting the recent evidence that volatility might not be a stationary process. No common pattern is detected among all of the studied indices, and different behaviors are also observed in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. We conclude that the fractionally cointegrated VAR approach allowing for long memory is an interesting alternative for modelling range-based volatility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical analysis demonstrates that decentralization exerts both a direct and an indirect impact on the shadow economy and corruption. First, decentralization helps to mitigate government-induced distortions, thus limiting the extent of corruption and the informal sector in a direct way. Second, in more decentralized systems, individuals have the option to avoid corruption by moving to other jurisdictions, rather than going underground. This limits the impact of corruption on the shadow economy and implies that decentralization is also beneficial in an indirect way. As a result, our analysis documents a positive relationship between corruption and the shadow economy; however, this link proves to be lower in decentralized countries. To test these predictions, we developed an empirical analysis based on a cross-country database of 145 countries that includes different indexes of decentralization, corruption and shadow economy. The empirical evidence is consistent with the theory.","[Dell'Anno, Roberto] Univ Salerno, I-84084 Salerno, Italy; [Teobaldelli, Desiree] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Urbino,"Dell'Anno, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II,132, I-84084 Salerno, Italy.",rdellanno@unisa.it,"Dell'Anno, Roberto/AAB-6385-2022","Dell'Anno, Roberto/0000-0001-7441-8328; TEOBALDELLI, Desiree/0000-0002-4264-5021",,,,,47,33,34,0,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The fist part of the discussion highlights that prior literature has failed to provide a single risk-adjusted model of long-run abnormal returns with no biases. Subsequently, the paper provides guidance on how one can choose among pertinent alternative techniques. As a conclusion, researchers ought to choose among alternative techniques after considering issues such as (i) the nature of dataset and market of interest, (ii) the event type (regulatory or corporate), (iii) returns' time-interval, (iv) association of the event with accounting data, (v) sample characteristics and prior evidence regarding similar events, as well as (vi) risk changes following the event. Robustness tests are essential, while the road for further research regarding the appropriate technique(s) is open.","Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Dionysiou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",,,,,,,,178,5,7,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, in literature we can find many alternative dispersion and risk measures that can help us to identify the most suitable investment opportunity. In this work two new dispersion measures, fulfilling the condition that more is better than less are proposed. Moreover, their distinct characteristics are analysed and empirically compared. In particular, starting from the definition of dispersion measures, we discuss the property of consistency with respect to additive shifts and we examine two dispersion measures that satisfy this property. Finally, we empirically compare the proposed dispersion measures with the standard deviation and the conditional value at risk on the US stock market. Moreover, within the empirical example the so called alarm is incorporated in order to predict potential fails of the market.","[Giacometti, Rosella; Ortobelli, Sergio] Univ Bergamo, Dept MSIA, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Ortobelli, Sergio; Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Finance, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",University of Bergamo; Technical University of Ostrava,"Giacometti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept MSIA, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy.",tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020; Ortobelli Lozza, Sergio/F-1524-2018; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Giacometti, Rosella/AAZ-8099-2020","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330; Giacometti, Rosella/0000-0002-9761-3529; Ortobelli Lozza, Sergio/0000-0003-4983-8165","Italian funds ex MURST 60%; MIUR PRIN MISURA Project; Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [13-13142S, 15-23699S, SP2015/15]; SGS Research Project of VSB-TU Ostrava; European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]","Italian funds ex MURST 60%; MIUR PRIN MISURA Project(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); SGS Research Project of VSB-TU Ostrava; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF))","This paper has been supported by the Italian funds ex MURST 60% 2013 and 2014 and MIUR PRIN MISURA Project, 2013-2015 (R.

Men with multiple physical illnesses are more adversely affected than those with a single physical illness; women are not.

We argue that simple rational-choice models of terrorist behavior - in the form of cost-benefit models - already provide a well-founded theoretical framework for the study of terrorism and counterterrorism. We also hint at their limitations which relate to the failure of accounting for the dynamics between terrorism and counterterrorism that may produce unintended second-order effects as well as for the costs associated with counterterrorism and its international dimension. We reevaluate previously proposed counterterrorism strategies accordingly.

For quantitative learning models employed in studies of low information environments, players' ex-post inferences and beliefs have been largely ignored. For games with large strategy spaces, this omission can seriously weaken the predictive power of a learning model. We propose a novel method of using players' ex-post inferences and assessments to impute foregone payoffs for unplayed strategies in low-information environments.

Half of China's exports are processing exports, which largely depend on imported intermediate inputs and tie up upstream as well as downstream trade partners. Thus, one would expect to find strong VS for China. Using the 'ordinary' I-O tables, however, this is not the case. Because the production of processing exports is only a small part of total production, the average input structure in the I-O table hides the typical features of processing exports. Using adapted, tripartite I-O tables (for 2002 and 2007) in which the processing exports have been singled out, indeed reveals the expected strong VS in China.","[Yang, Cuihong; Chen, Xikang; Zhu, Kunfu; Tang, Zhipeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dietzenbacher, Erik] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Dietzenbacher, Erik] Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, Grad Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pei, Jiansuo] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; University of Groningen; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of International Business & Economics","Dietzenbacher, E (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",h.w.a.dietzenbacher@rug.nl,"Dietzenbacher, Erik/AAK-6681-2021","Yang, Cuihong/0000-0002-4340-713X; Pei, Jiansuo/0000-0003-4360-8705; Dietzenbacher, Erik/0000-0001-8874-4175",,,,,26,31,41,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

(2011). The novelty of this model with respect to the previous framework consists in the introduction of a stylized supply chain where upstream firms - i.e. producers of capital goods (K-firms) - supply a durable and sticky input (capital) to the downstream firms, who produce consumption goods (C-firms) to be sold to households. Both C-firms and K-firms resort to bank loans to satisfy their financing needs. There are two-way feedbacks between firms and markets which yield interesting emerging properties at the macro level. We show that the interaction of upstream and downstream firms and the evolution of their financial conditions - in a nutshell: Capital and Credit - are essential ingredients of a crisis i.e. a sizable slump followed by a long recovery.

At the heart of their work was a concern about the gap between what they perceived to be the standard models in economics and the evolution of the actual economy. In particular, this meant abandoning the standard models of neoclassical economics and instead focusing on what both perceived to be an evolution towards a more managed economy. The purpose of this paper is to explain the relationship between the works of Schumpeter and Galbraith. Perhaps one of the enduring lessons that bonded Schumpeter and Galbraith is their keen focus on how the economy was evolving over time, and with it, the institutional landscape, that carried with it huge implications for public policy.","Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Audretsch, DB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, Suite 211,Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",daudrets@indiana.edu,,"Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762",,,,,35,2,8,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Eliminating asset market risk for the retired raises their welfare, whereas it lowers the welfare of the workers, despite the fact that they benefit later from the same arrangement. Overall welfare falls. The welfare effects are largest when personal and pension portfolios are optimally chosen.

Thus the main conclusion of the article is that coordinated measures of monetary and fiscal policies could achieve both goals, i.e. that fiscal and monetary authorities can stimulate economic growth without endangering price stability.","[Coric, Tomislav; Simovic, Hrvoje] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Deskar-Skrbic, Milan] Erste & Steiermark Bank Dd, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Simovic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",hsimovic@efzg.hr,"Simovic, Hrvoje/H-7676-2018","Simovic, Hrvoje/0000-0002-4040-0899; Coric, Tomislav/0000-0002-4396-2491",University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.02.]; Croatian Scienece Foundation [IP-2013-11-8174],University of Rijeka; Croatian Scienece Foundation,University of Rijeka [Grant Number 13.02.1.2.02.]; Croatian Scienece Foundation [Grant Number IP-2013-11-8174].,,24,21,21,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

It is based on a panel data set using methods that tackle slope heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and nonstationarity. The results do not point to a general direct robust link between trade and financial integration and financial development in SSA, once we control for other factors such as GDP per capita and inflation. The findings may be due to a number of factors including distortions in domestic financial markets, relatively weak institutions and/or poor financial sector supervision. We find some indication that financial integration is more important for financial development in countries with better institutional quality. Stronger scores in some measures of the quality of banking regulation and supervision are also linked to a positive association between integration and financial development in some of our results. Thus, African policy-makers should be cautious about expectations regarding immediate gains for financial development from greater international integration. Such gains are more likely to occur slowly and through indirect channels.","[David, Antonio C.; Mlachila, Montfort; Moheeput, Ashwin] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"David, AC (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",ADavid@imf.org,,"MLACHILA, MONTFORT/0000-0003-2533-3728",,,,,40,5,5,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We quantify the impact of this spatial pattern using a data set of Chinese firms which had never exported to the EU, the United States, and Canada before 2005. These countries imposed import quotas on textile and apparel products until 2005 and experienced a subsequent increase in imports of previously constrained Chinese firms. Controlling for firm-destination specific effects and accounting for potential true state dependence we show that the probability to export to a country increases by about two percentage points for each prior export destination which shares a common border with this country.

Otherwise, consumers may find themselves in stock-out situation, which may be a waste of their time, money and energy. As the mentioned situation intends to make a negative impact on the business performance of retailers and their suppliers, the issue of on-shelf product availability deserves particular attention. This article analyses this issue from the aspect of certain characteristics of product sales. Product availability, expressed by means of out-of-stock rate, is compared within various categories of sales variation and speed of turnover variables. In addition to these characteristics, product availability is also analysed from the aspect of various retail formats. The results have indicated that products with the highest sales variation, as well as slow turning products, are the most problematic in terms of on-shelf availability; in other words, they are characterised by the highest out-of-stock (OOS) rates. On the other hand, unlike large-scale retail formats, average store availability is the lowest in superettes, which indicates that the average OOS rate declines with the size of retail formats. In addition to serving as a basis for further research related to product availability in retailing, the given results may be used by retail managers when optimising customer service levels.","[Grubor, Aleksandar; Milicevic, Nikola] Univ Novi Sad, Subotica 24000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Grubor, A (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia.",agrubor@ef.uns.ac.rs; milicevic.nikola@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Grubor, Aleksandar/AAM-4219-2020; Milicevic, Nikola/JSK-6433-2023","Grubor, Aleksandar/0000-0001-9798-0401; Milicevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4834-6994",,,,,50,4,11,0,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

These subsidies cannot be explained by tangible economic benefits, and estimates of the value of intangible benefits also fall short of typical subsidies. In this paper, we incorporate fans' reference-dependent preferences into a model of the bargaining between local governments and teams. The model predicts that teams use relocation threats to exploit fans' utility loss from team departures, a negative deviation from the status quo, to extract large subsidies from local governments. Fans' loss aversion provides an explanation of the current team distribution, and observed team relocation and league expansion decisions in North America. The model also highlights the importance of anti-trust exemptions of the leagues in creating credible relocation threats for existing teams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Every month, the CEOs of the FEA's regional agencies are asked about their expectations of future labour market developments. We generate an aggregate unemployment leading indicator that exploits serial correlation in response behaviour through identifying and adjusting temporarily unreliable predictions. We use out-of-sample tests suitable in nested model environments to compare forecasting performance of models including the new indicator to that of purely autoregressive benchmarks. For all investigated forecast horizons (1, 2, 3 and 6 months), test results show that models enhanced by the new leading indicator significantly outperform their benchmark counterparts.

Works in the financialisation literature have tried to explain this phenomenon by arguing that rising financial payments and purchases have come at the expense of productive investment. This article shows that such arguments are not supported by the data. It also explains theoretically why rising dividend payments and the growth of corporations' portfolio investment are compatible with the fact that corporations' productive investment did not decline during the first two decades of 'neoliberalism' in the USA. There would necessarily be a trade-off between these uses of funds if they were all funded out of current profits, but there is no necessary trade-off because borrowed funds are an additional source. Finally, the article shows that the fall in US corporations' rate of profit (rate of return on investment in fixed assets) fully accounts for the fall in their rate of capital accumulation.","[Kliman, Andrew] Pace Univ, Pleasantville, NY 10570 USA; [Williams, Shannon D.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Pace University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Kliman, A (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, Dept Econ, 861 Bedford Rd, Pleasantville, NY 10570 USA.",akliman@pace.edu,,,,,,,20,67,75,5,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Goal of the research -analysis of data on electric energy production in Latvia and expert estimate of the ways for creating energy security potential of the country. Methods of the research are analysis of statistical data, and methods of expert evaluation. Novelty of the paper is conditioned by the fact that expert estimation of the possible ways for creation of energy security potential of Latvia has been performed for the first time, and the consolidated opinion of a group of independent experts has been obtained on the most prospective ways. One of the main aims is diversification of ways of energy resources supply to Latvia. By the year 2030, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of Latvia has been planning to decrease the volume of imported energy resources by 2 times and produce half of the energy by using its own renewable energy sources. Currently there are the ongoing negotiations in Latvia about the construction of another large hydropower plant (HPP) with the output of about 200 MW on the Daugava River. In the discussions the new HPP is considered to be a more ecological and economic alternative than the construction of Visaginas Nuclear PP. The estimates obtained from the expert query show large differences in their opinions. Altogether four methods are used for the processing of results of expert estimation, all the results of alternative ranking are compared and analysed by four methods. The conducted analysis makes it possible to conclude the following: the most promising directions for electric energy industry development in Latvia and, on this basis, for the creation of energy security potential of the country is the construction of HPP and heat power plants using its own energy resources. The direction of wind power industry development is recognised as important.","[Kochetkov, Yuri; Yurkovskaya, Tatyana] Baltic Int Acad, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia",,"Kochetkov, Y (通讯作者)，Baltic Int Acad, Lomonosova Str 4, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia.",Jurijs.Kocetkovs@rtu.lv; coyraz@gmail.com,,"Kochetkov, Yuri/0000-0002-1708-201X",,,,,57,1,1,0,6,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Most existing studies use wage equations to document wage differences, but little is known about the reason for the differences and the sorting of workers. Using an equilibrium search model, search frictions are taken into account. Additionally, sorting is examined using a logit model. We find that wage differences between workers who have a normal weight and workers who are overweight or obese can be explained by differential firm behavior, with respect to both the job-offer arrival rate and the probability of being promoted.","[Kromann, Lene] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Kromann, Lene] Copenhagen Business Sch, CEBR, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Copenhagen Business School,"Kromann, L (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",lkro@sam.sdu.dk,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Accordingly, this article explicitly shows that (i) a policy rule works effectively under some economic growth and inflation patterns but not necessarily under other patterns, (ii) a policy rule contributing to high economic growth may not always be compatible with stabilisation of economic growth, and (iii) the macroeconomic effects of debt and income distribution on economic growth and inflation are closely related to the choice of interest rate rule.","[Nishi, Hiroshi] Hannan Univ, Matsubara, Osaka, Japan",,"Nishi, H (通讯作者)，5-4-33 Amami Higashi, Matsubara, Osaka 5808502, Japan.",nishi@hannan-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245023] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,43,7,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In several countries, there is no classification of the underlying assets. Consequently, investors have fewer tools to identify which securitizations are subprime. Using a sample of mortgage securitization transactions issued in Spain from 1998 until the first half of 2009, we analyse the effects of a great securitization expansion. According to previous literature, we identify main determinants of residential mortgage-backed security default rate and construct a prediction model of default rate. By means of different probit models, our results show the importance of loan to value and seasoning, among other determinants, as predictive indicators of default rates. The results obtained point to more relaxed lending standards due to higher securitization levels. Our findings help to gain a more accurate perspective of the true effects of the mortgage securitization process and reinforce the role of certain determinants as default predictors in a context without a classification of underlying assets.","[Otero-Gonzalez, Luis; Duran-Santomil, Pablo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Finance & Accounting, Fac CC EE EE, La Coruna, Spain; [Ezcurra-Perez, Miguel] Swiss Re, London, England; [Lado-Sestayo, Ruben] Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade da Coruna,"Lado-Sestayo, R (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, La Coruna, Spain.",ruben.lado.sestayo@udc.es,"Lado-Sestayo, Rubén/AAC-3201-2019; DURAN SANTOMIL, PABLO/U-8352-2018; /F-2087-2015","Lado-Sestayo, Rubén/0000-0003-3760-2868; DURAN SANTOMIL, PABLO/0000-0002-8231-6425; /0000-0002-8214-6227",,,,,29,5,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

But the most dangerous are cartels. It is recognized that cartels make a great harm to all market players and adversely affect national economy and its competitiveness. The question is whether the companies are more likely to make the cartel agreement in growing economy, or on the contrary - in recession? Various authors' studies present different conclusions: 1) the economic downturn and demand uncertainty promotes the formation of cartels and 2) the economy increases, especially in emerging markets, firms tend to increase profits by making cartels. Probably there is no single answer, what relationship exists between the cartels and economic fluctuations, as it can be affected by various factors. This paper analyzes the situation of cartels in the country of small economy with developing culture of competition and evaluates the relationship between the cartels and the economic fluctuations. The empirical analysis is based on Lithuanian cases. This country is chosen because it corresponds to the features of the small economy with developing culture of competition. The specific of Lithuanian cartels justifies the necessity of evaluation the relationship between the cartels and the economic fluctuations. The lack of information is an obstacle to efficient and successful implementation of strategic decisions directing to the minimization of the number of cartel agreements and their negative impact on the economy. The research has shown that there is a moderate linear correlation between the cartels and the Lithuanian economic fluctuations.","[Pekarskiene, Irena; Bruneckiene, Jurgita] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Pekarskiene, I (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",irena.pekarskiene@ktu.lt; jurgita.bruneckiene@ktu.lt,"Bruneckiene, Jurgita/AAE-4948-2020","Bruneckiene, Jurgita/0000-0002-8281-1813",,,,,39,2,2,1,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using macroeconomic data from three mineral-producing countries (Australia, Canada and New Zealand) and two non-mineral-resource countries (USA and UK), I estimate the impulse response functions of the policy interest rates and the core consumer price index (CPI) inflation rates to mineral-commodity price shocks. I find that the central banks in both groups of the examined countries significantly respond to mineral-commodity price shocks. In responses to an unexpected 10% increase in mineral commodity prices, the central banks are estimated to increase their policy interest rates by approximately 0.8 percentage points. Moreover, the central banks seem to take anticipatory policy reactions to control core CPI variations triggered by these shocks. Thus, mineral commodity prices would act as important determinants of the monetary policies in both groups of the examined countries. These findings would be useful for analysing Taylor rules in their countries. However, effects of the increase in their policy interest rates on core CPI inflation cannot be identified for the examined countries.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan",Kyoto University,"Sekine, A (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan.",sekine.atsushi.32r@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Sekine, Atsushi/0000-0002-6215-8917",,,,,21,2,2,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We found that both the cooperative banks from Switzerland and the savings banks from Norway and Sweden have a high level of cost efficiency. With regard to the variables that influence the inefficiency level, the results showed that a higher risk implies the growth of this level, while an increase in performance leads to a decrease in inefficiency. The results showed that a higher rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth implies an increase in the inefficiency level.

The empirical relation between the model implied volatility' and the degree to which the option is in-the-money (moneyness) has been reported as resembling a U-shape (or smile') for options on currencies (and more of a smirk' for options on equities). In this article, using multivariate time-series analysis and employing an impulse response function, we investigate the structural relationships and dynamics of the volatility smile in relation to the option liquidity, key features of the underlying asset and market momentum. Our findings confirm evidence of a number of biases in the Black-Scholes model consistent with Chou et al. (2011) in regard to liquidity in both the underlying and the option itself, and with Pena et al. (1999) as to the importance of the option time to maturity. As well as delineating such biases as they co-relate both with each other and with the underlying asset volatility and momentum, we find that the pronounced smile is related to the differential sensitivities of in-the-money and out-of-the-money options, which itself suggests an explanation for the characteristic smile shape.","[Tanha, Hassan] Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Finance & Financial Serv Discipline, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Dempsey, Michael] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Finance Discipline, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Tanha, H (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Finance & Financial Serv Discipline, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",Hassan.Tanha@vu.edu.au,"Dempsey, Michael/GSM-7774-2022","Dempsey, Michael Joseph/0000-0002-9059-0416",,,,,16,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Cluster analysis can be a pre-requisite to other methods, and an analytic method in itself, useful for identifying the details that really matter and discovering surprising patterns in the data. I discuss the application of cluster analysis on the Comparative Constitutions Project database. Qualitative comparative analysis can reveal the hidden structure of interactions among different variables, but robustness checks are difficult to perform. Case studies are useful for distinguishing between rules-in-use and rules-in-form and for discovering important informal aspects. They can deal with complex nonlinearities well, but they are often hard to generalize.","[Tarko, Vlad] George Mason Univ, Econ Dept, Enterprise Hall,4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Tarko, V (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Econ Dept, Enterprise Hall,4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",vtarko@gmu.edu,,,,,,,79,2,2,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Social norms are often sustained by multiple mechanisms, including a desire to coordinate, fear of being sanctioned, signaling membership in a group, or simply following the lead of others. This article shows how stochastic evolutionary game theory can be used to study the resulting dynamics. I illustrate with a variety of examples drawn from economics, sociology, demography, and political science. These include bargaining norms, norms governing the terms of contracts, norms of retirement, dueling, foot binding, medical treatment, and the use of contraceptives. These cases highlight the challenges of applying the theory to empirical cases. They also show that the modern theory of norm dynamics yields insights and predictions that go beyond conventional equilibrium analysis.","Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford,"Young, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",peyton.young@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,142,209,228,4,80,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4607-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Defining the relationship between time charter and spot freight rates will illuminate the fluctuation mechanism of the spot freight market. In this article, three types of dry bulk ships - Capsize, Panamax and Supramax - are chosen to investigate the relationship between time charter and spot freight rates and to analyse the price discovery function of time charter contracts. A vector error correction model is developed, and an impulse response function is used to analyse the influence of time charter rates on spot freight rates. Empirical studies indicate that there are two-way lead-lag relationships between the time charter and spot freight rates and that a time charter contract has a price discovery function. Smaller ship sizes and longer durations lead to a stronger price discovery function.","[Zhang, Hong] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Qingcheng] Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Transportat Management, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Dalian Maritime University,"Zeng, QC (通讯作者)，Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Transportat Management, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.",qzeng@dlmu.edu.cn,,"Jayden, Cazi/0000-0002-6067-1274",,,,,13,10,10,3,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Some economists conclude that China's grain economy is well integrated, while others argue that China's gradual reforms have led to fragmented domestic markets while others conclude that previous studies have produced mixed results. To reconcile the debate, this article models and analyses the behaviour of China's food grain retail markets by testing for the existence of the convergent price clustering clubs using appropriate econometric methods and price data over 1997-2010. The article finds evidence as to why the controversy remains by identifying a number of small divergent price clustering clubs where it is hard to conclude that China's food grain markets are fully integrated. However, given that large convergent clustering clubs were also identified, it can be concluded that the degree to which Chinese grain food retail markets are integrated is 'high'. This finding is important for those who plan to investigate the economic behaviour of grain production under the assumption of a pure, fully integrated, food market economy in China.","[Zhu, Yanjie; Ren, Xiaojing; Ma, Hengyun] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yanjie] Henan Inst Educ, Dept Informat Technol, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ & Finance, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",Henan Agricultural University; Henan Finance University; University of Waikato,"Ma, HY (通讯作者)，Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",h.y.ma@163.com,"Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008","Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",National Social Science Foundation of China [14BGL093]; First Henan University Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Support Plan of Education Department of Henan Province [2012-CXTD-03]; Philosophy and Social Science Key Breakthrough Project of Education Department of Henan Province [2013-ZG-06]; Science and Technology Key Research Project of Education Department of Henan Province [13A790472],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); First Henan University Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Support Plan of Education Department of Henan Province; Philosophy and Social Science Key Breakthrough Project of Education Department of Henan Province; Science and Technology Key Research Project of Education Department of Henan Province,"Financial supports from National Social Science Foundation of China [14BGL093], The First Henan University Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Support Plan of Education Department of Henan Province [2012-CXTD-03], Philosophy and Social Science Key Breakthrough Project of Education Department of Henan Province [2013-ZG-06] and Science and Technology Key Research Project of Education Department of Henan Province [13A790472] are gratefully acknowledged.",,38,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a calibrated simple New-Keynesian model with endogenous growth and nominal rigidity, we compare two price setting environments of Calvo (1983) and Rotemberg (1982). In our growth model, the steady state welfare maximizing inflation takes into account the growth effect as well as the price distortionary effects of inflation. The long run welfare maximizing trend inflation could be positive in economies with nominal rigidity in the form of partial inflation indexation and price stickiness. A higher degree of inflation indexation lowers the steady state price distortion in the Calvo model and steady state price adjustment cost in Rotemberg model and raises the long run optimal inflation. Since the productive inefficiency caused by partial inflation indexation is higher in Calvo economy compared to Rotemberg, the long run optimal trend inflation is higher in Rotemberg than in Calvo. In both models, a two percent long run inflation target is attainable for a reasonable degree of inflation indexation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A decline in marital attractiveness of famine-affected cohorts, which is correlated with an increase in marital childlessness, provides support for the external validity of the Choo-Siow decomposition.

Using a price formation model based upon the excess of supply/demand, but also on the difference between the reported and real earnings of the firm, our results indicate that (1) insiders systematically misreport earnings, (2) earnings management is perceived as a self-dealing strategy, (3) insiders time opportunistically their transactions, thus, achieving higher returns than outsiders, and (4) insider information is not properly conveyed in prices, what erodes market efficiency. Therefore, earnings management and insider trading induce inefficiencies on stock prices and affect the reliability and confidence on financial markets. We thus advocate for the enforcement of financial market regulation since the ethical reasoning of investors is not enough to prevent opportunistic practices.","[Del Brio, Esther B.; Perote, Javier] Univ Salamanca, IME, Campus Miguel de Unamuno,Edif FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Lopes-e-Silva, Ilidio] Polytech Inst Viseu, Campus Politecn Santa Maria, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal",University of Salamanca; Instituto Politecnico de Viseu,"Perote, J (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, IME, Campus Miguel de Unamuno,Edif FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",perote@usal.es,"Perote, Javier/E-6235-2016","Perote, Javier/0000-0002-9122-4370","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO201345615, ECO2013-44483-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),This author acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness through the project ECO201345615 and the project ECO2013-44483-P.,,82,3,3,0,46,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Dissimilarity and Gini-opportunity indexes are calculated to provide different measures of inequality of opportunity using a self-reported variable for health status. The Shapley-value decomposition is then used to estimate the contribution of early-life circumstances such as parental background, region of origin and ethnicity to inequality of opportunity. The findings suggest that 8 % to 10 % of the circumstance-driven opportunities distinctively enjoyed by those who are healthier should be redistributed or otherwise compensated in order to achieve equality of opportunity. Differences in household socio-economic status during childhood and parental educational attainment appear to be the most salient dimensions of inequality of opportunity in adult health.","[Fajardo-Gonzalez, Johanna] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Fajardo-Gonzalez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",fajar016@umn.edu,"Fajardo-Gonzalez, Johanna/AAO-7081-2020; Fajardo-Gonzalez, Johanna/U-3228-2017","Fajardo-Gonzalez, Johanna/0000-0001-6984-1252",,,,,36,10,15,2,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

In Norway, a policy of issuing graded rather than full time sickness absence certificates, is viewed as a strategy not just to reduce direct costs of sick pay but also to facilitate returns to work and reduce inflows to permanent disability. This paper analyzes effects of graded sick leave on firm profits, on average and across different firm groups. A series of panel data models are formulated to estimate the effects of grading on firm profits. In these models, grading is found to mitigate the negative effects of sickness absence on firm profit. A one percentage point increase in full time sickness absence leads to a 1.7% reduction in return on assets relative to the sample mean; this negative effect is reduced by 70% when absence is graded. Effects are robust to inclusion of firm fixed effects as well as time-varying proxies for labor demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our work analyses the effects of suspension on the investment choice of borrowers under uncertainty and on the lending policy of banks facing asymmetric information. We show that suspension should be tightened at low loan rates, but loosened otherwise, to improve the repayment performance of borrowers. We also show that although credit rationing may not be completely removed due to imperfect information, the excess demand for credit or transitive waiting in the market can actually be attenuated by such efficient use of suspension.

The size of this effect increases with the length of the period of independence and its intensity. This effect persists even after accounting for the fact that cities did not become independent randomly. We conjecture that the Middle-Age experience of self-government fostered self-efficacy beliefs-beliefs in one's own ability to complete tasks and reach goals-and this positive attitude, transmitted across generations, enhances civic capital today.

This eliminates monopoly distortions. As tradeable assets, bounty claims can earn intertemporal bounties or state-dependent prizes, conditioned on time-varying market sales from bountiable goods multiplied by a time-invariant bounty rate. Creative destruction can make some bounty claims worthless, however. Government collects taxes to pay bounties. The switch from patents to intertemporal bounties is simulated using an R&D-based growth model calibrated to the U.S. economy. Funded by a tax on labor income, the regime switch can generate a consumption-equivalent welfare gain of 7%. This is considered the maximum opportunity cost to keep the U.S. patent system, as the labor income tax is non-distortionary in the model. Funded by the distortionary capital income tax, the regime switch can remain welfare-improving, provided the bounty rate is set appropriately. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For example, is a more stringent carbon cap called for if excessive carbon emissions today may trigger a shift toward greener preferences in the future? In contrast to the related literature, which largely focuses on regime shifts in damages, not preferences, we find that the possibility of a shift in environmental preferences can induce higher, or lower, optimal current emissions. This hinges on an economically interesting interplay between the magnitude of the possible shift, whether the shift is endogenous, and the magnitude of environmental damages. This helps reconcile the tension between the conservationists' view of pollution reduction (to reduce damage and lessen the likelihood of regime shift) and the traditional economic rationale emphasizing risk and discounting.

Specifically, banks' target capital ratios are estimated and compared with actual capital ratios to identify capital gaps, and the responses to the gaps are then analyzed using a panel model. The empirical results show that the expansion of the credit-to-GDP gap increases the target capital, hence reducing the capital gap. Additionally, changes in the capital gap impact banks' asset compositions and managerial behaviors. A decrease in the capital gap lowers the growth rate of total assets, risk-weighted assets, and loan obligations, but increases the growth rate of core capital relative to risky assets by a higher degree than that of the risk-weighted assets itself. Similar results are shown in various cases using other popular indicators as predictor variables for credit cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Hiring labor and buying agricultural services also impact left behind workers' time allocation. Moreover, we find that in China, contrary to several other developing countries, there is no trend towards a feminization of agriculture, but rather a tendency in the reverse direction.

This paper presents a theoretical model capable of providing a succinct comparison, of three broad forms of trade barriers involving i) trade costs, ii) localized tastes, and iii) information frictions. Despite being traditionally under-researched, it provides the stark finding that information frictions often generate the relatively more powerful marginal effect in reducing cross-border trade, and associated levels of welfare.

A calibrated version of the model is shown to provide an intelligible account of several recurring economic phenomena, thus constituting a favorable ground for policy analysis. The investigation provides a valuable methodological contribution to the field of banking research and sheds new light on the role of banks and their prudential regulation.

In this paper, the authors estimate trade balance equations for the Southern European countries, both for total trade and for the trade performed with the European Union, taking three alternative measures of the real exchange rate, based on consumption price indices, export prices and unit labour costs, respectively.

First, the price of formal land titles is often prohibitive, restricting access for both men and women. Second, when formal titles are issued, men are recorded as the sole owners of household land in the vast majority of cases. In theory, these problems may be in tension: requirements to grant women equal ownership may reduce the overall household demand for titling. In practice, we find no such trade-off: when residents of low-income, unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam were offered price discounts for formal land titles, demand rose significantly. Price elasticity of demand was unchanged when price discounts were conditional on registering a woman as (co-)owner of household land. Furthermore, conditional price discounts achieved near gender parity in land ownership. (C) 2016 M. Collin. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We show that positive wealth transfer shocks have a lagged positive response on output provided that persistence is sufficiently low, but these effects are small in comparison to other aggregate shocks. In fact, our calibration and simulation results suggest that wealth transfer shocks would need to be around nine times as large in order to produce the GDP volatility created by productivity shocks.

Assuming that payoff functions satisfy general shape restrictions, we show that equilibrium of the game implies a covariance restriction between each player's action and a component of the player's payoff function that we call the strategic index. The strategic index captures the direction of strategic interaction (i. e., patterns of substitutability or complementarity) as well as the relative effects of opponents' decisions on players' payoffs. The covariance restriction we derive is robust to the presence of multiple equilibria, and provides a basis for identification and estimation of the strategic index. We introduce an econometric method for inference in our model that exploits the information in moment inequalities in a computationally simple way. We analyze its properties through Monte Carlo experiments and then apply our approach to study entry behavior by chain stores where there is both an intensive margin of entry (how many stores to open in a market) as well as the usual extensive margin of entry (whether to enter a market or not). Using data from retail pharmacies we find evidence of asymmetries in strategic effects among firms in the industry that has implications for merger policy. We also find that business stealing effects are less pronounced in larger markets, which helps explain the large positive correlation in entry behavior observed in the data.","[Aradillas-Lopez, Andres] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gandhi, Amit] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Aradillas-Lopez, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",aaradill@psu.edu; agandhi@ssc.wisc.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,43,15,18,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Using a regime-switching model that controls for the economic effects of monetary policy we identify three co-movement regimes. We document that risk-based portfolio strategies poorly perform in the low correlation regime which features inflation shocks. We find outperformance evidence under the negative correlation regime with a high stock market risk and a very accommodating Fed policy. Less effectiveness is demonstrated under the positive correlation regime where bonds are regarded as risky assets and interest rate volatility is fueled by monetary policy.,"[Flageollet, Alexis; Bahaji, Hamza] NATIXIS Asset Management, 21 Quai Austerlitz, F-75013 Paris, France; [Bahaji, Hamza] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Bahaji, H (通讯作者)，NATIXIS Asset Management, 21 Quai Austerlitz, F-75013 Paris, France.;Bahaji, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Paris, France.",alexis.flageollet@am.natixis.com; hamza.bahaji@am.natixis.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The massive inflow of FDI in China's labor intensive industries is inconsistent with the conventional wisdom that FDI should be more prevalent in technology-intensive and low competition industries. To explain this puzzle, we offer a fire sale hypothesis: facing severe financial constraints, Chinese private firms give up their equity to form joint ventures with foreign firms in order to obtain financing. Using the garment industry as an example, we find that among domestic firms, the financial constraint index is highest for private firms and lowest for state-owned firms. We further estimate a probit model of joint-venture decisions by private firms. Our results suggest that those private firms with greater financial constraints are more likely to seek foreign joint ownership. The effect of financial constraints on joint venture decision is both statistically and economically significant. Journal of Comparative Economics 44(4) (2016) 884-901.

(1986) allowing heterogeneous partners to choose their sharing rule. A sharing rule is optimal if the repeated game under the sharing rule has a public strategy equilibrium whose payoff sum is not improved by any public strategy equilibrium under any sharing rule. Two key factors for the analysis are the efficiency loss from allowing only the more productive partner to work and the efficiency loss in any cooperative equilibrium from imperfect observability. If the latter loss is smaller than the former, a threshold discount factor exists below which an asymmetric sharing rule inducing only one partner to work every period is optimal. At the threshold, an optimal sharing rule uniquely exists that is also optimal for any greater discount factor. The latter sharing rule reduces to the equal sharing rule for identical partners. The optimal equilibrium payoff sum as a function of the discount factor is a step function whose jump occurs at the threshold discount factor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, we are interested in the simultaneous occurrence of such so-called spikes in two or more markets. Our approach is based on a novel dynamic model for multivariate binary outcomes, which allows the latent variables driving these observed outcomes to follow a vector autoregressive process. Furthermore the model is constructed using a copula representation for the joint distribution of the resulting innovations. This has several advantages over the standard multivariate probit model. First, it allows for nonlinear dependence between the error terms. Second, the distribution of the latent errors can be chosen freely. Third, the computational burden can be greatly reduced making estimation feasible in higher dimensions and for large samples. The model is applied to spikes in half-hourly electricity prices in four interconnected Australian markets. The multivariate model provides a superior fit compared to single-equation models and generates better forecasts for spike probabilities. Furthermore, evidence of spillover dynamics between the markets is revealed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using data at municipality level, we exploit the fact that municipalities have different exposure to the reform. We report a significant impact of the land reform on the number of murders: in those municipalities with a higher proportion of social land, and therefore more exposed to the land reform, the number of murders decreased more than in those municipalities less exposed to the land reform. Our results suggest that clearly specified and consistently enforced land rights reduce gainsfrom violence, leading therefore to lower levels of violence, as measured by the number of murders.

While in power from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban ruled a large portion of the Afghan territory and introduced a ban on girls' education. Using data from the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment survey, we rely on the fact that, depending on their year of birth and province of residence, individuals differed in the number of years they were exposed to the Taliban government while of school age. Our difference-in-differences estimates show that an additional year of exposure to the Taliban occupation while of school age reduces a woman's probability of completing basic education by about two percentage points. The effects on educational outcomes are larger in Pashtun districts and rural areas. These findings are not due to the 1992 introduction of the provisional Islamist government that preceded the Taliban, cultural differences related to ethnicity, or varying emigration rates across provinces. The estimates are robust to differences across provinces in the number of violent events before, during, and after the Taliban occupation. Women exposed to the Taliban's radical religious rule while they were of school age are also less likely to be employed outside of the household and more likely to have an agricultural job within the household. For fertility choices, exposure to the Taliban occupation increases total number of children and lowers age at first marriage. We discuss our empirical findings against theoretical economic literature on radical religious groups (e.g., Iannaccone, 1992; Berman, 2000). Journal of Comparative Economics 44(4) (2016) 821-841.

The paper highlights the severity and discriminatory nature of China's anti-dumping problems. The high concentration of the share of anti-dumping actions taken by the top 4 and top 8 anti-dumping initiators is noted. Our finding of a weak effect of existing RTAs on mitigating China's anti-dumping problems supports the argument that China could become more active in mitigating anti-dumping problems through RTA negotiations. An RTA can include a higher level of openness in exchange for an improvement in regional anti-dumping provisions. Case studies on RTAs involving the EU, the USA and India offer some precedents for offering inducements and modifying regional anti-dumping provisions. The approaches for China may lie in obtaining market economy status from intensive anti-dumping initiators at RTA levels and also altering regional anti-dumping provisions that could be put in place in exchange for some potential concessions.","[Sun, Yanlin] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] Western Univ, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Wuhan University of Technology; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Sun, YL (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",jocesunyl@126.com; jwhalley@uwo.ca,,,Ontario Research Fund; Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI),Ontario Research Fund; Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI),This paper is financially supported by the Ontario Research Fund and the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).

The capital gains from bond price and equity price increases turn out to be concentrated among relatively few households, while the median household strongly benefits from housing price increases. The capital gains from bond price increases (relative to household net wealth) do not correlate with household net wealth (or income). Bond price increases thus leave net wealth inequality largely unchanged. In contrast, equity price increases largely benefit the top end of the net wealth (and income) distribution, thus amplify net wealth inequality. Housing price increases display a hump shaped pattern over the net wealth distribution, with the poorest and richest households benefitting least, but there exists considerable heterogeneity across Euro Area countries. The ECB's OMT announcements over the summer of 2012 had quantitatively similar distributional implications as an unexpected loosening of the policy rate by about 175 basis points.

Opportunism is usually constrained by the policymakers' reputation concerns. However, if instances of rent-seeking are not easily identified, the strength of these concerns hinges on the informed constituents' ability to share their knowledge with the rest of society. We show that governments use excessive redistribution to discourage the communication of information. In contrast to the standard view that inefficient policies are necessary to implement redistribution, we argue that redistribution can perpetuate inefficient policies that generate private rents to politicians.

We design a new multi-person game, the Minimizer Game, as a testbed to compare initial choice predictions of NE, pfPCH and LK.

We develop a cross-validation procedure to fine-tune the data-dependent LASSO penalties and show that after the number of factors has been determined, a conventional least-squares approach can be used to estimate the break date consistently.

First of all, credit constraints are conceived within the Minsky's financial instability hypothesis. Secondly, markups may have different dynamic patterns and impacts. Finally, heterogeneous agents are assumed to form evolutionary expectations.

Workers are heterogeneous in ability, but not all employers observe a worker's type. Wage dispersion caused by search frictions makes the equilibrium wage distribution insensitive to informational asymmetries. Hence, the equilibrium outcome may be the same as when a worker's ability is known to every firm. The supportability of the full information outcome depends on market parameters related to productivity, knowledge, and search. The theoretical results elucidate an empirical puzzle about demographic differences in asymmetric information between employers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We document that nominal wages are downwardly rigid in emerging countries. We develop an open-economy model that incorporates this friction. The model predicts that the combination of a currency peg and free capital mobility creates a negative externality that causes over-borrowing during booms and high unemployment during contractions. Optimal capital controls are shown to be prudential. For plausible calibrations, they reduce unemployment by around 5 percentage points.

He thus provides a possible economic interpretation of the results in BBK: taxes. Schulz (2016) estimates the differential tax rates of dividends versus capital gains from ex-dividend day returns. We show that these estimated tax rates are suspect and imprecisely measured, peaking at over 100 percent in some periods. The results in BBK are robust to using tax rates from the literature (Sialm 2009). The arguments in Schulz (2016) thus crucially depend on implausibly large tax estimates.

So is the need to set aside some of the revenues as fiscal buffers against the risk of uncertain revenue flows. There is merit in both on equity and efficiency grounds. For capital-constrained resource-rich economies, the conundrum is whether to invest the savings in external financial assets, or to invest them in whole or in part in domestic infrastructure development. Conventional advice is for the former. There is growing voice, however, that there is room for both. An emerging strategy is to establish 'umbrella' sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) with three components each with a clear savings objective: for future generations, for budget smoothening buffers, and for public infrastructure investment. In sub-Saharan Africa Angola, Ghana and Nigeria are most recent examples. But will this innovation become a source of patronage or will it improve the efficiency of domestic infrastructure investment?

Technological congruence is a powerful tool that helps grasping the economic complexity of technological change with respect to the determinants of the direction of technological change and its effects in terms of growth accounting and specialization, both at the firm and the system level. Its appreciation stems directly from the advances of the economics of innovation in understanding the endogenous determinants of the introduction and diffusion of directed technological changes.

Previous studies that tried to address this issue using Australian data have been inconclusive at best but mostly showed no effects. One common feature of all studies is that they have assumed that the effects of exchange rate changes are symmetric. In this paper, we use the concept of partial sum and separate appreciations from depreciations to test whether the effects are symmetric or asymmetric. Application of the nonlinear ARDL approach of Shin et al. (2014) reveals that indeed the effects of changes in the real effective exchange rate of the Australian dollar are asymmetric in the short run as well as in the long run. While in the short run both appreciations and depreciations affect Australian domestic production, only effects of appreciation last into the long run, a unique finding.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen; Mohammadian, Amirhossein] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.;Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu,,,,,,,26,29,29,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

To capture parametric model risk inherent in the valuation procedure of fossil power plants, we use a methodology recently established in Bannor and Scherer (2013). As gas-fired power plants are seen as flexible and low-carbon sources of electricity, which are important building block's in terms of the switch to a low-carbon energy generation, we consider the model risk in this asset class in detail.

Furthermore, the differences in efficiency between foreign banks, public banks, large-sized banks and banks that belong to a local conglomerate were examined. It was concluded that the greatest efficiency was to be found in the case of foreign banks. Since size and conglomerate membership do not seem to lead to greater bank efficiency, it was proposed that Angolan policymakers should promote competition in the banking sector.","[Barros, Carlos Pestana; Mendes, Zorro] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Econ & Gestao, Lisbon, Portugal; [Leao, Emanuel Reis; Joao Macanda, Nkanga Pedro] Univ Agostinho Neto, Fac Econ, Luanda, Angola",Universidade de Lisboa; University Agostinho Neto,"Leao, ER (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Polit Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",emanuel.leao@iscte.pt,,"Leao, Emanuel/0000-0002-9586-7365; Mendes, Zorro/0000-0002-4277-0463",,,,,74,3,4,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Since many skills are age-dependent, population aging decreases the relative supply and increases the relative price of skills which depreciate with age. Thus, industries relying on skills in which younger workers are relatively more efficient will be more productive in countries with a younger labor force and less productive in countries with an older population. Building upon the neuroscience and economics literature, we construct industry-level measures of intensities in various age-dependent skills and show that population aging leads to specialization in industries which use age-appreciating skills intensively and erodes comparative advantage in industries for which age-depreciating skills are more important.

Parents invest in children's education partly due to the preference for their children to be educated. We consider a preference parameter that measures the degree of this cultural preference for education. We find that a society such as China in which parents place a high value on education accumulates more human capital, which is conducive to innovation, but the larger education investment also crowds out resources for R&D. As a result, a stronger cultural preference for education has an inverted-U effect on long-run growth. We also derive a closed-form solution for the transitional path of the equilibrium growth rate from any initial state and find that a strengthening of education preference causes an initial negative effect on growth. Finally, we consider a number of extensions to the benchmark model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The model replaces rational expectations with an adaptive learning rule that forecasts future exchange rates with an econometric model, and assumes two types of market participants, speculators and non-speculators, that differ by their forecasting model. Speculators employ a correctly specified forecasting model, are relatively short-term oriented, and are subject to momentum and herding effects via an expectation shock; non-speculators utilize a simple forecasting model, have no incentive to be short-term oriented, and are not subject to herding effects. Parameters are calibrated and estimated using the method of simulated moments, and simulation results show that the model is able to replicate foreign exchange market stylized facts better than a model of representative agent rational expectations. Furthermore, the dynamics of the model are shown to derive from both agent heterogeneity and the expectation shock. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We use this spatial variation to examine how the efficiency of electricity generators responds to increases in regulation. We show that, in response to increased regulatory stringency, electricity generators find technical efficiency enhancements and then transfer these enhancements to other units within their fleet. We find that a change in regulatory stringency translates to within-firm spillovers of 3-4%, and that these gains occur at least 3 years after the increase in regulatory stringency.

It is shown how integrated variables up to three degrees with deterministic trend parts can be transformed into positive and negative cumulative partial components. These cumulative components can be used for implementing the asymmetric causality tests based on a Wald test statistic that is shown to follow a chi-square distribution asymptotically. Each solution is expressed as a proposition and a mathematic proof is provided for each underlying proposition. This issue is important because most economic or financial variables seem to be characterized by both stochastic as well as deterministic trend parts. An empirical application is provided in order to show how the oil prices and the exchange rates as integrated variables with drift and trend can be transformed into cumulative partial sums of positive and negative components. The conducted causality tests reveal that allowing for asymmetry has important repercussions for the underlying causal inference between these two variables.","[Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser] UAE Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [El-Khatib, Youssef] UAE Univ, Dept Math Sci, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates University; United Arab Emirates University,"Hatemi-J, A (通讯作者)，UAE Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",AHatemi@uaeu.ac.ae,"El-Khatib, Youssef A.E./D-1372-2013; Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/AAC-3942-2019; El-Khatib, Y./ABB-8767-2021","Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser/0000-0002-6212-1292; El-Khatib, Y./0000-0002-7663-2675",UAE National Research Fund via the United Arab Emirates University [NF-UPAR 2013-25252],UAE National Research Fund via the United Arab Emirates University,This work was supported by the UAE National Research Fund via the United Arab Emirates University [grant number NF-UPAR 2013-25252].,,19,23,23,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We study the ratio between the risk-neutral and actual default intensities, which we call the coverage ratio or the relative credit risk premium. Actual default intensities are derived from rating agencies annual transition matrices, while risk-neutral default intensities are bootstrapped from CDS quotes of European corporates. We quantify the average risk premium and its changes over time. Compared to related literature, special attention is given to the effects of the recent financial and European sovereign crises. We find that average credit risk premia rose substantially and that post-crisis levels are still higher than those observed before the financial crisis. This observation is especially true for high-quality debt and if it persists, it will have an impact on corporates funding costs. The quantification and revision of risk premia contributes to the discussion of the credit spread puzzle and could give extra insights in valuation models that start from real-world estimates. Our work is furthermore important in the context of state aid assessment. The real economic value (REV) methodology, applied by the European Commission to evaluate impaired portfolios, is based on a long-term average risk premium.","[Heynderickx, W.; Cariboni, J.] European Commiss, JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Heynderickx, W.; Schoutens, W.] KU Leuven Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Leuven, Belgium; [Smits, B.] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Competit, Sint Joost Ten Noode, Belgium; [Smits, B.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Antwerp, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; KU Leuven; University of Antwerp,"Heynderickx, W (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, Ispra, Italy.;Heynderickx, W (通讯作者)，KU Leuven Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Leuven, Belgium.",wouter.heynderickx@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,"Heynderickx, Wouter/0000-0003-0872-8090",European Commission (DG Joint Research Centre); European Commission,European Commission (DG Joint Research Centre)(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),This research was funded by the European Commission (DG Joint Research Centre) and the European Commission had no involvement in this article other than funding.

Persistence stipulates that the ordering assigned to two choice functions is also assigned to every choice function in between.

This paper attempts to understand the latter demographic trend from the empirical perspective. We first construct a conditional hazard model that incorporates determinants of birth spacing, with a primary emphasis on human capital and personal preference factors. We then examine the importance of these factors, using a rich data set comprised of a selected sample of women from various cohorts reported in the 1980 Taiwan Census. Our results show that, in addition to the age at marriage, human capital factors such as the woman's education, job security and occupation are all significant in influencing the first spacing. The roles played by these human capital factors become even more important for the second spacing. In the third spacing, the relative importance of education and occupation still persists, while gender preferences become much stronger. Overall, while job security shortens the timing of childbearing, better education and occupation as well as more girls from previous births all lead to delays in births. As for preference factors, we find that elementary school teachers have a shorter birth-spacing compared to junior high school teachers, indicating possible personal preferences for children that are consistent with women's job selection.

This bias arises due to the classical error in variables problem and a mechanical interaction' which exists when the index comprises the asset of interest. Assuming that the market is proxied by a fixed-weight index, we demonstrate that the relative weighting of an asset within the index, and/or the magnitude of its idiosyncratic risk, directly biases the beta estimate for the individual stock and also for all stocks within the index. Via simulations, we show that the problem is most pronounced for markets with a small number of highly concentrated assets.

Inappropriate aggregation of temporal resolution can introduce substantial error into model outputs and associated economic insight. The mechanisms underlying the introduction of this error are shown. How many representative periods are needed to fully capture the variability is then investigated. For a sample dataset, a scenario-robust aggregation of hourly (8760) resolution is possible in the order of 10 representative hours when electricity demand is the only source of variability. The inclusion of wind and solar supply variability increases the resolution of the robust aggregation to the order of 1000. A similar scale of expansion is shown for representative days and weeks. These concepts can be applied to any such temporal dataset, providing, at the least, a benchmark that any other aggregation method can aim to emulate. How prior information about peak pricing hours can potentially reduce resolution further is also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The informational content of API reports is measured relative to market analysts' expectations collected by Reuters, whereas that of EIA reports is measured relative to API reports. Results suggest that unexpected inventory changes in both API and EIA reports exert an immediate inverse impact on returns and a positive impact on volatility; but the duration and magnitude of EIA inventory shocks are longer and larger, with the largest impact observed when Reuters and API both err on the same side. While there are no instant asymmetric return responses to positive and negative API shocks, the return and volatility responses to cross-commodity inventory shocks in EIA reports exhibit asymmetry.

Using a sample of 151 banks over the period 2003-2013 it reports a positive relationship between bank profitability and switching costs. The main result is that bank size measured by total assets has a complex relationship with switching costs.

We refer to this finding as contagion from the US stock market to the emerging East Asian markets. We also find an additional significant process of increasing correlations and equicorrelation (herding) in the second phase of the global financial crisis. Further, we employ two new models, namely DCCX-MGARCH (a DCC Multivariate GARCH model with exogenous variables) and DECOX-MGARCH (a dynamic equicorrelation multivariate GARCH model with exogenous variables), to identify the channels of contagion. We find that an increase in the VIX Index increases the conditional correlations and equicorrelation, while increases in TED spreads decrease the conditional correlations of six emerging East Asian countries with the USA. We compare the accuracy of the conditional correlation estimates of the DCC and DCCX models (or DECO and DECOX models) by constructing a loss function.

Specifically, I follow workers who experience temporary layoffs with or without a known recall date and workers who face involuntary reduction of work hours. Layoffs without recall date reduce spending on food by 15.2%, temporary layoffs with recall date reduce spending on food by 13%, while workers on involuntary hours reduction do not change food expenditure. The results are consistent with responses to unexpected shocks, supporting the permanent income hypothesis. Even though hours reductions significantly lower annual income, they have only a slight effect on lifetime income. This work highlights how different types of displacement trigger consumption responses via different channels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For that purpose we apply the TAR model entailing two regimes and endogenously determined threshold, delay parameter, and lag length. The results suggest that in all the countries, the interaction between equity and real estate returns is subject to regime switching in at least one direction. Equity returns in general seem to be much more sensitive to real estate returns changes, while the reaction of real estate returns to changes in equity returns is not always present and it is much more subdued and delayed. In the majority of the countries, the value of the threshold is large and negative suggesting that equity returns (real-estate returns) react differently to large negative changes of real estate returns (equity returns) when compared to changes of different magnitudes and alternative signs. Equity returns react more strongly to large negative changes of the real estate returns than to small negative or positive real estate returns changes, while the reaction of the real estate returns to the equity returns changes varies across countries, making neither regime more prevalent.","[Njavro, Mato; Posedel, Petra] Zagreb Sch Econ & Management, Zagreb, Croatia; [Vizek, Maruska] Inst Econ Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Njavro, M (通讯作者)，Zagreb Sch Econ & Management, Zagreb, Croatia.",mnjavro@zsem.hr; pposedel@zsem.hr; mvizek@eizg.hr,"Posedel Šimović, Petra/HMD-2428-2023","Posedel Šimović, Petra/0000-0002-4447-1643",,,,,31,1,1,0,6,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our findings indicate that episodes of exchange rate appreciation preceded expectations of further appreciation in the short run, but were marked by depreciations in the long run. This reversal largely explains the stabilizing pattern of expectations. Additionally, we find that the forward discount differed from future exchange rate changes due to the rejection of the unbiasedness condition and to the presence of a time-varying risk premium. Finally, we find that only short run expectations were able to outperform a random walk process as well as models of extrapolative, adaptive, and regressive expectations.

On the one hand, the media can, with some probability, uncover a bad organization if it has entered the market. On the other hand, the media reduces the incentives for bad types to enter the market in the first place.

The role of processing trade,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Processing trade; Firm productivity; Export,VERTICAL SPECIALIZATION; IMPORTED INPUTS; WORLD-TRADE; PRODUCTIVITY; FIRMS; GROWTH; LIBERALIZATION; IMPACT; INDUSTRY; QUALITY,"The firm level trade literature finds that exporters are exceptional performers for a wide range of countries and measures. Paradoxically, the one documented exception is the world's largest exporter, China. We show that this puzzling finding is entirely driven by firms that engage only in export processing the activity of assembling tariff exempted imported inputs into final goods for resale in the foreign markets. We find that processing exporters are less productive than non-processing exporters and non-exporters, and have inferior performance in many other aspects such as profitability, wages, R&D and skill intensity. Accounting for processing exporters explains the abnormality in exporter performance in China documented in the previous literature. Low fixed costs of processing exporting, as well as the trade and industrial policies favoring processing exporters are both responsible for the low productivity of processing exporters. Our analysis suggests that distinguishing between processing and non-processing exporters is crucial for understanding firm-level exporting behavior in China. It also provides caveats in analyzing the exporter performance in other developing countries that are highly integrated into the global value chains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Facing a very inelastic demand, an oil monopoly seeks to induce the highest price that does not destroy its demand, unlike the conventional Hotellian analysis: The monopoly tolerates some ordinary substitutes to its oil but deters high-potential ones. With limit pricing, policy-induced extraction changes do not obey the usual logic. For example, oil taxes have no effect on current oil production. Extraction increases when high-potential substitutes are promoted, but can be effectively reduced by supporting ordinary substitutes. The carbon tax not only applies to oil; it also penalizes its ordinary (carbon) substitutes, whose market shares are taken over by the monopoly. Thus, the carbon tax ambiguously affects current and long-term oil production and carbon emissions. (C) 2016.Elsevier B.V.

The results remain robust to a battery of validity checks. Furthermore, landline phones affect outmigration through two channels: information access on job opportunities and especially timely contact with left behind family members.

Interestingly, the effect goes against the well-documented Alchian-Allen effect if the importer is relatively rich.

Contracting failures, caused by non-verifiability of profits from new activities in original firms and overall profits from subsequent entrants, may lead respectively to implementation of new employee ideas in spinoffs and constraints on borrowing to buy out non-compete agreements. If borrowing constraints are not binding, enforcement of non-compete agreements unambiguously improves social welfare outcomes, increasing the entry of both original firms and subsequent generations of spinoffs. However, if employees are unable to buy out their non-compete covenants, enforcement of these agreements shuts down socially profitable spinoff firms. Non-enforcement sacrifices entry of original firms that would be marginally profitable in the absence of employee spinoffs, but otherwise clearly improves social welfare outcomes over enforcement in the presence of binding finance constraints.

From one perspective, FTA may promote FDI since FTA aim to promote economic activity between countries. However, lower trade barriers may lower the incentive of firms to conduct FDI. Therefore, the net impact is an empirical question. Using a panel of countries for the years 1990-2006, this article effectively controls for participation in an FTA when analyzing the impact on outbound FDI. The lengthy time series also allows us to examine effectively the dynamic nature of the relationship.

This possibility can generate income redistribution towards immigrants even if they have no voting rights. We show that the threat of conflict between natives and immigrants lowers vertical income redistribution (from the rich to the poor) as the level of immigration increases. The opposite holds for horizontal income redistribution (from natives to immigrants), which increases with the level of immigration. Income inequality weakens the negative effect of immigration on vertical redistribution, but it also reduces horizontal redistribution. These theoretical predictions are consistent with the results of our empirical analysis on data from 29 European countries: larger immigrant populations are associated with more redistribution towards immigrants and lower vertical redistribution.","[Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Solano Garcia, Angel] Univ Granada, Granada 18011, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Granada,"Sánchez-Pagés, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",sanchez-pages@gmail.com; asolano@ugr.es,"; Solano Garcia, Angel/H-3179-2017","Sanchez.pages, Santiago/0000-0003-2259-0745; Solano Garcia, Angel/0000-0001-7010-6212",Junta de Andalucia [SEJ 0361],Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"We thank audiences at Alicante, Cardiff, Carlos III Madrid, Strathclyde, SAET 2011, and the Priorat Workshop on Theoretical Political Science for their valuable comments and suggestions.

An efficient approximation algorithm based on the moment calibration method is developed to compute the multi-period VaR, and the numerical experiments show that the algorithm can yield good approximation quality. In the empirical analysis, we find that the GARCH-ST model can yield superior out-of-sample performance to a GARCH-normal model or a GARCH-t model, especially when measuring the extreme tail risk. Meanwhile, the square root of time rule (SRTR) tends to underestimate the multi-period tail risk, and cannot produce a better performance than the GARCH family models.","[Zhou, Chunyang; Qin, Xiao; Diao, Xundi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [He, Yingchen] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Columbia University,"Zhou, CY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",cyzhou@sjtu.edu.cn,"Qin, Xiao/IAQ-4178-2023","Diao, Xundi/0000-0002-7691-7208",China Scholarship Council [201506235081]; NSFC [71471115],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council [201506235081] and NSFC [71471115].,,21,3,3,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Yet when it comes to government support of grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for economic research, our sense is that many economists avoid critical questions, skimp on analysis, and move straight to advocacy. In this essay, we take a more skeptical attitude toward the efforts of the NSF to subsidize economic research. We offer two main sets of arguments. First, a key question is not whether NSF funding is justified relative to laissez-faire, but rather, what is the marginal value of NSF funding given already existing government and nongovernment support for economic research? Second, we consider whether NSF funding might more productively be shifted in various directions that remain within the legal and traditional purview of the NSF. Such alternative focuses might include data availability, prizes rather than grants, broader dissemination of economic insights, and more. Given these critiques, we suggest some possible ways in which the pattern of NSF funding, and the arguments for such funding, might be improved.","[Cowen, Tyler] George Mason Univ, Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Cowen, Tyler] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Tabarrok, Alex] George Mason Univ, Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Tabarrok, Alex] George Mason Univ, Econ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University; George Mason University; George Mason University,"Cowen, T (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.;Cowen, T (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",tcowen@gmu.edu; Tabarrok@gmu.edu,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

For this purpose, a four-variate version of non-diagonal GARCH-in-mean model that allows for asymmetry in the variance-covariance matrix is used. An important conclusion that emerges from this study is that the crude oil price uncertainty appears to be responsible for a significant decline in price returns of major feedstock edible oils considered in this study. The volatility impulse response analyses support the conclusion that the conditional variances of both edible and crude oil and covariances between them are generally highly responsive to historical shock. However, the size of the impacts is mainly commodity specific. Finally, we investigate the causality from crude oil price volatility to edible oil prices and the effects of oil price shocks on edible oil prices by using the Granger causality test and generalized impulse response function analysis, respectively. The empirical results show that there is strong evidence of causality from crude oil price volatility to all edible oil prices under study, and generalized impulse response analysis shows that the edible oil markets significantly respond to the shocks in oil prices.

This article reviews the potential trade-offs between effectiveness, moral hazard problems, and permanent redistribution. Addressing the counter-arguments against a tighter fiscal union is essential to overcome the political reluctance in some member states that are concerned about large amounts of redistribution. We discuss clawback mechanisms that have been suggested in the literature as a measure to limit redistribution, but conclude that clawbacks are undesirable, as they would essentially destroy the insurance value of a fiscal union. Instead, we propose that a clearly defined exit option as a guarantee against involuntary redistribution can make entry into a stronger fiscal union less risky and hence more attractive for member states.","[Hebous, Shafik; Weichenrieder, Alfons] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hebous, Shafik; Weichenrieder, Alfons] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Goethe University Frankfurt; Ifo Institut; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Hebous, S (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.;Hebous, S (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",hebous@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de; a.weichenrieder@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,[2014-11531],,This article is part of the research program of the Center 'Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe' (SAFE).

However, conventional discrete choice models depart from standard utility maximization models in two important respects. First, in typical discrete choice models, the total demand for a choice set is exogenously fixed. Second, conventional discrete choice models have a limited ability to describe the unrestricted substitutionary or complementary relationships between multiple categories of goods. Both suggest that conventional discrete choice models correspond to a special utility maximization problem that we can develop to incorporate endogenous change in the total demand for a choice set and multiple categories of goods in an unrestrictive way. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the theoretical foundation of such discrete choice models in the context of standard deterministic utility maximization, derive the elasticities of the implied demand functions, and obtain a method for the calculation of welfare change. The framework in this paper is most useful for considering complementary relationships across categories, which is generally intractable in conventional discrete choice models in the absence of restrictive assumptions. The analysis demonstrates that the results of discrete choice models are perfectly consistent with standard deterministic utility maximization, even if the total demand for a choice set changes endogenously or with multiple categories of goods. Thus, discrete choice models are intrinsically more applicable across a much broader range of consumer choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The hypothesis of this article is that incumbents opportunistically schedule privatizations to take place close to the next elections in order to finance higher public expenditures, aiming to please voters and increase the chances of being re-elected, particularly when their ability to borrow is constrained by high public debt. We consider the case of Albania, which is a transition and small open economy with a relatively high public debt. We find significant increases of income from privatization before elections. Despite often being trumpeted in the context of structural reforms, the intentional privatization of public assets in times of election is most likely a sub-optimal choice for the public interest. Studying the impact of elections on the privatization of public assets could be of interest to other transition economies facing fiscal constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the intensive margin is the more important contributor to export growth, contributing more than three quarters of observed growth. The intensive margin contracted significantly during the global financial crisis of 2009 but bounced back to pre-crisis levels quickly. However, the impacts on the extensive margin persisted after the crisis with lower levels of entry of firms, new products and new destinations. The short-term impact of the crisis was mitigated by the concentration of South African exports among larger, more productive super-exporters. However, the fall in entry of new firms, products and destinations as a result of the crisis may mean that this concentration persists, and, at least over the next few years, South Africa does not diversify and broaden its exports.","[Rankin, Neil] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch Cent, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa; [Matthee, Marianne] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Naughtin, Tasha] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Naughtin, Tasha] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; North West University - South Africa; The World Bank; Stellenbosch University,"Rankin, N (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch Cent, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa.",neilrankin@sun.ac.za,"Matthee, Marianne/AAU-6454-2021","Matthee, Marianne/0000-0002-4679-9757; Rankin, Neil/0000-0001-8825-3341",National Research Foundation of South Africa [90709],National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number 90709).

We propose a new technique for measuring the total magnitude of a growth episode: the change in output per capita resulting from one structural break in the trend growth of output (acceleration or deceleration) to the next. Our method allows us to quantify the amount of income gain and loss during growth accelerations and growth decelerations. We show that the income gains and losses are staggering in magnitude, often multiples of the level of income at the start of the growth episode. The top 20 growth accelerations have a net present value (NPV) magnitude of 30 trillion dollars twice the US GDP. The top 20 growth decelerations account for 35 trillion dollars less in NPV of output. What explains such 'staggering' gains and losses in income over relatively short periods is the key question that future research on economic growth should try and address. (c) 2016 The Authors.

The possibility of using government debt in portfolios as a means of hedging during times of financial crisis became especially apparent in the crises of 1997, 2001 and 2008.

In addition, we examine a novel set of decision situations where individual benefits and group damages change proportionately, as to hold the marginal per capita return constant. Individual responses to these proportionate changes are heterogeneous but on average, appropriation levels do not change significantly.

The results indicate that the influence of investment factors is different for investments of different sizes. The results also indicate that the increase in the frequency of large-scale investment decisions made by the firm influences especially the role of cash flow, diminishing its importance as an investment factor. This result allows one to argue that, probably, firms more experienced in large-scale decisions could be bolder in their decision-making process, relying less on the accumulation of funds through cash flow.","[Camargo, Marina Barboza; Azzoni, Carlos Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Camargo, MB; Azzoni, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",mabcamargo@yahoo.com.br; cazzoni@usp.br,,,"FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, SP- Brasil) [2011/11562-4]","FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, SP- Brasil)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP))","This work was supported by FAPESP grant (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, SP- Brasil) [grant number 2011/11562-4].",,30,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These premiums will contribute to the gender wage gap if women are less likely to work at high-paying firms or if women negotiate (or are offered) worse wage bargains with their employers than men. Using longitudinal data on the hourly wages of Portuguese workers matched with income statement information for firms, we show that the wages of both men and women contain firm-specific premiums that are strongly correlated with simple measures of the potential bargaining surplus at each firm. We then show how the impact of these firm-specific pay differentials on the gender wage gap can be decomposed into a combination of sorting and bargaining effects. We find that women are less likely to work at firms that pay higher premiums to either gender, with sorting effects being most important for low- and middle-skilled workers. We also find that women receive only 90% of the firm-specific pay premiums earned by men. Importantly, we find the same gender gap in the responses of wages to changes in potential surplus over time. Taken together, the combination of sorting and bargaining effects explain about one-fifth of the cross-sectional gender wage gap in Portugal.","[Card, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; IAE CSIC, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics,"Card, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Card, David/M-5090-2019; Cardoso, Ana Rute/B-5888-2009","Cardoso, Ana Rute/0000-0002-6168-8959",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [CO2012-38460]; Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Center for Labor Economics at UC Berkeley,Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Center for Labor Economics at UC Berkeley,"We are grateful to five anonymous referees, and to Laura Giuliano, Michael Ransom, Jesse Rothstein, Andrea Weber, seminar participants at California Polytechnic State University, Harvard, Northwestern, Princeton, RAND, University College Dublin, the Universities of Mannheim, Potsdam, and Venice for many helpful comments and suggestions.

The importance of these channels is empirically assessed using US data. A primary contribution of the discount factor and secondary effects of excess and average returns are found in the non-detrended analysis, confirming the theoretical characterization of the valuation effects in previous literature. By using detrended data instead, the role of excess returns would be spuriously overestimated.","[Civelli, Andrea] Univ Arkansas, Business Bldg 402, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Civelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Business Bldg 402, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",andrea.civelli@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Entry typically occurs later along the punishment path than along the collusive path (since profits are lower in the former case), and may not even occur along the punishment path. The possibility of delaying or even deterring entry may, therefore, constitute an additional incentive for deviating just before entry is supposed to occur along the collusive path. If firms set quantities and revert to Cournot equilibrium after a deviation, this incentive more than compensates for the fact that there are more firms after entry, making collusion harder to sustain before entry than after entry. If, instead, firms set prices or use optimal penal codes, deterring entry by breaking the cartel is not profitable, and thus collusion is harder to sustain after entry than before entry. The proposed model encompasses and explains conflicting results derived in the extant literature under more restrictive settings, and derives some novel results.","[Correia-da-Silva, Joao] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Correia-da-Silva, Joao; Pinho, Joana; Vasconcelos, Helder] Univ Porto, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Correia-da-Silva, Joao; Pinho, Joana; Vasconcelos, Helder] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Pinho, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.;Pinho, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",joao.correia@tse-fr.eu; jpinho@fep.up.pt; hvasconcelos@fep.up.pt,"Vasconcelos, Helder F/B-5966-2009; Pinho, Joana/M-4008-2013; Correia-da-Silva, Joao/B-5940-2009","Pinho, Joana/0000-0001-6348-3108; Correia-da-Silva, Joao/0000-0001-6040-2384; Vasconcelos, Helder/0000-0002-2584-4352","FEDER, through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE); National Funds, through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [PTDC/IIM-ECO/5294/2012, PEst-OE/EGE/UI4105/2014]; European Commission through Marie Sklodowska Curie Fellowship [H2020-MSCA-IF-2014-657283]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/79535/2011]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/IIM-ECO/5294/2012, SFRH/BPD/79535/2011, PEst-OE/EGE/UI4105/2014] Funding Source: FCT","FEDER, through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE); National Funds, through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Commission through Marie Sklodowska Curie Fellowship; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was financed by FEDER, through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE), and by National Funds, through Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), through projects PTDC/IIM-ECO/5294/2012 and PEst-OE/EGE/UI4105/2014.

While poverty, health, and inequality outcomes all improved during the Chavez administration, these outcomes also improved in each of the corresponding control cases and thus we cannot attribute the improvements to Chavismo.

The equilibrium quantity of aggregate noise trading is endogenously determined by the population size of liquidity traders active in the financial market. By improving market liquidity, public information reduces the expected trading loss of liquidity traders and thus attracts more such traders to the market, which negatively affects information aggregation. Analyzing an alternative setting that models noise trading as coming from hedgers yields similar insights. In a setting with endogenous information, public information can harm information aggregation both through crowding out private information and through attracting noise trading.

An absolute cap on coal or fossil fuel consumption has been proposed as a means to support the country's energy and climate policy objectives. We evaluate potential energy cap designs that differ in terms of target fuel, point of control, and national versus regional allowance trading using a global numerical general equilibrium model that separately represents 30 provinces in China. First, we simulate a coal cap and find that relative to a cap on all fossil fuels, it is significantly more costly and results in high localized welfare losses. Second, we compare fossil energy cap designs and find that a national cap on downstream fossil energy use with allowance trading across provinces is the most cost effective. Third, we find that a national fossil energy cap with trading is nearly as cost effective as a national CO2 emissions trading system that penalizes energy use based on carbon content. As a fossil energy cap builds on existing institutions in China, it offers a viable intermediate step toward a full-fledged CO2 emissions trading system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We compare a business-as-usual scenario needed to satisfy anticipated future energy demand with a set of scenarios that aim to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in the region. We find that more than a doubling of annual investments, in absolute terms, occurs in the business-as-usual scenario between 2010 and 2050, while investments may treble over the same time horizon when climate policies are introduced. Investment costs as share of GDP, however, decline over time in the business as-usual scenario as well as the climate policy scenarios, as a result of the fast economic growth of the region. In the business-as-usual scenario, cumulative investments of 1.4 trillion US$ are anticipated between 2010 and 2050 in electricity supply. These investments increase when additional climate policies are introduced: under a carbon tax of 50$/tCO(2)e in 2020 growing with a rate of 4%/yr, an additional 0.6 trillion US$ (+45%) of cumulative investment is needed. Climate control measures lead to increased investment in low-carbon electricity technologies, primarily based on wind and solar resources, as well as CCS applied to fossil fuels and biomass. Our analysis suggests that, in comparison to the business-as-usual case, an average additional 21 billion US$/yr of electricity supply investment is required in Latin America until 2050 under a climate policy aiming at 2 degrees C climate stabilisation. Conversely, there is a disinvestment in fossil fuel extraction and transformation. For oil production, a growth to 130 billion US$ annual investment by 2050 is anticipated in a business-as-usual scenario. Ambitious climate policy reduces this to 28 billion US$. Mobilising the necessary additional investment capital, in particular for low-carbon energy technologies, will be a challenge. Suitable frameworks and enabling environments for a scale-up of public and private investment will be critical to help reach the required low-carbon energy deployment levels.

Our empirical results suggest that (a) on average, opening up a region for foreign bank entry has no impact on aggregate productivity growth, (b) however, industries more dependent on external finance grow faster after a region is opened up for foreign bank entry, and (c) these results are due to changes in technical efficiency rather than reallocation.

When performing computational experiments with this model, we find that it shows a pronounced non-linear behavior under shocks: the default of a single unit will mostly have practically no knock-on effects, but might lead to an almost full-scale collapse of the entire system in a certain number of cases. The dependency of the overall outcome on firm characteristics like size or number of loans seems fuzzy. Distinguishing between contagion due to interbank credit and due to joint exposures to counterparty risk via loans to firms, the later channel appears more important for contagious spread of defaults.

First, we show that the same dynamical system that generates the equilibrium trajectory is obtained under a much simpler setting. Such a streamlined presentation should help to highlight the mechanism through which financial frictions cause instability and recurrent fluctuations. Then, we discuss the nature of fluctuations in greater detail when the final goods production function is Cobb Douglas. For example, the unique steady state possesses corridor stability (locally stable but globally unstable) for empirically relevant parameter values. This also means that, when a parameter change causes the steady state to lose its local stability, its effects are catastrophic and irreversible so that even a small, temporary change in the financial friction could have large, permanent effects on volatility. Other features of the dynamics include an immediate transition from the stable steady state to a stable asymmetric cycle of period n >= 3, along which n - 1 >= 2 consecutive periods of gradual expansion are followed by one period of sharp downturn, as well as to a robust chaotic attractor. These results demonstrate the power of the skew-tent map as a tool for analyzing a regime-switching dynamic economic model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Decomposition of total energy intensity,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy systems analysis; Decomposition; Energy intensity; Canada; LMDI,DIVISIA INDEX; EMISSIONS,"Between 1995 and 2010, the total energy intensity (E/GDP, PJ/Gross Domestic Product in 2002$) of the Canadian economy declined by 23% or - 2.64 MJ/$. To understand why, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMD-I) method was used to decompose a large body of government statistical data supporting the observed E/GDP decline. The analysis shows that (a) 48% (1.27 MJ/$) of the decline was associated with an inter-sector structural change in the economy (i.e. an increased contribution to the total GDP of the low energy-using commercial and institutional sector compared with the high energy-using manufacturing and heavy industry sectors); (b) 24% (0.62 MJ/$) was attributed to the impact of the Canadian GDP growing faster than population; (c) 22% (0.58 MJ/$) of the decline was associated with an overall decrease in business energy intensity. A deeper analysis of business sectors shows a positive impact of 0.4 MJ/$ from increased energy intensity in the oil and gas sector, offset by a 0.98 MJ/$ decline due to energy intensity declines in the other business sectors; (d) 6.3% (0.17 MJ/$) of the decline was associated with an improvement in the energy intensity of households, mostly from residential energy use rather than personal transportation energy use. These results provide insights for policy makers regarding those aspects of the Canadian economy that contribute to, or work against, efforts to transform energy systems toward sustainability.

Our semi-parametric model indicates a quadratic Engel curve for most of the expenditure categories, including food, and thus provides additional evidence to the argument for a quadratic food Engel curve for developing countries. As household expenditure increases, expenditures on some food categories like protein and non-home-made food increase at a faster rate, resulting in a quadratic food Engel curve. Our analysis demonstrates that knowledge about the correct specification of the Engel curves has important implications for modeling household responses to the negative income shocks. Such knowledge can be particularly useful for the developing countries where governments aim to protect the low-income households from such shocks.","[Hasan, Syed Abul] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Hasan, SA (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Coll Asia & Pacific, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",hasanandassociates@yahoo.com,"Hasan, Syed Abul/S-5065-2019","Hasan, Syed Abul/0000-0002-7439-9400",,,,,24,14,14,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The implied increase in relative costs of service production is widely claimed to have devastating implications for the public sector as a provider of tax-financed services such as health, education, and care. To match the increasing costs it appears inevitable that tax rates would be ever increasing. It is shown that this inference does not follow under standard assumptions when accounting explicitly for service provision from both the private and public sectors. Strikingly under assumptions often made in the literature, the welfare maximizing tax rate for a utilitarian policy maker would remain constant despite the Baumol cost disease, and by implication the share of public employment in total employment will remain constant.

To this end, we introduce endogenous product creation and labor market frictions in an otherwise-standard real business cycle model. Regulation affects producer entry costs, firing restrictions, and unemployment benefits. We find that reforms can have short-run recessionary effects, despite being expansionary in the long run. Estimates from a panel VAR for OECD countries provide empirical support for this result. Moreover, market deregulation has sizable effects on the efficiency of business cycle fluctuations. Increased flexibility in both goods and labor markets lowers the level and volatility of the inefficiency wedges that distort agents' equilibrium decisions, leading to a substantial reduction in the welfare cost of business cycles. Nevertheless, individual reforms produce contrasting effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We allow for the subjective probabilities of auditing and, using conventional assumptions, find that an emission tax produces a higher level of welfare than emissions trading under noncompliance. The main driver of the result is that the compliance pattern of the firms affects the marginal compliance cost (price of emissions) in the case of permits, thus affecting the level of emissions and welfare. The result also holds when enforcement and sanctioning costs are taken into account and differs from the result found by Montero (J Public Econ 85:435-454, 2002). We also show that the ranking may be reversed if these costs are taken into account and the regulator must audit at least one firm.

To examine its social desirability, we study how utilitarian criteria rank histories equal on all dimensions except the age at which individuals give birth to their children. We develop a T-period dynamic overlapping generations economy with a fixed living space, where individual welfare is increasing in the available space per head, and where agents have children in one out of two fertility periods. When comparing finite histories with an equal total number of life-periods, classical, average and critical-level utilitarian criteria select the same fertility timing, i.e. the one leading to the most smoothed population path. When comparing infinite histories with stationary population sizes, utilitarian criteria may select different birth timings, depending on individual utility functions. Those results are compared with the ones obtained when agents value coexistence time with their descendants. Finally, we identify conditions under which a shift from an early births regime to a late births regime is socially desirable.","[Ponthiere, Gregory] Univ Paris East ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] IUF, Paris, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Paris School of Economics,"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris East ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.;Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.;Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，IUF, Paris, France.",gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,31,0,1,0,9,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Evidence from China,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Unionization; Political connections; Wage inequality; China,PERFORMANCE; LABOR,"Our paper reconciles the debated literature on the role of the Chinese unions by exploring the heterogeneous effects of unionization on wages in firms with and without political connections. We utilize a survey of 1268 firms in 12 cities to verify our hypothesis that wages increase due to unionization, but this union wage effect is significantly depressed by firms' political connections. Through a detailed analysis of the mechanism behind the empirical results, we conclude that unions increase workers' wages by strengthening the bargaining power of workers, while this bargaining power can be weakened by firms' political connections. Our main conclusion is robust to a series of robustness checks. Moreover, the results from quantile regressions inform us that the union wage effect and the role of political connections may vary along with the firms' wage distribution. Our findings suggest that the solution to further increase wages for low-wage workers and reduce wage inequality is to make the labor union an independent organization which can freely bargain with firms in terms of workers' wages and benefits, rather than an agency subordinate to the government whose role can be affected by the government support and undermined largely by firms' political connections.

Motivated by some stylized facts, in a model with firm heterogeneity, including firms that differ in their skill intensity even within a narrowly defined industry, firms with relatively high skill intensity that are more likely to be exporters, and a positive association between a firm's skill intensity and its product quality, I develop a general equilibrium model where firms with a higher skill intensity endogenously choose a higher-quality product, and tend to be more profitable. In this framework, a reduction in trade costs allows members of the workforce to reallocate to more efficient firms that produce higher-quality products, using their skilled labor more intensively, resulting in a rising skill premium. The main sources of the increasing wage inequality that followed trade openness are a positive link between a firm's skill intensity, its product quality, and quality competition.","[Whang, Unjung] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Whang, Unjung] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Int Trade, Sejong Si 339007, South Korea",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Whang, U (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Whang, U (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Dept Int Trade, Sejong Si 339007, South Korea.",ujwhang@kiep.go.kr,,,,,,,39,4,4,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

After having presented the concept and its interest for comparative capitalism, this article argues in favour of its usefulness to explain institutional change. However, in order to be integrated fruitfully into a theory of institutional change, it is necessary to have a political economy definition of complementarity, which should not take institutions as some sort of inputs in a production function, but as socio-political compromises established in historically-specific conditions.","[Amable, Bruno] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Amable, Bruno] Inst Univ France, Lyon, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France,"Amable, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.;Amable, B (通讯作者)，Inst Univ France, Lyon, France.",bruno.amable@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,53,76,80,3,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We provide descriptive evidence on the extent of affirmative action in law schools, as well as a critical review of the contentious literature on how affirmative action affects URM law-school student performance. Our review then discusses affirmative action in undergraduate admissions, focusing on the effects such admissions preferences have on college quality, graduation rates, college major, and earnings.

We find that the open economy framework brings about more complex dynamics, along with a wider variety of qualitative behaviors and policy responses. Introducing parameters related to the open economy structure affects the values of bifurcation parameters and changes the location of bifurcation boundaries. As a result, the stratification of the confidence region, as previously seen in closed-economy New Keynesian models, remains an important research and policy risk to be considered in the context of the open-economy New Keynesian functional structures. In fact, econometrics and optimal policy design become more complex within an open economy. Dynamical inferences need to be qualified by the risk of bifurcation boundaries crossing the confidence regions. Policy design needs to take into consideration that a change in monetary policy can produce an unanticipated bifurcation, without adequate prior econometrics research.","[Barnett, William A.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Barnett, William A.] Ctr Financial Stabil, St Louis, MO USA; [Eryilmaz, Unal] Prime Minist Turkey, TR-06573 Ankara, Turkey",University of Kansas; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;Eryilmaz, U (通讯作者)，Prime Minist Turkey, Kanunlar & Kararlar Genel Mudurlugu, Vekaletler Cad, TR-06573 Ankara, Turkey.",barnett@ku.edu; unaleryilmaz@yahoo.com,"Eryilmaz, Unal/AAW-3748-2021; Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022","Eryilmaz, Unal/0000-0002-9056-4963",,,,,24,5,5,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We show that geographical sales diversification across different regions of the world induces UK firms to increase their R&D expenditures, as firms must innovate and develop new products to maintain a competitive edge over their rivals. This finding is robust to a battery of sensitivity checks. Furthermore, we find that R&D expenditures cause higher export sales but do not cause export sales diversification. Hence, the result that diversification causes higher R&D activity is not driven by reverse causality.","[Baum, Christopher F.] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Baum, Christopher F.] DIW Berlin, Dept Macroecon, Berlin, Germany; [Caglayan, Mustafa] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management & Languages, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Talavera, Oleksandr] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Boston College; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Heriot Watt University; University of Sheffield,"Baum, CF (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.;Baum, CF (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Dept Macroecon, Berlin, Germany.",,"Baum, Christopher F/A-9424-2008; Talavera, Oleksandr/ABE-1913-2021","Baum, Christopher F/0000-0003-4766-3699; Talavera, Oleksandr/0000-0002-4799-778X; Caglayan, Mustafa/0000-0002-1606-6501",British Academy,British Academy,"Caglayan and Baum gratefully acknowledge financial support from the British Academy.

We examine this phenomenon in a simple dynamic model of a professional labor market, where firms can pay a cost to interview applicants who have private information about their own ability. Inefficiencies arise when a firm decides not to interview potentially able candidates since it infers that sufficiently good candidates will be hired by more productive firms. This effect is robust to changes in the information structure of the market, but it can be mitigated by subsidizing screening costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that complexity in costs leads to choosing a high-benefit product, with high costs and overall lower payoffs. In contrast, when complexity is in the benefits of the product, we cannot reject the hypothesis of random mistakes. We also examine the role of heterogeneous complexity. We find that individuals still (mistakenly) choose the high-benefit but costly product, even if cheaper and simple products are available.

Despite the well-documented disadvantages of the Boston mechanism Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez (American Economic Review 93:729-747 2003), we hypothesize that a Boston mechanism where students are required to submit their preferences before the realization of their exam scores, can in fact have fairness and efficiency advantages compared to the often favored Serial Dictatorship mechanism. We test these hypotheses in a series of laboratory experiments which vary by the class of mechanism implemented, and the preference submission timing by students, reflective of actual policy changes which have occurred in China. Our experimental findings confirm the efficiency hypothesis straight-forwardly, and lend support to the fairness hypothesis when subjects have the chance to learn with experience. The results have important policy implications for school choice mechanism design when students' relative rankings by schools are initially uncertain.","[Lien, Jaimie W.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Decis Sci & Managerial Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lien, Jaimie W.; Zheng, Jie; Zhong, Xiaohan] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Tsinghua University,"Lien, JMW (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Decis Sci & Managerial Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, J; Zhong, XH (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",jaimie.lien.tsinghuasem@gmail.com; jie.academic@gmail.com; zhongxh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Lien, Jaimie/ABA-3592-2021; Zheng, Jie/F-9835-2017","Lien, Jaimie/0000-0002-9974-3212; Zheng, Jie/0000-0001-9211-2875","National Institute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173127, 71203112, 71303127]; Tsinghua University [2012z02182, 2012z02181]; Ministry of Education, China [20130002120030]","National Institute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University; Ministry of Education, China(Ministry of Education, China)","We thank the National Institute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University for funding the SEM Economic Science and Policy Experimental Laboratory (ESPEL).

We explore how the crisis affected the market power of banks and, furthermore, how the crisis was transmitted to the real sector of industrial growth. Three main results emerge. First, we find that bank competition in Kuwait was only marginally dampened during the crisis period. Second, the financial crisis penetrated the real sector through a weaker and less significant relationship between bank performance and industrial growth compared to the pre-crisis situation. Accordingly, industries depending more on external finance suffered disproportionately more during the crisis. Third, these findings apply to oil-rich Arab countries and, with respect to the adverse real effect of the crisis, to oil-exporting countries. Overall, these results confirm the vulnerability of oil-rich economies to the crisis, requiring appropriate policy actions to support financial stability and prevent declines in real economic activity.

RIN price data are used (a) to infer values of fuels where market data are unavailable and (b) to define binding and non-binding mandate regimes. A specific empirical exercise exploits the RIN price data to conduct cointegration tests on high frequency data representing spot and futures prices relating to ethanol and biodiesel from February 2009 through March 2015, finding little evidence of short-term biofuel and petroleum product substitution during this period.

A rolling window analysis is used to construct out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts of dynamic conditional correlations and optimal hedge ratios. In most of the situations we study, oil is the best asset to hedge emerging market stock prices. Hedge ratios from the ADCC model are preferred (most effective) for hedging emerging market stock prices with oil, VIX, or bonds. Hedge ratios estimated from the GO-GARCH are most effective for hedging emerging market stock prices with gold in some instances.

Assuming that the public institutions in charge of these policies lack commitment power, these interventions, both individually and jointly, are chosen and undertaken ex post. The costs of liquidation and redistribution across heterogeneous households play key roles in these decisions. If investment is sufficiently illiquid, a credible liquidation policy will deter runs. Despite the lack of commitment, deposit insurance, funded by an ex post tax scheme, will be provided unless it requires a (socially) undesirable redistribution of consumption that outweighs insurance gains. If taxes are set optimally ex post, runs are prevented by deposit insurance without costly liquidation. If not, a combination of the two policies will prevent runs.","[Cooper, Russell] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kempf, Hubert] Univ Paris Saclay, Ecole Normale Super Cachan, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 61 Blvd President Wilson, F-94230 Cachan, France; [Kempf, Hubert] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Universite Paris Saclay; Paris School of Economics,"Cooper, R (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",russellcoop@gmail.com; hubert.kempf@ens-cachan.fr,,,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Russell Cooper is grateful to the NSF for financial support.

It makes three contributions to a better understanding of the border effect puzzle. First, the special relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong provides us with a unique opportunity to disentangle the factors underlying the observed border effect. Second, in addition to estimating the border effect between mainland China and Hong Kong, we also estimate that between the mainland provinces of Guangdong and Shanghai. This comparison between two types of border effects facilitates a better understanding of the extent of domestic market integration in China. Third, owing to the nature of our data and the new estimation approach we adopt, our estimated border effects are less subject to the measurement error-related and estimation-related biases commonly seen in previous studies. We find the estimated border effect between Hong Kong and mainland China to be approximately 266km, which is substantially larger than that between Guangdong and Shanghai (1.3km). Both are substantially smaller than the estimated border effects found in many previous studies.","[Fan, Simon C.; Wei, Xiangdong] Lingnan Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jia] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University; Jinan University,"Wu, J (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Econ, 601 Huangpu Ave West, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",jwu@jnu.edu.cn,,"Fan, Simon/0000-0003-0955-5523; WEI, Xiangdong/0000-0001-6659-9149",,,,,15,3,3,1,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Then, we propose a group of logistic smooth transition heterogeneous autoregressive (LSTHAR) models of realized volatility. The models can simultaneously approximate long memory behavior and describe sign and size asymmetries. They differ in the underlying heterogeneous autoregressive structure and the transition variable specification. The out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the LSTHAR models is evaluated through the Diebold-Mariano test and the superior predictive ability test, in terms of the mean square error and the mean absolute error. Using high-frequency prices from the Australian New South Wales (NSW) electricity market as empirical data, we draw the following conclusions. 1) Introducing the logistic smooth transition structure with appropriate transition variable specification to the heterogeneous autoregressive models improves volatility forecasts. 2) Overall, the LSTHAR model that uses the sum of Beta function weighted past returns as the transition variable and includes past daily jumps as a predictor is the superior model for predicting volatility in the NSW market. This model significantly outperforms the others. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The original innovation of the MRS-GARCH model is assumed to follow the Normal distribution, which cannot accommodate fat-tailed properties commonly existing in financial time series. Many existing studies point out that this problem can lead to inconsistent estimates. To overcome it, the Student's t-distribution and General Error Distribution (GED) are the two most popular alternatives. However, a recent study points out that the Student's t-distribution lacks stability. Also, it incorporates the a-stable distribution in the GARCH-type model. The issue of the a-stable distribution is that its second moment does not exist To solve this problem, the tempered stable distribution, which retains most characteristics of the a-stable distribution and has defined moments, is a natural candidate. In this paper, we conduct a series of simulation studies to demonstrate that MRS-GARCH model with tempered stable distribution consistently outperform that with Student's t-distribution and GED. Our empirical study on the S&P 500 daily return volatility also generates robust results. Therefore, we argue that the tempered stable distribution could be a widely useful tool for modeling the financial volatility in general contexts with a MRS-GARCH-type specification.

Econometric estimates of dynamic random effects and multivariate probit models provide strong support to the thesis of persistence, particularly of linkages with the university sector and suppliers.

It is found that the patent holder prefers a two-part tariff contract, which includes both a fixed-fee and per-unit output royalty. However, the royalty included in the licensing contract makes each firm price at a markup over marginal cost and therefore makes both consumers and the society worse off, if the innovation is small and the supplier is weak. From a welfare perspective, licensing by means of an ad valorem tax is more efficient, as it allows the upstream firm to be less aggressive when trading with the downstream firm.

Following a traditional regression analysis, spatial variations in the relationships are examined utilizing different spatial econometric specifications estimated by maximum likelihood. The regressions are compared with each other via likelihood ratio tests, and the spatial Durbin model is found to be the most appropriate one suggesting that the typical least-squares model is misspecified. Empirical evidence indicates that military expenditure has a positive effect on economic growth with a significant spatial dependence for the time period under consideration.","[Yildirim, Julide] TED Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Ocal, Nadir] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey",Ted University; Middle East Technical University,"Yildirim, J (通讯作者)，TED Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",julide.yildirim@tedu.edu.tr,"Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/G-5706-2018","Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/0000-0002-4739-6028; Ocal, Nadir/0000-0001-6607-0587",,,,,83,29,30,2,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Investors should focus on the companies which represent high CSR standards. Changes in the level of these standards is important information from investors' point of view because these changes tend to be reflected in the share price and, consequently, in the rate of return. The research applying the event study methodology was conducted to determine how the inclusion or exclusion of the companies operating on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) from the ethical RESPECT Index affects the rate of return on their shares. The results confirm that investors on emerging markets also take into account the information about changes in the level of corporate social responsibility and respond positively to its growth and negatively to its decline. The same pattern of the invertors' reaction is observed on more mature markets. The obtained results not only contribute to the development of theory, but also have significant practical implications. They show that the presence in the ethical index helps to communicate higher standards of corporate social responsibility. Indicating it to investors may exert an impact on the company's market value.","[Adamska, Agata; Dabrowski, Tomasz J.] Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Adamska, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",agata.adamska@sgh.waw.pl; tomsz.dabrowski@sgh.waw.pl,,"Adamska, Agata/0000-0002-7421-5878; Dabrowski, Tomasz/0000-0002-0594-6642",,,,,61,11,11,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Consistent with agency theory, this study, using 435 large capitalization firms over the period from 2001 to 2008, finds a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have a higher level of stock liquidity.

It investigates the determinants of major economic transitions, such as the Industrial Revolution or the collapse of the Soviet Union. It asks whether evolutionary processes should lead to an increase in complexity, on average, of economic and social systems over time. It reviews modern theories of group learning in biology, which have both evolutionary and complexity dimensions, to see if they might be relevant to human social institutions, such as firms. It analyzes whether the structure of human interactions or individual human intelligence is primarily responsible for the performance of our institutions. Finally, it finds the methods of evolutionary analysis and of complex systems to be extremely useful in capturing the open-ended, evolving nature of an economy composed of interactive agents and suggests that these methods be used to create more realistic models of actual markets and economies.","[Axtell, Robert] George Mason Univ, Dept Computat Social Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Kirman, Alan] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Kirman, Alan] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Studies, F-13622 Marseille, Aix En Provence, France; [Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Chair Biodivers & Collect Behav, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Fricke, Daniel] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford OX0 6ED, England; [Hens, Thorsten] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hens, Thorsten] Norwegian Sch Econ & Business Adm, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Hochberg, Michael E.] Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Hochberg, Michael E.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Mayfield, John E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Schuster, Peter] Univ Wien, Inst Theoret Chem, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Sethi, Rajiv] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",George Mason University; Aix-Marseille Universite; Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz; University of Oxford; University of Zurich; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Universite de Montpellier; The Santa Fe Institute; Iowa State University; University of Vienna; Columbia University,"Axtell, R (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Computat Social Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,"Couzin, Iain D./Q-6862-2018; Axtell, Robert/A-4376-2009","Couzin, Iain D./0000-0001-8556-4558; Axtell, Robert/0000-0002-7187-2960",,,,,0,3,3,0,2,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,65,81,,,,,,17,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200005,0

Winter tourism is a set of activities and relationships composed of trips made to the regions which are located in the heart of ski sports and accordingly with slopes and snow, accommodations and other services. Since winter tourism mainly consists of a number of activities depending on snowy environments, it requires locations with certain height and slope which will also allow the execution of other nature sports such as walking, climbing etc. besides skiing and snowboarding. Uludag, the most popular winter sports center which is 30 km away from the Bursa city center has significant natural advantages in terms of winter tourism. However, with the recently changing tourism demands in winter tourism, developments have been taking place in the types of tourism. Uludag having natural advantages have not been able to sufficiently benefit from these advantages and cannot make use of its existing potential. Besides the countries having sucessful snow resorts of Europe such as Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy and Andorra, Romania and Bulgaria are also increasing their competitiveness in the international markets in recent years with ambitious investments. When Uludag which is in the location of the largest snow resort in Turkey is compared with these resorts, it is thought that there is a way to go in the field of winter tourism.

We use state-level data on premiums and employee contributions to health insurance from the insurance component of the 1996-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Our main analysis is a fixed effects regression that controls for age, race, income, union membership and the presence of state mandate waivers. We find robust evidence that the average mandate increases premiums by approximately 0.6%, and that mandates lead to similar increases in employee contributions for single-coverage health insurance plans. Alternative specifications using an AR(1) error structure estimate a larger effect of mandates, while those using generalized estimating equations estimate smaller effects. We find that mandates requiring insurers to cover a specific benefit, as opposed to a specific type of provider or person, lead to the largest increases in employee contributions.","[Bailey, James] Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Blascak, Nathan] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Creighton University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Bailey, J (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",jamesbailey@creighton.edu,"Bailey, James/AAE-7321-2019","Bailey, James/0000-0002-6132-6026",,,,,15,5,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Understanding immigrants 'needs means bigger chance for being accepted to the society. Public opinion will become more favourable toward immigrants and more accepting of immigration as younger, more liberal and tolerant generations replace older ones. Elderly people rely more heavily on stereotypes and lack the ability to inhibit information, causing people to be more prejudiced than they would like to be.

In order to classify the 24 developing countries included in his study, Barhoumi (2006) chose an arbitrary threshold of 10% to split the sample between high and low inflation regimes. For more accuracy, our study uses a panel threshold framework where a grid search is used to select the appropriate threshold value. In a larger panel-data set including 63 countries over the 1992-2012 period, we find that there are two threshold points identified by the data, allowing us to split our sample into three inflation regimes. When estimating the ERPT for each group of countries, we point out a strong regime-dependence of pass-through to inflation environment, that is, the class of countries with higher inflation rates experiences the higher degree of ERPT.

However, there is little empirical evidence that identifies the link between the pass-through of oil prices to gasoline in different volatility regimes. Using a Markov-switching model on weekly observations of fuel prices from 1990 to 2011, we find that fuel prices respond significantly faster to increases in crude oil prices than to decreases in crude oil prices. However, when volatility is low, the transmittal of a price change from crude oil to retail fuel is higher compared to periods of high volatility. These results provide important information on the behavior of retailers. The findings of this paper therefore provide clues for better understanding the recent dynamics of fuel prices and some policy implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It takes an integrated interdisciplinary approach to economic phenomena. Core concepts in economic theory (preference and choice) are clarified and Tinbergen's four questions about the origins of behavior are used to provide a framework. Informed by Tinbergen, areas from behavioral science are presented which may be useful for understanding economic behavior: some are directly evolutionary, while others come from scientific contexts informed by evolutionary theory. Each area has yielded well-researched ideas that provide considerable insight into human nature. It concludes with a review of where research stands today and where it could be directed in the future.","[Burnham, Terence C.] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Lea, Stephen E.

In establishing the new legislature, the adopted Constitution set rules such that a simple majority of all present representatives would determine the outcome of each legislative vote. We investigate how Convention vote outcomes might have changed if this voting rule was in place for the Convention. Using spatial models on 398 separate roll calls, we identify which vote outcomes would have differed under individual delegate voting. Analysis suggests only 16 of the vote outcomes would have changed but those that were predicted to change included considering unequal representation in the Senate (i.e., similar to representation in the House) and requiring two-thirds (rather than three-fourths) of states to ratify constitutional amendments.","[Carlsen, Paul D.] LED FastStart, Louisiana Econ Dev, 445 North Blvd,Suite 210, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA; [Heckelman, Jac C.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, 205 Kirby Hall, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA",Wake Forest University,"Heckelman, JC (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, 205 Kirby Hall, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA.",paul.carlsen@la.gov; Jac_C_Heckelman@mta.wfu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0752098],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Parts of this article are based on a chapter from Carlsen's dissertation.

However, it is reasonable to speculate that higher government debt may contribute to higher social spending, while fiscal deficits occur during a recession, which commonly creates greater demand for social expenditure. For a deeper investigation, this paper revisits the dynamic relationship between social spending and public debts in the time-frequency domain, using the novel wavelet-coherency analysis as well as the phase-difference technique to derive the co-moved and causal relationships between social spending and public debts in 13 OECD countries. The evidence identifies a dynamic relationship between variables. While higher social expenditures increase government debts, the shocks from government debts to social expenditures are conversely uncertain. We discover that higher government debt does reduce social expenditures, but it may be linked to higher social spending. The robustness of partial coherency and phase-difference discovers the role of a political party in the decision over social welfare programmes in the sample countries.","[Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping; Feng, GenFu] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lee, Chien-Chiang; Ning, Shao-Lin] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Ning, Shao-Lin] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Management, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shih Chien University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; National Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,39,4,4,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The MDC can effectively make a Coasian payment in the form of direct environmental assistance, but can also encourage good environmental citizenship through its influence over the prospect that the LDC will gain the benefits of membership into a particular international club. We examine the strategic interactions between the LDC and the MDC in this regional environmental game, and our comparative statics analysis explores how a change in the membership payoff will affect the environmental efforts and outcome of both countries. Our theoretical model also addresses the issue of the economic growth in the LDC as well as its environmental impacts in the region. We also conduct empirical study and examine the evidence in the thirteen Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries that joined the European Union (EU) in the 21st century and investigate the impacts of EU membership on their environmental performance. We find that there is a robust correlation between the degree of EU integration and pollution abatement from the LDC, and we also observe that emissions of selected pollutants seem to follow a concave pattern relative to the national income, both of which coincide with our theoretical discussions.

Furthermore, the income effect is higher for less-educated mothers. Based on a gestation-weight profile in the sample, increased gestation owing to the APFD could explain a maximum of 34%-57% of the measured weight increase, although we are unable to examine all the potential mechanisms.

In particular, do political tensions significantly affect consumer choices? The main objective of the paper is to study the consequences of political conflicts between Spain and Catalonia (a region of Spain) and the subsequent boycott calls on sales of Catalan sparkling wine (cava) in the Spanish market. We use data from sales of sparkling wine in supermarkets and similar outlets. To determine with precision the boycott period we use data on the number of news on the issue that appeared in the main national Spanish daily newspapers. The results of our econometric analysis indicate that the boycott calls triggered different consumers' reactions in different territories. While consumers in some Spanish regions followed them and reduced their purchases of Catalan cava, there was also an anti-boycott reaction of Catalan consumers which led them to increase their consumption of the product. As a consequence of this, the boycott calls had an insignificant impact at the Spanish aggregate level. These results can be rationalized by the predictions of theoretical models of boycotts that include both the free riding and animosity motives.","[Cuadras-Morato, Xavier; Maria Raya, Josep] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Cuadras-Morato, Xavier] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Cuadras-Morató, X (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",xavier.cuadras@upf.edu; josep.raya@upf.edu,"Cuadras-Morato, Xavier/A-6951-2013; Cuadras-Morató, Xavier/N-2875-2019; Raya, Josep Maria/K-5342-2015","Cuadras-Morató, Xavier/0000-0002-7420-0334; Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X",Spanish Government [ECO2011-25272t],Spanish Government(Spanish Government),Spanish Government (Grant/Award Number: 'ECO2011-25272t').,,19,9,9,1,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Studies concerning the impact of multinationals on entry, exit and survival of host country firms must use more recent data, investigate the role of vertical linkages and taking into account other control variables that may affect the exit rate.

By using a market model derived from Bakaert et al. (2005) and Baur (2012), we investigate the possible propagation channels of financial contagion as follows: 0 aggregate stock market contagion, ii) financial sector contagion, iii) real economy sector contagion from the financial system of the crisis originating country and iv) idiosyncratic contagion effects to the real economy sectors transmitted through the emerging financial market. At the aggregate level, our results document contagion incidences only during the ESDC. At the sector level, the energy, the materials and the industrial sectors are exposed to financial contagion from the European financial market in the episode of the ESDC. With regard to the idiosyncratic contagion effects, the real economy sectors are heterogeneous in the sense that they display co-movements at varying magnitudes during both of the crises. However, the healthcare sector is found to be vulnerable to financial system shocks within the emerging markets during both turmoil episodes. In this context, our results are of particular importance for the international investors in order to design a well-diversified portfolio, as well as for the authorities to maintain global financial stability and to prevent and mitigate the financial contagion.","[Gencer, Hatice Gaye] Yeditepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demiralay, Sercan] Yeditepe Univ, Dept Int Finance, Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University; Yeditepe University,"Gencer, HG (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.",gaye70@yahoo.com,"Gencer, Hatice/AAY-1010-2020; Demiralay, Sercan/CAI-2118-2022; Demiralay, Sercan/ABC-1368-2020","Demiralay, Sercan/0000-0003-2543-7914; Demiralay, Sercan/0000-0003-2543-7914",,,,,32,4,4,0,16,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

However, there are substantial differences between the genetic evolutionary biology and the evolution of institutions, firms, routines, or strategies in economics. Most importantly, there is no genetic codification and no sexual reproduction in economic evolution, and the involved agents can interfere consciously and purposefully. This entails a general lack of fixation and a quick loss of information through a Muller's ratchet-like mechanism.

The author proposes a fairly unconventional solution. He suggests that democratic socialism can be the necessary political complement to our capitalist system. By drawing on the socialist capacity to empower labor and increase mass consumption, we could achieve a more balanced and sustainable capitalism. The book is ideally suited for readers of Keynesian and post Keynesian analysis on contemporary capitalism and it fits in the discourse on problems of low income growth, declining demand, and investment opportunities in major world economies.","[Henow, Anne] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Henow, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

That is why decision makers need a specialized software tool that allows an efficient repeating of the optimization run because the number of units may be quite high.

The opinion poll carried out among the passengers using the services of Croatian transport organizations Zagrebacki elektricni tramvaj (ZET), Croatia Airlines (CA) and Hrvatske zeljeznice (HZ) shows that Internet-based sources of information are considered to be the most trustworthy. Users' opinions rank high on the list of reliable sources of information when it comes to seeking information on products and services. Further, the results indicate that the potential of these channels has been underexploited because passengers have not recognized them as information sources yet. The authors confirm that the traditional marketing tools for disseminating information are becoming inefficient given the investment made, which is primarily manifested in the lack of passengers' trust. In the opinion of the users of CA services, the company's official website provides the most information about the organization's activities. As for the users of HZ services, their source of information are usually the persons they know.

We combine new disaggregated aid data and various metrics of political institutions to re-examine this relationship. Long run cross-section and alternative dynamic panel estimators show a small positive net effect of total aid on political institutions. Distinguishing between types of aid according to their frequency domain and stated objectives, we find that this aggregate net effect is driven primarily by the positive contribution of more stable inflows of 'governance aid'. We conclude that the data do not support the view that aid has had a systematic negative effect on political institutions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Results indicate that psychological empowerment positively influences organizational citizenship behavior and knowledge sharing behavior. In addition, employee engagement partially mediates the relationship between psychological empowerment and organizational citizenship behavior and fully mediates between psychological empowerment and knowledge sharing behavior. Psychological empowerment has positive significant relationship with the employee engagement whereas leader-member exchange does not moderate the relationship between psychological empowerment and employee engagement.

Standard tools exist for identifying general period and standard scholarly protocols for examining, i.e. reading manuscript cook books for presentation to modern audiences. However, if read in conjunction with other documents and materials found tucked between the pages, we may consider the contents of the collection in terms of its place in time and place. Our collection of manuscript recipe books is rich in valuable non-recipe inclusions. Along with recipes written on scraps of papers or on pieces of notepaper, recipes clipped from newspapers and some clipped from product packings, there are different pamphlets, household account information, letters, postcards, a resume, bills etc. This additional biographical material may help get a broader perspective of the family and its members, the traces of which were tightly interwoven in the history of Eastern Slavonia. Therefore, a scholarly approach to study some of the named artifacts was done in three phases: description, induction and speculation. Although the first step of the analysis was characterised by pure objectivity, the next two phases, an emotional response to the non-recipe inclusion of the collection cannot be avoided, being a part of personal heritage.

The extended model shows that the impatience of the time-inconsistent agent has positive effects on the optimal payout decision which is opposite to DeMarzo and Sannikov (2006) and consequently provides a guideline to tailor the contract between investors and the agent. It also shows in the optimal capital structure, the total debt capacity shrinks with the degree of the agent's time inconsistency, and the long-term one shrinks more. In addition, our model predicts that the agent's time inconsistency not only imposes significant limits on the use of long-term debt but also has great effects on firms' capital structures. Thus our finding can potentially explain observed cross-sectional differences in firms' capital structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

All governance indicators are found to have a significant effect on GDP per capita while the only significant interaction term between cross-border mergers and acquisitions and control of corruption is negative.

We also reveal that - on average - the longer the maturity, the greater the term premium, both in the boom and in the recession. The other significant feature of the term premia for all maturities is that the boom premia are many times smaller than their recession counterparts. For the maturities of 35 weeks and over, the yield spread is a good predictor of future changes in the short interest rate. For other maturities it turns out to be a downwards biased predictor.

This paper investigates the impacts of ICT and its spillovers on productivity in Canada, focusing on heterogeneity across provinces and industries over time. The panel data estimation model includes 10 provinces with diverse economic activities for the period 1990-2008, and the two-digit level industries for the period 1981-2008. The findings show that ICT has a positive impact on labour productivity, but the effects vary significantly across provinces, industries, and time. Specifically, while provinces with higher shares of manufacturing and services in their GDP have reaped the benefits of ICT investment, other provinces primarily dependent on natural resources and agriculture are lagging behind. The industry-level analysis also reveals that manufacturing and services industries have benefited from ICT investment much more than primary sector industries. The results further indicate that ICT investment in the USA, a major trading partner, has spilled over to some Canadian provinces and industries and that the overall ICT effects are stabilized in those ICT-intensive provinces and industries.","[Moshiri, Saeed] Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Moshiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",smoshiri@stmcollege.ca,,,,,,,53,12,13,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Following these findings, this article examines possible trends in stock-bond return correlations. To this end, we introduce a trend component into a smooth transition regression (STR) model including the multiple transition variables of Aslanidis and Christiansen (2012). The results indicate the existence of significant decreasing trends in stock-bond correlations for many advanced safer countries. In addition, although stock market volatility continues to be an important factor in stock-bond correlations, the short rate and yield spread become only marginally significant once we introduce the trend component. Our out-of-sample analysis also demonstrates that the STR model, including the volatility index and time trend as the transition variables, dominates other models. Furthermore, we find a significant increase in stock-bond correlations for riskier euro countries around the beginning of the euro crisis. Our findings of decreasing and increasing trends in stock-bond correlations can be considered a consequence of the decreasing effects of diversification and more intensive flight-to-quality behaviour that have taken place in recent years and after the euro crisis.","[Ohmi, Harumi] Mizuho DL Financial Technol Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Okimoto, Tatsuyoshi] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Acton, Australia",Australian National University,"Okimoto, T (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Acton, Australia.",tatsuyoshi.okimoto@gmail.com,"Okimoto, Tatsuyoshi/Q-8510-2019","Okimoto, Tatsuyoshi/0000-0002-1196-4599",Japan Center for Economic Research,Japan Center for Economic Research,The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of this work from the Japan Center for Economic Research.,,31,14,16,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The analysis is based on the market indicators development for the main categories of wood products defined by the FAO classification of forest products. The impact of economic crises on the market is examined through the analysis of development of production, consumption, trade and prices of selected wood and wood products in the respective period. Demand for solid wood products is mostly driven by the development of specific sectors such as the construction or industrial production, while paper and paperboard market is dependent on the development of gross domestic product per capita. The results indicate that due to the different economic drivers at specific product markets there were differences in the development of market with the solid and composite wood products and the products of pulp and paper industry identified. In particular, fuel wood production increased by 24%, while production of sawnwood decreased by 50%, wood based panels by 30% and paper and paperboard by 21%. Similarly, consumption of pulp dropped by 8%, paper and paperboard by 15%, while the drop in consumption of industrial roundwood was by 27% and sawnwood by 57%.","[Palus, Hubert; Parobek, Jan] Tech Univ Zvolen, Tg Masaryka 96053, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Altpergerova, Andrea] Sturova 602-7, Pliesovce 96263, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Palus, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Tg Masaryka 96053, Zvolen, Slovakia.",palus@tuzvo.sk; altpergerova@gmail.com; parobek@tuzvo.sk,"Parobek, Jan/M-3686-2014; Paluš, Hubert/K-9135-2015","Parobek, Jan/0000-0002-3441-934X; Paluš, Hubert/0000-0002-1187-4286",,,,,22,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1620,1627,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800200,0

The rapid development of scientific and data technology over the past decade has brought not only new and sophisticated analytical tools into financial and other industries, but also introduced the power of data science application in everyday strategic and operational management. Data analytics and science developments have been particularly valuable to financial organisations that heavily depend on financial information in their decision making processes. The article presents the research that focuses on the impact of the data and technology trends on decision making, particularly in finance industry. It covers an overview of the benefits associated with the decision analytics and the use of big data by financial organisations. The aim of the research is to highlight the areas of impact where the big data trends are creating disruptive changes to the way the finance industry traditionally operates. For example, we can see rapid changes to organisation structures, approach to competition and customer as well as the recognition of the importance of data analytics in strategic and tactical decision making. Investment in data analytics is no longer considered a luxury, but necessity, especially for the financial organisations in developing countries. Technology and data science are both forcing and enabling the financial industry to respond to transformative demands and adapt to rapidly changing market conditions in order to survive and thrive in highly competitive global environment. Financial companies operating in developing countries must develop strong understanding of datarelated trends and impacts as well as opportunities. This knowledge should not only be utilised for survival efforts, but also seen as the opportunity to engage at global level through innovation, flexibility, and early adoption of data science benefits. The paper also recommends further studies in related areas, which would provide additional value and awareness to the organisations that are considering their participation in the global data and analytical trends.","[Peric, Amela] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, DAB, 702 Harris St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Polic, Nedzad] Zenica Univ, Fac Econ, Fak 3, Zenica 72000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Polic, Nedzad] Hifa Oil Doo, Fak 3, Zenica 72000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Kozarevic, Emira] Tuzla Univ, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 72000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Technology Sydney; University of Zenica; University of Tuzla,"Peric, A (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, DAB, 702 Harris St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",amela_peric@hotmail.com; nedzad.polic@ef.unze.ba; emira.kozarevic@untz.ba,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,16,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,1078,1090,,,,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600107,0

Nevertheless, legal status of audit committee in a two-tier system is still not fully comparable to its legal status in a one-tier system. One of the differences that remain even after the most recent reform of the EU audit law relates to the possibility of obtaining information, and high-quality information is one of essential conditions for effective functioning of audit committee. In a two-tier system, legally regulated information sources of supervisory board - and thus also of the audit committee - are the following: regular and special management reports, the auditor of annual financial reports, external supervisory board experts and the right of access to incorporated information. The dilemma is whether the audit committee has an option to obtain information directly from the company's employees. In this respect, the question of possible direct communication between the audit committee and internal auditor is central to the discussion. This issue is specific to the two-tier system. According to prevailing opinions in theory of the two-tier system, this possibility of direct communication is allowed only in exceptional cases. However, authors of the article are observing that this strict approach is slowly weakening and a trend of gradual convergence of internal auditor and supervisory board can be noted. The interaction between the audit committee, the auditor of annual reports and internal auditor is one of the indicators of good corporate governance.","[Podgorelec, Peter] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, Maribor, Slovenia; [Prelic, Sasa] Univ Maribor, Fac Law, Mladinska 9, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Podgorelec, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, Maribor, Slovenia.",peter.podgorelec@um.si; sasa.prelic@um.si,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,508,515,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100053,0

The photovoltaic power plant for the techno-economic analysis will be modelled on data of the production of photovoltaic power plant installed in the Laboratory for Renewable Energy Sources at Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Osijek. Photovoltaic power plant was built from commercial and easily available electronic components (photovoltaic modules, inverter) with total installed capacity that amounts to 10 kWp. Cost-benefit analysis will be carried out for the three aforementioned legal entities with respect to their specificity, in a way that for each legal entity photovoltaic power plant will be modelled separately. Data on the production of photovoltaic power plant that will be used for modelling and data on electricity consumption of all legal entities were collected simultaneously at all locations over a period of one year and will be shown on a monthly basis. Techno-economic analysis will be based on the results of measurements of electricity production, electricity consumption of different legal entities taking into account their specifics and information on photovoltaic power plants construction prices and electricity prices.

For example, it is proposed that women are more cooperative than men when dealing with natural resources decisions; however, few scientific studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. We provide evidence for a greater cooperative attitude in women compared to men in both college students and coastal fishing communities of Baja California, Mexico, by means of game theory experiments. In both laboratory and field experiments, women changed their behaviour towards lower extraction compared to men, when regulations, sanctions or social scolding were introduced in the games. These results suggest that raising the role of women in decision-making, along with an adequate institutional framework, may lead to a more sustainable use of natural resources.","[Revollo-Fernandez, Daniel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Revollo-Fernandez, Daniel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Becario Programa Becas Posdoctorales, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Revollo-Fernandez, Daniel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Reg Invest Multidisciplinarias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Aguilar-Ibarra, Alonso] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Micheli, Fiorenza] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Saenz-Arroyo, Andrea] Colegio Frontera ECOSUR, Dept Conservac Biodiversidad, San Cristobal de las Casa, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Stanford University,"Revollo-Fernández, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;Revollo-Fernández, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Becario Programa Becas Posdoctorales, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;Revollo-Fernández, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Reg Invest Multidisciplinarias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",drevollofer@gmail.com,,"Saenz-Arroyo, Andrea/0000-0002-5659-4608; Micheli, Fiorenza/0000-0002-6865-1438","Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC; CONACYT [81653, 297139]; PAPIIT-UNAM [IN3013102]",Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC(Comunidad de Madrid); CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PAPIIT-UNAM(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico),"This study was partially funded by Comunidad y Biodiversidad AC, CONACYT [grant number 81653] and PAPIIT-UNAM [grant number IN3013102].

Moreover, related recent macroeconomic development in the Eurozone, which is characterised in particular by the requirement of stabilizing the economic growth while maintaining conditions for fiscal sustainability of public budgets, and by persistent deflationary pressures, induces a fundamentally different background for monetary policy conduct in the Eurozone. The traditional signalling function of the price of money has namely failed in the Eurozone in the time of crises and continued globalisation and financial integration. The main aim of the paper is thus to analyse effects of inflation expectations and expected real interest rates on the long-term nominal interest rates leading path in the core and the periphery of the Eurozone using SVAR methodology. The results of the analyses draw attention in particular to serious differences in the role of considered factors when determining nominal interest rates between the periphery and core countries of the Eurozone.

At the lower limit of LDR, a requirement of higher RR can push banks to extent more loans in order to support economic development in a period of economic bust. At the upper limit of LDR, a requirement of higher RR and/or capital can also provide disincentive to slow down its investment activities in an economic booming period and manage liquidity risk better.","[Satria, Dadang M.; Harun, Cicilia A.; Taruna, Aditya Anta] Cent Bank Indonesia, Macroprudential Policy Dept, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Satria, DM (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Indonesia, Macroprudential Policy Dept, Jakarta, Indonesia.",dmuljawan@bi.go.id,,,,,,,10,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Thirlwall's Law aims at evaluating a country's growth rate consistent with internal and external economic equilibrium. It states that BOP equilibrium requires a rate of economic growth not exceeding the ratio of the income elasticity of a country's exports to the income elasticity of its imports-giving focus on price and non-price competitiveness. The study aims to verify whether the balance-of-payments constrained growth approach is suitable for explaining the Bulgarian growth performance in the last two decades. To this end, an econometric analysis of the equilibrium (sustainable) growth rate of the Bulgarian economy according to the concept of the BOP constraint on growth is made and compared to the actual registered levels of growth. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the characteristics of Bulgarian external trade represent a constraint on the country's growth dynamics and hinder the process of sustainable economic convergence with the developed world.","[Spasova, Elena] New Bulgarian Univ, 21 Montevideo Str, Sofia 1618, Bulgaria",New Bulgarian University,"Spasova, E (通讯作者)，New Bulgarian Univ, 21 Montevideo Str, Sofia 1618, Bulgaria.",elenaspasova@nbu.bg,"Spasova, Elena/ABF-6906-2021",,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-40322-9; 978-3-319-40321-2,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,75,92,,10.1007/978-3-319-40322-9_5,0.0,,,18,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8CB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392198500005,0

As a consequence, numerous studies has tried to develop models enhancing early bankruptcy forecasting. Prediction of corporate bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to investors/creditors, borrowing firms, and governments alike. Timely identification of firms' impending failure is indeed desirable. By this time, several methods have been used for predicting bankruptcy. Bankruptcy prediction has long been an important and widely studied topic. In order to timely discern the emerging danger of instability in the enterprise, it is necessary to preform financial analyses, statistics and reports, which generate necessary data that the top management needs to draw up the necessary strategies.

By focusing on the relationship between the terms of trade, exchange rate, volume of trade, current account and output we are trying to provide some new insights into trade dynamics over a business cycle in Croatia. Furthermore, the analysis is done on aggregate level and evaluates only the market of goods, for it constitutes the larger part of the trade balance.

After 1989, Slovak agricultural sector was transformed from centrally planned economy to the market economy. Fundamentally, this process was based on privatization. The year 2004, when Slovakia joined EU and adopted Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), farmers received their first direct payments. New political regulations, quotas, requirements and single payment system led to the number of substantial changes that have been ultimately impacting economic development in the sector and priorities of farmers. Nowadays, the majority of utilized agricultural area (UAA) (74.64% in 2014) is cultivated by large farms with over 500 hectares, while the UAA per farm in the EU is much lower. Therefore, also measures implemented through CAP result different in Slovakia. Based on individual farm data we analyze profitability of farms divided into groups based on the type of production into crop and animal. Using descriptive statistics and portfolio theory we simulate the total faun profitability and volatility of animal and crop production in Slovakia. Based on the results we conclude that in the long run crop farms are profitable and profit from crop production is used to cover the losses from animal production in mixed farms. Farms focused on animal production only are efficient and profitable, but the profitability is lower in comparison with crop farms. Performance of animal farms is less volatile than performance of crop farms.","[Toth, Marian; Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",marian.toth@uniag.sk; drahoslav.lancaric@uniag.sk; radovan.savov@uniag.sk,"Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019; Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019",,"Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0552]; VEGA [1/0912/14, 1/0930/15]",Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This paper was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-15-0552 with the title Impact of financial markets and agricultural policies on the agri-food sector, VEGA 1/0912/14 with the title The Common Agricultural Policy 2014-2020 and its impact on the financial situation of farms in Slovakia, VEGA 1/0930/15 with the title Impact of agricultural subsidies on productivity of farms and food safety.",,22,6,6,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2220,2227,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800276,0

Despite this market intensification, the existence of the economic surplus undermines the syllogistics of market-determined pricing.

Procedures for demonstrating this practice are based more on economic analyses and impact assessments. Definition of relevant markets and dominance is done on a case-by-case basis, using a number of economic, econometric techniques and methods, the use of which could have a significant impact on the result. A frontier between a competitive behaviour based on merits and conduct that constitutes an abuse of dominant position is rather ambiguous. Therefore, market operators should be become more familiar with the decision-making practice of the competition authorities; the case-law on the markets on which they operate; definition of dominance and the definition of what is considered as an abuse of a dominant position.","[Zemanovicova, Daniela; Vasakova, Livia] Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Fak Managementu, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia; [Vasakova, Livia] Zastupenie Europskej Komisie SR, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Zemanovicová, D (通讯作者)，Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Fak Managementu, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia.",daniela.zemanovicova@fm.uniba.sk; Livia.vasakova@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-88064-25-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,384,398,,,,,,15,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8MG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392435700031,0

The paper argues that the traditional approach to price convergence analysis should be applied with caution, especially in a transitional economy such as China where questions to be asked should relate to the 'degree of market-orientation' and not simply whether it is a market-based economy or not.","[Zhu, Yanjie; Ma, Hengyun; Wang, Wenchao] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yanjie] Henan Inst Educ, Dept Informat Technol, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ & Finance, Hamilton, New Zealand",Henan Agricultural University; Henan Finance University; University of Waikato,"Zhu, YJ (通讯作者)，Henan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.",juliazhuyj@163.com; loxley@waikato.ac.nz; h.y.ma@163.com; wangwch80@126.com,"Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023; wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008","Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",State Soft Science Planning Research Project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013GXQ4D170]; Ministry of Education Joint Research Fund for the Doctoral Programme [20124105110006]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14BGL093]; First Henan University Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Support Plan of Education Department of Henan Province [2012-CXTD-03]; Philosophy and Social Science Key Breakthrough Project of Education Department of Henan Province [2013-ZG-06]; Science and Technology Key Research Project of Education Department of Henan Province [13A790472],State Soft Science Planning Research Project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Ministry of Education Joint Research Fund for the Doctoral Programme; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); First Henan University Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Support Plan of Education Department of Henan Province; Philosophy and Social Science Key Breakthrough Project of Education Department of Henan Province; Science and Technology Key Research Project of Education Department of Henan Province,"The research was partially supported by State Soft Science Planning Research Project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2013GXQ4D170), Ministry of Education Joint Research Fund for the Doctoral Programme (20124105110006), National Social Science Foundation of China (14BGL093), The First Henan University Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Support Plan of Education Department of Henan Province (2012-CXTD-03), Philosophy and Social Science Key Breakthrough Project of Education Department of Henan Province (2013-ZG-06), and Science and Technology Key Research Project of Education Department of Henan Province (13A790472).

We use a unique panel dataset from participating and non-participating households to estimate the average treatment effect of participating in either program on electricity usage. We fit models with household-by-season, season-by-year, and household-by-year fixed effects to account for all possible confounders that might influence energy usage. Since the programs are voluntary, we seek to restore near-exogeneity of the program treatment by matching participating households with control households. We deploy coarsened exact matching (CEM; lacus et al., 2011) as our main matching method. We ask whether it is sufficient to match households based on past electricity usage, or if we gain by adding structural characteristics of the home, including heating system type. We find that the two programs reduce electricity usage by 5% on average. The effects are strong in both winter and summer for the energy audit groups but appear to be stronger in the winter for the heat pump rebate group. Adding house characteristics to the matching variables does seem to affect results, suggesting that using past usage alone, or house characteristics alone, may not be sufficient to identify the effects of program participation.

For the long-run analysis, Johansen's cointegration test reveals that three cointegration vectors exist among the model variables, indicating a long-run relationship. To conduct a short-run analysis, this paper employs vector auto regression (VAR) to estimate the responses of US tourists in Taiwan to the shocks of changes to personal disposable income, cost of living, and substitute price. The short-run equilibrium adjustment processes are discussed in terms of generalized impulse response. The results show an immediate and significant response of changes in tourist arrivals to their own impacts, changes in the cost of living, and changes in the substitute price. In addition, the price, income, and cross-elasticity of tourism demand are all positive at the beginning of the responses, implying that the tourism products can be attributed to normal and substitute goods.","[Chen, Yen-Hsun; Kang, Hsin-Hong] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Chen, Yen-Hsun] Far East Univ, Dept Leisure & Sports Management, Tainan 74448, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Chen, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Business Adm, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",yhchen@cc.feu.edu.tw; hhkang@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,40,2,6,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We find that allowing for the regime-switching aspect both in monetary policy rules and shock volatilities is a crucial setup in improving the model's fit with Korean data. The regime estimates indicate that monetary policy more aggressively reacts to inflation, but less strongly to output, after launching the Inflation Targeting (IT) policy in the late 1990s. The identified regimes have three implications on macroeconomic performance in Korea. First, the introduction of the IT monetary policy has contributed to a sharp reduction in the level as well as the volatility of inflation in the 2000s, Second, technology shocks are the most important drivers of output fluctuations in Korea as the major economic crises in Korea are mainly explained by adverse shocks on technology. Finally, it would have been possible to achieve higher output and lower inflation simultaneously if the IT monetary policy regime was maintained over the entire sample period. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

The literature suggests that this may contribute to observed gender gaps in labor force pay and achievement. Understanding which factors may drive these gender differences is essential for designing policies that promote equality. We adopt a game theoretic model of contests to consider a variety of explanations for the differences in male and female competitive performance that have been proposed in the empirical and experimental literature. Comparing the testable predictions of the model with the empirical evidence from past papers, we reject explanations involving male over-confidence, misperceptions about relative ability, and some types of preference differences. Explanations involving female under-confidence and differences in risk aversion are consistent with the significant evidence. Two explanations provide perfect matches to observed performance patterns: (i) males are better than females at handling competitive pressure, and (ii) males enjoy competition more or have greater desire to win than females.

In a two-country model with imperfect knowledge diffusion, the larger country has a greater share of firms with higher productivity levels. The concentration of relatively productive firms increases knowledge flows between firms, causing an increase in firm-level employment in innovation. Accordingly, the aggregate growth rate is higher when counties are asymmetric than when they are similar in size. The larger scale of firm-level innovation activity reduces market entry, however, and aggregate product variety falls. In this framework, national R&D subsidies have positive effects on the industry share, relative productivity, and wage rate of the implementing country. If the smaller country introduces an R&D subsidy, aggregate product variety rises and productivity growth falls. If the larger country introduces an R&D subsidy, productivity growth rises, but aggregate product variety may rise or fall.","[Davis, Colin] Doshisha Univ, Kyoto 6028580, Japan; [Hashimoto, Ken-ichi] Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Doshisha University; Kobe University,"Davis, C (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Inst Liberal Arts, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan.",cdavis@mail.doshisha.ac.jp,,,JSPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730209] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful for helpful comments from the Associate Editor, two anonymous referees, Tetsugen Haruyama, Tarishi Matsuoka, Takayuki Ogawa, Ryoji Ohdoi, Yoshiyasu Ono, and participants in seminars held at ESRI, Kobe University, Niigata University, Osaka Prefecture University, and Tokyo Metropolitan University and in the Osaka University GCOE Conference and the Spring Meeting of the Japanese Economic Association.

We focus our analysis on the percentage of shares in relocated firms that the government allows to be foreign-owned. The government's decision on this percentage depends on the entry cost, the number of firms that relocate and the weight of the consumer surplus in the objective function of the government. We show that by its choice of this percentage, the Chinese government may restrict or encourage FDI to its country. We also find that if the government may subsidise the fixed entry cost, it provides a subsidy only when the producer surplus has a greater weight than the consumer surplus in weighted welfare.

For example, a worker's ability revealed in one job or when unemployed is informative about her productivity in another job. We analyze a general setup of experimentation with common values, and show that in addition to the well-known conditions of value matching (level) and smooth pasting (first derivative), this implies that the second derivatives of the value function must be equal whenever the agent switches action. This condition holds generally whenever the stochastic process has continuous increments. The main appeal of our approach is its applicability, which is demonstrated with two applications featuring common value experimentation: strategic pricing, and job search with switching costs.

We examine the validity of this characterization of (SW)-W-infinity in an incomplete information setting. We argue that in Bayesian games with a nontrivial state space, the characterization is very sensitive to the way in which uncertainty in the form of approximate common certainty of admissibility is taken to interact with the uncertainty already captured by players' beliefs about the states of nature: We show that (SW)-W-infinity corresponds to approximate common certainty of admissibility when this is not allowed to coincide with any changes to players' beliefs about states. If approximate common certainty of admissibility is accompanied by vanishingly small perturbations to beliefs, then (SW)-W-infinity is a (generally strict) subset of the predicted behavior, which we characterize in terms of a generalization of Hu's (2007) perfect p-rationalizable set.

We show that the central bank can stimulate real activity by changing the size or the composition of its balance sheet, when interest rate policy is ineffective. Specifically, the central bank can stabilise the economy by increasing money supply against eligible assets even when the policy rate is at the zero lower bound. By changing the composition of its balance sheet, it can affect interest rates and, for example, neutralise increases in firms' borrowing costs, which is not possible under a single instrument regime. We further analyse the limitations of balance sheet policies and show that they are particularly useful under liquidity demand shocks.","German Fed Minist Finance, Berlin, Germany; Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Schabert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Ctr Macroecon Res, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",schabert@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Schabert, Andreas/AAD-8901-2022","Schabert, Andreas/0000-0002-4924-9937",,,,,27,2,2,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Block (2009, 2011), as well as Ivan Jankovic (2011), surmise? While we agree with these authors that issuances of fiduciary media breed financial instability, we disagree that maturity transformation represents such a case. Maturity transformation otherwise known as borrowing short-term and lending long-term guided by several base legal principles, does not result in the issuance of fiduciary media. Most notable among these principles is that any credit issued must be funded by borrowing of a positive duration, i.e., not via a demand deposit. We demonstrate that two factors instigate larger degrees of maturity transformation than would otherwise be the case, breeding potential instability: a continual increase in the credit supply and the provision of a lender of last resort. We also show that the interest rate is a natural stabilizing brake on the over-issuance of longer-dated credit against short-term financing.","[Howden, David] St Louis Univ, Div Business & Econ, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; [Gabriel, Amadeus] Grp Super Commerce Rochelle, Dept Finance & Econ, Paris, France",Saint Louis University,"Howden, D (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, Div Business & Econ, Madrid Campus, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",,"Gabriel, Amadeus/AAD-4681-2022","Gabriel, Amadeus/0000-0001-6872-6017",,,,,42,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper shows that there are significant differences in the trends of transitory and permanent income inequality between demographic groups since the 1980s. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, educational attainment and the composition of a household are found to play a key role. While permanent inequality increases steadily for educated households, it is flat over large parts of the sample period for the less educated households. Transitory inequality increases for all households headed by couples whereas it is constant for single households. Altogether, permanent shocks-account for a larger part of the income variance of educated households whereas transitory shocks are relatively more important for the less educated. These results are able to shed light on the transmission of changes in income inequality to consumption inequality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the parameters stability tests show strong evidence of short-run parameter instability, thus invalidating any conclusion from the full sample linear estimations. Therefore we turn to nonlinear tests and observe a stronger predictive power from EMU to EPU than from EPU to EMU. Using sub-sample bootstrap rolling window causality tests to fully account for the existence of structural breaks, we find evidence that EPU can help predict the movements in EMU only around 1993, 2004 and, 2006.

The first neoclassical synthesis was already accomplished, and signs of what later became the rational expectations revolution were beginning to be seen.

Then, we test the stability of individuals' choices in panel data from rural Paraguay over almost a decade. Answers to social preference survey questions are quite stable. Experimental measures of risk, time, and social preferences do not exhibit much stability. Correlations between experimental measures of risk aversion are a more precisely estimated zero, whereas correlations for time and social preferences are larger and noisier. We also find no systematic evidence that real world shocks influence play in games.

The particular focus lies on variation in idiosyncratic shocks to households using housing damages caused by a super typhoon as a proxy. Relying on individual panel data and a setting in which typhoons are a relatively rare event, we find negative and persistent effects on children's education but no effects on children's health. Effects on education are likely driven by a shift in parental investments made to cope with the economic consequences of typhoon damages. Subgroup analysis suggests that results are stronger for girls, children with no older siblings, children from poor families, and families with no strong family or social network.

To answer this question empirically, this contribution exploits a natural experiment on the reception of West German television in the former German Democratic Republic. After identifying the impact of Western television on individual beliefs and attitudes in the late 1980s, longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel is used to test the persistence of the television effect on individual beliefs during the 1990s. The empirical findings indicate that Western television exposure has made East Germans more inclined to believe that effort rather than luck determines success in life.

The theoretical mechanism is based on agents that increase the set of goods they consume with income. This affects the structure of a country's import demand and therewith the extensive margin of trade. We formalize this intuition by incorporating preferences that allow for binding non-negativity constraints into an otherwise standard Ricardian multi-country model. We quantify the model and find that the behaviour of the model's extensive margin of trade is consistent with the data.,"[Hepenstrick, Christian] Swiss Natl Bank, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tarasov, Alexander] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Swiss National Bank (SNB); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Tarasov, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",atarasov@hse.ru,"Tarasov, Alexander/M-6371-2015","Tarasov, Alexander/0000-0002-4393-9419",Verein zur Forderung des Akademischen Nachwuches; Ecosciencia Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR 15],Verein zur Forderung des Akademischen Nachwuches; Ecosciencia Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Ana Cecilia Fieler, Kevin Staub, Gino Gancia, Andreas Kohler, Pedro Mira, Josef Zweimuller, Alessandro Barattieri, Marc Melitz, Pol Antras, Tomasz Swiecki, Elhanan Helpman, Samuel Kortum and seminar participants at the University of Zurich, the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies, Harvard University and EconCon for helpful comments and discussions.

A two-thirds supermajority had been seen as a sacred threshold for the coalition to ensure its continued legitimacy. It is conjectured here that the 2008 election represented a challenge to the competitive authoritarian regime and that this had direct effects on firms with ties to the ruling coalition. The empirical results show that firms with political patronage were indeed adversely affected by the electoral outcome. More specifically, firms with close ties to the Barisan Nasional experienced a significant negative value effect. Firms characterised by political patronage also saw their leverage reduced significantly more than other firms after the 2008 election, suggesting that their access to debt capital had become more restricted. Moreover, this effect was mainly driven by changes in long-term debt. These results suggest a significant negative impact on connected firms as the political status quo was challenged in Malaysia.","Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Johansson, AC (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.johansson@hhs.se,,"Johansson, Anders C./0000-0002-2964-872X",Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,"Anders C.

On one hand, market definition suffers decisive logical infirmities that render it infeasible, unnecessary, and counterproductive, and the practice of stating market power requirements as market share threshold tests is incoherent as a matter of empirics and policy. On the other hand, market power is often probative of the desirability of liability, yet the typically assumed functional relationship is unexplored and often implausible. These latter deficiencies are addressed through a ground-up analysis of the channels by which market power can be relevant. It is important to explicitly and simultaneously consider both anticompetitive and procompetitive explanations for challenged practices and to attend to the magnitudes of the social consequences of correct and mistaken imposition of liability in order to identify the various ways and senses in which market power bears on optimal decision-making.

We study a Cournot oligopoly with pollution, with one CSR operating in the market. A CSR firm not only takes into account its profits but also internalises its own share of pollution and is sensitive to consumer surplus. With a large enough market, the CSR firm obtains higher profits than its profit-seeking competitors, and induces a higher level of social welfare. The results are confirmed when a socially optimal tax on pollution is adopted. Indeed, even if the environmental concern restrains the production of a CSR firm, the social concern expands it. The second effect more than offsets the first one in a large market, making the CSR production strategy be more aggressive compared to its competitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that heterogeneity in the estimates of the elasticity is natural to a considerable extent: the magnitude of the elasticity depends on the theoretical model applied and features of the workforce. Moreover, we find that labor demand has become more elastic over time, and is particularly elastic in countries with low levels of employment protection legislation.

The role of policy as a tool that potentially tackles two externalities-innovation and environmental market failures-has been studied over the past decade. Sector integration, which is increasingly relevant for understanding the economic, environmental and innovation performances of countries, might additionally influence innovations, and it is relatively overlooked. We integrate these two perspectives to provide evidence on the adoption of EI in EU sectors over 2006-2008. Using past CO2 emission intensity as a proxy of policy stringency we find that emission intensive sectors are more likely to adopt CO2-related eco-innovations. The aforementioned results are valid for both the economy as a whole and for industrial sectors specifically. We additionally show that inter sector integration and knowledge sources matter: we do observe that sectors with more emission intensive upstream 'partners' eco-innovate more to reduce their CO2 footprints. The positive and significant effect of upstream emission intensity (supplier's emission intensity) on EI is actually stronger than the effect of 'direct' CO2 emission intensity (policy effect).","[Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Mancinelli, Susanna] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Mancinelli, Susanna] SEEDS, Ferrara, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni; Nicolli, Francesco] CNR, Ceris, Inst Econ Res Firms & Growth, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Ferrara; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",massimiliano.mazzanti@unife.it,"Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561; Mancinelli, Susanna/0000-0002-9678-1520; nicolli, francesco/0000-0001-8109-5969; mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942",European Union [308680],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This paper is based on work carried out in the CECILIA2050 research project, funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme for Research (grant agreement no 308680, www.cecilia2050.eu).

I find that the relatively low ownership rate of young households is mainly explained by their high geographic mobility. Downpayment constraints have minor quantitative implications on ownership rates, except for old households. I also find that idiosyncratic earnings uncertainty has a significant impact on homeownership rates. Based on these results, I argue that the long term increase in ownership rates observed over the period 1993-2009 was not necessarily due to mortgage market innovations and the relaxation of downpayment requirements, as is often argued. Instead, it was simply an implication of US demographic evolution, most notably the decline in interstate migration and, less importantly, population ageing. The model predicts that an increase in the income risk (i.e. higher income inequality) has a positive impact on geographical mobility of young households, which means that young homeowners are less affected by the labour market inefficiency associated with homeownership.

Since arbitration is a private system that relies on arbitrators, who are also private persons, selecting an arbitrator is one of the most important processes in arbitration. The qualifications for arbitrators vary in different jurisdictions, but the common qualifications regarding arbitrator ethics are defined either in national lath or in the rules of arbitral institutions. Most national laws and arbitral institutions' rules require arbitrators to be impartial and independent, but their definitions are not clearly determined. Although it seems somewhat late, the KCAB is drafting 'the Codes of Ethics for Arbitrators' who are serving for arbitration cases under the jurisdiction of the KCAB. The draft is based on the frame of the IBA Rules of Ethics, but it will need some additions as well as modifications. Upon drafting the ethical codes, it is necessary to clearly determine the meaning of impartiality and independence which are mostly discussed regarding arbitrators' ethical obligations.

Specifically, we provide empirical evidence on the influence of several policy and non-policy shocks (euro-zone output gap, money market rate and inflation) on economic activity as well as monetary and fiscal policies in the three countries. The main motivation behind our empirical investigation is the fact that all of these economies are small open economies with rigid exchange rate regimes and different degree of integration within the European Union (EU). As for the methodological issues, we employ recursive vector autoregressions to identify the exogenous shocks in the euro-area. Generally, the estimated results imply that euro-zone economic activity has significant and relatively strong influence on these economies where foreign output shocks are transmitted relatively quickly. The results also suggest that the effects of foreign shocks are of larger magnitude in the countries that are more integrated with the EU. An additional finding is that positive foreign interest rate shocks trigger a contractionary response of domestic monetary policy notwithstanding the fact that domestic money market rates are not linked with euro-zone interest rates. Finally, euro-zone inflation is instantly transmitted to domestic inflation. We can explain these effects by several factors, such as: the fixed exchange rates, the relatively high trade integration of SEE economies within the euro-zone as well as the dependence of SEE banks on foreign financing.","[Petrevski, Goran; Tevdovski, Dragan] St Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Skopje 1000, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Petrevski, G (通讯作者)，St Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Goce Delchev Blvd 9B, Skopje 1000, Macedonia.",goran@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; janebogoev@yahoo.com; dragan@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,"Tevdovski, Dragan/AAA-4808-2021; Tevdovski, Dragan/AAC-5250-2020; Petrevski, Goran/L-4100-2019","Tevdovski, Dragan/0000-0001-6921-0880; Petrevski, Goran/0000-0002-5583-8287",CERGE-EI Foundation under a programme of the Global Development Network,CERGE-EI Foundation under a programme of the Global Development Network,"This research was supported by a grant from the CERGE-EI Foundation under a programme of the Global Development Network.

Is it unfair that different people pay different prices for the same good or service? We provide what we believe to be a novel approach: We let normal everyday consumers play the role of sellers who have access to consumers' data (and willingness to pay). A strong finding of behaviour in this setup is that subjects charge a fixed percentage (approximately 64%) of the willingness to pay from each of their subjects, leading to a fair, whilst uneven, distribution of prices. Interesting, this 64% price level does not change when we vary the number of sellers competing in the market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper offers new insights into the behavioral impediments to the uptake of index insurance. We start from the observation that an index insurance contract appears to the farmer as a compound lottery, with uncertainty about individual production outcomes, as well as about the validity of the index as a reflection of individual losses. Adopting the smooth model of ambiguity aversion to this insurance problem, we show that in theory this compound lottery structure per se will dampen the demand for index insurance. Using framed field experiments with cotton farmers in Southern Mali, we elicited the coefficients of risk aversion and compound-risk aversion. The experimental results find that almost 60% of farmers are compound-risk averse, and that the distribution of compound-risk aversion is such that it would nearly cut in half the potential demand for the standard index insurance contracts. Our results highlight the importance of designing contracts with minimal basis risk under compound-risk aversion. Such a reduction in basis risk would not only enhance the value and productivity impacts of index insurance, but would also assure that the contracts are purchased and have their anticipated impacts.

We report results from an experiment in which groups of size between 2 and 15 play a one-shot multiplayer threshold public-good game. In our random leader treatment, all group members select a suggestion (e.g., Everyone should choose X), with one randomly chosen to be broadcast to the group. In a choice only treatment, subjects choose suggestions but none is sent, and in a baseline treatment, there are no suggestions at all. We find a negative interaction between group size and this kind of communication: the beneficial effect of both suggestions overall and cooperative suggestions on cooperation, cooperative outcomes, and payoffs decreases sharply as the group size increases. We find a similar negative interaction in a follow-up treatment in which all group members' suggestions are broadcast to the group. Our results suggest that care should be taken in generalising conclusions from small-group experiments to large groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates public education and tax policies as a possible source for these differences. Empirical and quantitative policy experiments focus on the case of the U.S. and Norway. An overlapping generations model is developed and calibrated to match U.S. data. Functions for labor taxes and public education spending are estimated for each country and incorporated into the model. The benchmark exercise finds that taxes and public education spending account for about one-third of differences in earnings inequality and 14 percent of differences in intergenerational earnings persistence between the U.S. and Norway. Furthermore, public intervention in early childhood education more than doubles the impact of these policy changes. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

One decision is kept secret from the respondent's spouse, while another choice is public. Most people give the same amount in public and secret, while a minority behave opportunistically and give more to their spouse in public and less in secret. The types identified in the lab also behave differently at home. For those who behave opportunistically in the lab, greater knowledge about finances at home is associated with worse opportunism in the lab, suggesting that for these couples complete information at home is not due to trust but rather is an endogenous response to non-cooperative behavior. The paper highlights that allowing for heterogeneous types changes the conclusions we draw about appropriate models of the household and suggests that laboratory games can be used to identify household types useful in the interpretation of field data.

Using a natural field experiment that exogenously manipulates wage bonuses within contests in a Chinese high-tech manufacturing facility, we show that how loss aversion affects worker behavior critically depends on the incentive scheme as well as the framing manipulation. Four sets of two identical teams competed against each other to win a bonus given to the team, within a set, with the higher average hourly productivity over the week. In each set, the bonus was framed as a reward or gain for one team and as a punishment or loss for the other. Average weekly productivity was slightly higher under the loss treatment, but this increase was statistically insignificant. However, the team under the loss treatment was at least 35% more likely to win the contest. As teams' payoffs are based on relative productivity under a contest, framing effect is much stronger in terms of relative productivity. Finally, workers seemingly responded to the bonus by increasing the quality of production as well as quantity-defect rate fell as productivity increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We employ a quasi-experimental approach exploiting the location-specific timing of MMC implementation in Kentucky. Using data from the March Current Population Survey from 1995 to 2003, our findings suggest that the introduction of MMC increases the likelihood of being uninsured and decreases formal Medicaid participation. This finding is consistent with an increase in conditional coverage, waiting until medical care is needed to sign up or re-enroll in Medicaid. These effects are concentrated among low-income children and absent for high-income children. We find no evidence of crowd-in, substituting private coverage for Medicaid. These results are robust to multiple placebo tests and imply the potential for less formal participation (i.e., more conditional coverage) among the Affordable Care Act-Medicaid expansion population (which is likely to be primarily covered under MMC) than is typically predicted.","[Marton, James] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Yelowitz, Aaron] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Kentucky,"Yelowitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, 335 Business & Econ Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",marton@gsu.edu; aaron@uky.edu,"Yelowitz, Aaron/M-7378-2014","Yelowitz, Aaron/0000-0001-8847-1437",,,,,45,11,12,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We introduce shadow costs of public funding (i.e., the excess burden of taxation). The profits of public firms obtained by the government reduce these costs. We find that in a mixed duopoly, the level of product differentiation is too low for social welfare. This result is in sharp contrast to the private oligopoly, where the level of product differentiation is too high.

We focus on the effect that operates through immigrants' supply of domestic labor, which substitutes women's household services especially in the care of elderly parents. We use a dataset of Italian households that contains information on planned retirement age, labor supply and family structure for a representative sample in the years 2000-2008. A double-difference identification approach exploits the women-men differences between families with and without old parents, interacted with the supply of immigrants in the local labor market. We find that an increase of immigrants by one percentage point of the local population is associated with an increase in the planned retirement age gap between women and men with a living parent over 80, by 0.45. Such differential is reduced to 0.17 if the household had no living old parent. The effect is stronger for poor and for less educated women. It is also stronger when considering the inflow of Eastern European female immigrants only, the group supplying the largest share of labor for domestic care. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use measures of conscientiousness at age 16 to explain adult wages and other outcomes, such as employment, education, health, and savings behaviour. We use several waves from the 1970 British Cohort Study. Our estimates suggest a significant and sizeable correlation between early conscientiousness and adult outcomes. Measurement error is corrected for by applying IV techniques, errors-in-variables estimators, and structural equation modelling. Investigation of the lower-order structure of conscientiousness suggests that facets related to reliability, decisiveness, and impulse control are most strongly correlated with outcomes. We also investigate changes in early conscientiousness and find that persons who experience declines in the personality distribution between the ages 10 and 16 seem to be worse off in terms of a variety of socio-economic outcomes.","[Prevoo, Tyas; ter Weel, Bas] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [ter Weel, Bas] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",Maastricht University; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Prevoo, T (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",t.prevoo@maastrichtuniversity.nl; b.ter.weel@cpb.nl,,,,,,,53,24,29,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Due to technological advancements and ever increasing civilization, there is a persistent need of energy. Along with the conventional energy sources, the renewable energy sources have also significantly contributed to the rising energy needs. As a renewable source of energy, numerous small hydro-power plants (SHPPs) have been built up across the world in the recent past. Usually these SHPPs are being built and operated by the private developers complying with the government regulations. In order to assist a developer in selecting the most profitable and feasible SHPP for construction and subsequent operation, a method based on fuzzy axiomatic design principles is employed in this paper. The techno-commercial and socio-economic criteria as considered for analyzing the feasibility of the candidate SHPPs are expressed qualitatively using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The performance of each SHPP is evaluated in terms of its total information content and the one with the least information content is selected to be the best venture for the required construction activity.

We analyze the effects of competition and uncertainty on the incentives of the journalists to write informative reports. We obtain that there is not a unique prediction as to the effects of competition, but the correct answer depends on how much uncertainty there is. Thus, if the editor is perceived to be honest, we show there is an equilibrium in which all the journalists write informative reports, provided that a certain level of competition is met. In contrast, if the editor is perceived to be biased, partial revelation of information exists, even in the absence of competition.

We show theoretically and empirically that financial market imperfections affect the number and identity of exporters' destinations. Bigger economies with lower trade costs are more attractive markets because they offer higher export profits. This generates a pecking order of destinations such that firms serve all countries above a cut-off level of market potential. Credit constraints, however, raise this cut-off above the first best. Financially more advanced nations thus have more trade partners and go further down the pecking order, especially in sectors that rely heavily on the financial system. Our results provide new, systematic evidence that countries follow a hierarchy of export destinations, that market size and trade costs determine this hierarchy, and that financial frictions interact importantly with it. This has policy implications for the effects of cross-border linkages that depend on the number and identity of countries' trade partners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We employ a fundamental model for electricity prices which lends itself well to integrating such forecasts, while retaining ease of implementation and tractability to allow for analytic derivatives pricing formulae. In an extensive futures pricing study, the pricing performance of our model is shown to further improve based on the inclusion of electricity demand and capacity forecasts, thus confirming the general importance of forward-looking information for electricity derivatives pricing. However, we also find that the usefulness of integrating forecast data into the pricing approach is primarily limited to those periods during which electricity prices are highly sensitive to demand or available capacity, whereas the impact is less visible when fuel prices are the primary underlying driver to prices instead.

Using longitudinal data from the Luxembourg Panel Socio-Economique 'Liewen zu Letzebuerg' (PSELL3), we find that long-term housing deprivation is negatively associated with long-term income but the size of this relationship is highly reduced when controlling for unobserved heterogeneity through fixed effects models. This finding suggests that housing deprivation is less affected by short variations in income than by changes in long-term income and that unobserved characteristics may affect the relationship between long-term deprivation and long-term income. It also highlights the importance of taking a long-term perspective when analysing individuals' well-being. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence that local governments shifted their efforts from fostering industrial growth to urbanizing China, i.e., to developing the real estate and construction sectors, when their retention rate of enterprise tax revenue was reduced. The increase from the new revenue source compensated for half of the losses in revenue that resulted from the reassignment of fiscal rights.

The paper obviates the variable omission bias, and the use of cross-sectional techniques that characterise most existing studies. The results show that there is a distinct causal flow from electricity consumption to economic growth: both in the short run and in the long run. This finding supports the electricity-led growth hypothesis that has been conjectured in the literature. The paper urges policy-makers in Nigeria to implement policies which enhance the generation and consumption of electricity in order to engineer economic growth. Appropriate monetary policies must also be put in place, in order to moderate inflation, thus enhancing growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We calculate the associated statistical premium using global and independent methods. The results show that the premium calculated in the global method is larger than that calculated in the independent method. Next, we consider the markets with more general losses which are correlated to one another. We adopt the principle of minimum sensitive dependence on risk aversion to find the statistical premium with the help of the Lagrange multiplier method. It is shown that the statistical premium found by using this method is larger than that calculated by using the independent method. We also show that when there is larger uncertainty, there is larger need for a risk loading in global condition. When the risk aversion is introduced, all insured prefer to move from their originally optimal loss control activities to a combination of the lower dispersion and risk tolerance.

Using a game-theoretic approach, the countries' policy options for capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) are analysed with respect to welfare and distribution effects. An SR tends to narrow down the market, while ROs intensify price competition. However, cross-border effects are most likely negative for consumers and producers in total in the case of a unilateral implementation of a CRM, and market design changes should be coordinated. All results are strongly driven by possible changes in competition and market power. In practice, the market design decision should also consider possible regulatory failures that might lead to further market distortions. The risk of market design flaws seems larger for full capacity markets such as ROs than for an SR, which requires only minor adjustments to the market design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When the elasticity of substitution among goods is larger than one, an increase in the dispersion raises aggregate productivity because firms at the top of the distribution produce most of output. When the elasticity is smaller than one, an increase in the dispersion reduces aggregate productivity because firms at the bottom of the distribution use most of inputs. We use individual firm level data from Spanish manufacturing firms to test the relationship between the dispersion of firms' productivity and aggregate productivity. The estimated coefficients are consistent with the predictions of the model: we find that an increase in the coefficient of variation of firms productivity of 1% increases aggregate productivity by 0.16% in sectors with an elasticity of substitution larger than one while the same increase in the standard deviation reduces aggregate productivity by 0.36% in sectors with an elasticity of substitution smaller than one.

For this purpose, we develop and simulate an equilibrium search and matching model considering the situation of the Spanish 2012 labour market reform as a benchmark. Our steady-state results show that the availability of STW schemes does not necessarily reduce unemployment and job destruction. The effectiveness of this measure depends on the degree of subsidization of payroll taxes it may entail: with a 33 % subsidy, we find that STW is quite beneficial for the Spanish economy because it reduces both unemployment and labour market segmentation. We also perform a cost-benefit analysis that shows that there is scope for Pareto improvements when STW is subsidized. Again, the STW scenario with a 33 % subsidy on payroll taxes seems the most beneficial because more than 57 % of workers improve. These workers also experience a significant increase in annual income that could be used to compensate the losers from this policy change and the State for the fiscal balance deterioration. This reform saves the highest number of jobs and has the lowest deadweight costs.","[Osuna, Victoria] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain; [Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville 41013, Spain; [Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] FEDEA, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"García-Pérez, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville 41013, Spain.",vosupad@upo.es; jigarper@upo.es,"Osuna, Victoria/D-2512-2014; Garcia Perez, J Ignacio/JWP-2410-2024; García-Pérez, José Ignacio/D-2755-2009",,[PAI-SEJ513]; [PAI-SEJ479]; [P09-SEJ4546]; [ECO2012-35430]; [P09-SEJ688]; [ECO2013-43526-R],; ; ; ; ;,"We gratefully acknowledge the support from research projects PAI-SEJ513, PAI-SEJ479, P09-SEJ4546, ECO2012-35430, P09-SEJ688 and ECO2013-43526-R.

We show that as the degree of economic policy uncertainty increases, firms tend to lower their leverage ratios. However, firms that are from regions with lower degrees of marketization, are state-owned or have prior bank-firm relationships mitigate the negative effect of policy uncertainty. Moreover, we provide consistent evidence that this negative effect is sourced from the deterioration of the external financing environment. We also find that firms adjust their financing structures by using more trade credit when economic policy uncertainty increases.

The responder observes the message with certainty and the offer with probability p before accepting or rejecting the offer. We investigate versions with p = 0 and p = 0.5 along with the ultimatum game as a baseline. Intuition and a model comprising both standard economic agents and others who dislike inequity, lies and lying provide clear predictions that our experimental results support. As the likelihood increases of offers being seen, the offers themselves increase, messages overstate them less, and responders are more likely to accept (even when the offer is unseen).

In particular, we ask if decision makers are blamed for being pivotal if they implement an unpopular outcome in a sequential voting process. We conduct an experimental voting game in which decision makers vote about the allocation of money between themselves and recipients without voting rights. We measure responsibility attributions for voting decisions by eliciting the monetary punishment that recipients assign to individual decision makers.

Individuals who purchase the product engage in word of mouth with their friends. The main result establishes that prices optimally fluctuate over time. A monopolist sets prices over time to balance extracting profits in the short term with increasing information diffusion through word of mouth and thereby the population of potential consumers in the future. The key state variable for determining this tradeoff is the distribution of valuations of the individuals on the edge of the diffusion. This distribution of valuations is determined by the history of prices and changes overtime. Our analysis reveals that prices must move up and down infinitely often. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Korea,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Large discount stores; Entry; Local employment; Retail trade,WAL-MART; EXTERNALITIES; COMPETITION,"The Korean retail sector has undergone significant structural changes in conjunction with the rapid expansion of big-box stores since the mid-1990s. Using county-level data from Korea in 1997-2010, we examine the effects of the entry of large discount stores on local retail employment. Based on a differences-in-differences approach, our analysis shows that the entry of a large discount store leads to an increase of approximately 200 retail jobs in the county. Two thirds of this gain is attributable to the entry of the large store itself, and the other third is a result of the expansion of other retail sectors. In particular, we find that the entry of a large discount store increases employment in non-general merchandise sectors, such as bakeries, clothing stores, and electronics stores. Our finding suggests that the opening of a large discount store may have a spillover effect on the local retail sector, thereby leading to an overall increase in county employment. Such a finding of positive employment effects is in sharp contrast to previous findings on the employment effect of large retail chains, based primarily on the expansion of Wal-Mart in the US. While Wal-Mart competes with incumbent chain stores, large discount stores the first nationwide large-scale chains introduced in Korea may play the role of anchor stores. By providing modern shopping infrastructure and attracting new small stores into neighborhoods, these large discount stores have transformed local retail sectors from traditional shopping environments.

The aim of this paper is to empirically measure, in a methodologically innovative manner, the extent to which the movement of capital inflows in the non-eurozone European Union new member states (EU NMS) has been determined by domestic and external factors and discuss potential consequences of such trends, thereby filling the existing literature gap, i.e. the lack of empirical papers that systematically model the temporal dynamics of capital flow determinants. The paper uses econometric methods, i.e. historical decomposition from a structural vector autoregression model, to examine the temporal dynamics of capital flow determinants and extract components of capital inflows in non-eurozone EU NMS that are influenced by domestic and foreign shocks separately. Econometric analysis confirmed the hypothesis that macroeconomic factors in the eurozone are becoming increasingly dominant determinants of capital inflows in EU NMS, especially after the EU accession, and proved that these trends can be connected to rising financial integration levels of analysed countries. Furthermore, results suggest that the rising influence of push factors can be connected with the higher volatility of capital inflows, thus making host countries more prone to sudden stop episodes. The paper uncovers several non-negligible macroeconomic risks of large capital inflows determined by push factors for domestic economic authorities in small integrated economies and points out the need to make efforts to strengthen the domestic financial and regulatory system to ensure the capability of these economies in efficiently managing capital inflows.","Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Globan, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",tgloban@efzg.hr,"Globan, Tomislav/H-7550-2018","Globan, Tomislav/0000-0001-5716-2113",,,,,52,10,10,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2015,42.0,3,,,,,643,672,,10.1007/s10663-014-9270-2,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN2OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358261800008,0

The results indicate that fiscal policy plays a limited role in improving the distribution of disposable income; the Gini coefficient decreased by barely three percentage points after direct fiscal action. On average, 61% of this reduction was due to public cash transfers and the rest to direct taxes, reflecting the pressing need for personal income tax to be strengthened. Analysis of household surveys gives an indication of the potential effects of tax reforms aimed at increasing the average effective tax rate of the top income decile. Allocating this additional revenue to targeted transfers would produce significant results. Consequently, tax reforms must be evaluated bearing in mind how those resources are used.","[Hanni, Michael; Podesta, Andrea] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Econ Dev Div, Port Of Spain, Trinidad Tobago; [Martner, Ricardo] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Econ Dev Div, Fiscal Affairs Unit, Port Of Spain, Trinidad Tobago",,"Hanni, M (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Econ Dev Div, Port Of Spain, Trinidad Tobago.",michael.hanni@cepal.org; ricardo.martner@cepal.org; andrea.podesta@cepal.org,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,6,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2015,,116,,,,,7,26,,,,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY1FT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366152800001,0

Using a panel of 27 provinces and four directly controlled municipalities from 1997 through 2008, we find that the presence of large banking institutions negatively correlates with small business development in local markets and that this negative relation is driven mainly by participation of large banks in the short-term loan market. Rural banking institutions, in contrast, are found to promote regional entrepreneurial activity. Moreover, large state banks facilitate small business development in concentrated markets. When we interact measures of banking financing by state banks and rural banking institutions with a set of provincial-level marketization indexes, we find that extensive marketization, factor market development and sophistication of legal frameworks mitigate the negative effect of large state banks on small business development. In provinces with advanced market development, efficient factor markets and favourable institutional settings, the positive effect of rural banking institutions on small business growth is even stronger.","[Hasan, Iftekhar] Fordham Univ, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Kobeissi, Nada] Long Isl Univ, Brookville, NY USA; [Wang, Haizhi] IIT, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Zhou, Mingming] Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO USA",Fordham University; Long Island University Post; Illinois Institute of Technology; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,"Hasan, I (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 45 Columbus Ave,5th Floor, New York, NY 10023 USA.",ihasan@fordham.edu,"sheng, chen/JEO-8801-2023","Zhou, Mingming/0000-0002-8480-8503",,,,,66,12,16,4,57,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

To conduct our analysis, we use Geographical Information Systems to merge the subjective well-being data with information on respondents' distance from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, their proximity to nuclear power stations in general, and the spatial distribution of radioactive fallout after the accident. Our main findings are as follows: (1) After the disaster, people living in a place affected by the tsunami or close to the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant experienced a drop in life happiness, while the effects declined with distance to the place of the disaster. (2) No change in subjective well-being is detectable in people living close to nuclear facilities in general. (3) In contrast to happiness with life after the disaster, no effect on people's happiness with their entire life can be found among those affected by the disaster. (4) The drop in life happiness in municipalities affected by the tsunami is equivalent to 72% of annual income and reaches 240% for those living in close distance to the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant (<= 150 km).

PWYW allows consumers to select any level of voluntary payment. Using two experiments, we find that consumers voluntarily report payments greater than zero on average in the absence of social pressure. Further, reported voluntary payments are influenced by numbers in the exchange context. When higher numbers are present, consumers respond by reporting they would make higher payments. However, the meaning of the number is also important. When the number represents a descriptive norm (what others are doing), it is more predictive of reported payments compared to a number that represents an injunctive norm (what is the correct thing to do) in some cases. Our results indicate that PWYW may indeed be feasible for products that are purchased anonymously and that firms can strategically provide information that affects payments.

The main aims of the research are (1) to revisit the standard CBD model in order to examine whether its findings from the European Union context hold also for the United States and (2) to expand the CBD standard inquiry of local development beyond economic welfare. In relation to the latter, we address in particular (1) the effect of local cultural industries on migration (as a continuation of Florida's hypothesis) and (2) the effect of culture on social well-being (alternatively measured by means of level of happiness and level of crime in terms of property theft). Our paper is, therefore, a novel contribution, providing a better understanding of the link between arts, culture and regional development and also facilitating an innovative evaluation of cultural impact relevant in the developmental debate in an extended socio-economic sense. The data used in this inquiry comprise a composite dataset, a cross section for the year 2000 at the county level combining census data with the cultural vitality index from the Western States Arts Federation and happiness variables from the general social survey panel for 2006. A three-stage least squares exploration of recursive types of a standard CBD and an extended CBD model leads to three main results: (1) the existence of a CBD cultural effect on local development is confirmed for the USA; (2) endogenous cultural industries have an effect on the mobility of human capital, and (3) the impact of cultural effects seems to be more significant when a negative Myrdalian vicious cycle is assumed.","[Tubadji, Annie] Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece; [Osoba, Brian J.] Cent Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, New Britain, CT 06050 USA; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Aegean; Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Nijkamp, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",atubadji@hotmail.com; osobabrj@mail.ccsu.edu; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,,"kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,97,22,24,3,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The Brazilian experience is instructive as it is a case of an economy that expanded aggregate exports significantly, but with stagnant aggregate TFP growth. The authors first estimate firm-level TFP under alternative assumptions (exogenous and endogenous law of motion for productivity) following Wooldridge's (On estimating firm-level production functions using proxy variables to control for unobservables, 2009) GMM procedure. In turn, they use stochastic dominance techniques to assess whether the ex-ante most productive firms are those that start exporting (self-selection hypothesis). Finally, they test whether exporting boosts firms TFP growth (learning-by-exporting hypothesis) using matching techniques, to control for the possibility that selection into exports may not be a random process. Their results confirm the self-selection hypothesis and show that starting to export yields an extra TFP growth that emerges since a firm's first year of exporting but lasts only one year. Further, this extra TFP growth is much higher under the assumption of an endogenous law of motion for productivity, which reinforces the importance of accounting for firm export status to study the evolution of productivity.","[Cirera, Xavier; Lederman, Daniel] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA; [Manez, Juan A.; Rochina, Maria E.; Sanchis, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Manez, Juan A.; Rochina, Maria E.; Sanchis, Juan A.] ERICES, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; University of Valencia,"Máñez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",jamc@uv.es,"Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; Llopis, Juan A.

This article uses a generalized method of moments (GMM) on a panel of eighteen East European countries in transition for the period 2002-2008. We show that decentralization has a positive impact on growth conditional to local government's autonomy to manage the structure of local public expenditure toward its recurrent component to open the way for more private sector engagement in service delivery. Moreover, our results confirm the reverse causality between local financial indicators and growth: A higher level of growth leads to a lower level of government intervention and a smaller public sector, which confirm previous results.","[Abdellatif, Lobna; Atlam, Baher; Aly, Heidi] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Giza 12613, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Aly, H (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Giza 12613, Egypt.",heidi.aly@feps.edu.eg,,,,,,,72,7,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We identify the two basic means to achieve this goal. First, the outsider must relinquish private benefits in a manner that is informative about security benefits. We show under which conditions this is feasible and which acquisition strategies used in practice meet these conditions. Second, the outsider can alternatively use derivatives to drive a wedge between her voting power and her economic interest in the firm. Such unbundling of ownership and control, while typically considered a source of corporate governance problems, is an efficient response to the frictions dispersed ownership causes for control contestability. We also show that unbundling comes with costs and benefits for the bidder's incentives to improve firm value.","[Burkart, Mike] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Burkart, Mike] Swedish House Finance, CEPR, Stockholm, Sweden; [Burkart, Mike] Swedish House Finance, ECGI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Burkart, Mike] Swedish House Finance, FMG, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lee, Samuel] NYU, Stern Sch Business, SIEPR, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Lee, Samuel] NYU, Stern Sch Business, ECGI, New York, NY 10003 USA",Stockholm School of Economics; Swedish House of Finance; Swedish House of Finance; Swedish House of Finance; New York University; New York University,"Burkart, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,ECGTN; Jan Wallander Foundation,ECGTN; Jan Wallander Foundation,"This article was previously circulated under the title Signalling in Tender Offer Games.

Such evaluation is based on the knowledge of the impact of some events on the underlying state, which is modeled in discrete time as a spatial point process, i.e. both size and time of the jumps can be treated as random variables. This assumption allows us to improve upon the current theory of patent valuation in some respects. In particular, the propagation of the jumps from the economic environment to the patent value is not restricted to be immediate, but can occur with a random delay and with varying intensity, depending on the time to maturity. These actual features lead to a more general formula for patent value that may give rise to a non-trivial difference not accounted for in the existing literature.","[Ventura, Marco] Italian Natl Inst Stat, ISTAT, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Cerqueti, Roy] Univ Macerata, Dept Econ & Law, Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"Ventura, M (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat, ISTAT, Pzza Indipendenza 4, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",roy.cerqueti@unimc.it; mventura@istat.it,"Ventura, Marco/AFV-7975-2022; 胡, 巧爱/GXZ-8730-2022","Ventura, Marco/0000-0003-3388-7122; CERQUETI, ROY/0000-0002-1871-7371",,,,,29,3,3,1,38,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The market microstructure is one in which informed traders may place market orders or full demand schedules and where market makers set the price. Market-order traders trade less aggressively on their information and thus reduce the informativeness of the price; in a full market-order market, price informativeness is bounded, whatever the quality of traders' information about the asset's dividend. When traders can choose their order type and demand schedules are (even marginally) costlier than market orders, then market-order traders overwhelm the market when the precision of private signals goes to infinity. This is because demand schedules are substitutes: at high levels of precision, a residual fraction of demand-schedule traders is sufficient to take the trading price close to traders' signals, while the latter are themselves well aligned with the dividend. Hence, the gain from trading conditional on the price (as demand-schedule traders do) in addition to one's own signal (as all informed traders do) vanishes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper analyzes the role of allocative efficiency on total factor productivity (TFP) in the manufacturing sector by applying the methodology of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) to establishment data from the Chilean manufacturing census. We find that a reduction in resource misallocation accounts for about 40 percent of the growth in manufacturing TFP between 1983 and 1996. In particular, a reduction in the least productive plants' implicit output subsidies is the primary reason for the reduction in resource misallocation during this period. Moreover, these plants enjoyed above industry-average growth in physical productivity, contributing to the overall improvement in efficient TFP after the financial crisis. Our evidence suggests that Chile's banking reform during the early and mid-1980s is likely to have played an important role in the observed improvement in allocative efficiency.

This paper studies a feature of some of these programs that has received relatively little attention in the literature: the inclusion of no immunity for instigators clauses (NIICs). These provisions deny leniency benefits to parties that instigate cartel behavior or function as cartel ringleaders. Our results show that NIICs can lead to increased or decreased levels of cartel conduct. By removing the instigator's benefit from cooperating with the authorities, a NIIC undoes some of the destabilizing benefit the leniency program was intended to generate and thereby furthers cartel stability. On the other hand, the instigator faces an asymmetrically severe punishment under a NIIC and this can reduce the incentive to instigate in the first place. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This result holds true when controlling for quite reliable measures of cognitive abilities, a number of background characteristics, family income and indicators of students' motivation. Secondly, using a Regression Discontinuity Design, we investigate the effects of a remedial program in helping students with different propensities to procrastinate.

Will this growth persist, given the tepid recovery in developed countries, numerous weather shocks, and civil conflicts in Africa? This paper stress tests African economies. The findings indicate that Africa's long-term growth is fairly impervious to a prolonged recession in high-income countries. Growth is, however, much more sensitive to a disruption of capital flows to the region, and to internal shocks, such as civil conflict and drought, even if the latter follow historical patterns. The broad policy implication is that with proper domestic production conditions African countries can sustain robust long-term growth. Because of the economic dominance of the agriculture sector and the share of food in household budgets, countries will need to increase the resilience of agriculture and protect it from unfavorable climate change impacts, such as drought. As in the past, civil conflicts and violence will pose by far the greatest threat to Africa's performance.

Econometric results point to an approximate 80% growth in bilateral trade with an ambitious trade agreement. However, at the same time, computable general equilibrium (CGE) estimates highlight distributional impacts across countries and factors not evident from econometrics alone. Translated through our CGE framework, while bilateral trade increases roughly 80%, there is a fall of about 2.5% in trade with the rest of the world in our central case. The estimated gains in annual consumption range between 1% and 2.25% for the United States and EU, respectively. A purely discriminatory agreement would harm most countries outside the agreement, while the direction of third-country effects hinges critically on whether NTB reductions end up being discriminatory or not.

We show that, provided the sets of asset pay-offs and of collateral levels are sufficiently rich, the equilibrium allocations with sequential trades and collateral constraints are equivalent to those obtained in Arrow-Debreu markets subject to a series of limited pledgeability constraints. We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibria to be Pareto efficient and show that when collateral is scarce equilibria are not only Pareto inefficient but also often constrained inefficient, in the sense that imposing tighter borrowing restrictions can make everybody in the economy better off. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of Markov equilibria and, for the case of two agents, for the existence of equilibria that have finite support.

This article builds a two-sector dynamic model to study the evolution of the sectoral structure and its impact on financial fragility. The model embeds a static mechanism of balance-of-payments crisis which produces multiple equilibria within a single time period when the non-tradable sector is large enough compared to the tradable sector. The article studies the dynamics induced by an increase in financial openness. It shows that the relative size of the non-tradable sector overshoots, which makes the economy more likely to be financially fragile during the transitory dynamics. Using an extended version of the model, the article conducts a quantitative analysis and shows that this mechanism accounts well for several episodes of large capital inflows that led to financial crises.","Banque France, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Kalantzis, Y (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,42,13,14,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

These effects are not well detected by the methods applied in the large public finance literature estimating the elasticity of taxable income and quantifying the efficiency loss from taxation. Our analysis builds on a standard search theoretic framework where workers are continually seeking better paid jobs, but are also fired from time to time because of economic development and productivity shocks. We incorporate non-linear taxation into this setting and estimate the structural parameters of the model using employer-employee register based data for the full Danish population of workers and workplaces for the years 2004-2006. Our results indicate that along the intensive margin the Danish taxation generates an overall efficiency loss corresponding to a 12% reduction in total income. It is possible to reap 4/5 of this potential efficiency gain by going from a high-tax Scandinavian system to a level of taxation in line with low-tax OECD countries such as the United States. The tax-responsiveness of labor mobility and allocation corresponds to an elasticity of taxable income with respect to the net-of-tax rate in the range 0.15-0.35. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, this common belief that firms significantly underinvest in R&D is increasingly being challenged, leading the rationale behind public support for private R&D to be questioned. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the perspectives of two sources: the theoretical literature on endogenous growth, and its recent developments in integrating a geographical dimension, and the empirical literature that measures the social returns to R&D in relation to the private returns. Ultimately, we are able to clearly distinguish among different types of market failures and compare their relative impact on the gap between the private and social returns to R&D. Two main conclusions are reached. First, systematic firm underinvestment in R&D is not demonstrated. Second, even though instances of underinvestment do occur, they are mainly explained by surplus appropriability problems rather than by knowledge externalities. This suggests the need for a new policy mix that employs more demand-oriented instruments and is more concentrated on identifying efficient allocations among activities rather than merely increasing global private R&D investment.","[Montmartin, Benjamin] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, Nice, France; [Massard, Nadine] Univ St Etienne, GATE LSE CNRS, St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Jean Monnet,"Montmartin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, Nice, France.",,,,,,,,55,15,16,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To facilitate a detailed understanding of his position, his work is examined from different angles, in three successive 'approximations'. The coherence, or mismatch, of Schumpeter's conceptions is subsequently discussed. The article argues that Schumpeter's essay on social classes provides an ontologically grounded theory of process which is also a theory of reproduced order and that this theory does not fit well with Schumpeter's alternative conception of order as equilibrium.

Numerical simulations, based on a calibrated version of the model, are used to illustrate these channels. Panel data regressions are presented next; they show that higher innovation performance promotes growth directly, whereas public capital has both direct and indirect growth effects by promoting human capital accumulation and innovation capacity. Elasticity estimates derived from simultaneous equation techniques show that the general equilibrium effects of public capital on steady-state output per capita (which account for indirect effects) are significantly higher than those derived from single equation methods.

While this assumption enhances tractability, it is unrealistic given the considerable delays in the actual practice of bankruptcy. In this paper, I identify the duration of bankruptcy proceedings as an additional source of friction in financial markets and investigate the relationship between this friction and the effectiveness of monetary policy by using U.S. state-level data. Consistent with the commonly-observed positive relationship between the degree of standard financial frictions and the amplitude of macroeconomic responses, I find that U.S. monetary policy is most effective in states with longer bankruptcy proceedings.

This position is often accused of inconsistency: Coase sees the figure of the judge as willing and able to improve economic efficiency, but criticises the actors of public intervention, particularly regulators, for being fallible, vulnerable to political pressures, and lacking information. I shall show that Coase's giving this role to the judge stems precisely from his criticism of public intervention. This means that his figure of the judge escapes the tenets of the theoretical system that first rendered it necessary. Various reasons could explain this difference of treatment as between the judge and the other figures of public intervention in Coase's system, but Coase makes too strong an opposition between common law on one side and regulatory and statutory law on the other, and leaves unexplained the motivation of judges.","Natl Ctr Sci Res CNRS PHARE, Paris, France",,"Bertrand, E (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Sci Res CNRS PHARE, Paris, France.",Elodie.Bertrand@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,63,5,5,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Plott and Zeiler (Am Econ Rev 95:530-545, 2005) replicate this willingness-to-pay/willingness-to-accept gap with conventional experimental procedures, but find no gap after implementing procedures that provide for subject anonymity and familiarity with the second-price mechanism. This paper investigates whether anonymity is necessary for their result. We employ both types of procedures with and without anonymity. Contrary to predictions of one theory-which suggest social pressures may cause differences in subject valuations-we find, regardless of anonymity, conventional procedures generate gaps and Plott and Zeiler's does not. These findings strongly suggest subject familiarity with elicitation mechanisms, not anonymity, is responsible for the variability in results across value-elicitation experiments. As an application to experimental design methodology, there appears to be little need to impose anonymity when using second-price mechanisms in standard consumer good experiments.","[Brown, Alexander L.; Cohen, Gregory] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Brown, AL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",abrown@econmail.tamu.edu,,"Brown, Alex/0000-0002-5582-5304",Texas A&M Humanities and Social Science Enhancement of Research Capacity Program,Texas A&M Humanities and Social Science Enhancement of Research Capacity Program,"Financial support was provided by the Texas A&M Humanities and Social Science Enhancement of Research Capacity Program.

In addition it captures important features of the US business cycle, outperforming models with a fixed exit rate and a fixed number of firms.

Our empirical results indicate that not all the countries are alike and that the theoretical prediction that stock prices fall at the announcement of a policy change is not always supported.

In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of three of the more prominent proposed approaches: pre-analysis plans, hypothesis registries, and replications. They have been primarily discussed for experimental research, both in the field including randomized control trials and the laboratory, so we focus on these areas. A pre-analysis plan is a credibly fixed plan of how a researcher will collect and analyze data, which is submitted before a project begins. Though pre-analysis plans have been lauded in the popular press and across the social sciences, we will argue that enthusiasm for pre-analysis plans should be tempered for several reasons. Hypothesis registries are a database of all projects attempted; the goal of this promising mechanism is to alleviate the file drawer problem, which is that statistically significant results are more likely to be published, while other results are consigned to the researcher's file drawer. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of replications. We argue that even with modest amounts of researcher bias-either replication attempts bent on proving or disproving the published work, or poor replication attempts-replications correct even the most inaccurate beliefs within three to five replications. We offer practical proposals for how to increase the incentives for researchers to carry out replications.","[Coffman, Lucas C.] Ohio State Univ, Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Niederle, Muriel] Stanford Univ, Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Niederle, Muriel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Coffman, LC (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",coffman.155@osu.edu; niederle@stanford.edu,"Niederle, Muriel/F-2613-2011",,,,,,22,72,78,0,9,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This is no less true in South Arica where the Rand's volatility is a longstanding policy and business challenge. This paper extends the literature on nominal and institutional factors associated with currency volatility. Rose's description of inflation as Bretton Woods in reverse is the departure point and is read with Berganza and Broto's recent demonstration in a time series study that inflation targeting emerging market economies have experience higher exchange rate volatility. Meanwhile Bleaney and Tian have shown the cross-sectional connection between the level of inflation and exchange rate volatility. We build on Bleaney and Tian's cross-sectional approach to investigate the association between the level at which inflation targeting countries target inflation and exchange rate volatility over the long run. Crucially, we control for the average level of inflation and distinguish between inflation targeting countries that target high and low levels of inflation, in order to investigate whether the choice of the level of the inflation target (an institutional feature) is associated with greater exchange rate volatility.","[Du Plessis, Stan; Reid, Monique Brigitte] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Provinc, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Du Plessis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Provinc, South Africa.",stan@sun.ac.za,"Reid, Monique/AAF-8136-2021","Reid, Monique/0000-0001-8762-8631; Du Plessis, Stan/0000-0002-2899-5172",,,,,12,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

This paper studies the effects of split work schedule on workers' psychological well-being, daily time use, and productivity. Using cross-sectional data from the 2002 to 2003 Spanish Time Use Survey, I find that female split-shifters experience an increased feeling of being at least sometimes overwhelmed by tasks and not having enough time to complete them. On working days, a split work schedule is positively related to time spent on the job, sleeping, and eating and drinking, and negatively associated with time spent on housework, parental child care, and leisure activities. Most of the time-use effects are similar across the sexes, and only a few of the time reductions are partly made up on days off. I also find that the split work schedule is associated with lower hourly wages.","Ctr Univ Def Zaragoza, Acad Gen Mil, Zaragoza 50090, Spain",,"Chapela, JG (通讯作者)，Ctr Univ Def Zaragoza, Acad Gen Mil, Ctra Huesca S-N, Zaragoza 50090, Spain.",jorgegc@unizar.es,"Chapela, Jorge González/AAA-9507-2021","Chapela, Jorge González/0000-0003-3550-6370",,,,,41,3,4,2,36,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Using CDS and sovereign bond spreads, the price discovery mechanism was tested using a vector error correction model. Financial integration is measured using news-based methods. We find that sovereign CDS and bond markets are co-integrated. In five out of seven sovereigns (71%), the bond market leads in price discovery by adjusting to new information regarding credit risk before CDS. In 29% of times, CDS markets are the source of price discovery. We also find a positive correlation of 0.67 between the degree of financial integration and the bond market information share. The evidence suggests that changes in sovereign credit risk and bond yields are significantly influenced by common external (global) factors, while country-specific factors play an insignificant role.

Using Ukraine as an illustration, I argue that only ownership empowerment of economically powerless classes can democratize the oligarchic transition economies. As an exit strategy from oligarchic capitalism, I recommend that state capitalism be implemented, as a transitory condition only, to divest oligarchs of unlawfully acquired economic power. Then, progressive restructuring of oligarchic companies must be conducted through broadening property ownership to include shared ownership and worker participation in economic decisions. I conclude that only by nurturing the democratic fundamentals of the economy and promoting a social democratic welfare state could a government in post-Euromaidan Ukraine initiate its own social control and create a genuine political and economic democracy.","Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Klimina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",,,,,,,,41,2,4,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This means that informal care is less available, particularly for elderly people, with important implications for health-care utilisation and health expenditure. This paper uses a two-part model to examine the relationship between living alone and hospitalisations in Australia in terms of both the likelihood and the length of hospitalisation. The results show living alone increases the probability of hospitalisation by 2.9 percentage points and length of stay by 3.8days for people aged 45 and above. Further analysis indicates that these impacts depend on the length of living alone. Additionally, the probability and the length of hospitalisation vary depending on whether the cause of living alone is separation/divorce, widowhood or never having married.","[Mu, Chunzhou; Kecmanovic, Milica; Hall, Jane] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat CHERE, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Mu, CZ (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat CHERE, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Chunzhou.Mu@chere.uts.edu.au,"Mu, Chunzhou/A-4460-2019; Hall, Jane P/I-3469-2014","Mu, Chunzhou/0000-0002-6464-1267; Hall, Jane/0000-0002-2191-0543","REFinE at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at UTS, a Centre of Research Excellence under the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute - Commonwealth of Australia","REFinE at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at UTS, a Centre of Research Excellence under the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute - Commonwealth of Australia","The authors are supported by REFinE at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at UTS, a Centre of Research Excellence under the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute, which is supported by a grant from the Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the Department of Health.

My data consist of a rich array of measures of voting behaviors and corresponding ballot and voter population characteristics for a panel of electoral districts from three Australian federal election cycles. I examine how the number of candidates and voting tickets on the ballot, as well as key moderating variables, affect the share of voters (1) opting for a simplified alternative to the baseline voting process; and (2) intentionally casting an invalid ballot. The findings indicate that incremental options can increase or decrease motivation to engage in a choice process; the overall pattern of results appears consistent with a diminishing returns model of expanded choice. Voters appear to trade off costs and benefits rationally in their decisions concerning how and whether to make choices. Public policies and private strategies should leverage moderating variables to encourage participation in choice processes and should account for opt-out tendencies at both ends of the choice spectrum.

We consider the situation wherein the managerial delegation contracts are determined by maximising social welfare within the public firm, which is equal to the objective function of its owner, and through bargaining over the content of managerial delegation contracts between the owner and manager within the private firm. We show that, in equilibrium, when the manager of the private firm has high bargaining power relative to that of the owner, the public firm chooses a price contract, while the private firm chooses a quantity contract. However, there is no equilibrium market structure under the pure strategic contract class when the manager has sufficiently low bargaining power relative to that of the owner.","[Nakamura, Yasuhiko] Nihon Univ, Tokyo 102, Japan",Nihon University,"Nakamura, Y (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-2 Misaki Cho, Tokyo 1018360, Japan.",yasuhiko.r.nakamura@gmail.com,,,KAKENHI [25870113]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25870113] Funding Source: KAKEN,"KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Different defense strategies result in different growth paths. The long-run growth path is determined by the equilibrium of a dynamic game with three players: the external predator, the government, and the family. The equilibrium growth path can have different phases: submissive equilibrium, tolerant equilibrium, and complete protection equilibrium. Sustainable growth will endogenously induce an adjustment of the defense strategies. As the economy keeps growing, complete protection will eventually be preferred. The optimal growth path prefers to compress the length of the transitional period between incomplete protection and complete protection.

Player one's type is private information and he may be a commitment type, drawn from a countable set of commitment types, who is locked into playing a particular strategy. Under a full-support assumption on the monitoring structure, we prove a reputation result for stage games with a strong Stackelberg action: if there is positive probability that player one is a particular type whose commitment payoff is equal to player one's highest payoff, consistent with the players' individual rationality, then a patient player one secures this type's commitment payoff in any Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the repeated game. In contrast, if the type's commitment payoff is strictly less than player one's highest payoff consistent with the players' individual rationality, then the worst perfect Bayesian equilibrium payoff for a patient player one is equal to his minimax payoff.

Schools compete to place graduates by investing in education quality and by choosing grading policies. In equilibrium, schools strategically adopt grading policies that do not perfectly reveal graduate ability to evaluators. We compare outcomes when schools grade strategically to outcomes when evaluators perfectly observe graduate ability. With strategic grading, grades are less informative, and evaluators rely less on grades and more on a school's quality when assessing graduates. Consequently, under strategic grading, schools have greater incentive to invest in quality, and this can improve evaluator welfare.","[Boleslavsky, Raphael] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Sch Business Adm, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Cotton, Christopher] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Miami; Queens University - Canada,"Boleslavsky, R (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Sch Business Adm, Jenkins Bldg,Room 521,5250 Univ Dr, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",r.boleslavsky@miami.edu; cot-ton@econ.queensu.ca,,"Cotton, Christopher/0000-0002-2623-8215",Jarislowsky-Deutsch Chair in Economic and Financial Policy at Queen's University,Jarislowsky-Deutsch Chair in Economic and Financial Policy at Queen's University,Cotton is grateful for financial support provided through his position as the Jarislowsky-Deutsch Chair in Economic and Financial Policy at Queen's University.,,23,38,51,2,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

As such, we are especially interested in how the policy instrument reacts to key macroeconomic variables in the face of possible corruption (modelled here as tax leakage) and possible dependence by the central bank on the fiscal policy process. We analyse this issue by deriving optimal rules for a strict inflation targeting and a real exchange rate target regime. We find that, firstly, the existence of corruption imposes an inflationary bias on the optimal rule even when the central bank is independent. We find, furthermore, that a central bank that exhibits some dependence exacerbates this effect. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Empirical data for the following dimensions of (re-) distribution in the period of finance-dominated capitalism since the early 1980s is provided for 15 advanced capitalist economies: functional distribution, personal/household distribution and the share and the composition of top incomes. Based on the Kaleckian approach to the determination of income shares, the effects of financialisation on functional income distribution are studied in more detail. Some stylised facts of financialisation are integrated into the Kaleckian approach, and by means of reviewing empirical and econometric literature it is found that financialisation and neoliberalism have contributed to the falling labour income share since the early 1980s through three main Kaleckian channels: 1) a shift in the sectoral composition of the economy, 2) an increase in management salaries and rising profit claims of the rentiers and thus in overheads, and 3) weakened trade union bargaining power.","[Hein, Eckhard] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, D-10825 Berlin, Germany; [Hein, Eckhard] Inst Int Polit Econ IPE, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hein, E (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Badensche Str 50-51, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",eckhard.hein@hwr-berlin.de,"Hein, Eckhard/HQY-4102-2023","Hein, Eckhard/0000-0002-6542-6630",,,,,81,76,82,2,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Retirement waves of baby-boom generations, combined with a rise in longevity and low fertility rates, raise the old-age dependency ratio to 85% by 2050, the highest among major developed countries, and generate a significant budget imbalance, as the government faces rising costs of public pension and health and long-term care insurance. Preserving the current level of the transfers will require a major increase in taxation. Using consumption taxes to balance the government budget, the tax rate reaches the maximal value of 48% in late 2070s. A pension reform to reduce benefits by 20% results in a peak tax rate of 37%, which can be reduced further to 28% if the retirement age is also gradually raised by 5 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Usually, these refinements were motivated by a discussion of how rational agents would reason in some particular cheap talk games. In this paper, we propose a new refinement and stability measure that is intended to predict actual behavior in a wide range of cheap talk games. According to our Average Credible Deviation Criterion (ACDC), the stability of an equilibrium is determined by the frequency and size of credible deviations. ACDC organizes the results from several cheap talk experiments in which behavior converges to equilibrium, even in cases where other criteria do not make a prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In our model, there are two vertical tasks-an upstream task for improving the project's potential environment, and a downstream task for implementing the project. The downstream task must be done by the worker, but the upstream task can be done by either the manager or the worker. An effort for the upstream task is a hidden action of the party in charge of the task. The realized project environment is the manager's private information. We show that, when the upstream task is easy, the manager may assign the task to herself, even if her opportunity cost is larger than the worker's (a bias in favor of micro-management). When the upstream task is hard, by contrast, the manager may assign the task to the worker, even if her opportunity cost is smaller than the worker's (a bias in favor of macro-management). We also discuss distortions in the project output schedules in each case to show that the central trade-off is efficiency in task allocation versus efficiency in project output.

This stability issue was examined by McAvinchey and McCausland who considered a hypothetical enlargement of Eurozone with a new member country, and empirically showed that the effects of enlargement are predominantly destabilizing. Using the Argy's method of exact log-linearization, we show that the model is intrinsically unstable. A numerical example is given with the 2010 parameter values. We found that the stability could ironically be rehabilitated when uncovered interest parity and purchasing power parity are violated.","Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Akiba, H (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda,Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, Japan.",hiroya@waseda.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture [26380330]","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","An earlier version was presented at a graduate workshop at Hosei University.

Prior research on returns of regulated water supply and distribution companies concluded that regulation interacts significantly with equity returns and that the systematic risk and hence required returns of water utilities equity were low and decreasing over time (Buckland and Fraser, J Bus Financ Account 28(7-8):877-904, 2001). The current research analyses the returns on securities issued by regulated water companies in the differently regulated economies of the UK and the US, using data from 1980 to 2010. Mirroring the results from the 1990s, the evidence suggests that UK regulators have chronically overestimated the systematic risks borne by investors in water utilities, resulting in lax pressure on permitted returns and higher prices than are needed to provoke efficiency. The analysis also confirms that there are striking differences between the regulatory risks and patterns of returns for private sector water utilities in the UK and the US.","[Buckland, Roger] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Williams, Julian] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England; [Beecher, Janice] Michigan State Univ, Inst Publ Util, Lansing, MI USA",University of Aberdeen; Durham University; Michigan State University,"Buckland, R (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen, Scotland.",r.buckland@abdn.ac.uk; julian.williams@durham.ac.uk; beecher@msu.edu,,"Beecher, Janice/0000-0003-1709-5133",,,,,57,7,8,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Unlike the existing studies, we show that retail-minus regulation could obtain the intended result of reducing the retail price. This concurs to a great extent with conventional wisdom, which has been criticized, but not entirely, because the price-reducing effect in our model is not driven by competition. Such an effect is more obvious in the case of inferior-quality entry, where the lower incumbent price can help the entrant expand the market. The key is that the retail-minus rule offers the incumbent an incentive to reduce its price in order to utilize the value created by the entrant. The outcome relies on the combination of a differentiated entry and the retail-minus rule. Differentiated entry under the retail-minus rule could benefit both the incumbent and consumers because the rule protects the incumbent from business stealing while allowing value creation by the entrant.","[Kim, Sung-Hwan] Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon 441749, South Korea; [Byun, Jeong Wook] KISDI, Jincheon, South Korea",Ajou University,"Kim, SH (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon 441749, South Korea.",jwbyun@kisdi.re.kr; skim92@ajou.ac.kr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

An inverted U shaped relationship is demonstrated, showing that low levels of inequality exert a positive correlation with economic growth while high levels depict a negative one. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the existence of an Optimal Rate of Inequality (ORI) that maximizes growth rates in comparison to other inequality levels, and releases the economy from any distortion generated by high inequality or high redistribution and the associated taxation levels. Empirical evidence from a broad panel of countries as well as a bibliometric analysis is presented to validate these propositions.","Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Tamaulipas,"Charles-Coll, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas, Mexico.",jacoll@uat.edu.mx,,,,,,,49,2,2,0,12,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

It is shown that the risk-free rate depends on risk aversion, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the share of wealth invested in human wealth, life expectancy, and the preference for bequests. In a standard life-cycle context, mortality increases the subjective time rate of discount, and thus increases the compensation required to postpone consumption. This latter effect is offset in a bequest-driven model of the type considered here, leading to much more powerful income effects. In this sense, the model provides a bequest-motive explanation for the risk-free rate puzzle put forward by Weil in 1989.","[Cui, Xiaoyong] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Gong, Liutang] Peking Univ, LMEQF, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Gong, LT (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",ltgong@gsm.pku.edu.cn,"Cui, Xiaoyong/B-3669-2016",,National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China [70725006]; Young Scientists Fund [71103208],National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Young Scientists Fund,The authors thank two anonymous referees and the participants of the Macro Workshop at the Beijing University for useful comments.

I study the nonlinear properties of devices often used to remove the unit root and I find that they generate different dynamics when matching emerging markets. Models with endogenous discount factors reinforce consumption response to shocks and increase the countercyclicality of the trade balance to output ratio. Conversely, models with debt frictions ameliorate the responses of consumption and trade balance. Hence, to generate dynamics similar to those in emerging economies, the debt frictions need to be small, inducing a near unit root behavior in their Euler equations. This difference across models is hidden when matching developed economies because of consumption smoothing and the mild countercyclicality of the trade balance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses recent micro data of rural China to answer this question. An instrumental variable model is estimated to account for potential endogeneity issues. Results show that poorer households have lower probability of entering the informal credit market. Further examination shows that the poor are limited by social network and that they have no financial means to invest in their social capital to expand their social network. Our findings shed light on potential solutions of reducing poverty in rural areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Firing costs assist significantly in explaining the procyclicality of JCR, the negative correlation of JCR and JDR, and the persistence of vacancies. They also decrease the counter-cyclicality of job turnover. We also postulate that the Hosios condition helps explain the negative correlation of JCR and JDR and vacancies' persistence.

Key features of the model are: (i) rational voters interpret public good provision as a signal of incumbent competence, and (ii) realistically, grants are unobservable to voters. In this setting, the national government will use the grant as an instrument to manipulate the public good signal for the benefit of aligned local incumbents and challengers. Then, aligned municipalities receive more grants, with this effect being stronger before elections, and the probability that the aligned local incumbent is re-elected is higher. These predictions are tested using a regression discontinuity design on a new data-set on Italian municipalities. At a second empirical stage, the national grant to municipalities is instrumented with an alignment indicator, allowing estimation of a flypaper effect for Italian municipalities.

By modeling the underlying markets for online content and offline products, we can identify the sources of distortions for each type of result, and their interaction. This explicit treatment proves crucial for understanding, not only spillovers across markets, but also fundamental policy issues, such as the welfare effects of integration. In particular, integration of the engine with a small fraction of content providers is welfare-enhancing when incentives to distort are stronger for sponsored than organic search, but welfare-reducing in the opposite case.

Variants of a dictator game in a lab-in-the-field experiment with Filipino migrants in Rome are used to examine remitting behavior under varying degrees of commitment. These range from the soft commitment of simply labeling remittances as being for education, to the hard commitment of having funds directly paid to a school and the student's educational performance monitored. We find that the introduction of simple labeling for education raises remittances by more than 15%. Adding the ability to directly send this funding to the school adds only a further 2.2%. We randomly vary the information asymmetry between migrants and their most closely connected household, but find no significant change in the remittance response to these forms of commitment as information varies. Behavior in these games is then shown to be predictive of take-up of a new financial product called EduPay, designed to allow migrants to directly pay remittances to schools in the Philippines. We find this take-up is largely driven by a response to the ability to label remittances for education, rather than to the hard commitment feature of directly paying schools. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Findings suggest that trout species have attained a cultural status, which makes it difficult to have them eradicated without facing stiff resistance from the trout-dependent sector. Results suggested that a process of leisure augmentation through environmental greed underpinned the introduction and continuance of spreading trout. With this process came also the development of a complex set of institutions that protected trout since they served an honorific role. My findings also suggest that the Ayresian thesis that all ceremonial systems are past-binding could be relaxed because ceremonial interests also envision alternative futures that can entrench and further protect ceremonial systems. To that end, these ceremonial interests facilitate path-breaking, but harmful institutional change. I extend Paul Dale Bush's concept of institutional spaces by assigning faces to the concept, resulting in expansion of possible institutional adjustment configurations. I find that this reorganization of Bush's concept tells the historical evolution of institutions of the leisure class in South Africa in a more dynamic way.","Rhodes Univ, Area Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Marire, J (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Area Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Grahamstown, South Africa.",,,"Marire, Juniours/0000-0002-6648-7582",,,,,57,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Our approximation guarantee is parameterized by the set of allowable resource cost functions, and degrades with the degree of nonlinearity of these cost functions. We prove that our guarantee is the best possible for every set of cost functions that satisfies mild technical conditions.

The positive influence of education on growth is supported by many empirical studies. However, the effects of education on labour supply, poverty reduction and welfare as well as subsistence agriculture are hardly traceable in an econometric set-up, given the complex interactions and the long-term nature of education. An economy-wide dynamic simulation model provides a well-suited toolkit to analyse the effects of increased school provision in these aspects and provides insights into the intertemporal aspects of the schooling decision of children. We develop a macroeconomic model that explicitly includes education and human capital allocation, and takes into account that the possibility of child labour increases the opportunity costs of human capital formation. In an application for Tanzania, we find that a large-scale investment programme in education might have a negative effect on both gross domestic product (GDP) growth and high-skilled labour supply in the short term but leads to higher GDP and welfare as well as significantly reduced child labour supply in the medium to long term.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Schuerenberg-Frosch, H (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",hannah.schuerenberg-frosch@uni-due.de,,"Schurenberg-Frosch, Hannah/0000-0003-3712-5571",,,,,24,1,1,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The purpose of the proposed method is to relate between-group differences in an outcome variable to differences in observable characteristics. The method overcomes disadvantages of existing decompositions for nonlinear models discussed in the literature. In particular, it leads to a unique decomposition and absorbs the present nonlinearities in a natural way. In this paper, the proposed decomposition is theoretically identified and it is shown how it can be estimated and how inference can be conducted. It is then compared to existing decomposition methods. An empirical application is presented where the results from the proposed decomposition method are compared with results from existing methods. It is demonstrated that linear methods such as the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition may not be appropriate in the presence of substantial nonlinearities, and that the decomposition approach proposed in this paper leads to a theoretically sensible decomposition of the outcome differential.","Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Schwiebert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",schwiebert@leuphana.de,,,,,,,21,11,11,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

We give positive answers to both questions. To achieve these results, we first show that there is a classical solution to the HJB equation and give a representation of the solution in terms of the dual function of the solution to the dual HJB equation. We demonstrate the usefulness of that representation with some nontrivial examples that would be difficult to solve with the trial and error method. We then combine the dual method and the partial differential equation method to give a direct proof to the turnpike property and to estimate the error and the convergence rate of the optimal policy when the utility function is continuously differentiable and strictly concave. We finally relax the conditions of the utility function and provide some sufficient conditions that guarantee the turnpike property and the convergence rate in terms of both primal and dual utility functions.

In particular, we construct a system of public education and public pensions that mimics the efficient complete market allocation.

In a stylized three-country model of trade under oligopoly, we take into account the conditions that FTA members set external tariffs to induce their exporting firms to comply with rules of origin (ROO) within the trade bloc. This approach rules out trade deflection and regime switches in forming an effective PTA. The key findings are as follows: (i) Unless the difference in market size is too large and ROO are too restrictive, an PTA can be welfare-improving to countries with market size differential. (ii) The formation of a preferential trade agreement (either an PTA or a CU) is more likely to emerge between countries of similar market size. However, forming a CU allows for a greater degree of market size asymmetry than forming an PTA. (iii) Compared to the pre-PTA equilibrium, the greater reductions in external tariffs under an FTA than under a CU remain valid even for the case with market size asymmetry and preferential ROO. As such, a non-member country is relatively better off under an PTA. (iv) World welfare is higher under an FTA than under a CU when the market size asymmetry is moderate and ROO are less restrictive.

However, since we do not have complete data on the switchovers in lead reserve currencies, a great deal of uncertainty attends any forecasts. Hence, it is possible that new reserve currencies might appear with greater rapidity than anticipated. Of the candidates for new reserve currencies among the major emerging economies, the renminbi (RMB) is the most plausible. However, even under optimistic assumptions regarding economic growth and financial development, RMB status as a major reserve currency is some time off. A role for regional reserve currency status in the near future is much more likely. The advent of a multi-reserve currency world is unlikely to have negative consequences for global financial stability (and might be stability-enhancing). However, achieving the prerequisites for reserve currency status will force sacrifices in terms of policy autonomy. In addition, reserve currency status might reduce international competitiveness for individual countries, as higher currency demand appreciates their currencies.","[Chinn, Menzie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Robert M La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chinn, Menzie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chinn, Menzie D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chinn, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Robert M La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mchinn@lafollette.wisc.edu,,,,,,,49,9,9,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Our experience in fitting this disequilibrium model suggests that simple causality tests are not a proper means to understand the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth. Our results also suggest, at least for developing countries, that an electricity supply constraint sometimes plays an important role when investigating the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth.

We present a basic model of procurement in a multitask environment in which a risk-averse firm chooses noncontractible efforts in cost reduction and quality improvement. We first consider the effect on incentives and risk transfer of bundling building and management stages into a single contract, allowing for different assumptions on feasible contracts and information available to the government. Then we extend the model in novel directions. We study the relationship between the operator and its financiers and the impact of private finance. We discuss the trade-off between incentive and flexibility in PPP agreements and the dynamics of PPPs, including cost overruns. We also consider how institutions, and specifically the risk of regulatory opportunism, affect contract design and incentives.

Home teams should move first only when this is optimal, and this should lead them to winning the tournament more often.

This paper contributes to this literature by estimating causal effects on local expenditures and income taxes of general, unconditional grants. This is done in a difference-in-difference model utilizing policy-induced increases in grants to a group of remotely populated municipalities in Finland. The finding is that increased grants have a statistically and economically significant positive immediate effect on local expenditures. The effect on local income taxes, while statistically significant, is considerably smaller in magnitude. Furthermore, there is no evidence of dynamic crowding-out-i.e., that the immediate response in expenditures is reversed in later years.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Lundqvist, H (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",helene.lundqvist@ne.su.se,,,,,,,26,20,22,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

It investigates the effects of three dimensions of family networks on these transitions: their structure, the strength of their ties, and the resources embedded in them. For this purpose, we use a first-hand survey conducted in Ouagadougou on a representative sample of 2000 households. Using event history data and very detailed information on family networks, we estimate proportional hazard models for discrete-time data. We find that family networks have a significant effect on the dynamics of workers in the labour market and that this effect differs depending on the type of transition and the dimension of the family network considered. Network size appears not to matter much in labour market dynamics. However, strong ties play a stabilizing role by limiting large transitions. Their negative effect on transitions is reinforced by a high level of resources embedded in the network.

This study uses a panel data of 30 provinces in China during 1999-2010 to estimate the panel smooth transition regression model.

Otherwise they are in the low fiscal difficulty (LFD) regime. The primary finding of this study is that the land leasing fee has a significantly positive influence on the total value of commodity buildings sold in the LFD regime. In addition, the local fiscal deficit has a significantly positive impact on the real estate market in the LFD regime, but this impact turns to be negative in the HFD regime. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We study the performance of different regulatory approaches for network expansion in the context of realistic demand patterns and fluctuating wind power. In particular, we are interested in the relative performance of a combined merchant-regulatory price-cap mechanism compared to a cost-based and a non-regulated approach. We include both an hourly time resolution and fluctuating wind power. This substantially increases the real-world applicability of results compared to previous analyses. We show that a combined merchant-regulatory regulation, which draws upon a cap over the two-part tariff of the transmission company, leads to welfare outcomes superior to the other modeled alternatives. This result proves to be robust over a range of different cases, including such with large amounts of fluctuating wind power. We also evaluate the outcomes of our detailed model using the extension plans resulting from a simplified model based on average levels of load and wind power. We show that this distorts the relative performance of the different regulatory approaches.","[Schill, Wolf-Peter; Egerer, Jonas; Rosellon, Juan] DIW Berlin, Dept Energy, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Egerer, Jonas] Tech Univ Berlin, WIP, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Rosellon, Juan] CIDE, Dept Econ, Col Lomas De Santa Fe 01210, DF, Mexico",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Following empirical evidence, greenfield investors are modeled as more productive than M&A firms, which are in turn more productive than exporters. The model has two symmetric countries and generates two-way flows of both M&A and greenfield FDI.

To explain flows between OD regions, it is not only what happens in the origin and destination that is relevant, but also what happens in their neighbouring regions. However, what happens if there is a high degree of overlap between origin neighbouring areas and destination neighbouring areas? The article presents an empirical illustration to re-examine the evidence presented in previous research (Alama-Sabater et al., 2013) and more closely analyses the territorial level, focusing on the case of interregional trade of goods at the NUTS3 level (Spanish provinces). We then use two different methodologies within the framework of a spatial gravity equation for interregional trade modelling. The findings confirm the importance of spatial dependence on trade flows and in particular that logistics decisions within a province affect shipments from contiguous provinces.","[Alama-Sabater, Luisa; Marquez-Ramos, Laura; Suarez-Burguet, Celestino] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Miguel Navarro-Azorin, Jose] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Márquez-Ramos, L (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",lmarquez@eco.uji.es,"Suarez, Celestino/AAA-2446-2019; Sabater, Luisa Alama/L-1769-2014; Márquez-Ramos, Laura/ABB-6904-2021","Suarez, Celestino/0000-0002-3039-6240; Márquez-Ramos, Laura/0000-0002-2193-9645; Navarro Azorin, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-9698-1226",,,,,30,9,9,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Preferential interest rate policies are often used to remedy the problem. This paper constructs a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, imperfect enforcement and costly intermediation. Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously by an agent's type (ability and net wealth) and credit market frictions. The credit program subsidizes the interest rate on loans and requires a fixed application cost, which might be null. We find that the credit subsidy policy has no significant effect on output, but it may have negative effects on wages. The program is largely a transfer from households to a small group of entrepreneurs with minor aggregate effects. We also provide estimates of the effects of reducing the frictions directly. When comparing differences in US output per capita in a baseline case to simulations with counterfactually high frictions, intermediation costs and enforcement explain about 20-25 % of the output gap.

Items on eBay, for instance, are frequently offered through auctions, posted prices, and buy-it-now auctions. In this article, I study how this mechanism multiplicity influences the welfare of buyers and sellers. I specify and estimate a structural model of mechanism choice in online markets, in which I consider both sides of the market: On the demand side, buyers' choices among available listings are equilibrium outcomes of an entry game. On the supply side, sellers make equilibrium decisions when choosing sales mechanisms and prices. I estimate this model using data from sales of baseball tickets on eBay and calculate consumer and seller rents in three markets: the actual market with all three sales mechanisms and two counterfactual markets with auctions and fixed prices or only fixed-price listings, respectively. I find that the addition of auctions to fixed-price markets hurts sellers and risk-averse buyers but benefits risk-neutral buyers. Additionally, the consumer surplus increases when buy-it-now auctions are offered but the seller surplus is reduced further. I discuss the intuition for the cause of this result.

Our aim was to establish whether technical tools can consistently achieve returns exceeding those of the B&H strategy across various financial markets. We found the relative strength index (RSI) to be the best oscillator, outperforming the DJIA, the FTSE100 and the NK225 for five of the six years examined. The only index that did better than the RSI was TA100, which outperformed all the examined oscillators. In second place was the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) oscillator, which outperformed the NK225 B&H strategy and came in second for TA100. The results show that during bear markets the RSI and MACD generally produce better gains than the indices, while the opposite occurs during bull markets.","[Cohen, Gil] Carmel Acad Ctr Business Sch, Haifa, Israel; [Cabiri, Elinor] Univ Haifa, Sch Business, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Cohen, G (通讯作者)，Carmel Acad Ctr Business Sch, Haifa, Israel.",Gilc@yvc.ac.il,"cohen, gil/CAA-0988-2022; Cohen, Gil/AFK-6266-2022","Cohen, Gil/0000-0002-5176-4583",,,,,14,8,14,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Specifically, we test whether the expansion of Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women during the 19805 and 1990s affects hospitals' decisions to adopt neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). While Medicaid expansion provided new insurance to a substantial number of pregnant women, prior literature also finds that some newly insured women would otherwise have been covered by more generously reimbursed private sources. Such crowd-out, combined with Medicaid's low reimbursement rats, leads to a theoretically ambiguous net effect of Medicaid expansion on a hospital's incentive to invest in technology. Using American Hospital Association data, we find that on average. Medicaid expansion has no statistically significant effect on NICU adoption. However, we also find that in geographic areas where more of the newly Medicaid-insured may have come from the privately insured population, Medicaid expansion slows NICU adoption. This holds true particularly when Medicaid payment rates are very low relative to private payment rates. Our findings are consistent with prior evidence on reduced NICU adoption from increased managed-care penetration. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our work for insurance expansions associated with the Affordable Care Act. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, at-risk youth incapacitated to schools may impact the learning environment and school safety. The purpose of this article is to study whether raising the minimum dropout age (MDA) requirement above 16 increases crime committed within US public high schools. A difference-in-difference estimation exploits changes in state-level MDA laws over time and indicates that schools in states that raise their MDA requirement to 18 incur more overall crime relative to schools in states that do not, while no effect on overall crime is identified when the MDA requirement is raised to 17. Furthermore, these effects persist for 4 years after passage and more intensely in metropolitan areas. Coupling this research with existing literature suggests that when the MDA requirement is raised to 18, only a small portion of the observed reduction in juvenile crime is displaced to schools.

Owing to transaction costs and other frictions, it is quite plausible that we are dealing with potential non-linearities in the real interest rate. Therefore we examine stationarity of the real interest rate allowing for non-linearities and asymmetric adjustment with smooth structural change in the data generating process. Our findings suggest that taking account of non-linearities in the data generating process results in a rejection of the unit root null hypothesis for some countries which seem to be non-stationary according to conventional unit root tests. This finding points to the importance of allowing for both structural breaks and asymmetric adjustment in the real interest rate series of transition countries.","[Guney, Pelin Oge] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Telatar, Erdinc; Hasanov, Mubariz] Okan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Istanbul, Turkey",Hacettepe University; Okan University,"Güney, PÖ (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",pelinoge@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Hasanov, Mubariz/GMX-0254-2022; Hasanov, Mübariz/AAT-7120-2021","Hasanov, Mubariz/0000-0003-0216-9531; Hasanov, Mübariz/0000-0003-0216-9531",,,,,64,5,6,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We characterize the BTOP grants and examine the impact of the awards on broadband adoption. Econometric specifications controlling for award endogeneity related to observed and unobserved county-level factors find that spending is apparently associated with increased broadband adoption. Further investigation, however, reveals that the impacts of spending are nonlinear and even nonmonotonic over the range of county-level BTOP spending in the data. Controlling for trends to reduce the potential for spurious correlation between spending and outcomes removes most of the significance of the results. We conclude with three lessons for policy-makers derived from the uncertain outcomes of BTOP spending found in our exploration.","[Hauge, J.

However, extant literature on firm's technology innovation usually assumes that the R&D outcome is certain, which does not hold in many real-world situations. To fill this gap, this paper investigates an innovating firm's licensing strategy in a differentiated Cournot duopoly model when the firm is an insider and the R&D outcome is stochastic. We develop a duopoly game model in which the innovating firm has three options for licensing its innovation: fixed-fee licensing, royalty licensing and two-part tariff licensing. We consider three stages in the model: the R&D, licensing and output stages. We find that product differentiation and technology spillover play significant roles in the innovating firm's choice between fixed-fee and royalty licensing. In addition, regardless of the degree of product differentiation, we find that (1) two-part tariff licensing is superior to both fixed-fee and royalty licensing when technology spillover is low and that (2) two-part tariff licensing is equivalent to royalty licensing when technology spillover is high.","[Hong, Xianpei] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qiang] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Xu, Lei] Tianjin Univ Technol, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Meidute, Ieva] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Sydney; Tianjin University of Technology; University of Southern Denmark; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Hong, XP (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",xphong@mail.hzau.edu.cn; steven.lu@sydney.edu.au; chully.xu@gmail.com; gov@sam.sdu.dk; ieva.meidute@vgtu.lt,"Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/AAD-6877-2019; Govindan, Kannan/M-5996-2017","Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/0000-0003-0435-7632; Govindan, Kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196; xu, lei/0000-0003-2715-5056","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302005]; major Program of the National Social Science Fund of China [13, ZD147]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662014BQ048, 2662015PY176, 2662015QC050]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); major Program of the National Social Science Fund of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71302005), the major Program of the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 13&ZD147), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Nos. 2662014BQ048, 2662015PY176, 2662015QC050).",,36,4,4,3,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The research of internationalization strategy, firm attributes, product attributes and firm performance in a complex network can be helpful to further reveal the effect of an internationalization strategy on firm performance. Dynamic cluster analysis is performed to analyze the relationship between internationalization strategy and firm performance based on big data concerning interactions with firm attributes and product attributes. The complex network of internationalization strategy, firm attributes, product attributes and firm performance is analyzed in a 2-mode network. The relationship of internationalization strategy and finn performance, concerning the effects of firm attributes, are further tested by a path model, and the effect of an internationalization strategy on firm performance is further estimated. This research finds that an internationalization strategy has a positive relationship with firm performance, and an indirect positive effect through financial leverage. Also, the integral function of internationalization strategy on firm performance in the complex network is generally on an ascending trend.

A framework that features search frictions is developed. Households choose search intensities, and firms create vacancies. Workers accumulate skills through past work experience, or a process of learning-by-doing. This paper extends the learning-by-doing framework to consider endogenous skill loss by the unemployed, or a process of loss-of-learning-by-not-doing. An adverse aggregate technological shock induces workers to reduce their search intensity and firms to reduce their creation of vacancies. As unemployment increases, workers lose their accumulated skills. The skill obsolescence causes a decline in the future marginal productivity of workers. The decline in productivity causes a persistence in the cyclical downturn, and a delay in the recovery of the economy. This allows the model to capture the observed unemployment persistence.

Employers expect from employees not only high motivation, but as great engagement as possible in the completion of business objectives. Employees have been changing as well. The labour market is being entered by Generation Y, who as employees present a different approach to work and duties. This forces employers to focus greater attention and use a different approach in selecting motivational instruments and building engagement. The purpose of this article is to identify the problems related to building the engagement of employees of the youngest generation. The authors point out the specific qualities of Generation Y based on literature, mainly from western countries, and then, based on their own research involving 382 managers and 1505 Generation Y employees from 16 Polish enterprises, indicate the distinguishing characteristics of the youngest employees. The research shows that according to the self-evaluation of Generation Y employees and the manager's opinion the level of engagement of the youngest employees is not significantly different from their older co-workers, but the research confirms the dissimilarity of Generation Y interviewee's approach to work and tasks. It brings to their supervisors as well as human resources departments a new task to search for a new organizational solutions and ways of improving work conditions to support the engagement development of young employees.","[Kopertynska, Maria Wanda] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland; [Kmiotek, Krystyna] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Rzeszow University of Technology,"Kopertynska, MW (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,,"Kopertynska, Maria Wanda/0000-0003-4817-5945",,,,,17,3,3,0,30,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Such models have a limited usability because the lack of factors assessed in case of small and medium companies. In SMEs sector the company's crisis identification is specific because of the nature of SMEs business management which creates the strong dependability of business results on human resources and environmental factors. In this study the set of qualitative and quantitative factors is proposed to support the development of company's crisis identification models for SMEs. The proposed set of criteria allows identification of the real situation in the company regarding not only the financial statements but also a wide variety of factors related to company's management capabilities, competencies of human resources, possible impact of internal and external environmental factors and other important non-quantitative aspects. The prosed set of criteria might be used for the development of company's crisis identification model which would help to forecast the possible company's crisis in SMEs sector.","[Kurschus, Ralph-Jorn] Rechtsanwalte Insolvenzverwalter, DE-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Sarapovas, Tadas] ISM Univ Management & Econ, LT-01304 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Cvilikas, Aurelijus] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",ISM University of Management & Economics; Kaunas University of Technology,"Kurschus, RJ (通讯作者)，Rechtsanwalte Insolvenzverwalter, Schwedenstr 11, DE-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",ralph-joern-kurschus@zikura.de; tadsar@ism.lt; a.cvilikas@yahoo.com,,,,,,,32,6,11,5,35,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We study this issue in a setting where governments can set differentiated effective tax rates in an oligopolistic industry in which firms with two productivity levels co-exist. We show that the optimal structure of tax differentiation depends critically on the feasible level of the corporate profit tax, which in turn depends on the degree of international tax competition. When tax competition is weak and optimal profit tax rates are high, favoring high-productivity firms is indeed the optimal policy. When tax competition is aggressive and profit taxes are low, however, the optimal tax policy reverses and favors low-productivity firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The affiliation that we examine is where the brokerage firm has, on its board of directors, a director or an upper management individual from the firm which an analyst at the brokerage firm provides coverage. We find that affiliated analysts tend to provide earnings forecasts that are insignificantly different from unaffiliated analysts in terms of accuracy. However, we also find that forecasts provided by affiliated analysts tend to be significantly more pessimistic than those provided by their unaffiliated counterparts. This pessimistic bias in their earnings forecast will more easily allow the covered firm to beat earnings expectations when earnings are realized. We find that this bias surfaced after the Global Settlement decision, an enforcement agreement between large investment banks and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding issues surrounding conflicts of interest.","[Mathew, Prem G.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Business, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Yildirim, H.

The results indicate that a 1-point increase in the Corruption Perception Index (implying a decrease in corruption) results in a 2% to 7% increase in tourist inflows.

Unemployment behaviour in Croatia shows evidence of cyclo-stationarity caused by seasonal employment effects. We use 88 time series (variable) to explain observed fluctuations with our MSSA model explaining 76 % of the total unemployment variance comprehensively. Evidence of this study demonstrates that unemployment phenomena should be modelled by using a non-linear model with multivariate singular spectrum models giving more robust and empirically valid results in relation to standard modelling techniques.

Urban transport is typically an important expenditure item for households and structural change in these services may affect households differently depending on their position in the distribution of income and expenditure. We estimate the effects on household income groups of this structural change by applying a computable general equilibrium model incorporating microsimulation behaviour with top-down and bottom-up links. We compare estimates based on a pure microsimulation approach, a top-down approach and a hybrid top-down/bottom-up approach. We estimate small reductions in real income and small reductions in inequality; this pattern is largely replicated across regions.

Hence, financial market development has opposite regional implications as trade liberalization. While the former leads to more dispersion of economic activity across space, the latter tends to drive clustering.

By using a large database of German firms, we furthermore investigate for the first time the link between foreign ownership and access to finance in Germany, one of the world's leading target countries for FDI. We use newly available comprehensive panel data that we constructed from information collected by the German statistical offices and from credit rating scores supplied by the leading German credit rating agency. We find foreign-owned firms in German manufacturing on average to show slightly more financing restrictions than domestically owned enterprises, but this very small difference diminishes once unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account. We further demonstrate that one reason for this finding is the preference of foreign investors for targets with relatively low creditworthiness.

It investigates whether international openness limits the negative consequences of terrorism on economic growth. The analysis is focused on 120 developing countries over the period 1976-2008. The positive interaction effect of terrorism and globalization suggests that the latter ameliorates the adverse impact of the former on growth. I also identify the critical values of the globalization index where the negative effects of both domestic and transnational terrorism are offset by the positive impact of openness; this, however, happens at a significantly high level of openness. The findings are robust to using the disaggregated measure of globalization and some individual indicators of economic openness. The result helps explain why the growth consequences of terrorism vary across nations and hold important policy implications.","Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Younas, J (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",jyounas@aus.edu,,,American University of Sharjah's grant [FRG13-3-24 AY 2013-2014],American University of Sharjah's grant,This research was partially supported by American University of Sharjah's grant (FRG13-3-24 AY 2013-2014).,,39,12,12,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

However, one may reasonably agree that distributive value judgments should also account for the 'consequences' of economic inequalities in such a way as to (i) improve economic efficiency and (ii) prevent from subordination, exploitation and humiliation. In this way of thinking, by evoking the well-known Rawlsian 'Fair Equality of Opportunity' and 'Difference Principle', the author proposes a pragmatical non-parametric estimation strategy to compare income distributions in terms of Rawlsian inequity and its contribution to overall inequality. The latter methodology is applied to PSID data from 1999 to 2013 and compared with existing empirical evidences on Roemer's (A Pragmatic Theory of Responsibility for the Egalitarian Planner, 1993, and Equality of Opportunity, 1998) inequality of opportunity. Remarkably, Rawlsian inequity is found between 56% and 65% of the overall income inequality, with an increasing pattern originating from the recent economic crisis.","[Abatemarco, Antonio] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy",University of Salerno,"Abatemarco, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy.",aabatemarco@unisa.it,"Abatemarco, Antonio/AAE-9360-2020",,,,,,62,0,1,0,13,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,DEC 22,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,201633.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-33,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EF8RN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390597100001,0

LIML is an attractive alternative, especially when the many-instruments robust (MIR) standard errors are used as proposed by Bekker (1994). In this note we present an alternative approach to LIML through concentrated instrumental variables (CIV). This is a class of instrumental variables indexed by a single parameter. When this parameter belongs to a certain set, 2SLS estimators using CIV instruments, are many-instruments consistent. We refer to them as CIV estimators. Moreover, the usual expression for the asymptotic variance of IV estimators is many instruments consistent. One particular choice of CIV parameter, within this set, yields LIML. We thus get an alternative to the many-instruments robust (MIR) standard errors of Bekker (1994) that is of the usual simple IV form. As a byproduct, we present a new estimator, which we call the CIVE. This is a two-step estimator where the CIV parameter is based on 2SLS in the first step. It avoids LIML but is equally good to a very high degree. This suggests a simple MIR estimation strategy in an weak and many instruments setting: do 2SLS to obtain the CIV parameter, and then obtain the CIVE by another 2SLS step. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Its founders thought that countries would borrow from the Bank temporarily until they grew enough to borrow commercially. Some critiques and analyses of the Bank are based on the assumption that this continues to be its role. For example, some argue that the growth of private capital flows to the developing world has rendered the Bank irrelevant. However, we will argue that modern analyses should proceed from the premise that the World Bank's central goal is and should be to reduce extreme poverty, and that addressing failures in global capital markets is now of subsidiary importance. In this paper, we discuss what the Bank does: how it spends money, how it influences policy, and how it presents its mission. We argue that the role of the Bank is now best understood as facilitating international agreements to reduce poverty, and we examine implications of this perspective.","[Clemens, Michael A.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Clemens, Michael A.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Kremer, Michael] Harvard Univ, Developing Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kremer, Michael] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",IZA Institute Labor Economics; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Clemens, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,80,27,39,1,55,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The purpose of this paper is to study lead/lag interactions between workers' remittance outflows and macroeconomic leadingvariables in Saudi Arabia for 1980-2013 within a time frequency framework. To this end, we perform three wavelet variants, namely, the wavelet power spectrum, the cross-spectrum wavelet, and the coherence wavelet. We show that remittance outflows are strongly associated with the main Saudi aggregates and that their relationships change across time scale and frequency bands. In the short- and mid-term, real output growth and government expenditures, guide remittance outflows. More specifically, government expenditures positively affect remittance shares to real outputs. In addition, the wavelet analysis reveals a positive causality link from the active population to remittances over low-frequency bands. These outcomes have several prominent implications and point to practical recommendations in terms of monetary policy coordination and financial stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet the existing studies estimating these elasticities for emerging countries disregard the effects of tax reforms on tax revenue, which renders their estimates inconsistent. We introduce a framework for estimating both short- and long-run tax revenue elasticities using quarterly data adjusted for the effects of reforms. Our results suggest that the long-run elasticities in the Czech Republic are 1.4 for wage tax, 0.9 for value added tax, 1.7 for profit tax and 1 for social security contributions. The adjustment process for value added tax and social security contributions is fast, but for the remaining two categories, it is important to distinguish between the short- and long-run elasticities: the initial response of revenue to changes in the bases is weak.

An important focus is on the role that non-economic dimensions have in determining financial decision-making, in particular the physical and mental health of each partner, as well as their cognitive ability and personality traits. We find that increased employment and wages are positively associated with own decision-making responsibility in both cross-sectional and within-couple panel models, and that non-economic characteristics of couples are also important. Interestingly, we find that many results are sensitive to whether we use male or female reports of who is the decision-maker, suggesting that studies with information from only one person in the household need to consider that their results may be partially dependent upon the gender of the respondent.

This evidence has been used to argue that people respond to selfishness with anger, and get utility from punishing those who mistreat others. Elements of the standard 3PP experimental design, however, allow alternative explanations: it has been argued that 3PP could be motivated by envy (as selfish dictators earn high payoffs), or could be influenced by the use of the strategy method (which is known to influence second-party punishment). Here we test these alternatives by varying the third party's endowment and the use of the strategy method, and measuring punishment. We find that while third parties do report more envy when they have lower endowments, neither manipulation significantly affects punishment. We also show that punishment is associated with ratings of anger but not of envy. Thus, our results suggest that 3PP is not an artifact of self-focused envy or use of the strategy method. Instead, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 3PP is motivated by anger.","[Jordan, Jillian; McAuliffe, Katherine; Rand, David] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, 1 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [McAuliffe, Katherine] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Rand, David] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Rand, David] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University; Boston College; Yale University; Yale University,"Jordan, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, 1 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",jillian.jordan@yale.edu,"Rand, David G./B-3716-2009","McAuliffe, Katherine/0000-0002-4230-0250",John Templeton Foundation,John Templeton Foundation,"We thank Gordon Kraft-Todd for assistance running the experiments, and gratefully acknowledge funding from the John Templeton Foundation.",,41,57,63,4,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Sri Lanka, the first country in South Asia which undertook trade reforms more than three decades ago, is taken as a case in point in this study. The paper analyses the effects of trade liberalisation on income distribution and poverty in the urban, rural and estate sectors in Sri Lanka using the first ever microsimulation model built for the country in combination with a multi-household computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results reveal that without any fiscal policy adjustments a 100% tariff cut would lead to an increase in economic growth and a reduction in poverty incidence both in the short run as well as in the long run. However, when the tariff cut combined with the fiscal policy adjustments to maintain the budget neutrality, poverty outcomes showed mixed results. In contrast, results show that trade liberalisation increases the income inequality in Sri Lanka. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The standard network flow problem is amended by certain constraints specific to copulas, which limit scalability of the problem. However, we show in dimensions as high as twenty that the new approach dominates the alternatives which usually require recursive estimation or full enumeration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
