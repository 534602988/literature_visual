Specifically, we distill the results of several decades of research analysing the relationship between major asset classes (common stocks, gold, fixed income securities, real estate) and inflation. Even though previous studies have brought forth important facts characterising the interplay of asset returns and inflation rates (e.g., time-dependency, asymmetry, outlier-sensitivity and a tendency towards long-term but limited short-term inflation protection), there is still no consensus on the subject because sample, data and methodology issues preclude strict comparison of most studies. Thus, from a synthesis of the insights gained from our review, we also outline possible directions for future research that may help to establish consensus among researchers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed approach follows the general idea of linearly combining selected performance measures with positive weights and combination weights are determined by means of an optimisation step. The underlying criterion function takes into account the risk-return trade-off potentially associated with the equity screens, evaluated on a historical and rolling basis. By construction, performance combination weights can vary over time, allowing for changes in preferences across performance measures. An empirical example shows the benefits of our approach compared to naive screening rules based on the Sharpe ratio. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper identifies international contagion in banking during the 2007-2009 crisis for 54 economies. We identify three channels of contagion - systematic, idiosyncratic and volatility - and find evidence for these in 45 countries. Banking crises are overwhelmingly associated with the presence of both systematic and idiosyncratic contagion. The results reveal that crisis shocks transmitted from a foreign jurisdiction via idiosyncratic contagion increase the likelihood of a systemic crisis in the domestic banking system by almost 37 percent, whereas increased exposure via systematic contagion does not necessarily destabilize the domestic banking system. Thus while policy makers and regulatory authorities are rightly concerned with the systematic transmission of banking crises, reducing the potential for idiosyncratic contagion can importantly reduce the consequences for the domestic economy.

As it involves competitiveness, companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge - many times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when assessing the opportunity of extending the business - therefore the need for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of implementing them. This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the opportunity of opening two new business lines.","[Fulea, Mircea; Sandru, Gabriela; Brad, Stelian] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Maftei, Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Fulea, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",mircea.fulea@staff.utcluj.ro,"Brad, Stelian/ABC-7027-2020; Fulea, Mircea/N-9742-2018; Maftei, Mihaela/A-8074-2019","Fulea, Mircea/0000-0001-9640-6379; Maftei, Mihaela/0000-0002-5363-9938",[PPN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4-1319 innDrive],,Support within the project PPN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4-1319 innDrive is acknowledged with gratitude.,,17,1,1,1,31,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1198,1212,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300007,0

Growing coffee in the shade is more costly, but yields a price premium. This paper analyzes the effects of such restrictions in a general equilibrium setting and shows that such policies may have unanticipated effects. It is shown that in a world with capital mobility, the GSP could result in capital outflows rather than inflows and consumer preferences for shade grown coffee end up hurting labor in developing countries. Even small subsidies that are contingent on the use of domestic intermediates can result in specialization in the targeted good.

While in developed countries, the propensity to commute long distances generally originates from the preference to work in the core of the city and live in the suburb or periphery, in developing countries, the trend is often quite the opposite. For example, in Bangladesh, people generally have a strong preference to live at the heart of the major cities even if they work at the peripheral areas of the city, in another city or in a rural area. Further, it is also not uncommon to maintain split-families where the earning member of the family lives near the workplace while the rest of the family is based in a big city (subject to affordability). These phenomena lead to substantial increase in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and add burden to the transport infrastructure. The focus of the research is to explore the key factors that induce middle and upper-middle class commuters in Bangladesh to live away from their workplace and/or maintain split-families. A case study is conducted using Stated Preference (SP) surveys conducted among the faculty members of two universities: one located at the periphery of the capital city and the other quite far away. Discrete Choice Models are developed using the collected data. Results reveal that albeit some differences, for both cases, the choices are strongly driven by quality of the education institutes and the house rent. Factors like gender, income and car-ownership, which traditionally play a strong role in the context of developed countries, are found to be of less significance. The models, though estimated with limited data, provide useful insights about the factors that drive residential location choices in the context of a developing country and can help in formulating policies for encouraging people to live closer to their workplaces and thereby reduce commuter VMT.

Many existing methodologies from social and physical sciences need to be deployed, and new modelling techniques and ideas still need to be developed. Existing bread-and-butter micro-and macroeconomic tools, such as the expected utility framework, market equilibrium concepts and representative agent assumptions, are far from adequate. Four key issues-along with several others-remain inadequately addressed by economic models of climate change, namely: (1) uncertainty, (2) aggregation, heterogeneity and distributional implications (3) technological change, and most of all, (4) realistic damage functions for the economic impact of the physical consequences of climate change. This paper assesses the main shortcomings of two generations of climate-energy-economic models and proposes that a new wave of models need to be developed to tackle these four challenges. This paper then examines two potential candidate approaches-dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models and agent-based models (ABM). The successful use of agent-based models in other areas, such as in modelling the financial system, housing markets and technological progress suggests its potential applicability to better modelling the economics of climate change.","[Farmer, J.

Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among overpriced stocks.","[Stambaugh, Robert F.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Stambaugh, Robert F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yu, Jianfeng] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Yu, Jianfeng] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Adv Inst Finance, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yu] Univ Penn, Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Tsinghua University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Pennsylvania,"Stambaugh, RF (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,"Yuan, Yu/0000-0001-7370-8446",,,,,118,419,466,31,297,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

In the model, a jump in one region of the world increases the intensity of jumps both in the same region (self-excitation) as well as in other regions (cross-excitation), generating episodes of highly clustered jumps across world markets that mimic the observed features of the data. We develop and implement moment-based estimation and testing procedures for this model. The estimates provide evidence of self-excitation both in the US and the other world markets, and of asymmetric cross-excitation, with the US market typically having more influence on the jump intensity of other markets than the reverse. We propose filtered values of the jump intensities as a measure of market stress and examine their out-of-sample forecasting abilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The differential deductibility of debt entailed by various current tax law provisions leads to potential distortions in the patterns of asset ownership across MNCs and various proposed solutions have significant limitations. We suggest alternative regimes - a worldwide debt cap (WDC) and a net financing deduction (NFD) - to address the ownership distortions that we highlight along with other well-established problems of income-shifting through debt. These alternative regimes are extensions to a multinational setting of two general approaches to the neutral treatment of interest expenses - the CBIT (comprehensive business income tax) and ACC (allowance for corporate capital). While these regimes provide solutions to ownership distortions and to problems of base erosion and profit shifting, they have the potential disadvantage of restricting other policy parameters.","[Desai, Mihir A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Desai, Mihir A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dharmapala, Dhammika] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"Desai, MA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mdesai@hbs.edu; dharmap@uchicago.edu,"Dharmapala, Dhammika/GPF-9205-2022","Dharmapala, Dhammika/0000-0001-9858-0565",,,,,41,6,7,0,15,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

It consists of three arrows: unconventional monetary policy (the first arrow), expansionary fiscal policy (the second arrow), and economic growth strategies to encourage private investment (the third arrow). After the new regime started, both the stock and the foreign exchange markets reacted very favorably. The purpose of this paper is to investigate why the markets reacted to the new regime so favorably. Unlike orthodox arguments, we focus on asymmetric behavior between local and foreign investors after December 2012. We show that under the new regime, foreign investors were aggressive in purchasing Japanese stocks and in selling the Japanese yen, while local investors were not. By using high frequency intra-daily data, both structural break tests and regression analysis show that various news shocks had more significant impacts on the stock prices and exchange rates in nighttime than in daytime even if they were revealed in daytime. Noting that local investors tend to trade in daytime, while foreign investors tend to trade in nighttime, this implies that more dramatic market responses to the new regime happened in time zones when foreign investors were active. However, the asymmetry became less significant after the market crash on May 23, 2013. Faculty of Economics, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our approach differs from McMillen's insofar as our goal is to explain the variation in housing prices at a point in time rather than over a period of time. The basic statistic used to summarise house price distribution is the Gini index, which compares the actual distribution of the price per square metre (PPSM) with a uniform distribution. We decompose the Gini index into what can be explained for by the explanatory variables (which can also be easily decomposed into the contribution of each explanatory variable) and what remained unexplained. With a data set that includes appraisal values for 9297 dwellings in Barcelona in 1998-2001, the part explained by the standard OLS slopes (up to 60%) suggests a high degree of homogeneity in the linkage between PPSM and the explanatory variables. In any event, when heterogeneity is introduced using a quantile approach, that part of the Gini index explained for by the regressors falls. Finally, the variable that produces the most heterogeneity is area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Grant, LE; Potoski, M",,,,"Grant, Laura E.; Potoski, Matthew",,,Collective Reputations Affect Donations to Nonprofits,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,QUALITY DISCLOSURE; PROGRAMS; POLICY,"Maintaining their organization's reputation is an important challenge for nonprofit managers. Organizations are often linked via a common reputation within their industry or sector such that publicity about one organization can spill over to affect how stakeholders view its peers. The linkages of common reputations may be particularly pronounced among nonprofits because important dimensions of their quality are difficult to observe directly. In this paper, we show that when the third-party evaluator Charity Navigator rates nonprofits and displays ratings of their peers, it creates a collective reputation among groups of nonprofits performing similar functions in the same region. Through an analysis of 3,413 charities from 1993 through 2008, we find that donations to nonprofits rated by Charity Navigator rise and fall with the published Charity Navigator ratings of their peers. The effect appears to be due to the charity updating fundraising choices in response to the ratings rather than donor reactions. The presence of collective reputations has important implications for nonprofit management, such as collective self-regulation programs.

While both types of intermediaries create safe money-like claims, they go about this in different ways. Traditional banks create money-like claims by holding illiquid fixed-income assets to maturity, and they rely on deposit insurance and costly equity capital to support this strategy. This strategy allows bank depositors to remain sleepy: they do not have to pay attention to transient fluctuations in the market value of bank assets. In contrast, shadow banks create money-like claims by giving their investors an early exit option requiring the rapid liquidation of assets. Thus, traditional banks have a stable source of funding, while shadow banks are subject to runs and fire-sale losses. In equilibrium, traditional banks have a comparative advantage at holding fixed-income assets that have only modest fundamental risk but are illiquid and have substantial transitory price volatility, whereas shadow banks tend to hold relatively liquid assets.

Our results demonstrate first that the asymmetric effect exists, that is, firms adjust their capital structure when ratings are downgraded, but do not significantly adjust their leverage ratios when ratings are upgraded. Second, capital structure adjusts faster in countries with better financial development and strong legal and institutional environments than in weak ones, regardless of the upgraded and downgraded rating changes. Hence, the financial development and legal and institutional environments are more crucial in affecting the leverage ratio adjustments than the rating change directions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While a significant literature has investigated the calorie-income elasticity abstracting from production, this paper provides an empirical application of the nonseparable household model linking the effect of exogenous variation in planting season production decisions via climate variability on household dietary diversity. Using degree days, rainfall and agricultural capital stocks as instruments, the effect of production on household dietary diversity at harvest is estimated. The empirical specifications estimate production effects on dietary diversity using both agricultural revenue and crop production diversity. Significant effects of both agricultural revenue and crop production diversity on dietary diversity are estimated. The dietary diversity-production elasticities imply that a 10 per cent increase in agricultural revenue or crop diversity result in a 1.8 per cent or 2.4 per cent increase in dietary diversity respectively. These results illustrate that agricultural income growth or increased crop diversity may not be sufficient to ensure improved dietary diversity. Increases in agricultural revenue do change diet composition. Estimates of the effect of agricultural income on share of calories by food groups indicate relatively large changes in diet composition. On average, a 10 per cent increase in agricultural revenue makes households 7.2 per cent more likely to consume vegetables, 3.5 per cent more likely to consume fish, and increases the share of tubers consumed by 5.2 per cent.","[Dillon, Andrew] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Mcgee, Kevin; Oseni, Gbemisola] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Michigan State University; The World Bank,"Dillon, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",dillona6@anr.msu.edu,,,,,,,29,93,106,4,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

To address this question, we propose and analyze a variant of the well-studied -maxmin model in decision theory. In our framework, and consistent to the paper's empirical focus on renewable-energy R&D investment, experts' subjective probability distributions are allowed to be action-dependent. In addition, the decision maker constrains the sets of priors to be considered via a parsimonious measure of their distance to a benchmark average distribution that grants equal weight to all experts. While our model is formally rooted in the decision-theoretic framework of Olszewski (Rev Econ Stud 74:567-595, 2007), it may also be viewed as a structured form of sensitivity analysis. We apply our framework to original data from a recent expert elicitation survey on solar energy.

Using a meta-analysis, the present paper synthesizes prior literature regarding the CE-performance relationship of 43 independent samples including 13,237 firms. Our results reveal that strategic renewal, innovation and corporate venturing positively influence overall, subjective and objective firm performance. In addition, we conduct moderator analyses to reflect on the context and to verify whether and how the relationships vary in the presence of several study-specific factors. We find that innovation has a stronger effect on performance in high-tech as opposed to low-tech industries, and the association between corporate venturing and performance is the strongest in Europe (compared with North America and Asia). Against our theoretical predictions, we find the association between strategic renewal and performance to be stronger for larger than for smaller firms. Based on our results, we derive recommendations for future research and point to managerial implications.","[Bierwerth, Michael; Isidor, Rodrigo; Kabst, Rudiger] Univ Paderborn, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Chair Int Business, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Schwens, Christian] Univ Duesseldorf, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Chair Management, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Schwens, C (通讯作者)，Univ Duesseldorf, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Chair Management, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",christian.schwens@hhu.de,"Schwens, Christian/ABF-9496-2021","Schwens, Christian/0000-0002-4576-5520",,,,,120,115,132,8,193,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper considers the consequences of bank competition on credit constraints using firm level data covering 69 developing and emerging countries. In addition to the classical concentration measure, competition is assessed by computing three non-structural measures (Boone indicator, Lerner index and H-statistic). The results show that bank competition alleviates credit constraints and that bank concentration measure is not a robust predictor of a firm's access to finance. The study highlights that bank competition not only leads to less severe loan approval decisions but also reduces borrower discouragement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I test this prediction by examining the connection between takeover returns and board friendliness, using social ties between the CEO and board members as a proxy for less independent boards. I find that social ties are associated with higher bidder announcement returns when the potential value of board advice is high, but with lower returns when monitoring needs are high.

Using a number of financial, market, corporate governance, macro-economic and other indicators as explanatory variables, we compare classifiers ranging from conventional techniques (such as logit/probit and LDA) to fully nonlinear classifiers, including neural networks, support vector machines and more recent statistical learning techniques such as generalised boosting, AdaBoost and random forests. We find that the newer classifiers significantly outperform all other classifiers on both the cross sectional and longitudinal test samples; and prove remarkably robust to different data structures and assumptions. Simple linear classifiers such as logit/probit and LDA are found nonetheless to predict quite accurately on the test samples, in some cases performing comparably well to more flexible model structures. We conclude that simpler classifiers can be viable alternatives to more sophisticated approaches, particularly if interpretability is an important objective of the modelling exercise.

Using a process of expanding window regressions where the in-sample start period expands (backward recursion) we conduct forecasts over twenty-three international markets, including both developed and emerging.

To achieve a desired accuracy level, the least-squares Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the values of American gold futures options. Our empirical and numerical results based on actual market data are provided to illustrate the importance of incorporating state-dependent jump risks when pricing American put options on gold futures.

Price premiums are highest for medium-size gated communities. Premiums were also evident in higher priced gated communities before 2008 but vanished after the financial crisis. Gated communities offer homeowners additional attributes but usually have higher infrastructure and service costs.

We think of parties as heterogeneous groups of individuals who aim to implement a set of policies but who differ in their priorities. When party heterogeneity is too great, parties are in danger of splitting into smaller yet more homogeneous political groups. In this context we argue that primaries can have a unifying role if the party elite cannot commit to policy concessions. Our model shows how three factors interact to create incentives for the adoption of primary elections, namely (1) the alignment in the preferred policies of various factions within a party, (2) the relative weight of each of these factions and (3) the electoral system. We discuss the existing empirical literature and demonstrate how existing studies can be improved in light of our theoretical predictions to provide a new, structured perspective on the adoption of primary elections.","[Hortala-Vallve, Rafael] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Mueller, Hannes] Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Hortala-Vallve, R (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.hortala-vallve@lse.ac.uk,"Mueller, Hannes/ABC-1470-2020","Mueller, Hannes/0000-0001-7667-3971",Juan de la Cierva programme,Juan de la Cierva programme,"We thank Stephen Ansolabehere, Fernando Aragon, Torun Dewan, Simon Hix, Michael Laver, Massimo Morelli, Hande Mutlu-Eren, Gilles Serra, Kenneth Shepsle, participants of the APSA 2010 Annual Meetings and seminar participants at the London School of Economics and Universitat Autonoma of Barcelona for helpful comments and discussions.

Validated psychiatric symptom scores are seldom used for non-clinical reasons. One prevalent symptom that deserves our interest is Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by inattentiveness and hyperactivity that has been linked to occupational choice and performance. Building on the person-environment fit literature, we hypothesize that individuals who exhibit behavior associated with ADHD are more likely to have entrepreneurial intentions. Using a sample of 10,104 students enrolled in higher education, we can confirm our prediction that students with a higher level of ADHD-like behavior are more likely to have entrepreneurial intentions. Additionally, we show that risk taking propensity is a mediator that partly explains this positive effect. Our study points to the importance of behavioral tendencies associated with developmental disorders, when making entrepreneurship decisions. Our study contributes to the literature on the determinants of entrepreneurship, which so far has largely neglected the effects of psychiatric symptoms on entrepreneurship.","[Verheul, Ingrid; Burmeister-Lamp, Katrin; Turturea, Roxana] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Block, Joern] Univ Trier, Trier, Germany; [Block, Joern] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Thurik, Roy] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Thurik, Roy] Panteia BV, Zoetermeer, Netherlands; [Thurik, Roy] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, Netherlands; [Tiemeier, Henning] Erasmus Univ, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Erasmus Med Ctr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Tiemeier, Henning] Erasmus Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Erasmus Med Ctr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Verheul, I (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",iverheul@rsm.nl; block@uni-trier.de; kburmeister@rsm.nl; thurik@ese.eur.nl; h.tiemeier@erasmusmc.nl; rturturea@rsm.nl,"Thurik, Roy/A-9386-2012; Tiemeier, Henning/H-6534-2019; Block, Joern/K-2208-2016","Thurik, Roy/0000-0002-0242-6908; Tiemeier, Henning/0000-0002-4395-1397; Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346",Panteia BV Zoetermeer; Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship (ECE),Panteia BV Zoetermeer; Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship (ECE),"The authors are grateful for participating in the international GUESSS project initiated and coordinated by Philipp Sieger and his colleagues of University of St. Gallen, Switzerland.

The objective of the research was to identify the degree of usage, the willingness of the Romanian people to use codes in the buying process and also their perception about the functionality and usefulness of the codes. This is a pioneering work for the Romanian literature, because there aren't other studies that explore issues concerning the use of QR codes in the buying process.

In contrast, our results suggest that SDFs as functions of individual stock returns are generally downward sloping. A simple jump-diffusion model can reconcile these empirical findings. The same model also implies a steeper implied-volatility curve for the index than for the typical stock, a well-known empirical fact from the options literature. Both the SDF and volatility-curve results can be explained by a common source of jump risk among stocks, together with diversification of Brownian risk in the index. We also devise novel empirical tests of SDF monotonicity based on average returns of option trading strategies, thus avoiding the estimation of the return density functions.","[Chaudhuri, Ranadeb] Oakland Univ, Rochester, MI 48309 USA; [Schroder, Mark] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Oakland University; Michigan State University,"Chaudhuri, R (通讯作者)，Oakland Univ, Sch Business Adm, Rochester, MI 48309 USA.",chaudhur@oakland.edu,,,,,,,56,14,17,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The estimated credit limit volatility is larger than most estimates of income volatility and varies over the business cycle. Within a model, variable credit limits create a reason for households to hold both high interest debts and low interest savings at the same time. Using the estimated credit volatility, the model explains why around one third of American households engage in this credit card puzzle. The approach also offers an important new channel through which financial system uncertainty can affect household decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Investor flows into and out of CLNs are passed to and withdrawn from the futures markets via issuers' trades to hedge their CLN liabilities. The flows are not based on information about futures price movements but nonetheless cause increases and decreases in commodity futures prices when they are passed through to and withdrawn from the futures markets.

They reduce their first year's profits through discretionary expenses, blame the bad outcome on their predecessors, lower the performance benchmark, and save income for subsequent accounting periods. Identifying such an earnings bath for incoming CEOs in banks requires us to disentangle under-provisioning, which may have triggered the turnover event, and the earnings bath. For a sample of German savings banks over the period 1993-2012, we find that incoming CEOs increase discretionary expenses and that this increase is stronger for incoming CEOs from outside the bank than for insiders. We further show that CEOs coming from outside increase discretionary expenses during their first year in charge even if the default risk of the bank is low and the stock of risk provisions relative to risk exposure is high. Therefore, we conclude that the effects are only partially driven by incoming CEOs who rectify discretionary expenses by insufficient existing risk provisions, and that big bath accounting plays an important role in explaining discretionary expenses during CEO turnovers.

In this paper, we try to shed some light on this issue by using National Transfer Accounts (NTA). We estimate the NTA for 2008 and compare them with the obtained previously for 2000 (Patxot et al., 2011a), obtaining interesting conclusions. The aggregated lifecycle deficit - difference between consumption and labour income - has increased from 8.8% of GDP in 2000 to 10.1% in 2008. The aggregated LCD evolution is driven on the one hand by the change in per capita profiles and, on the other hand by the change in population age structure. Along the observed period, the effect of population has been quite positive, due to the effect of migration, so that the economic support ratio has increased. In absence of population changes, LCD would have increased 2 percentage more points in terms of GDP. Nevertheless, the positive effect of population age structure is ending and the opposite effect is expected for the next decades with the baby boom retirement. Hence, our conclusion is that the levels of labour income and consumption by age observed in 2008 are not sustainable in the coming decades. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The adverse demand shock of 2008-2009 led to a severe recession in the United States and Europe. Monetary policy could be greatly improved with a regime of targeting the forecast, or setting policy so that the expected growth in nominal GDP is equal to the central bank's target growth rate. This goal could be accomplished by setting up a nominal GDP prediction market and then adjusting the monetary base to stabilize nominal GDP futures prices. The market, not central banks, would set the level of the monetary base and short-term interest rates under this sort of policy regime. Modest adjustments in such a regime could address many previous criticisms of futures targeting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The introduction of the West German welfare system was accompanied by mortality reductions, particularly for older East Germans. We use this natural experiment to investigate to what extent increased public social security transfers contributed to the rise in life expectancy. We find that every euro invested in East German pensions and health care yielded on average three hours of additional life expectancy. The rise in public spending was particularly beneficial for older age groups. Investments in health care were more beneficial for reducing all-cause mortality in the East. Still, investments in pensions were important for closing the life expectancy gap to West Germany. Our results suggest that public policy measures geared toward equalizing living standards can also help to narrow mortality differentials. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One important explanation for changing fiscal policies is the increasing economic and political role played by the growing middle class in shaping the level and quality of collective goods and services and the types of taxes and relative tax burdens to fund these expenditures.

We apply the model to assess the potential environmental impacts of road development in the country. Results indicate that an ongoing plan for road network expansion in the country would cause a reduction of more than 2 % in the existing forest resources, an increase of about 16 % in the current agricultural land, and a total loss of carbon stock estimated to be 316 TgC. The DRC government should consider forest protection a priority as road development is promoted. A plan for agricultural intensification could be safely pursued if coupled with necessary resources to prevent deforestation.","[Li, Man; De Pinto, Alessandro; Ulimwengu, John M.; You, Liangzhi; Robertson, Richard D.] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Li, M (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",man.li@cgiar.org,"WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; Li, Man/D-5714-2018","Li, Man/0000-0003-4296-4097; You, Liangzhi/0000-0001-7930-8814; De Pinto, Alex/0000-0003-0327-494X",United Stated Agency for International Development,United Stated Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors are indebted to Heidi J.

A new, specifically tailored measure of the Economic Value Added approach, based on the shadow price of equity, is developed in order to account for specific characteristics of the Japanese banking system. This new shareholder value measure is then used in a dynamic panel data model as a linear function of various bank-risk, bank-specific, and macroeconomic variables. This study finds that cost efficiency gains, credit risk and bank size are the most important factors in explaining the shareholder value creation in Japanese banking. Cost efficiency changes are also found to significantly influence cost of equity capital. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Investigations were performed to determine how climatic variability influences irrigation and whether this adaptive measure actually reduces producers' vulnerability to climate change. We used a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for the heterogeneity in the decision of whether to use adaptive measures. We compared the expected land values under the actual and counterfactual cases of farm households that either adapt or do not adapt to climate change. Simulation results show that irrigation can be an effective tool for counteracting the harmful effects of climate change. The income of farmers tends to increase on lands where irrigation technologies are practiced. These conclusions confirm the need to invest in adaptation strategies to prepare Brazil for coping with the adverse effects of global climate change.,"[Da Cunha, Denis Antonio; Coelho, Alexandre Braganca] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Rural Econ, Ave PH Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"Da Cunha, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Rural Econ, Ave PH Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",denis.cunha@ufv.br; acoelho@ufv.br; jose.feres@ipea.gov.br,"Feres, Jose/C-4139-2013; Coelho, Alexandre B/F-2418-2014; da Cunha, Dênis Antônio/L-6029-2013; da Cunha, Dênis Antônio/ABI-7436-2020","Coelho, Alexandre B/0000-0002-9735-7035; da Cunha, Dênis Antônio/0000-0003-4838-3795",LACEEP (Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Program); FAPEMIG (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais),LACEEP (Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Program); FAPEMIG (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),"Thanks are due to LACEEP (Latin American and Caribbean Environmental Program) and FAPEMIG (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais) for the scholarships to D.A.

The research used semi-structured interviews with 39 venture capitalists and experts. The results show that venture capitalists prefer to invest in companies which develop products for treating and diagnosing diseases showing a high prevalence and large market volumes, such as cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological diseases, and orthopaedic disorders. The study confirms that venture capitalists use a number of industry-specific criteria highly relevant in a changing business environment.

The impact of business models on bank stability,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Banks; Risk-taking; Business model; Non-interest income; Non-deposit funding,DIVERSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; INCOME; SIZE; MERGERS; FIRMS; GMM,"In this paper, we analyze the impact of business models on bank stability in 15 EU countries between 2002 and 2011. We represent banks' business models by the share of non-interest income in total operating income and the share of non-deposit funding in total liabilities. In contrast to the literature, we include in our sample a large number of unlisted banks, which represent the majority of banks in the EU. We believe this to be important, since many unlisted banks typically have a more retail-oriented business model. We show that banks will be significantly more stable and profitable if they increase their share of non-interest income, indicating that substantial benefits are to be gained from income diversification. Such benefits are particularly large for savings and cooperative banks. Investment banks, in contrast, become significantly more risky. Diversifying into non-deposit funding has a different impact as well. While retail-oriented banks will be significantly less stable if they increase their share of non-deposit funding, investment banks will be significantly more stable. These findings indicate that it is important to enlarge the sample of banks and to include different types of banks with different business models in order to arrive at general conclusions about the effect of non-interest income and non-deposit funding on bank stability.

Resolving insolvent banks can positively affect the real economy by overcoming moral hazard problems and improving banks' credit allocation and monitoring. We propose a new indicator to measure the strength of 'catharsis', i.e., how strictly banks are resolved, and use a large firm-level dataset to test its effect. We find that a relatively stronger implementation of bank resolution rules has a statistically and economically significant positive effect on firm growth - particularly with respect to firms that are structurally more dependent on bank financing. Our findings are robust to various specifications. Investigating the transmission channels of this 'catharsis effect' reveals that it essentially works by means of benefiting higher quality firms (quality channel) and reallocating credit to firms that need it most (quantity channel). Additional analysis suggests that the 'catharsis effect' works best in banking systems that offer access to international financing because such access mitigates the potentially negative credit supply effects of liquidating insolvent banks. Taken together, our findings indicate that more attention should be focused on developing incentive-compatible bank resolution regimes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997-2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Women earned about 30% less than men, in both paid work and self-employment. The explained gap accounts for only about a quarter of the gap in paid work but for about half of the gap in self-employment. When the decomposition is made across the earnings distribution, the total gap decreases with earnings in both paid work and self-employment, and both conditional and unconditional on characteristics. In both employment sectors, the explained gap remains similar across the distribution, and therefore the unexplained gap drives the decrease in the total gap.

Demand estimation can be defined as a process that involves coming up with an estimate of the amount of end use demand for a product or service. Companies use demand estimation techniques for various reasons. One of the reasons that businesses use demand estimation is to determining the production amount in a certain period of time and accordingly keep the inventory level under control. An additional consideration is to assist with pricing. Decision maker's uses various techniques for demand estimation. One of the techniques is using the earlier period data and the other is utilizing the test markets which are similar to larger targeted markets. In this paper, we resort to Bayesian approach for demand estimation and utilized the textile products export data which belongs to years between 2002 and 2014. In Bayesian analysis the new information is combined with the previously available information. At this point the prior information (distribution) corresponds to the historical data or the subjective thought of the decision maker about the unknown parameter of the involved process. The performance of the following updates depends on the prior information therefore the determination of prior information is significant.

Organizations take very different approaches to build quality work culture. For some organizations, quality work culture has never mattered most. But in some organizations, quality work culture is crucial to ensure the employees served a better service to the customers. The purpose of this study is to identify which leadership style creates quality work culture at financial institution. Data collected through survey and direct interviews with several executives in order to gain accurate information. The respondents were chosen among employees from first line managers up to top management. Bass and Avolio's (1995), Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ Form 5X) was used to measure leadership styles and questions on quality work culture adopted from Geri McKeown. In addition, IFE matrix was applied to determine current work culture in the financial institutions. Findings revealed that transactional leadership had greatest influence towards quality work culture. A strong quality work culture may due to number of years the financial institutions existed in the industry. This statement was supported by a strong correlation between quality work culture and leadership styles. The strong significant relationship between leadership style and quality work culture clearly shows that transactional leadership style possessed by majority of leaders influence the level of quality work culture. The paper is hoped to contribute towards improving the quality work culture by identifying the prominent leadership style practiced by financial institutions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The fee is assessed in relation to tax revenue and total income of selected municipalities. These municipalities are divided into six categories according to the size and the number of inhabitants in particular municipality.

The calculations in all model examples were made for 4 average real annual interest rates and for 4 standardised income levels. The income replacement rates of the examined individuals were compared with the existing PAYG and with a hypothetical balanced PAYG. The aim was to determine the minimum rate of the pension funds' appreciation from which the transition to the FF would be profitable for all examined individuals. The article also attempts to identify the duration of the transition period, the moment after which the FF would become budget-neutral, and the approximate cost of the transition process.","[Brabec, Petr; Kubelkova, Karina] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Brabec, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",petr.brabec@vse.cz; karina.kubelkova@vse.cz,"Kubelková, Karina/C-2671-2019","Kubelková, Karina/0000-0001-7261-2469",,,,,18,0,0,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Our model predicts that public banks provide more loans to the real sector during times of crisis, compared to private banks which cut down on lending and increase liquidity holdings. We put forth three reasons for this heterogeneous behavior. First, the objective of public banks, in contrast to their private peers, is not only to maximize profits given risks, but also to stabilize and promote the recovery of the economy. Second, public banks may suffer less deposit withdrawals or avoid a bank run in a severe crisis, because the state has better access to additional funds making a recapitalization more likely. And finally, public banks may suffer less deposit withdrawals due to their higher credibility in promising a future recapitalization in the case of a severe crisis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The reform converts the shares owned by controlling shareholders from non-tradable to tradable shares. The removal of such market friction allows for a better alignment of interests between controlling and minority shareholders, which gives managers more incentives to improve corporate performance. We find that the pay-for-performance sensitivity improves greatly after the reform. Changes in the pay-for-performance sensitivity are also associated with firm ownership structure, the level of agency conflicts and governance quality. Given that firms with controlling shareholders are the dominant form of business organization in many countries around the world, our results have important implications in that they show that a better alignment between controlling and minority shareholders' incentives has a significant effect on executive compensation.

In this regard, we manage to distinguish between different types of government spending (namely: government investment, government wage component consumption and non-wage component consumption) where each type of spending has a varied role in the economy. The government wage increase has the largest positive effect both on private consumption and output by affecting the economy through the government production. This is a natural consequence of government production being complementary to private consumption in our model. Other two government spending types, namely government non-wage consumption and government investment, also have positive effects on output, whereas their responses on (private) consumption are mostly negative. These results provide an alternative explanation for the wide range of multipliers existing in the literature as our setup enables them to produce different effects on macroeconomic variables.","[Cortuk, Orcan] Cent Secur Depository Turkey, MKK, Istanbul, Turkey; [Guler, Mustafa Haluk] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Guler, MH (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey.",Haluk.guler@tcmb.gov.tr,,"Cortuk, Orcan/0000-0001-7589-1977",,,,,40,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The growth strategy Europe 2020 encourages the EU to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive place where innovation supports inclusion, even within the sphere of agriculture and CAP addresses, farmers. Czech organic farmers and their Websites were tested in 2014 and in 2015 to assess their commitment to the Agricultural policy and law in the light of the recent scientific literature. The assessment of data was done while focusing on the attitude of Czech organic farmers and their Websites and how they reflect the agricultural policy and law. A battery of qualitative as well quantitative strategies was employed, along with Meta-Analysis processing. The evaluation was performed from various angles, relying on quantitative, rather than qualitative, methods, more on induction than deduction attempting to move to scientific objectification. The selected criteria targeted the domain names and Websites' content and interconnectivity, friendliness and the capacity to carry out various policies and tasks. Hypotheses were tested and casuistic observations were added. The result offers new insights in the unjustly underplayed arena, with a strong potential to contribute to a flourishing agribusiness. Although the semi-conclusions are yielded from a micro-sample, their homogeneity, direct feedback and back-up by published data suggest that Czech organic farmers understand the CAP and IS/IT, but they remain non-committal. Their Websites suggest their awareness about Agricultural policy and law and IS/IT and their low interest to get actively engaged. Due to the restricted sample, a further search and studies need to be done to analyze this asymmetry and to correct it to enhance the efficiency of the partnership between the EU and its farmers.","[Cvik, Eva Daniela; Pelikanova, Radka MacGregor] CULS Prague, Dept Law, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Cvik, ED (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Dept Law, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",cvik@pef.czu.cz; pelikanovar@pef.czu.cz,"Vrana, Ivan/H-1768-2018; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018; MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019; Cvik, Eva Daniela/H-1768-2018","Vrana, Ivan/0000-0001-5920-5631; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146; MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880; Cvik, Eva Daniela/0000-0002-8873-8039",,,,,20,3,3,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,82,89,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600008,0

The chosen industry for the study is the Malaysian aerospace industry. The National Aerospace Blueprint launched in 1997, targets at making Malaysia a major aerospace player in the global scene by 2015. The blueprint identifies four focus areas mainly: (1) aircraft parts and components manufacturing, (2) maintenance, repair and overhaul, (3) avionics and systems integrations and (4) aerospace training. The study will adopt an explanatory case method (Yin, 2009). This allows an in-depth understanding of the global value chain in the Malaysian aerospace industry.

Three different scenarios will be taken into consideration regarding the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy. The results of different scenarios under which the Common agricultural policy is implemented will provide us with an insight on the identification of energy crops for which the agricultural income is a potential significant motive to the farmers for their adoption related not only to other energy crops but also conventional crops. According to our findings higher income is acquired by the cultivation of the sun flower compared to that of rapeseed in non-irrigated areas while in irrigated areas highest income comes from the crop of corn compared to the crop of sunflower and rapeseed. The practical value of the present work stands on the formation of a structure of different energy crops that secure income maximization, while if we take into consideration crops with limited needs in non-cultivated areas with less fertile soils might also contribute to the formation of rural development (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,"Eleni, Z (通讯作者)，193 Pantazidou Str, GR-68200 Orestiada, Greece.",ezafeir@agro.duth.gr,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2015,33.0,,,,,,388,397,,10.1016/S2212-5671(15)01723-2,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4FZ,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380846000034,0

These countries registered high internal and external imbalances that could not be reduced through monetary devaluation. Within this context, fiscal policy instruments represent the core elements for growth, competitiveness and stability. Although, especially during the last years, fiscal policy changes were implemented having as an important objective the decrease of budgetary deficits and public debts, the influence is much more significant. Taxation can also be used to resolve important issues as low competitiveness. In this respect, we determine the effects of fiscal devaluation on the current account balance by applying panel data analysis on data for all European Union member states, as the principle can be useful for all countries, and conclude on the use of fiscal devaluation as solution for enhancing competitiveness.

The reason for this necessary linkage is directly connected with the power that rests in the junk bonds, because they are used to finance LBO deals. The orginal-issue high-yield debt instrument, the so-called junk bond innovation, was pioneered by Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham, providing many hostile bidders and LBO firms with the enormous amounts of capital needed to finance multi-billion-dollar deals. The history of these two instruments goes hand in hand, as for example, the conjunction between the U.S. recession of the early 1990s along with the junk bond market crash following the fall of the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, brought the first LBO wave (the one that started in 1980) to an end. This is not the only example that shows a true connection between LBOs and junk bonds. This paper aims to bring into light the liaison that exists between these two instruments and the history that was created by the financing of LBOs with junk bonds. The present article will bring into focus the speculations that rests on the idea that the junk bonds has proven to be a life saver to big leveraged buyout groups as companies are able to get access to funding as investors look to invest in companies with high yields. Apart from this subject, this paper will try to figure out the role that the junk bond market plays in new LBO's, especially the ones created after 2012 (there was a slowdown in the LBOs activity after the financial turnover from 2008, and only after 2012 we can observe an improvement in the leveraged buyout market). This research paper will try to stimulate thinking about the effects that are generated on a market by a LBO, the power that exists behind a leveraged buyout (e.g. the junk bonds) and the connection that makes them prevail and become powerful, mainly together.

We use the panel data set of bank leverage and tier 1 capital ratio. Our dataset comprises the 172 French banks; commercial banks, cooperative banks, investment banks and saving banks covering the period of 2002 to 2012. We estimate models with generalized method of moments (GMM). Our results support both the theory of corporate finance and the buffer view, where a tendency towards the latter seems to be evident for banks. This is consistent with an effect of capital regulation on bank capital structure. We introduce also Tier 1 capital ratio as an explanatory variable to analyse the effect of capital regulation. However, Tier 1 capital total for banks seems to be increased. This implies that Risk-Weighted Assets increased, which may stem from internal model improvements. Furthermore, we show that the number of unprofitable, dividend-paying banks decreased. Our result indicates that this type of risk-shifting, where equity holders are favored over debt holders. The issuance of equity seems to be applied as a last remedy used when earnings are declining. All these findings are confirmed after taking into account an alternative measure the regulatory capital ratio in order to examine the capital regulation compliance of banks.

Thus, the paper focuses on this new business opportunity. The aim of the paper is to identify the business potential to build up and elaborate the workplace service business. Interviews with national workplace service providers and international workplace experts were conducted in order to get practical insight on the topic. Based on the interviews, two development steps are required to utilise the new business opportunity: (1) the transaction-oriented way to provide workplace services should be substituted by new business models, and (2) the workplace service should be re-thought and re-designed as a service that is not solely dependent on physical space.

More precisely, empirical studies conducted in this chapter aim to apprehend the feedback effect of this strategy of monetary policy on the budget deficit and volatility of exchange rate performance. This said, we consider the institutional framework as endogenous to IT and analyze the response of authorities to the adoption of this monetary regime. To do this, the retained methodological path in this chapter is an empirical way, based on the econometrics of panel data. First, our contribution to the existing literature is to evaluate the time-varying treatment effect of IT's adoption on the budget deficit of emerging inflation targeters, using the propensity score matching approach. Our empirical analysis, conducted on a sample of 34 economies (13 IT and 21 non-IT economies) for the period from 1990 to 2010, show a significant impact of IT on the reduction of budget deficit in emerging countries having adopted this monetary policy framework. Therefore, we can say that the emerging government can benefit ex post and gradually from a decline in their public deficits. Retaining the same econometric approach and sample, we tried secondly to empirically examine whether the adoption of IT in emerging inflation targeters has been effectively translated by an increase in the nominal effective exchange rate volatility compared to non-IT countries. Our results show that this effect is decreasing and that this volatility is becoming less important after the shift to this monetary regime. We might suggest that this indirect and occasional intervention in the foreign exchange market can be made by fear of inflation rather than by fear of floating hence in most emerging countries that have adopted the IT strategy. Finally, we can say that our conclusions corroborate the literature of disciplining effects of IT regime on fiscal policy performance as well as the two controversial effects of IT on the nominal effective exchange rate volatility.","[Kadria, Mohamed; Ben Aissa, Mohamed Safouane] Univ Tunis El Manar, LAREQUAD, Tunis, Tunisia; [Kadria, Mohamed; Ben Aissa, Mohamed Safouane] Univ Tunis El Manar, FSEGT, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar,"Kadria, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, LAREQUAD, Tunis, Tunisia.",mohamed.kadria@gmail.com; safouane.benaissa@univmed.fr,,"Kadria, Mohamed/0000-0002-9016-5233",,,,,66,1,1,2,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,1,27,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024002,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900002,0

In this model, demand slopes and hence preferences are not identifiable without further restrictions because of the absence of independent variation of endogenous composition and exogenous location characteristics. Several solutions of this problem are presented and applied to data on neighborhoods in US cities. These solutions use exclusion restrictions, based on either subgroup demand shifters, the spatial structure of externalities, or the dynamics of prices and composition in response to an amenity shock. The empirical results consistently suggest the presence of strong social externalities, that is a dependence of location choices on neighborhood composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We will be invented to a group called parametric methods for estimating the level of risk. This is a procedure where the theoretical probability distribution of losses is known, but we do not know its parameters. We must then be suitably approximated with some theoretical probability distributions and thus used for the distribution of individual risk rate. In our contribution we real data to approximate Normal, Student's and Laplace distribution. Percentage approximation we checked on the basis Likelihood logarithmic functions.

Accounting fairness refers mostly to the fair presentation and, therefore, to the measurement or valuation of an element recognized in the entity's financial statements. Depreciation is the process of allocating costs to an asset over its entire life. This allocation is done in a way that the cost of the asset (depreciation expense) is charged to the accounting periods during the economic life of the asset and decreases the net value of fixed assets. Applying different depreciation accounting and valuation methods across firms or countries makes financial statements incomparable to each other. The research objective of the paper is a presentation of depreciation methods in comparison with life-cycle costing (LCC) methodology. Both LCC and depreciation methods are applied to: i) a typical commercial property asset an office building, as part of a real property developer's fixed assets portfolio and ii) a vessel a Handymax, as part of the fixed assets of a shipping company in order to explore the relationship between these methods when applied to the valuation of fixed assets and how these methods correlate with each other. Following the above mentioned procedure, our aim is to provide answers to the following questions: i) 'which depreciation method is more appropriate to be used as the accounting method for fixed assets?' and ii) 'in what way the LCC methodology is associated with depreciation methods and more broadly with accounting methods and practices?'.

Implementation of a process approach to the business management is considered one of the biggest breakthroughs of 20th century. Traditional functional managerial systems are ineffective therefore new system has to be developed. The answer on this question is the Process Management. The aim of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) framework is to improve level of processes maturity. This model could be used as a base for implementation of process approach in the business management. The aim of the paper is create briefly description of CMM and to point out relation between financial performance of Slovak enterprises and process control level (a maturity of processes). The theoretical base has been created after theoretical knowledge study. The CMM has been used in this paper as a base for creation questions of primary quantitative research.

Our case study performed in dynamics during eight years (2006-2013), based on real data from the Romania's furniture industry, on a large enterprise with more than 700 employees, reveal that the main expenses of the enterprise are with the cost of employees and with the raw material and materials.

Following the trajectory proposed by the double dividend hypothesis, this study examines the potential of carbon taxation enactment accompanied by payroll tax cuts in order to lower the tax burden of these pre-existent distortionary taxes. The feasibility of tax swap mechanism between environmental and payroll taxation is verified via estimating and comparing their efficiency costs. The results obtained from empirical analysis and simulation validates the potential of the tax swap, where the efficiency costs of payroll taxation are considerably larger than of environmental taxation. Therefore we demonstrate that there is enough room to implement a tax shift mechanism which would have a double dividend outcome - pollution reduction and decreasing the efficiency costs of the payroll taxation.","[Nerudova, Danuse; Dobranschi, Marian] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Nerudová, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Brno, Czech Republic.",danuse.nerudova@mendelu.cz; marian.dobranschi@mendelu.cz,"Dobranschi, Marian/V-6136-2018; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012","Dobranschi, Marian/0000-0002-5642-0341; Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,608,617,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000067,0

For the moment the evaluation technique consist mainly in clusters evaluation done by the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis (ESCA), with the means of a set of indicators, on the basis of which the quality of cluster management is eventually certified, after obtaining the gold label. The use, at an European level, of cluster benchmarking has become more and more necessary, in the context of internationalization and of the tough competition that clusters have to face. The paper will highlight also the need for cluster policies and smart specialization strategies (SS3) in order to promote economic growth and regional competitiveness. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Current financial and economic crisis accentuates high unemployment, fulminate bankruptcy of many firms and impossibility of quantification of negative economic and social consequences. That's why, fiscal specialists believe that taxation of insurance represents an important issue both for insurers and the European or/and national supervisory body of insurance market, and also for individuals or/and legal entities. EU attempts to harmonize first the national legislations regarding the taxation and then those relating to insurance, aiming to ensure the specific solvency of insurance companies. Estimating that, the significance of fiscal considerations in the decision to subscribe insurances contracts, different European countries, including Romania, have tried and managed through its fiscal laws to apply different ways for fiscal deductibility of insurance expenses. The taxation of insurance should be regarded and analyzed both from the perspective of gross premiums subscribed and received by insurance companies and services from the insurer. Insurers 'benefits may take various forms (daily allowances, sums insured in case of life or death, rents, amounts provided for single-premium policy, those with capitalization) depending on the policy and concluded the nature of risk covered. Taxation of these benefits are achieved with the principles and logic of tax (a tax or insurance premiums or benefits), but depends on the binding and/or voluntary policy. Legislation regarding taxation is changing frequently. Besides this, we assist now at several changes, both in legislation regarding the accounting and insurance domain. To avoid failure of these entities, the European Commission, through its agencies, helped to create the legal framework to ensure the solvency of insurance companies. The implementation of IAS/IFRS in our country, for insurance companies, helped supervisors and local decision makers to use XRL in order to disclosure the accounting information's in financial statements understandable for the investor. Between taxation - legislation - accounting - solvency exist a real connection, which positive evolution will help the standard of live. In order to do so I performed an analysis on a sample of 32 countries and a horizon of 6 years (2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011). During our work, we tested 4 linear regression models (life gross written premiums, non-life gross written premiums, number of insurance companies and number of employees in the insurance sector). The results will confirm the existing link between development level of countries and insurance, but exclude the relationship between taxation and insurance. The conclusions of the paper will help the practitioners and The Financial Supervisory Authority in their decisions. We must point out that this study is a continuation of our work started in 2009.

Using a version of an unobserved components model introduced by Fleischman and Roberts, we estimate that potential GDP in late 2014 was about 7 percent below the trajectory it appeared to be on prior to 2007. We argue that a significant portion of the recent damage to the supply side of the economy plausibly was endogenous to the weakness in aggregate demand. Endogeneity of supply with respect to demand provides a strong motivation for a vigorous policy response to a weakening in aggregate demand, and we present optimal-control simulations showing how monetary policy might respond to such endogeneity in the absence of other considerations. We then discuss how other considerations-such as increased risks of financial instability or inflation instability-could cause policymakers to exercise restraint in their response to cyclical weakness.","[Reifschneider, Dave] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC USA; [Wascher, William; Wilcox, David] Board Governors, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Reifschneider, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC USA.",,,"Wascher, William/0000-0003-0313-5958",,,,,55,47,56,1,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

In this way, an easier, faster and integral access to the Community funds is possible, allowing the EU budget to exercise its role of stabilizing the Union. In the future programming period 2014-2020, different instruments, such as loans, equity or guarantees will be used to enhance the effectiveness of EU funds and thus to enhance their financial impact. The paper also makes reference to other pieces of EU regulation, which have the purpose of addressing the weaknesses identified as a consequence of the financial crisis. Structural Funds Regulations, applicable in the future programming period 2014-2020, aimed to increase the efficiency of structural instruments, so important in the current economic and fiscal climate. However, the debate continues about the possibility of improving the EU budget, its revenue and expenditure, to comply with several financial relevant principles (economic efficiency, equity, stability, visibility and simplicity, effectiveness administrative costs, autonomy financial).

Relationship marketing is a marketing strategy enforcing companies to deal with enormous customer data management challenges, thus necessitating the deployment of supporting IT systems. This need has been covered to a great extent by the development of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of a company's CRM related human, organizational and technological resources on its CRM processes. A customer life-cycle based approach has been chosen. As a result of this, CRM processes have been mapped on the initiation, acquisition, regain, maintenance, retention, expansion and exit customer life-cycle stages. Field research was conducted by utilizing an interviewer-administered questionnaire, which was developed by adopting relevant work reported in literature. The case industry chosen was the Greek banking sector. The survey was conducted among all the employees of a Greek leading bank's 10 branches located in the region of Thessaly, who were involved in CRM processes. The final sample comprised 102 correctly answered questionnaires. Inter-item analysis was used to verify the scale's factors for internal consistency or reliability. The Cronbach's alpha, which was calculated for each scale, ranged between 0.819 and 0.912. Regression analyses were then performed to examine the impact of CRM resources on customer life-cycle stages. The results highlighted that CRM organizational resources are the most vital, since they have a positive effect on the processes of all customer life-cycle stages. Moreover, human resources were proved to have a significant effect on the early (initiation, acquisition, regain) and middle (maintenance, retention) customer life-cycle stages, while their impact on the late stages (expansion, exit) is minimal. Finally, technological resources were shown to have a small influence on the middle customer life-cycle stages. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The consequence of that is that clients more and more often make decisions about termination of doing business with their bank if they are not satisfied with its way of doing business. In order to keep the existing and attract the new clients, banks should clearly position themselves on a market, and they may achieve this through the creation of a powerful image. A well-positioned image represents competitive advantage which is impossible to copy. Integrated marketing communications are especially important for clear positioning of image on a banking market. However, banks must not neglect the effects of uncontrolled communications on the creation of their image. Therefore, this paper researches the effects of controlled and uncontrolled communications on creation of bank images. Necessary information for this research has been gathered through a primary research on Bosnian and Herzegovinian banking market, where two random samples of 300 legal entities and 500 individuals have been formed. Also, 22 top bank managers have been surveyed. The analysis of gathered results has shown that controlled communications have more powerful impact on the creation of bank image on Bosnian and Herzegovinian market than the uncontrolled ones.","[Smajlovic, Ermina] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Smajlovic, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",ermina.mustafic@untz.ba,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,260,275,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700015,0

The issue of the takeover relevant directors' duties has not been specifically and critically addressed in Romania. We reach the conclusion that due to similarities between the American and Romanian directors' fiduciary duties and considering that the Romanian capital market is an area that is heading towards further development, the natural progression of the duties of directors of the companies present on the Bucharest Stock Exchange should follow the organic evolution of their American counterparts. This development is, however, artificially altered by the European neutrality rule. As shown above, the protection of Romanian minority shareholders is deficient under the European rule and the interests of Romanian companies and their shareholders may be affected by the application of the neutrality rule. Furthermore, the European Directive 2004/25/EC creates a disadvantage for European companies compared to their non-European equivalents, primarily in regard to U.S. companies. For these reasons we conclude that it is necessary de lege ferenda to diminish the application of the neutrality rule at least in Romania's case. This initiative should be accompanied by a reconsideration of Romanian directors' duties in hostile takeover through the lens of their American counterparts' position, the next stage in the evolution of the legal and economic field, as mentioned above.

These types of methods are encouraged in ammunitions design too. As an example we can observe that some military standards encourage the use of numerical simulation in first steps of a product design or on his life cycle, before experimental testing, but not exclude experimental testing. To complete this approach the present paper comes with some models for the efficiency estimation taking into account the necessary resources for ammunition experimental testing, in general and ammunition consumption in experimental tests in particular.

They pay much lower premiums than those insured under the general scheme, in consequence, the subsidies provided by the State budget for their pensions constitute around 90%. One reason for the continuation of this privileged pension is a reference to solidarity, but the functioning of many farms in Poland, because of low income, is made possible only by a low pension premium. In the paper this privilege is determined in a comprehensive way: 1. What is solidarity? 2. Is the responsibility of the community unlimited? 3. Should an individual under solidaristic reciprocity transfer to the community specific benefits, in exchange for the social privilege,? 4. Should solidarity be looked at through the prism of current actions, or through the increasing budgetary expenditure and thus the impact on the financial position of the country in the future? 5. Whether this privilege affects the financial situation of the State budget? and 6. Can farmers, because of their income, pay higher pension premiums? The aim of the study is to present solidarity based on the example of the social insurance system used for farmers in Poland. The work is based on an analysis of the subject literature and secondary research. The subject literature lacks studies presenting the issue in this way. In the paper we present that, the farmers' pension insurance system is not based on solidarity (thinking about the interests of the individual and the community - in the short term, as well as in terms of the future), it is simply political rent-seeking. Therefore, it requires significant changes to avoid potential State budget problems. Changes are possible due to the accession to the European Union, because farmers' financial situation has improved.","[Walczak, Damian] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Dept Financial Management, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Pienkowska-Kamieniecka, Sylwia] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, Chair Social Policy & Insurance, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Walczak, D (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Dept Financial Management, Gagarina 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",dwalczak@umk.pl; sylwia.pienkowska@uwm.edu.pl,"Walczak, Damian/K-1331-2014; Pieńkowska-Kamieniecka, Sylwia/L-3598-2017","Walczak, Damian/0000-0002-2986-9928; PIENKOWSKA-KAMIENIECKA, SYLWIA/0000-0002-5818-2658",,,,,25,2,2,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,536,543,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600062,0

This study supports the neighborhood social effects argument, using a spatial econometrics approach and data from The Ohio State University (OSU) 2012 Campus Transportation Survey. A spatial probit model of commuters' mode choices (bicycling versus non-bicycling) is estimated, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The results show that the more OSU-affiliated bicycle riders are residing around an individual OSU commuter, the more attractive bicycling becomes, controlling for other factors such as gender, status, proximity to campus, bicycle infrastructure and attitudes. The results indicate that students and males are more likely to commute by bicycles. The probability of choosing bicycles decreases with distance from campus. In addition, proximity to bicycle infrastructure and physical environment both encourage respondents to bicycle. Feeling of safety, travel cost and concern for the environment also affect bicycling choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this respect, one of the most important /main issues of the women employment policy in Romania is closed related to the child care facilities /services. In Romania the public system of child care services is still underdeveloped, whereas the private one is randomly developed (E Zamfir & Zamfir, C 1996, Marginean, I and Cojocaru, S-coord. 2006, Zamfir, E 2009,). They tend to exclude the people that are living in the rural area and also in extreme risk of poverty or very isolated and poor areas (as gipsy communities) (Zamfir, E and Zamfir, C 1993, E Zamfir 2012). Besides, there is an inefficient way of evaluation and monitoring of both, the results of the child care facilities and women employment policies, too (Zamfir, E and Zamfir, C, 2000, Zamfir, E 2010-3)). For this reason, during the last 10 years, the concrete achievements in improving child care services related to women professional life are less visible at the implementation level. There is, however, a lack of pragmatic solutions to transform the objectives and the directions of action into concrete measures which could assure the real changes in daily women life. In fact, good intentions must be supported by efficient practical means/instruments, by constant monitoring and evaluation process of the adopted solutions. In spite of fact that the issues of harmonizing work/professional, private and family life within the current gender policy are characterized by adopted an adequate legal, modern framework-as a good policy initiative, the status of this policy initiatives remains much more at the announced stage and enacted levels(Zamfir, E. 2010-1). Very few initiatives have been implemented or evaluated in time. The process of monitoring and evaluating the actions in this frame of gender policy is still underdeveloped. The gender Policy in Romania follows very contradictory and sinuous trends: increase in women economic participation, increase in professional status but, also still remain signs of degradation in the private/family life. On the one hand, in some period of time, in Romania the gender equality policy, under international pressure, became visible at the legal frame and at the structure of institutions, too. On the other hand the degradation of women private/life is happened due to the lack of economic and financial resources which most affected the quality of social services and moral values for family and child protection. A partially positive aspect which can be mentioned in Romania, in the last 8 years, refers to development of some special child care facilities under the EU financed social inclusion programs. Some of them were good and stable in establishing a network of social services support facilities for children within the communities which could help significantly to increase the rate of women employment (Cace, S 2006, Zamfir, E, 2010-2, Stanescu, S Cace, S - coord. 2011). In the same time, the gender employment policies appear as an objective of the reform in all strategic sectors of our Society, being a constant element to eliminate social exclusion and gender marginalization. At the present the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Protection and Elderly, through the Agency of Equal Opportunities between Men and Women and Equal Opportunities, is in the process to develop the draft for the National Strategy for Equality between men and women for 2014-2017 with a General Plan of Actions. The project will be promoted by Government Decision, currently being in the process of public consultation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Based on China's micro cultural firms' data, a quantile regression analysis has been conducted, aiming to find out the impact of anticompetition regulation on TFP. Findings indicate that (1) administrative regulation s decrease the TFP and the negative effects are higher when the firms distribute at both ends of the TFP than that at middle.

Multiple equilibria exist in a global rollover game: intermediate liquidity holdings support equilibria with both positive and zero expected liquidation. A simple uniqueness refinement pins down the private liquidity choice, which balances the forgone expected return on investment with reduced fragility and costly liquidation. Due to fire sales, liquidity holdings are strategic substitutes. Intermediaries free ride on the holdings of other intermediaries, causing excessive liquidation.

Using a comprehensive sample of 2249 IPOs of Chinese companies that went public during the 1994-2013 period, we find that companies backed by Chinese domestic VCs are significantly less likely to list abroad while those backed by foreign VCs or co-invested by foreign and domestic VCs are significantly more likely to do so. We further find that the introduction of a domestic stock market for high-tech start-ups (the ChiNext Board) significantly reduces the likelihood to list abroad. However, the effect of VC participation largely disappears after the introduction of the ChiNext Board, in that the companies backed by foreign or co-invested VCs are more likely to list domestically. Moreover, we find that VC-backed IPOs have larger issuance sizes, but we find no impact on IPO underpricing of these Chinese companies. These results on IPO outcome hold for both the full sample and a matched sample using propensity score matching. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The existing literature does not provide a conclusive answer. Using a panel of 108 countries from 1971 to 2010, we provide insight to this discussion by examining aid's impact on economic freedom conditional on the quality of political institutions. We find some evidence suggesting that aid can improve economic freedom when given to democracies, but it may decrease it in autocracies. Also, aid given to entrenched regimes may reduce economic freedom. We illustrate that the results are sensitive to model selection, choice of controls, time period sample, and measurement of aid. Our results have important policy implications. Most countries that 'need' aid do not have healthy political institutions. As such, aid is less likely to have a positive impact on economic freedom, partially explaining the contradictory findings in the literature. This also highlights the difficulty of finding a top-down solution to institutional improvements. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Despite intensive research there is no clear evidence for a link between lottery risk preferences and risk involved in trusting others. We argue that this is due to crucial differences between the risk measurements in the two settings. Trusting is giving up control to a human while lottery risk arises from a mechanistic randomization device. We propose a risky trust game that experimentally measures risk in the same context as the standard trust game, but nevertheless reduces the trust decision to objective risk. Our results show that transfers in the trust game can indeed be explained by individual risk attitudes elicited with the risky trust game, while lottery risk preferences have no explanatory power.

Using panel analyses for 93 countries from all continents for 1970-2011, we show that, first, the speed of convergence to the US in terms of GDP per capita is closely related to the share of working age population - the support ratio - as it drives national saving and various investments. In the case of Asia, the speed of convergence is more elastic to support ratios than other continents, suggesting that the first and the second demographic dividends have been extracted to a deeper degree. Second, fertility - the main driving force of support ratio dynamics - is determined by child rearing costs that are, in turn, a function of the level of GDP per capita relative to the US. Again, Asia's fertility is extremely sensitive to the level of development, implying that economic convergence leads to too high child rearing costs and too low fertility. These findings lead to the possibility of Asia's demography-driven middle-income trap: low fertility eventually turns the positive demographic dividends of the past into negative ones and forces the speed of convergence to slow down, so that the relative per capita GDP stagnates before it fully converges to the US. However, in the meantime, East Asia's declining support ratios and South and South East Asia's increasing support ratios imply that within-Asia convergence may occur for some time. In the long run, economic convergence cannot be sustained without demographic convergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One undesirable outcome is public financial deficits, which, in turn, brings about another undesirable result, i.e., intergenerational inequity. We study how these outcomes can be mitigated by focusing on the National Pension Program (hereafter referred to as the NPP), because it is a key government response to population aging, as well as a clear illustration of how fiscally unsustainable social programs can undermine the equity across generations. Four questions are asked: (1) How serious is intergenerational inequity in Taiwan? (2) Does the NPP reduce or exacerbate the imbalance in financial burdens across generations? (3) How can the financial sustainability of the NPP be restored? and (4) How can intergenerational equity be restored? To address these questions, we apply the Generational Accounting method to 2010 NTA data and official population projections. The results suggest that the NPP may enhance the welfare of the current elderly, but the financial burden on the generations not yet born is bound to increase unduly. As such, the NPP alone is not a panacea for rapid population aging, and all citizens and the State should work together to find better and more comprehensive solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In most cases the leave is unpaid, and rarely longer than 12 weeks in duration. This study evaluates disparities in parental leave eligibility, access, and usage across the family income distribution in the United States. It also describes the links between leave-taking and women's labor market careers. The focus is especially on low-income families, as their leave coverage and ability to afford taking unpaid leave is particularly poor. This study shows that the introduction of both state and federal legislation increased overall leave coverage, leave provision, and leave-taking. For example, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leads to an increased probability of leave-taking by nearly 20 percentage points and increased average leave length by almost five weeks across all states. The new policies did not, however, reduce gaps between low-and high-income families' eligibility, leave-taking, or leave length. In addition, the FMLA effects on leave-taking were very similar across states with and without prior leave legislation, and the FMLA did not disproportionately increase leave-taking for women who worked in firms and jobs covered by the new legislation, as these women were already relatively well covered by other parental leave arrangements.

Besides its nutritional role, food has become a main socio-cultural determinant, food consumption patterns being influenced, on one hand, by psycho-sensory and quality characteristics of the food product and, on the other hand, by the physiological state of the consumer and its main determinants: traditions, religion and culture. These elements, together with economic considerations have a significant share in shaping the modern eating habits. In this context, the present paper aims to identify and analyze the main capitalization methods of the food's traditional potential in reshaping the modern food offer, starting with a literature review and continuing with an exploratory analyze of the traditional food sector in Romania. Considering the main directions outlined by literature, this article tries to identify a set of specific features of the traditional food sector in Romania both in terms of producer and consumer perspectives. In this regard, an interview and an exploratory based questionnaire study were conducted. Having as a starting point the wide variety of Romanian food resources, this study aims to highlight how culinary customs have been modeled throughout history in order to establish eating patterns as an assessment method based on the impact of technological progress on the future alimentation.","[Bobe, Magdalena; Procopie, Roxana; Toma, Maria Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Bobe, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",magdalena.bobe@com.ase.ro,"Procopie, Roxana/ABC-8593-2020","Procopie, Roxana/0000-0002-2295-0678",,,,,12,2,2,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,976,988,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700018,0

We estimate the effect of political reservation on the incidence of child labor by exploiting the state variation in the share of seats reserved for the two minority groups in state legislative assemblies mandated by the Constitution of India. Using data from state and household-level surveys on fifteen major Indian states, we find that at the household-level, Schedule Tribe reservation decreases the incidence of child labor, while Scheduled Caste reservation increases the total number of children working. We examine these impacts on the general as well as the disadvantaged group population independently, and across the gender of children. We also explore potential explanations for the differential impact of SC and ST political reservation, including geographic isolation, caste fragmentation, support for the Congress Party, and decentralization of power.

I argue that market segmentation is one mechanism linking diversity to economic underdevelopment: when ethnic groups are geographically segregated and trust is concentrated within groups, markets will be tend to be segmented along ethnic lines. I evaluate this argument using maize price data from seventy Malawian markets over 14 years and combine it with census data on the spatial distribution of ethnic groups. I find that maize price differences a key indicator of market segmentation are indeed larger for ethnically dissimilar markets, even after taking sub national administrative borders geographic barriers, and climatic differences into account. These statistical findings are complemented by interview data from farmers and traders in three markets across Malawi, which highlight the centrality of trust in small-scale maize trading, as well as a preference for coethnic trading partners. Together, these findings suggest that ethnic diversity, and ethnoregional segregation in particular, can have a negative impact on market integration, an important driver of food security and long-term economic development.

Starting from the idea that small and medium sized enterprises can be exponents of responsibility, this paper propose to analyse tourism operators' opinions regarding Corporate Social Responsibility and underlines its importance in tourism businesses. For achieving this, a quantitative research was used and a questionnaire on the micro, small and medium sized enterprises, representatives for tourism industry in eight EU countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and France) was conducted.

We find that the median individual in metropolitan areas with the highest quartile house price growth becomes a homeowner 5 years earlier than that in areas with the lowest quartile house price growth. The result is consistent with a life cycle housing-demand model in which high past price growth increases expectations of future price growth thus accelerating home purchases at young ages.

The elimination of the threshold had, on average, a stronger effect on municipalities with larger councils since implicit (also known as effective) electoral thresholds are inversely correlated with council size. Using a dataset that includes all 426 Hessian municipalities over the period 1989-2011 and exploiting discontinuities in a state law that maps populations exogenously to council size, we implement a difference-in-discontinuities design. Our results show that the reform had large psychological effects that eventually improved the electoral prospects of (relatively small) local parties. In the short-run, however, the vote and seat shares of the large national parties increased.

Comparing group incentive and individual-incentive treatments, we find that the observed dynamics of both individual errors and worst performances within firms, after a phase of learning, are largely indistinguishable. Importantly, and possibly explaining our finding, more than 80% of our laboratory firms, notwithstanding initially widespread inefficiency, were eventually able to achieve and sustain efficient coordination despite the presence of an unforgiving payoff structure. This result, which may be due to the reduced strategic uncertainty so characteristic of chosen-effort weak-link game experiments, stands in stark contrast to standard results in the coordination game literature and provides an interesting challenge to test beds currently used.

Professionalization behaviour was monitored up to 2014. Previous studies have conceptualized professionalization as a threshold to be attained. We demonstrate that professionalization is a complex process occurring in waves, triggered by changes in firm ownership and management. Waves of professionalization converge during the MBO/I process. Buyouts provide a funnelling mechanism enabling diverse control systems to be standardized. Post-MBO/I, divergence in the professionalization process reoccurs contingent on firm-specific contexts. Professionalization focuses on operations when stewardship relationships predominate, but on agency control mechanisms when there is increased potential for agency costs. Buyout organizational form is an important transitory phase facilitating the professionalization process.

Controlling for investor demand, our findings suggest credit constraints play an economically significant asset pricing role in markets that are both highly levered and relatively illiquid.","[Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Naranjo, Andy] Univ Florida, Finance, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Naranjo, Andy] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Scheick, Benjamin] Villanova Univ, Finance, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Villanova University,"Ling, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Real Estate, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ling@ufl.edu; andy.naranjo@warrington.ufl.edu; benjamin.scheick@villanova.edu,,,Real Estate Research Institute,Real Estate Research Institute,"The authors thank Evan Dudley, Andrew Karolyi, Pok-sang Lam (our JMCB Editor), Mahendrarajah Nimalendran, Michael Pagano, Jay Ritter, Michael Ryngaert, Jenny Tucker, two anonymous referees, as well as conference and symposium participants at California State University-Fullerton, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, Texas Tech University, University of Cambridge, University of Florida, University of Georgia, Villanova University, the Annual Research Symposium of the Real Estate Research Institute, the 4th Annual ReCapNet Conference on Real Estate and Capital Markets, and the Annual Meeting of the Allied Social Science Associations.

This behavior by the secret promoter is illegal (and leads to prosecution) but the actions of the hiring firm are legal. We use data from these prosecutions to analyze the behavior and motivations of the hiring firms. We find that secret promotion leads to an initial increase in the price and trading volume of the firms on the date that the secret promotion started. Subsequently, however, we find that this increase in price is reversed when regulators (e.g. SEC or NASD) take action against these promoters for not disclosing their relationships with the hiring firms. We find that the main motives behind these relationships are to maximize the private benefits of the firm's managers and owners through pumping the share prices and subsequently dumping their shareholdings.

First, accumulation raises wages and leads to redistribution from the consuming old to the saving young. Second, higher wages raise the price of old-age care and, in anticipation of this, the young save more.

Motivated by theoretical treatments of green goods as a bundle of private and public characteristics in proportions fixed by the provider, we design an experiment with two linked treatments to test how the presence of impure public goods affects behaviour towards public good causes. We set parameters, such that from a standard economic perspective the presence of the impure public good is behaviourally irrelevant. In a treatment where the impure public good provides only small contributions to the public good, we observe that on aggregate pro-social behaviour is lower in the presence of the impure public good. On the contrary, in the treatment where the impure public good is more generous towards the public good component at the expense of private earnings, individuals are unaffected in their behaviour. We observe that impure public goods, that are theoretically irrelevant and are mostly self-interested, may hinder pro-social behaviour and look for explanations in social psychology, such as the phenomenon of thoughtful anchoring, motivated reasoning and reluctant altruism. The results from this experiment question the role of green goods in enhancing environmentally friendly behaviours.","[Munro, Alistair] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan; [Valente, Marieta] Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gestao, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Valente, Marieta] Univ Minho, NIMA, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Valente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gestao, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Valente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, NIMA, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",mvalente@eeg.uminho.pt,"Valente, Marieta/J-8407-2016; Munro, Alistair/A-3714-2009","Valente, Marieta/0000-0003-3332-8945; Munro, Alistair/0000-0003-3918-8701","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia - FCT Portugal [SFRH/BD/19130/2004]; JSPS [21530213]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/19130/2004, PEst-OE/EGE/UI3181/2014] Funding Source: FCT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21530213] Funding Source: KAKEN","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia - FCT Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank three anonymous referees, and in particular the editor, for thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Substantial financial support is found for improved air quality in Nairobi, with approximately 85 per cent of the whole sample stating a positive WTP. The way WTP values are elicited, with and without ability to express preference uncertainty, has significant effect on WTP welfare estimate. Allowing respondents to express experienced uncertainty when stating WTP value yields more conservative but less accurate WTP values for inclusion in policy analysis.

Based on a sample of 79 developed and emerging countries over the 1973-2010 period, our results suggest that in the aftermath of banking crises, investment ratio declines but swiftly recovers to its pre-crisis level within two to three years. Bank credit declines significantly and remains stagnated even in the medium run. In terms of country characteristics, we find that investment and bank credit ratios decline significantly more in advanced countries and countries with higher level of capital openness. In addition, investment ratio declines significantly more in countries with higher level of financial development. Finally, we split the banking crises episodes into two categories: those preceded by a domestic credit boom or a surge in net capital inflows, and those that were not preceded by such booms. We find that dynamic adjustment of investment and bank credit ratios differs substantially across the two groups. Existence of a credit boom or a surge in capital inflow in the run-up to the crisis intensifies the length and depth of the decline in investment and bank credit ratios. In fact, we find no statistically significant decline in investment following banking crises that were not preceded by a credit boom or a surge in capital inflows. These results imply that deleveraging is costly to the economy.

The cross-area externality is estimated as small, which implies that the congestion alleviation was not large enough (yet) to change the travel mode choices of commuters residing in areas that did not experience the improvement.

One attempt at selecting stocks that are less prone to extreme risks is obeyance of Islamic Sharia rules. In this light, we investigate the statistical properties of the Dow Jones Islamic Stock Market Index (DJIM) and explore its volatility dynamics using a number of up-to-date statistical models allowing for long memory and regime-switching dynamics. We find that the DJIM shares all stylized facts of traditional asset classes, and estimation results and forecasting performance for various volatility models are also in line with prevalent findings in the literature. With this proximity to standard asset classes, investments in the DJIM could hardly provide a cushion against extreme market fluctuations. Among the various models, the relatively new Markov-switching multifractal model performs best under the majority of time horizons and loss criteria.

Supporting a causal interpretation, this effect is stronger in chain-owned stores than in franchised locations-twin restaurants over which private equity owners have limited control.

Among other issues, the papers considered analyze: the burden sharing rule that will result from a negotiation over a global public good; the role of information asymmetries; the impact of unilateral commitments, delegation, and ratification; whether or not countries are going to form groups during the negotiation process; and the influence of the expectation of a future bargaining process on investment decisions. The basic bargaining model is optimistic, as it predicts that countries will reach an efficient agreement immediately. However, all the developments of this model surveyed afterwards are rather pessimistic and even the basic model has perverse incentives for pre-negotiation signals.","[Caparros, Alejandro] CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Albasanz 26, Madrid 28037, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP),"Caparrós, A (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Albasanz 26, Madrid 28037, Spain.",alejandro.caparros@csic.es,,,"MEC (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness), through the project ACBPA [ECO2012-35432]","MEC (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness), through the project ACBPA","I gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the MEC (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness), through the project ACBPA (ECO2012-35432).

The outperformance of the timing strategy is not driven by the backwardation and contango. It is stronger during recession and can not be explained by macroeconomic variables.

Existing informal finance theories cannot match two characteristics of family finance: family investors may accept below-market or even negative returns, yet borrowers often prefer formal finance. We argue that social preferences make family finance cheap but create shadow costs that nonetheless discourage its use: Committing family funds to risky investment displaces intrafamily insurance and undermines limited liability. The same characteristics that sustain familial insurance thus render family finance a poor source of risk capital. Even when overcoming capital constraints requires social ties, intermediation and semiformalization may therefore be crucial for promoting risk taking.","[Lee, Samuel] Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Lee, Samuel] ECGI, Brussels, Belgium; [Lee, Samuel] Swedish House Finance, Stockholm, Sweden; [Persson, Petra] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Persson, Petra] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Persson, Petra] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Persson, Petra] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Santa Clara University; European Corporate Governance Institute; Swedish House of Finance; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Lucas Hall,RM 216T,500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",sslee@scu.edu,,,,,,,68,73,88,4,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Despite persistent calls to increase accountability in the nonprofit sector, there is little research examining the burden imposed by existing regulatory requirements, especially at the state level. This paper uses a bunching design to estimate the avoidance behavior exhibited by tax-exempt charities in response to New York State's audit requirements. There is clear evidence of bunching in response to the requirement that nonprofits above certain revenue thresholds file financial statements reviewed by or audited by an independent certified public accountant. Measuring the extent of bunching around the revenue notches yields estimates of the average revenue that nonprofits either forego or fail to report in avoidance of the requirements. Results from dynamic estimation show that charities near the threshold for a review engagement report approximately $1,300 less revenue than otherwise predicted by a counterfactual; charities near the threshold for a full audit report approximately $1,400 less. The results have implications for the optimal design of state-level financial regulations.

This has resulted in a substantial deleveraging of their balance sheets. The popular term for this phenomenon is corporate saving. Corporate saving by Japanese companies is now at the highest level in history. Dividends and stock repurchases are two potential ways to resolve excessive corporate saving. Stock repurchases in particular offer a fast, flexible and very public method to solve the problem of excessive corporate savings. This research is an investigation of stock repurchases by Japanese companies from 2000 to 2009. Companies repurchase their stock to return excess cash to investors, resolve governance issues, adjust capital structure and send signals. This paper uses accounting and stock market information to explain this behavior. Contrary to recent research on American firms, we find that replacement of dividends does not appear to explain stock repurchase behavior in Japan. We find evidence that repurchase behavior in Japan is linked to excessive corporate savings. However, repurchases are also closely linked to the ownership structure of the firm. Firms whose dominant owners are other members of the firm's industrial group are less likely to repurchase. Bank ownership has mixed implications for repurchases. Firms having foreign and individual ownership are more likely to repurchase stock. Foreign and individual ownership appears to improve governance and thus may be a partial solution to excessive corporate savings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

As expected, this directional contrast is temporary, in that all three information release types lead to a decrease in information asymmetry following the short-window announcement period. Our evidence demonstrates that the direction of the effect of a public information release on announcement-period information asymmetry is determined by how the information contained in the release relates to prior information held by sophisticated and unsophisticated investors, which supports extant disclosure theory.

In the short-run, the shadow bank share rose when deposit interest rate ceilings were binding on traditional banks, the economic outlook improved, or risk premia declined, and fell when event risks arose.

Although the reviews ostensibly have the same objective, they reach sometimes starkly different conclusions. The first objective of this paper is to identify why reviews diverge in their conclusions and how future reviews can be more effective. The second objective is to identify areas of overlap in the recommendations of existing reviews of what works to improve learning. This paper demonstrates that divergence in the recommendations of learning reviews is largely driven by differences in the samples of research incorporated in each review. Of 229 studies with student learning results, the most inclusive review incorporates less than half of the total studies. Across the reviews, two classes of programs are recommended with some consistency. Pedagogical interventions that tailor teaching to student learning levels-either teacher-led or facilitated by adaptive learning software-are effective at improving student test scores, as are individualized, repeated teacher training interventions often associated with a specific task or tool. Future reviews will be most useful if they combine narrative review with meta-analysis, conduct more exhaustive searches, and maintain low aggregation of intervention categories.","[Evans, David K.] World Banks Africa Reg, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Popova, Anna] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Evans, DK (通讯作者)，World Banks Africa Reg, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",devans2@worldbank.org,,"Evans, David/0000-0001-5413-9284",World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"David K.

This method provides individual level estimates, and allows us to explore the heterogeneity in the data.

Different from a Bayesian approach, the investor separately relies on the conditional distribution of returns and on the posterior over parameters to make decisions, rather than on the predictive distribution of returns that integrates priors and likelihood information. We find that in the perspective of U.S. investors, ambiguity aversion generates strong home bias in equity holdings, regardless of beliefs in the CAPM or risk aversion.

There was also pressure to modify accounting rules to avoid giving credits for sequestration which would occur naturally. New accounting rules are based on reference levels against which greenhouse gas emissions and sinks resulting from forest management are compared during the second commitment period (2013-2020) of the Kyoto Protocol. In this study we investigate the timber market impacts and the effectiveness of the reference level policy in promoting forest management actions in the EU countries. We also study how setting of caps for policy-based gains affects the effectiveness of the policy. We found that the policy enhances carbon sequestration, if it is implemented in such a way that it affects harvests. The market impacts and the effects on forest sinks can be substantial in countries where non-LULUCF sector emissions are high relative to the potential of forest resources to act as sinks. In smaller countries with relatively large forest resources, the effectiveness of the policy is dampened by upper limits imposed on the emission compensations. The results of our study can be used to improve the effectiveness of policies in climate change negotiations.","[Jani, Laturi; Jussi, Lintunen; Jussi, Uusivuori] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Jokiniemenkuja 1, FI-01370 Vantaa, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Jani, L (通讯作者)，Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Jokiniemenkuja 1, FI-01370 Vantaa, Finland.",jani.laturi@luke.fi,,,"Academy of Finland [257919, 292825]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [292825, 257919] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),We thank an anonymous reviewer and the editors for constructive comments.

Finally, middle-income, high-income, and prime borrowers all sharply increased their share of delinquencies in the crisis.

Special attention is paid to the influence of the recent financial market crisis. For that purpose, in the first step we use a three-variable single-equation framework with teal GDP, an interest rate spread and a monetary or credit variable, in forecasting horizons of one to eight quarters. This first stage thus serves to pre-select the variables with the highest forecasting content. In a second step, we use the selected monetary and credit variables within different VAR models, and compare their forecasting properties against a benchmark VAR model with GDP and the term spread (and univariate AR models). Our findings suggest that narrow monetary aggregates, as well as different credit variables, comprise useful predictive information for economic dynamics beyond that contained in the term spread. However, this finding only holds true in a sample that includes the most recent financial crisis. Looking forward, an open question is whether this change in the relationship between money, credit, the term spread and economic activity has been the result of a permanent structural break or whether we might return to the previous relationships.

The classic hypothesis and its two variants are proven in a novel fashion.

We assume that when firms set the price at time t, they use information on the price in period t - 1 plus a portion of change in prices between t - 1 to t - 2 (a partial error correction). Under this expanded setting, we explicitly derive both structural and reduced-form NKPCs. The empirical results show that the extrapolative component is strongly significant in explaining inflation dynamics. In addition, the expanded version of the hybrid NKPC exhibits a better empirical performance than the original hybrid NKPC proposed by Gall and Gertler (1999) in terms of various statistical criteria.

We exploit the heterogeneity in judicial requirements across US states to examine their impact on banks' lending decisions in a sample of urban areas straddling state borders. A key feature of our study is the way it exploits an exogenous cutoff in loan eligibility to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) guarantees, which shift the burden of foreclosure costs onto the GSEs. We find that judicial requirements reduce the supply of credit only for jumbo loans, which are ineligible for GSE guarantees, i.e., in the nonsubsidized segment of the market. Thus, while we find a significant effect on credit supply, the aggregate impact is muted by the indirect cross-subsidy by the GSEs to borrower-friendly states. (c) 2016 Dr. Jihad C. Dagher.

Strictly speaking, PILOTs are voluntary, though nonprofits may feel pressure to make them, particularly in high-tax communities. Evidence from Massachusetts indicates that PILOT rates, measured as ratios of payments to the value of local tax-exempt property, are higher in towns with higher property tax rates: a one percentage point higher property tax rate is associated with a 0.2 percentage point higher PILOT rate. PILOTs appear to discourage nonprofit activity: a one percentage point higher PILOT rate is associated with 0.8% lower real property ownership by local nonprofits, 0.2% lower total assets, and 0.2% lower revenues of local nonprofits. These patterns are consistent with voluntary PILOTs acting in a manner similar to low-rate, compulsory real estate taxes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper clarifies the content and scope of these claims. The most productive firms are generally not the greatest beneficiaries from trade liberalization and may oppose further liberalization due to increased competition in export markets from compatriot firms. Exporting industries will feature no support for trade if foreign competition is too strong or barriers too unequal. The key analytic factor generating intra-industry division is product differentiation, both directly, by increasing export opportunities for less efficient firms, and by inducing home market effects wherein larger countries are more competitive. The implications of these findings for the distributional effects of liberalization and the study of trade politics are discussed.","[Osgood, Iain] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Osgood, I (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Haven Hall,505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",iosgood@umich.edu,,,,,,,32,32,41,0,9,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

While transit authorities as public agencies continue to deliver transit services in some cities, many others have privatised these services, have opened up the market to private operators or have outsourced them to newly founded subsidiaries. The situation is no different in Turkey, where new legislation was enacted in the 1980s enabling local authorities to establish corporate companies under their own agency, and to shift to them the entire responsibility for running certain public transport operations. The motivation is often to increase efficiency, productivity and profitability in these operations, although there is a risk that planning and operation may become fragmented under such organisational reforms, making it difficult to maintain coordination in planning and to ensure the provision of an integrated service.

Our empirical evidence indicates a quantile-dependent cointegrating relationship between government expenditures and revenues. In addition, this paper examines the long-run causality relationship between expenditures and revenues by using the vector error-correction (VEC) model with coefficients based on the different quantiles.

This paper derives a pricing formula using a reduced form model in order to appraise the MSR's breakeven servicing fee. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applications of this reduced-form pricing formula in deriving the breakeven servicing fee and analyzing profits of an MSR. We also provide numerical sensitivity analysis results for operational and state variables to show how the breakeven servicing fee changes with respect to various operational conditions and economic circumstances. Results reveal that changes in the breakeven servicing fee depend mainly on direct servicing costs, the initial interest rate, and the volatility of the interest rate. Our model can assist financial institutions and regulators in evaluating fair servicing fees and in turn improve the management of the various risks of an MSR in response to changing economic conditions and operating costs.

Our method explicitly accounts for survey respondents' reluctance to reveal a willingness to accept which is smaller than the actual compensation. We apply our approach to the case of the 2005 European agricultural reform using uniquely gathered survey data from farmers in Lower Saxony, Germany. We find empirical indications for strategic misreporting. Correcting for these effects with a structural model, we find that information rents are in the order of up to 14% of total compensation paid.

Specifically, the risk-adjusted financial performance of 103 socially responsible bond funds in the US and the Eurozone is compared with a matched sample of conventional funds. During the period 2001-2014, socially responsible bond funds outperform by one-half of one percent annually. An evaluation of fund holdings and a performance-attribution analysis suggest that this outper-formance is directly related to the mitigation of ESG risks, which is achieved by the exclusion of corporate bond issuers with poor corporate social responsibility activities. A separation of crisis and non-crisis periods further indicates that the outperformance is especially likely to occur during recessions or bear market periods. We confirm this crisis-related return effect from a sample of socially screened bond indices.

This is particularly important in the context of the paradigm of mobilities and the idea of sustainable development. Contemporary urban planning has yet to find a satisfactory answer to the question of how to diminish the negative consequences of individual transport without placing inordinate limitations on the natural human desire for mobility. It would seem that the increasingly negative effects of car use - for which bus transport provides no attractive alternative - are fast creating a need for a means of public transport that is not only separated from street traffic, but that is also effective and environmentally friendly. These requirements are met to the fullest extent by light rail systems such as trams, tram-trains and various hybrid solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In China, the development of HSR network has progressed rapidly since the first line commenced operation in 2008. As an important component of this network, Jiangsu province proposed an ambitious HSR construction program which planned to cover over 95% of its counties by 2030. Reduced travel time for passengers is one of the most important effects of HSR, and therefore this study aims to analyze the accessibility impact of the evolving HSR network in Jiangsu province from 2010-2030. A layered cost distance method, based on a door-to-door approach, is proposed to evaluate the present and future accessibility at a more detailed geographical level. The results demonstrate that, with the gradual development of the HSR network, accessibility levels across the province will be improved by about 9.6%, and the distribution of the gains will be uneven since the most significant improvements will occur in the more peripheral areas. The inequality in regional accessibility will decrease by an average of 25.7%, which will produce a more homogeneous accessibility landscape. In addition, several policy measures are suggested in order to further enhance the competitiveness of the HSR network in the transport market at a regional level. This extended period of exploratory and detailed analysis is expected to facilitate proactive public policy decisions related to improving the transport network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Regardless of the quality of the underlying assets, it is impossible to make reliable statements regarding the future performance of a synthetic CDO tranche.

The share issuance measure which is the annual logarithmic change in shares outstanding that is adjusted for distribution events is not significantly related to expected equity returns in a univariate setting.

After controlling for book-to-market, size and momentum factors, there is a significantly negative relation between share issuance and expected returns, especially for longer return horizons.

A biofuel mandate is compared with a tax policy on conventional fuel and a benchmark case of a laissez-faire solution (the absence of biofuel as an energy source). This study also evaluates the interaction effects of a biofuel mandate when it is used simultaneously with a tax on conventional fuel. The evaluation of the relative efficiency of second-best energy policy alternatives, inspired from the French case, is based on a general equilibrium model taking into account the externalities due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The emissions come from conventional fuel refining and consumption as well as from biofuel use and the associated land-use changes. Using, French biodiesel data involving rapeseed for 2010, our numerical results show, on the one hand, that the tax policy on conventional fuel appears to be the best policy option in terms of welfare because it leads to significant reductions in GHG emissions. On the other hand, our numerical results show that the biofuel mandate is the worst policy option in terms of welfare. However, if the price of rapeseed in 2010 were low enough, then a combination of the tax on gasoline with a biofuel mandate would have been preferable to the tax on gasoline.","[Bayramoglu, Basak] INRA AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE EA 437, UPEM 77454, Marne La Vallee, France; [Jacques, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 09, LEDa CGEMP, Paris, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Bayramoglu, B (通讯作者)，INRA AgroParisTech, UMR Econ Publ 210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",Basak.Bayramoglu@grignon.inra.fr; Jean-Francois.Jacques@u-pem.fr,"Bayramoglu, Basak/X-1281-2019","Bayramoglu, Basak/0000-0002-0847-5858",,,,,40,0,0,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

South South cooperation is one of the instruments for engagement, and affinities between Brazil and African countries are invoked to justify the transfer of technology and public policies. In this article, we take the case of one of Brazil's development cooperation programs, More Food International (MFI), to illustrate why policy concepts and ideas that emerge in particular settings, such as family farming in Brazil, do not travel easily across space and socio-political realities. Taking a discourse-analytical perspective, we consider actors' narratives of family farming and the MFI program, and how these narratives navigate between Brazil and three African countries Ghana, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. We find that in Brazil, family farming has multiple meanings that expose contrasting visions of agricultural development as determined by history, geography and class-based power struggles. These multiple meanings are reflected in the disparate ways MFI is portrayed and practiced by Brazilian actors who emphasize commercial opportunity, political advocacy, or technological modernization. We also find that African countries adopt their own interpretations of family farming and MFI, and that these are more attuned with mercantilist and modernization perspectives, and less mindful of Brazil's domestic political struggles. This has prompted a reaction from those on the Brazilian side fighting for an alternative agricultural development trajectory. The significance of this reaction is yet to be determined.

On the one hand, investors are subject to the anchoring bias by viewing the 52-week high price as a reference point; on the other hand, the effect of the 52-week high price is stronger if it happened more recently, which is known as the recency bias. This paper examines the role of the 52-week high in explaining momentum profits in the Taiwan stock market by comparing two strategies that are related to anchoring and recency biases, respectively. We show that the profitability of the 52-week high strategy is attenuated by the considerably negative returns in January months, while the profitability of the recency strategy is not sensitive to the January seasonality. However, the recency strategy still displays predictable time-series patterns when conditioning variables are taken into consideration. It is profitable only during periods before 2000, expansionary periods, and up market states. Further investigations show that when all strategies are considered simultaneously, the 52-week high strategy plays a determinant role in generating momentum returns during the sample period from January 1982 to December 2012, while the recency strategy dominates the momentum profits in the 1970s. Overall, our results reveal mixed evidence for both strategies, suggesting the coexistence of the anchoring bias and the recency bias in the Taiwan stock market. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Given that we are dealing with the human aspect of the intangibles that drive the value created by a company, it is not obvious what impact the 'boom' and 'bust' phases of the economic cycle will have on investor valuations of this primary component of a company's investment in human capital (HC). Our results reveal that economic cycles have a substantial immediate impact on the value implications of compensation costs. Specifically, these value implications increase significantly during upticks in the economy and decline in the downturns, in high-tech as well as low-tech firms. Notwithstanding, the value implications of compensation costs are consistently higher for high-tech firms. Furthermore, the changes in value implications for high-tech firms throughout the economic trends are more volatile than those observed for low-tech firms. When differentiating between investors on and outside the exchange, we find consistently stronger value implications of compensation costs for the latter. It seems that throughout the economic cycle more informed and sophisticated investors have a higher assessment of the role of a firm's investment in HC in value creation. Another important implication of our results is that, in response to economic changes, investors modify their valuations of HC quickly rather than gradually, which is unexpected given the strategic value and complexity of the human aspect of the firm's intangibles.","[Gavious, Ilanit; Lahav, Yaron] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Russ, Meir] Univ Wisconsin, Austin E Cofrin Sch Business, Green Bay, WI 54302 USA",Ben Gurion University; University of Wisconsin System,"Gavious, I (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",madaril@bgu.ac.il,"Lahav, Yaron/ABB-6625-2020; Russ, Meir/AAT-8284-2020","Lahav, Yaron/0000-0003-4047-5134;",Frederick E.

This raises questions regarding the implications of strategic interaction between different authority levels concerning the regulation of these activities. We apply a bio-economic objective function where fishers and regulators have environmental, economic and social preferences, and where fishers are subject to the aggregate of the regulations set by the various authorities. We analyse one situation where EU authorities set their regulation first, followed by national authorities' regulation, and one situation where the two regulators set their regulations simultaneously. Using data from a survey on preferences among fisheries stakeholders combined with data from the UK nephrops fisheries, this study shows that a hierarchy of regulators with similar preferences will yield higher unit regulations, i.e. higher taxes or higher subsidies than a situation with one regulating authority. When regulators have unequal preferences we may get a situation where one regulator induces a tax on effort, whereas the other offers a subsidy. In this situation the aggregate unit regulation becomes uncertain.","[Aanesen, Margrethe; Armstrong, Claire W.] Arctic Univ Norway UiT, POB 6050, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Aanesen, M (通讯作者)，Arctic Univ Norway UiT, POB 6050, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",margrethe.aanesen@uit.no,,"Armstrong, Claire/0000-0002-1837-9165",EC-FP7 [212881],EC-FP7(European Union (EU)),"The research on which this paper is based was conducted as part of the EC-FP7 funded project Making the European Fisheries Ecosystem Plan Operational (MEFEPO) (Project # 212881).

We show that the ability of aggregate retail order imbalances, contrarian in nature, to predict short-term future returns is significantly enhanced during times of market stress, when market liquidity provisions decline. While a weekly rebalanced portfolio long in stocks purchased and short in stocks sold by retail investors delivers 19% annualized excess returns over a four-factor model from 2002 to 2010, it delivers up to 40% annualized returns in periods of high uncertainty. Despite this high aggregate performance, individual investors do not reap the rewards from liquidity provision because they experience a negative return on the day of their trade and they reverse their trades long after the excess returns from liquidity provision are dissipated. During the financial crisis, French active retail stock traders stepped up to the plate, increased stock holdings, and provided liquidity. In contrast, mutual fund investors fled from delegation by selling their mutual funds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Second, the hybrid approach offers statistically and economically significant out-of-sample benefits for investors who use factor models to construct optimal portfolios.

Realistic, high-dimensional macroeconomic learning problems, which entail parameter, model, and state learning, generate substantially different subjective beliefs about consumption dynamics compared to the standard, full-information rational expectations benchmark. Beliefs about long-run dynamics are volatile, with counter-cyclical conditional volatility, and drift over time. Embedding these beliefs in a standard asset pricing model significantly improves the model's ability to match the stylized facts, as well as the sample path of the market price-dividend ratio.","[Johannes, Michael; Lochstoer, Lars A.] Columbia Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, New York, NY USA; [Mou, Yiqun] Clarke Capital Management, Skokie, IL USA",Columbia University,"Johannes, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,47,43,45,2,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

It is widely recognised that cycling plays a prominent role in sustainable transport. However, research has largely focused on cycling substituting motorised transport. This study explores how cycling forms part of multimodal transport behaviour based on survey data on transport modes and travel purposes and the weekly frequency of out-of-home activities and travel mode use in a representative sample of adult Danes (n = 1957). The following five distinct multimodal travel segments or 'modality styles' are identified: 'education transport'; 'public-based transport'; 'limited transport'; 'bicycle-based transport'; and 'car-based transport'. Travel behaviour is predominantly multimodal with few unimodal car-drivers being identified. Substantial cycling takes place in all modality styles, and is embedded in a multimodal behaviour as the modality style combined cycling with several other modes. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that cycling serves many purposes that transgress the division of utility cycling and recreational cycling, and that cycling takes place in both dense urban settings and small towns. Thus, the way in which travel modes relate to the urban environment and variations in modality styles must serve as the starting point for policies aiming to fulfil the potential of multimodal transport behaviour and promote cycling.

Our major finding is that while commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and consumer loans respond to monetary policy asymmetrically according to theoretical predictions, mortgage loans show a reverse asymmetric response. In other words, while other loans are more responsive to contractionary than to expansionary shifts in monetary policy of the same magnitude, mortgage loans tend to respond inversely. Contrary to the bank lending channel predictions, expansionary monetary policy increases mortgage loan growth more than contractionary monetary policy of the same magnitude reduces this growth. We find that this reverse asymmetric response of mortgage loans is mainly driven by the securitization of these loans. Further, we show that this result is most pronounced for single-family home mortgages.","[Termos, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Saad, Mohsen] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Beirut; American University of Sharjah,"Termos, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",at36@aub.edu.lb; msaad@aus.edu,"Saad, Mohsen/AAF-5572-2021","Saad, Mohsen/0000-0002-5917-4318",,,,,38,4,4,0,16,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

We conduct an experimental online vignette study with a German sample to investigate how voters' acceptance of a political decision depends on the process through which it is reached. For a set of different issues, we investigate how acceptance varies depending on whether the decision is the result of a direct-democratic institution, a party in a representative democracy, or an expert committee. Our results show that for important issues, direct democracy generates greater acceptance; this finding holds particularly for those voters who do not agree with a collectively chosen outcome. However, if the topic is of limited importance to the voters, acceptance does not differ between the mechanisms. Our results imply that a combination of representative democracy and direct democracy, conditional on the distribution of issue importance among the electorate, may be optimal with regard to acceptance of political decisions.","[Towfigh, Emanuel V.; Goerg, Sebastian J.; Gloeckner, Andreas; Llorente-Saguer, Aniol; Bade, Sophie; Kurschilgen, Carlos] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Towfigh, Emanuel V.] EBS Univ Business & Law, Chair Publ Law Empir Legal Res & Law & Econ, EBS Law Sch, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Towfigh, Emanuel V.] EBS Univ Business & Law, Dept Management & Econ, EBS Business Sch, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Goerg, Sebastian J.] Florida State Univ, Coll Social Sci & Publ Policy, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Gloeckner, Andreas] Univ Hagen, Inst Psychol, Hagen, Germany; [Leifeld, Philip] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Leifeld, Philip] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Leifeld, Philip] Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Llorente-Saguer, Aniol] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Bade, Sophie] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham, Surrey, England",Max Planck Society; European Business School (EBS) University; European Business School (EBS) University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Fern University Hagen; University of Glasgow; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Bern; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Towfigh, EV (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.;Towfigh, EV (通讯作者)，EBS Univ Business & Law, Chair Publ Law Empir Legal Res & Law & Econ, EBS Law Sch, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.;Towfigh, EV (通讯作者)，EBS Univ Business & Law, Dept Management & Econ, EBS Business Sch, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.",towfigh@coll.mpg.de,"Towfigh, Emanuel V./I-8564-2012; Glöckner, Andreas/B-8897-2011; Goerg, Sebastian J./AAL-4475-2020","Towfigh, Emanuel V./0000-0001-6323-8540; Glöckner, Andreas/0000-0002-7766-4791; Goerg, Sebastian J./0000-0002-1740-6870; Llorente-Saguer, Aniol/0000-0001-8704-5284",Max Planck Society (Max Planck Digital Library),Max Planck Society (Max Planck Digital Library),"Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society (Max Planck Digital Library).

One reason is the growing recognition that, in seeking explanations for rising income inequality, we need to look not only at wages and earned income but also at income from capital, particularly at the top of the distribution. In this paper, we use evidence from existing data sources to attempt to answer three questions: (i) What is the share of total personal wealth that is owned by the top 1 per cent, or the top 0.1 per cent? (ii) Is wealth much more unequally distributed than income? (iii) Is the concentration of wealth at the top increasing over time? The main conclusion of the paper is that the evidence about the UK concentration of wealth post-2000 is seriously incomplete and significant investment in a variety of sources is necessary if we are to provide satisfactory answers to the three questions.","[Alvaredo, Facundo] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.; Morelli, Salvatore] Oxford Martin Sch, INET, Oxford, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Morelli, Salvatore] Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy",Paris School of Economics; University of Oxford; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Naples Federico II,"Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.;Alvaredo, F; Atkinson, AB; Morelli, S (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, INET, Oxford, England.;Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.;Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.;Morelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy.",alvaredo@pse.ens.fr; tony.atkinson@nuffield.ox.ac.uk; salvatore.morelli@unina.it,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Morelli, Salvatore/AAA-6202-2021","Morelli, Salvatore/0000-0002-1935-3565",Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); European Research Council (ERC); Economic and Social Research Council / Department for International Development (ESRC-DFID) joint fund [ES/I033114/1]; ESRC [ES/I033114/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council / Department for International Development (ESRC-DFID) joint fund; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is an outgrowth of the larger project 'Top Wealth Shares in the UK since 1896' by the same authors.

To explain this, the paper focuses on external demand and overseas production. Our model shows that a small change in the exchange rate has no effect on exports because of the fixed costs associated with shifting the plant location to other countries. It also implies that a change in the exchange rate has a significant effect on exports either when depreciation coincides with strong external demand or when appreciation coincides with weak external demand. We examine the validity of these theoretical implications through estimating a simple export function in Japan and calibrating our export function. Both of the experiments confirm that the model can track Japan's exports reasonably well, especially after the new policy regime started.","[Fukuda, Shin-ichi; Doita, Tsutomu] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Fukuda, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",sfukuda@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JSPS KAKENHI Grant [26285044, 15K13003]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K13003, 26285044] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Etsuro Shioji, Cesar M.

However, individual published impact assessments typically focus on only one program and one outcome. This article presents two-year impacts of the Zambian Government's Child Grant, an unconditional CT to families with children under age 5, across a wide range of domains including consumption, productive activity, and women and children's outcomes, making this one of the first studies to assess both protective and productive impacts of a national unconditional CT program. We show strong impacts on consumption, food security, savings, and productive activity. However, impacts in areas such as child nutritional status and schooling depend on initial conditions of the household, suggesting that cash alone is not enough to solve all constraints faced by these poor, rural households. Nevertheless, the apparent transformative effects of this program suggest that unconditional transfers in very poor settings can contribute to both protection and development outcomes.","[Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, CB 3435,Abernethy Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Handa, Sudhanshu] UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, Social & Econ Policy, Piazza SS Annunziata 12, I-50122 Florence, Italy; [Seidenfeld, David] Amer Inst Res Int Dev Evaluat & Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St,NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Davis, Benjamin] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Agr Dev Econ Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Tembo, Gelson] Palm Associates, 56 Jesmondine, Lusaka 11506, Zambia",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Istituto degli Innocenti; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Handa, S (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, CB 3435,Abernethy Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;Handa, S (通讯作者)，UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, Social & Econ Policy, Piazza SS Annunziata 12, I-50122 Florence, Italy.;Seidenfeld, D (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Res Int Dev Evaluat & Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St,NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA.;Davis, B (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations, Agr Dev Econ Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.;Tembo, G (通讯作者)，Palm Associates, 56 Jesmondine, Lusaka 11506, Zambia.",shanda@email.unc.edu; dseidenfeld@air.org; Benjamin.davis@fao.org; tembogel@gmail.com,,"Daidone, Silvio/0000-0002-1789-5635",,,,,43,29,31,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Popular arguments attribute these episodes to relatively high growth rates of money, which were then primarily explained by China's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the undervaluation of RMB. We attempt to explain China's high monetary growth rates through the supply of land. Under China's land system, the supply of land is controlled by the government and can be viewed as exogenous to the monetary system. An increase in the money supply stimulates bank loans and thereby monetary growth. Both an error correction model and a simultaneous equations model are developed to explore the effect of the land supply on monetary growth. The empirical results show that the effect of the land supply on the money supply is significantly positive and even exceeds that of foreign exchange reserves. The significance for monetary policy is that, under China's existing political economy, both the central bank and local governments should be responsible for monetary policy and price levels.

However, potential fiscal gains are also important: tax revenues are crucial in all kinds of amnesties. Nevertheless, over the last thirty years an average of 24% of all applications have been rejected. It remains an open question as to why governments accept this loss of fiscal base. We argue that applying for amnesty is basically self-incrimination, and that immigration-averse governments have an incentive to use applications as a means to identify. and expel illegal workers. In equilibrium only applicants with the highest income are granted amnesty, while the poorest immigrants do not apply, and fiscal revenues remain sub-optimal. We show that electoral accountability can solve the commitment problem. However, the large number of rejections suggests that the strict voter-coordination required by this mechanism is hard to obtain in practice. Therefore immigration amnesties seem doomed to inefficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It thereby provides a link between the literature on monetary policy committees and central bank monetary policy implementation through monetary rules. Using a novel dataset of the idiosyncratic characteristics of FOMC members, over the period from August 1979 to February 2014, the empirical findings show that characteristics such as education, age, and, to a lesser extent, work experience are not important in understanding the FOMC decision-making process. Instead, the results point to the importance of time spent within the Federal Reserve System, tenure on the FOMC itself, and the influence of the Chair in shaping the decision making process. The results are expected to have implications for the capacity of economic agents, as well as various markets in the economy, to more readily interpret public (monetary policy) information that reaches them. This makes the monetary policy decision process less noisy and thus enhances the capability of agents and markets to attach the correct weight to this information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This generates isolated pockets of areas which are difficult to reach through the transport system. To address this accessibility problem, we have developed a novel approach to systematically examine the current urban land use and road network conditions as well as to identify poorly connected regions, using GPS data collected from taxis. This method is composed of four major steps. First, city-wide passenger travel demand patterns and travel times are modeled based on GPS trajectories. Upon this model, high density residential regions are then identified, and measures to assess accessibility of each of these places are developed. Next, the regions with the lowest level of accessibility among all the residential areas are detected, and finally the detected regions are further examined and specific transport situations are analyzed. By applying the proposed method to the Chinese city of Harbin, we have identified 20 regions that have the lowest level of accessibility by car among all the identified residential areas. A serious reachability problem to petrol stations has also been discovered, in which drivers from 92.6% of the residential areas have to travel longer than 30 min to refill their cars. Furthermore, the comparison against a baseline model reveals the capacity of the derived measures in accounting for the actual travel routes under divergent traffic conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting car-based accessibility problems, contributing towards the development of urban road networks into a system that has better reachability and more reduced inequity.

By the same token, in a context of spatially concentrated income-earning opportunities and other urban functions, as well as limited purchasing power, accessibility to adequate means of connectivity with the rest of the urban fabric can be a determining factor in overcoming conditions of poverty for residents in physically marginal areas. Within the framework of the splintering urbanism thesis, and using the case study of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Bogota, Colombia's capital city, we examine the apparent mismatch between the growth of low-income informal settlements in peripheral locations and the development of transport networks in the period 2000-2010. Our aim is to identify the effects on social and spatial marginalisation of an uneven provision of material infrastructures and services for mobility.

Firms with higher debt concentration at the start of the case are more likely to file prearranged bankruptcy plans, to move quickly through the restructuring process, and to emerge successfully as independent going concerns. Moreover, higher ownership concentration within a debt class is associated with higher recovery rates to that class. Trading of claims during bankruptcy concentrates ownership further, but this trading is not associated with subsequent improvements in bankruptcy outcomes and could, at the margin, increase the likelihood of liquidation.

However, decades of environmental valuation studies evidence the economic benefits of other forest ecosystem services different than carbon, and there is no evidence on how these economic benefits differ in countries where REDD is to be implemented. To respond to this question, we conduct a global meta-analysis of forest primary studies published over the past 30 years in which we estimate the economic benefits related to different forest ecosystem services in targeted REDD countries, and discuss the implications of considering these economic figures in REDD decision making. A systematic review of the scientific literature leads to the selection of 52 original studies to conduct a meta-analysis on 205 observations. We obtain that the economic benefits of forest ecosystem services in REDD countries are always greater than in other countries, and provide economic ranges of services to serve as a reference to REDD decision making in relation to co-benefits and opportunity costs. The results have implications for future avoided deforestation programs, which should take co-benefits into account in order to better articulate payments for ecosystems and create proper incentives for forest conservation and sustain local livelihoods.

We address this issue in this paper by studying how entrepreneurs obtain access to electricity in Lebanon, showing that the hybrid political order imposes a high cost on electricity. We furthermore find that a hybrid political order channels entrepreneurial talent into lobbying and bribery. The key constraint that emerges from the hybrid political order in this case is the corrupt organisation of governance of the electricity sector. This results in higher prices (because bribes for contracts have to be earned back) in entrenchment of oligopolies, because contracts often come with political protection.","[Stel, Nora] Univ Utrecht, Maastricht Sch Management, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stel, Nora] Univ Utrecht, Ctr Conflict Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Naude, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Naude, Wim] Maastricht Sch Management, POB 120, NL-6201 BE Maastricht, Netherlands; [Naude, Wim] IZA Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",Utrecht University; Maastricht University; Utrecht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Naudé, W (通讯作者)，Maastricht Sch Management, POB 120, NL-6201 BE Maastricht, Netherlands.",w.naude@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Naudé, Wim/E-3812-2017","Naudé, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945",,,,,48,13,16,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The IPCC's assessment of the impacts of climate change on agriculture all but ignores human agency and human ingenuity. The statement in the SPM on violent conflict is much stronger than in the chapter and indeed the literature. AR5 ignores the literature on the impacts of climate change on cold-related mortality and morbidity. On poverty traps, WG2 reaches a conclusion that is not supported by the cited papers. The total impacts of climate change were assessed in four subsequent IPCC reports. Although there are no statistically significant differences between the assessment periods in the underlying literature, the subsequent SPMs reach very different conclusions.

The aim of this article is to identify young people preference for buying IT & C products from companies that distribute them across multiple channels. In this regard, an exploratory research was conducted on a sample of 340 students. The main results showed the high frequency use of Internet as a means of searching the information needed for purchasing IT & C products, the low share of exclusively online purchase, the fact that they are being perceived by students as both a need and a desire, and the weak expression of views about products purchased in the virtual environment. Price and quality are the main criteria in choosing them. Originality of this article is determined by identifying students' preference for firms practicing multi-channel distribution strategy for IT & C products.

One of the key objectives of the banking sector reforms in China has therefore been to reduce the high level of NPLs. To do so, Chinese regulatory authorities have injected significant capital into the banking system and scrutinized NPLs since 2003. This paper examines the impact of NPLs on bank behavior in China. Using a threshold panel regression model-and a dataset covering 60 city commercial banks, 16 state-owned banks and joint-stock banks, and 11 rural commercial banks during 2006-2012, we test whether lending decisions of Chinese banks exhibit moral hazard. The results support the moral hazard hypothesis, suggesting that an increase in the NPLs ratio raises riskier lending, potentially causing further deterioration of the loan quality and financial system instability.

Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and analysis of variance were used to evaluate data using statistical software. Chi-square statistics identify significant differences in enterprise characteristics through examining firm size, location, gender ownership, type and age. An analysis of variance indicates significant differences in business performance across small, medium and large enterprises in term of input and output ratios. Obstacles facing firms are largely similar regardless of firm size in eleven of the sixteen business-obstacles surveyed. Results reveal that large enterprises perceive more challenges with telecommunication services, customs, trade regulations, and corruption, while small and medium firms face greater constraints gaining access to land and finance. This study is useful in helping to design policies that can efficiently support small and medium food and agribusiness enterprise development.","[Ali, Jabir] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Sitapur Rd, Prabandh Nagar 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Ali, J (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Sitapur Rd, Prabandh Nagar 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jabirali@iiml.ac.in,"Ali, Jabir/I-1955-2019","Ali, Jabir/0000-0002-5891-568X",,,,,54,15,15,3,28,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

An original dataset of African migrants living in Johannesburg is used. As South Africa attracts both economic and forced migrants, we focus on the impact of the reason of emigration (violence versus economic concerns) on migrants' remittance behaviour. On the extensive margin, the results show that leaving a home country for reasons of violence decreases the probability of remitting to the home country. On the intensive margin, transferred amounts do not differ according to whether the migrant was forced to migrate or not. When the migrant has decided to remit, it is more his/her current conditions in the host country and traditional factors (income, education, sex, etc.) that determine the amounts transferred. Our results are robust when restricting the definition of forced migration.","[Arestoff, Florence] Univ Paris 09, PSL, LEDa, DIAL UMR225, F-75016 Paris, France; [Kuhn-Le Braz, Melanie] Direct Marches Etud & Prospect, FranceAgriMer, 12 Rue Henri Rol Tanguy TSA 20002, F-93555 Montreuil, France; [Mouhoud, El Mouhoub] IRD, LEDa, DIAL UMR225, F-75010 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Kuhn-Le Braz, M (通讯作者)，Direct Marches Etud & Prospect, FranceAgriMer, 12 Rue Henri Rol Tanguy TSA 20002, F-93555 Montreuil, France.",melanie.kuhn1@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,18,2,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The aim of this paper is to analyze cross-industry collaborations between the food and pharmaceutical sectors in the convergence area of functional foods. Selected companies from food (Nestle/Danone) and pharmaceutical (Martek/Bayer HealthCare) sectors are analyzed using the determinants of motivation and industrial scope. The analysis shows that food companies are more active in cross-industry collaborations than pharmaceutical companies. The latter are more active at the front-end of the value chain focusing on research and development, and delivering their ingredients to food companies that due to their higher expertise in consumer marketing launch the products. While the first cross-industry collaborations were based on an exploration motivation, those that follow focus on exploitation. Acquisitions and licensing agreements are dominant in inside-out and outside-in processes, whereas strategic alliances and joint ventures are based on a coupled process between the food and pharmaceutical sectors.","[Bornkessel, Sabine] Univ Appl Sci Osnabruck, Oldenburger Landstr 62, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany; [Broering, Stefanie] Univ Bonn, Technol & Innovat Management Agribusiness, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Omta, S.

The recession's effects are nonetheless apparent in the notable fraction of homeowners who moved involuntarily due to, for example, foreclosure. Many involuntary moves appear to stem from a combination of negative home equity and adverse economic shocks rather than negative equity alone. Homeowners with both negative equity and economic shocks were substantially more likely to have moved between 2007 and 2009 and to have moved involuntarily. The findings suggest that, analogous to the double-trigger theory of default, the relationship between negative equity and household mobility varies with households' exposure to adverse shocks.

For example, the complex network approach focuses on network robustness and resilience due to route interruptions during a relatively short period. Also seasonal interruptions of air routes are a well-documented phenomenon in the context of demand variability. However, only recently discussions emerge on the more permanent cessation of air routes, the route churn. Today, European low-cost carriers frequently apply route churn in their networks. To enable early route churn detection in these networks, a regression model is developed in which route characteristics explain the churning likelihood of individual routes. The results of the econometric analysis show that churn rates are higher during an economic downturn, within the Eastern European market, between the Eastern and the Mediterranean market and between primary airports. In addition, we find that distance and the number of seats offered have a significant negative effect on the churn likelihood. The results also show significant effects of market share, seasonality and route age on the chance of cessation. To conclude, the paper demonstrates substantial differences in churn behaviour amongst specific low-cost carriers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the 10 managers revealed aspects regarding popular risk management techniques applied in Romania IT industry and strategies for risk mitigation to company development. The first research question was set to find out what is the opinion of the ICT industry's specialist regarding the online environment and the business opportunities of this field in the Romanian context compared with the international context. The second research question was set to find out if the ICT specialists have a standard procedure regarding the risk and opportunity identification process in their field of expertise. The third research question was set in order to bring to light the real life experiences regarding risk aspects that the ICT specialists encountered through their career.

The model is based on two main intellectual capital characteristics namely, the employee's positive traits (courage, interpersonal skills, wisdom, positive experience, leadership skills) and personal strengths (self-efficacy, expertise, optimism). In this research we investigated the most widely used models for information security and we analysed these models by identifying their weaknesses and strengths and we finally compared these methods to the research's proposed model and argued about the effectiveness of the model as compared to existing ones.","[El-Den, Jamal; Dangi, Kumar] Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Engn & IT, Darwin, NT, Australia",Charles Darwin University,"El-Den, J (通讯作者)，Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Engn & IT, Darwin, NT, Australia.",jamal.el-den@cdu.edu.au; msg2kumar007@gmail.com,"El-Den, Jamal/N-2078-2013","El-Den, Jamal/0000-0003-4059-5451",,,,,30,1,1,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,79,86,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300010,0

The group analyzed consists of Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and Spain. The Panel-STAR model evaluated in the study allows modeling and testing heterogeneity and nonlinearity simultaneously within the nonlinear STAR methodology. The difference of the Panel-STAR models analyzed in the study from the Panel-STR models is, they allow dynamic effects. The motive behind proposing dynamic modelling of heterogeneous Panel-STAR models is related to the fact that CO2 emissions are an accumulated process which possess path-dependence to the history of the emissions and economic growth. Both variables are integrated of order 1 due to serial panel unit root tests. For the data, Panel-STAR type nonlinearity cannot be rejected. The empirical findings suggest that various thresholds could be obtained and the rejection of linearity is strongest for the Panel-STAR model with the transition variable taken as the emissions growth rate. A second-best model is also estimated by taking the transition variable as the rate of economic growth. The empirical fmdings suggest that i. the effects of economic growth on emissions growth cannot be rejected in both regimes, ii. in both regimes, the effect is positive in contrast to EKC type theoretical expectations, iii. the positive effects of economic growth are lower in the second regime suggesting asymmetry, iv. after achieving a threshold of emissions' growth, though the political commitment against environmental degradation exists, the growth of CO2 emissions is partially slowed and the relation is not reversed.

The literature shows that individuals provide biased information both to administrative agencies and household surveys. The effects of tax evasion could thus influence the income inequality computed in official statistics. In this paper, I investigate whether tax evasion generates a bias when inequality indices are computed using household survey data. To achieve this, I apply a parametric model of the Dagum type (three parameters) on the gross personal income of 27 European countries, distinguishing between the self-employed and employees. Subsequently, the parameters computed in the model are used as dependent variables in seemingly unrelated regressions. I find that for the self-employed, tax evasion tends to reduce inequality as measured by regular wage statistics. Thus, the results reveal that tax evasion distorts inequality indices, generating an underground inequality.","[Fantozzi, Roberto] Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Rome, Italy",,"Fantozzi, R (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,271,306,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024012,0.0,,,36,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400011,0

The main research problem investigated what motivates young people towards their current and future employment, in particular in tourism, and how recognition of these motivating factors can change the managerial approach. A questionnaire survey using Kovach's job-related motivators was applied (Kovach, 1987). The research was conducted in the higher education institutions that were enrolling students on tourism and hospitality courses and are located in the North of Poland, in Tricity, which is a well-known tourist destination. The study results demonstrate the importance of rates of pay, an intrinsic interest in a particular job and the opportunities for advancement and career development offered as the main motivating factors for undergraduate students of tourism and hotel management. These job-related motivators need special managerial attention when motivational strategies are drawn up to attract the young and to reduce the number of those who leave the industry after graduation. The findings contribute to the literature on tourism and hospitality management by providing a more thorough understanding of the factors that are crucial in shaping students' motivation with respect to their work and their intention to work in the industry after graduation. Practical recommendations for managers have been also formulated. The value of the research is connected with the fact that the findings contribute to understanding how to develop the intellectual capital of future workforce for the tourism sector by using motivating instruments. It is the one of the few attempts in Poland to measure motivating factors among tourism and hospitality students, and to the authors' best knowledge, one of the limited that use Kovach's job-related motivators. This study gives an opportunity to compare the findings and to discover potential differences in students' motivation towards work related also to a cultural and social context.","[Grobelna, Aleksandra; Marciszewska, Barbara] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Grobelna, A (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",aleksandra.grobelna@gmail.com; marciszewb@wp.pl,"Grobelna, Aleksandra/R-3357-2018; Marciszewska, Barbara/X-8540-2018","Grobelna, Aleksandra/0000-0002-1765-6757; Marciszewska, Barbara/0000-0002-7952-889X",,,,,51,18,18,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,95,103,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300012,0

In B2B environment where personalized interactions matter most in influencing customers purchasing behaviour, it is imperative that relationship marketing and knowledge management co-exists in symbiotic manner. Instead of over-relying on information systems as a single source of capturing explicit customer knowledge, marketers have went to great lengths in extracting tacit customer knowledge from their sales representatives into explicit knowledge that can be utilized firm-wide. These market oriented activities complements the traditional knowledge management practices of deploying firm-specific resources, or also known as the 'inside-out' approach. The market orientation perspective is assumed to be deeply concentrated on the marketer's identification and response to customer needs, which information being communicated are frequently referred as customer intelligence or customer knowledge. Despite various iterations of market orientation construct being tested in different organizational settings, empirical research on market orientation at the individual level has been insufficient. Thus, this research intends to validate the sub-dimensions of the Individual Market Orientation construct by using factor analysis of the adopted I-MARKOR scale. A total of 539 sets of questionnaire were collected from B2B sales representatives from local and foreign banks operating in Kuala Lumpur. Prior to that, the items were content validated by nine academic experts in the field of marketing and workplace behaviour, whereby several items were amended and removed. By using factor analysis on the dimensions of Individual Market Orientation, three factors were extracted (i.e. information acquisition, information dissemination, coordination of strategic response), explaining 62.1% of the variance in the model. These findings demonstrate construct validity of the individual market orientation scales, indicating that the instrument can be reliably used for future research. In terms of practical implications, marketers may use the scale to evaluate their sales representatives' individual market orientation traits to ensure that they have the necessary competencies in treating customer knowledge as collective knowledge rather than individualistic knowledge. Without doubt, such behaviours are mutually beneficial to the firm, its employees and its customers.","[Hamzah, Muhammad Iskandar; Othman, Abdul Kadir; Hassan, Faridah] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Hamzah, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",iskandar68@gmail.com,"Hamzah, Muhammad Iskandar/R-2003-2019; Othman, Abdul Kadir/S-3126-2019; Othman, Abdul Kadir Kadir/J-6264-2014","Hamzah, Muhammad Iskandar/0000-0002-8794-2409; Othman, Abdul Kadir/0000-0001-5174-573X;",Fundamental Research Grant Scheme - Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia,Fundamental Research Grant Scheme - Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia,"This work was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme awarded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, and managed by the Innovation and Research Management Institute, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia.",,23,0,0,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,367,374,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300044,0

The essence of the modern era can be described using the concepts of wealth and speed. The current social, philosophical and economic theories only cope with the analysis of the concept of wealth. The theme of speed and acceleration has remained completely outside their field of vision. Economic and social sciences and philosophy are able to convey a lot of about wealth, but until recently, they have not been able to tell almost anything about speed. The problem of speed has a more prominent place in economic and social sciences. However, without the fact of accelerating, it is not possible to imagine and theoretically grasp the modern era at all. The absence of problems of speed and acceleration in economic and social sciences is perplexing because the speed of our modern societies has become one of the highest values and one of the most important requirements of the present time. The notion of speed does not yet have a clear and usable definition, and it lacks systematic economic and social analysis. It seems, therefore, that it is necessary to complement the existing theoretical reflection on the concept of globalization with another important fact, namely, the concept of speed. Speed is a key analytical tool for exploring hitherto neglected dromologic dimension of globalization. The main paper's aim is the analysis of new political economy of speed and its relation to the globalization.","[Hauer, Tomas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Social Sci, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Hauer, T (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Social Sci, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",tomas.hauer@vsb.cz,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,2,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

In this paper we take a perspective of national accounts to investigate the question of macroeconomic imbalances connected with the European sovereign debt crisis. More specifically we utilize the methodology of sectoral balances lying behind Flow of Funds statistics and Post Keynesian macroeconomic analysis. We use a simplified, highly consolidated accounting model of an economy consisting of three sectors i.e. domestic private sector of households and firms, government sector and foreigner sector. Since every debtor has to have a creditor by definition, the interconnections among sectoral financial balances get interesting views and implications for Eurozone's housekeeping, like deficits at periphery and surpluses at core countries or limitations on private sector balances by various fiscal constraints.","[Jonas, Jan; Kominek, Ondrej] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Jonás, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",jonas@econ.muni.cz; calton@mail.muni.cz,"Jonáš, Jan/ABH-9552-2020","Jonáš, Jan/0000-0003-0126-0712",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Thus, there is a need for methods for assessment of rail transport competitiveness and detection of areas for improvement. This paper presents a method developed for the Polish regional t-ransport market and verified according to the requirements of the British market. A numerical competitiveness evaluation, called Rail Transport Competitiveness Index, considers four criteria: journey duration, ticket price, service frequency and number of changes. Surveys in Poland and the United Kingdom have been carried out in order to assign relevant weights of importance to each criterion. The method has been applied on 18 routes in Pomerania Province, to create a map of rail transport competitiveness in the region. After necessary modifications, considering dynamic fares, it has been used for Milton Keynes-London route. Its universal nature makes it useful also for other countries, possibly after minor modifications.","[Jurewicz, Piotr] Rail Safety & Stand Board, Dept Res & Dev, London, England; [Kaszubowski, Daniel] Gdansk Univ Technol, Highway Engn Dept, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Jurewicz, P (通讯作者)，Rail Safety & Stand Board, Dept Res & Dev, London, England.",pkjurewicz@gmail.com; daniel.kaszubowski@wilis.pg.gda.pl,"Kaszubowski, Daniel/J-8075-2019","Kaszubowski, Daniel/0000-0002-7592-2865",,,,,11,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-26848-4; 978-3-319-26846-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,17,29,,10.1007/978-3-319-26848-4_3,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics; Transportation,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Transportation,BG0LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386325500003,0

However, uncertainty arising from violent conflict on farming choices lacks substantial academic attention. In this research we address the ramifications of conflict on household cropping choices, building on the notion of conflict resistant cropping systems introduced in Kibriya et al. 2014 and King et al. 2013. We argue that farming households' preferences change under conflict as they revert to a cropping system that minimizes losses. This novel concept is solidified by formulating a definition through rational choice theory. The theoretical expectations are verified through data obtained from 2300 smallholder farming households in North Kivu, DRC. A case study and propensity score matching methods are employed to demonstrate that conflict-affected households focus more on low-value crops that are less frequently stolen in order to maximize the probability of survival.","[Kibriya, Shahriar; Savio, Graham] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Conflict & Dev, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd,TAMU 2124, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Price, Edwin] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Conflict & Dev, Howard G Buffett Fdn Chair Conflict & Dev, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd,TAMU 2124, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [King, Joseph] Conflict & Dev Fdn, POB 10067, College Stn, TX 77842 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kibriya, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Conflict & Dev, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd,TAMU 2124, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",shahriar@tamu.edu; gpsavio@tamu.edu; ec-price@tamu.edu; kingjn@condevcenter.org,,,Howard G.

The paper presents short-term impact of food embargo and notes the influence of Russian rouble devaluation on mutual trade between EU and Russia.

Both start-ups and already established corporate entities are increasingly persecuting new opportunities, products, and business models in order to establish superiority above their competitive environment. The tendencies evince an optimist impact of entrepreneurial orientation on business performance, namely on financial performance. Beyond the aforementioned relationship, there are impulses such as environmental and organizational factors, which are affecting the businesses. The results of this study provide evidence of the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on business performance in a post-socialist context. We test the impact of three moderators on this bivariate relationship. In contrast to the substantial body of literature for Western markets, we contribute to minimizing the considerable gap of research in post-socialist economies. Entrepreneurial orientation as an organizational behavior may affect the financial performance of businesses differently in distinct market contexts. Both, internal and external factors are crucial to identifying, analyze and monitor, to achieve superior performance and to overcome competitors. This study builds upon a stratified sampling survey of Hungarian company owners and managers from the Amadeus database. The study uses a confirmatory, deductive approach. For the analysis, we rely on structural equation modeling using the PLS algorithm. Our study contributes to existing literature by means of confirming the entrepreneurial orientation to firm performance relationship for Hungary. In this context, we test the moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental hostility as environmental factors and firm age as an organizational factor. Environmental hostility is closely related to an unfavorable environment, deriving from rapid and radical changes in the industry, which are typical for post-soviet economies. In such dynamic environments, destructive innovations of the industrial actors appear more often. The results confirm that the internal and external factors have no significant influence on the entrepreneurial orientation to financial performance relationship.","[Kovacs, David; Urkmez, Taylan; Brockhaus, Dominik; Wagner, Ralf; Zulauf, Katrin] Univ Kassel, 1 Moenchebergstr St, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Kovacs, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, 1 Moenchebergstr St, D-34125 Kassel, Germany.",kovacsdavid009@gmail.com; uerkmez@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de; brockhaus@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de; rwagner@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de; zulauf@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de,"Wagner, Ralf/D-1389-2010",,,,,,32,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,383,394,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300031,0

Does national standardization require full centralization of individual assessment, or can a set of unbinding national guidelines reduce unwanted variation between regions? The case of this article is a national benefit norm for municipal social assistance payments issued by the Norwegian central government in 2001. A large share of municipalities changed their local norms to match the national norm in the following years, but data show that local benefit norms are uncorrelated with the actual payments. The apparent compliance to national guidelines does not translate into actual welfare generosity. Although caseworker discretion is important for individual payments, the municipal level of welfare payments is clearly influenced by local preferences and budget constraints. This implies that political control is active, but through other instruments than the local benefit norms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cycle tourism represents a concrete expression of sustainable tourism, geared not towards mass tourism or elite tourism, but toward more sustainable forms of holiday that allow low consumption of natural resources and a strong connection with the land, its culture and its traditions. In this sense, cycle tourism can lead to a range of effects on the local economy, ranging from positive economic and environmental impact to the nature conservancy and the diffusing capacity of virtuous behavior and good practices. The cycle tourism also has a longer term economic impact that is harder to quantify, both in marketing the territory's attractions and even in job creation. After all, bike-minded improvements in infrastructure and enforcement create healthier, more economically sound places not just to visit but also to live. The ability to capitalize on the potential offered by cycle tourism requires the presence of a network of local actors, both public and private, which actsynergistically to the success of the initiative. At a policy level, this implies the need to develop any projects in an integrated perspective, involving all the stakeholders of the territory. The most successful international experiences, analyzed in this study, show that the expansion of cycle tourism needs to be supported by original forms of public-private partnerships, oriented to build innovative and advanced forms of offer that combine entrepreneurial private interests with public development goals.","[Pavione, Enrica; Pezzetti, Roberta] Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Pavione, E (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",enrica.pavione@uninsubria.it; roberta.pezzetti@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,13,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,997,1006,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300083,0

One of the reasons is the fact that Chinese culture has preserved a unique medium that retains evidence about ancient Chinese society: namely the Chinese writing system reflects the history of shell money. The importance of shell money in the Chinese trade network is supported by the fact that the primary character for 'shell' was extensively used as a semantic component in secondary characters relating to money or trade.

But it is still more and more complicated to attract customers. One approach could be to target opinion leaders, win them, and let them communicate the marketing message instead of the company itself. This approach would require to identify opinion leaders. This paper investigates whether gender and personality traits can predict opinion leadership. Methodology/methods The paper can be perceived as a replication in a loose sense of the term, since it replicates only a part of a previously published model and it uses fewer items to measure relevant constructs. The Big Five Inventory is measured using a 10-question instrument as opposed to a 21-question one. Opinion leadership is measured using one question instead of nine; moreover, it is investigated separately as self-perceived in the eyes of others and in one's own opinion (two variables). Generalized linear models (GLM) and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are used to analyze data. Scientific aim The aim of the paper is to estimate impact of gender and personality traits on opinion leadership. Findings Extraversion is the personality trait closest related to opinion leadership regardless whether it is self-perceived in the eyes of others or in one's own opinion. Opinion leadership in one's own opinion can be predicted even using neuroticism, and conscientiousness. The three traits are consistent with previous findings. Unlike in previous research, openness to experience was not significant. Averages of two self-evaluations are the same, although the correlation is not 1.0, but Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is 0.7. The difference in these two evaluations is significantly influenced by openness to experience. Conclusions From six investigated factors, extraversion has the highest influence on self-perceived opinion leadership. Since extraversion can be identified also through observation, the finding has also a practical implication.","[Sudzina, Frantisek] Univ Chem Technol, Tech 5, Prague 16628, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Sudzina, F (通讯作者)，Univ Chem Technol, Tech 5, Prague 16628, Czech Republic.",sudzinaf@vscht.cz,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,229,236,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200027,0

J,"Thompson, O",,,,"Thompson, Owen",,,DRUG POLICY AND INTERGENERATIONAL INCOME MOBILITY IN THE UNITED STATES,CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INCARCERATION; EMPLOYMENT,"A conviction for drug possession blocks some of the most common pathways through which individuals from low income families achieve upward economic mobility in the United States, such as access to higher education, entry-level employment, and military service. These considerations are of growing importance because the number of drugrelated arrests have nearly quadrupled since 1980. This article estimates the effect of a conviction for drug possession on earnings mobility using a sample of individuals born between 1980 and 1984, some of the first cohorts to come of age in the context of intensive U.S. drug criminalization and enforcement. To distinguish the effect of a drug conviction from the effect of drug use or general criminality, I compare mobility among individuals with drug convictions to control groups who self-report significant drug use and who have had interactions with the criminal justice system that did not lead to a drug conviction. I find that relative to these groups, a drug conviction reduces the probability of transitioning upward from various points in the lower half of the income distribution by 10-15 percentage points, or as much as 50%, and that these effects are substantially stronger for non-whites than for whites. These findings suggest that a policy of decriminalizing nonviolent drug possession would substantially increase intergenerational mobility among low income populations, and this effect should be weighed alongside more conventional costs and benefits in formulating optimal drug policy.","[Thompson, Owen] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Thompson, O (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",thompsoo@uwm.edu,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

For evidence, we consider 26 years of the US patent record in biotechnology. We find that the creation of new combinations of components not only stimulates average usefulness, but also leads to a significantly higher likelihood of breakthroughs, while reducing the probability of failure. Interaction effects illustrate how reusing more familiar components continues to foster the creation of more useful and breakthrough inventions while lowering failure but only as long as the familiar components are recombined in unprecedented ways. Yet, more familiar components are less likely to be used in new combinations and as such are more likely to be associated with a familiarity trap. Our results therefore illustrate how inventive success and particularly breakthroughs require a difficult combination of the reuse of familiar components and recombinant creativity, i.e. the ability to recombine the familiar components in new ways.","[Arts, Sam] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Int Business Strategy & Econ, Fac Business & Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Veugelers, Reinhilde] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Fac Business & Econ, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Veugelers, Reinhilde] Bruegel, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium; [Veugelers, Reinhilde] CEPR, London, England",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Arts, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Int Business Strategy & Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Korte Nieuwstr 33, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",sam.arts@kuleuven.be; reinhilde.veugelers@kuleuven.be,"Arts, Sam/ABG-8398-2020","Arts, Sam/0000-0003-3214-7325","Flemish Science Foundation; Research Council of KU Leuven [GOA/12/003, G.0825.12]",Flemish Science Foundation(FWO); Research Council of KU Leuven(KU Leuven),"Financial support of the Flemish Science Foundation and the Research Council of KU Leuven is gratefully acknowledged (GOA/12/003, G.0825.12).

We use this result to develop a new option valuation model in which the underlying asset price exhibits volatility and jump intensity dynamics. The volatility and jump intensity dynamics in the model are directly driven by model-free empirical measures of diffusive volatility and jump variation. Because the empirical measures are observed in discrete intervals, our option valuation model is cast in discrete time, allowing for straightforward filtering and estimation of the model. Our model belongs to the affine class enabling us to derive the conditional characteristic function so that option values can be computed rapidly without simulation.

Finding Evidence in Administrative Data and the Implications for Value Added,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRIMARY-SCHOOLS; ACHIEVEMENT; QUALITY; END,"The federal government's Race to the Top competition has promoted the adoption of test-based value-added measures (VAMs) of performance as a component of teacher evaluations throughout many states, but the validity of these measures has been controversial among researchers and widely contested by teachers' unions. A key concern is the extent to which nonrandom sorting of students to teachers may bias the results and lead to a misclassification of teachers as high or low performing. In light of potential for bias, it is important to assess the extent to which evidence of sorting can be found in the large administrative data sets used for VAM estimation. Using a large longitudinal data set from an anonymous state, we find evidence that a nontrivial amount of sorting exists-particularly sorting based on prior test scores-and that the extent of sorting varies considerably across schools, a fact obscured by the types of aggregate sorting indices developed in prior research. We also find that VAM estimation is sensitive to the presence of nonrandom sorting. There is less agreement across estimation approaches regarding a particular teacher's rank in the distribution of estimated effectiveness when schools engage in sorting.

In response, UK governments have planned and (so far, partially) implemented a significant fiscal tightening to cut borrowing from a post-war high of over 10 per cent of GDP to a planned overall surplus. This fiscal tightening is heavily weighted towards spending cuts, which are expected to comprise 86 per cent of the measures. The spending measures imply not only a significant reduction in spending as a share of GDP but also a significant change in the composition of that spending - with benefits for pensioners, health care and schooling now taking up a much larger share of overall spending than they did pre-crisis. Overall, the new tax and benefit measures have included some welcome improvements to the structure of the system, but many of these have probably happened in spite of, rather than because of, the need for fiscal consolidation. Opportunities to make many significant improvements have been missed, while in other areas new policies have made the system less efficient and less coherent.","[Emmerson, Carl; Tetlow, Gemma] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Tetlow, Gemma] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Emmerson, C (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",carl_emmerson@ifs.org.uk; g.tetlow@ifs.org.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through grant entitled 'Combining Micro- and Macro-Economic Approaches to Fiscal Policy Evaluation'; Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy [RES-544-28-5001]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through grant entitled 'Combining Micro- and Macro-Economic Approaches to Fiscal Policy Evaluation'; Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank participants at the workshop on 'European Public Finances through the Financial Crisis' (ZEW, Mannheim, 10-11 June 2014), in particular Antoine Bozio and Paul Johnson, for useful advice and comments.

Unlike most previous work, we avoid assuming that agents simply have a taste for prestige, and instead model the material value of a prosocial reputation. The model predicts that, specifically, in small communities with low population turnover where reputation is important, volunteering will decline with age (as the end of the agent's reputational game approaches). In communities with higher turnover, this effect will not be observed. Our results support this hypothesis. The model also implies that the presence of a public good which must be provided voluntarily enhances trust in bilateral market and non-market interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A substantial literature has therefore studied how to make democracy consistent with group identity. We contribute to this literature by introducing the role of group decisiveness into voting incentives and mobilization of voters. In the elections that we study, for the same populations, accounting for income and other influences, group identity increased voter turnout on average by some 8 percentage points in local elections and decreased voter turnout by some 20 percentage points in national elections. We empirically investigate the effect of group identity on voter turnout and also evaluate whether group identity resulted in budgetary imbalance or replacement of local government because of dysfunctionality. Our contribution is to show how democracy can persist with group identity, although democracy in such instances differs from usual political competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier RV.

We build on model-based research as well as an up-to-date survey of natural gas resource availability. We find that natural gas is an abundant fossil fuel and that the Asia-Pacific region will be most important in future global natural gas markets, especially under stringent international climate change mitigation. This means that an increasingly large share of future natural gas trade flows and infrastructure expansions will be directed to the Asia-Pacific region and that the role of liquefied natural gas will continue to increase globally.

Without any reform, projected demographic transition implies a massive increase in government expenditures in the magnitude of 40% of total consumption at the peak. Gradually shifting earnings-related part of pension towards self-financed IRA, expenditures can be reduced by 20% of consumption, providing a major relief for the government budget. The reform generates a significant rise in capital, as individuals save more for retirement, which is invested for many years. As a result, wage, output and consumption are also higher, leading to a sizeable welfare gain in the intermediate and long-run. Current generations, however, can face a large welfare loss depending on how the transition is financed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This demand drives a premium on safe and liquid assets that the financial sector exploits by owning risky and illiquid assets and writing safe and liquid claims against them. The central prediction of the theory is that safe and liquid government debt should crowd out financial sector lending financed by short-term debt.

Repeated interaction among firms can eliminate wasteful rent- and revenue-seeking expenditures through cooperation. We show that while aggregate outcomes are equivalent under tariffs and quotas if cooperation arises, the conditions under which cooperation arises differ by policy. This difference arises because a firm must incur additional cost to physically import and distribute the goods associated with additional quota licenses, whereas there is no such cost when it comes to consuming additional tariff revenue. Thus, quotas and tariffs are non-equivalent. We provide a simple sufficient condition under which cooperative elimination of rent-seeking under quotas is easier than cooperative elimination of revenue-seeking under tariffs and therefore a quota is the preferred policy whenever the policy admits cooperation.","[Lake, James] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Umphrey Lee Ctr, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Linask, Maia K.] Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, 28 Westhampton Way, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",Southern Methodist University; University of Richmond,"Linask, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, 28 Westhampton Way, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",mlinask@richmond.edu,,"Lake, James/0000-0002-9452-1135",,,,,48,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2015,165.0,3-4,,,,,211,238,,10.1007/s11127-015-0304-5,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DD6ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370074300003,0

Analysis of borders of states with differing foreclosure laws reveals a discrete jump in foreclosure propensity as one enters nonjudicial states.

This interdependence, which links firms' asset and liability sides, can lead to short-termism in investment. In our model, financing frictions increase with the investment horizon, such that financing for long-term projects is relatively expensive and potentially rationed. In response, firms whose first-best investments are long-term may adopt second-best projects of shorter maturities. This worsens financing terms for firms with shorter-maturity projects, inducing them to change their investments as well. In equilibrium, investment is inefficiently short-term. Equilibrium asset-side adjustments by firms can amplify shocks and, while privately optimal, can be socially undesirable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This is a prediction of the anticommons model, in which numerous parties have authority to exclude others from using a resource. This model further predicts that when governments over-tax the base, private parties will underutilize the resource, and underutilization will be greater as the number of parties with exclusion rights rises. We test these predictions by studying cell phone taxation and local option tax authority, which allows some cities, counties, and special-purpose districts to levy taxes on cell phone use. Consistent with theory, we find that the tax rate on cell phone service is higher when local governments have the option to tax. Further, the percentage of households owning cell phones is lower when there is the local option to tax, and ownership rates fall with the number of taxes levied.","[Mitchell, Matthew] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd,4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, MSN 1D3, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University,"Mitchell, M (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd,4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",mmitchell@mercatus.gmu.edu; tstratma@gmu.edu,"Mitchell, Matthew/JSK-9297-2023",,,,,,45,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2015,165.0,3-4,,,,,171,191,,10.1007/s11127-015-0302-7,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DD6ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370074300001,0

This study aimed to determine the optimal management strategy for tropical planted forests when timber and carbon sequestration are valued. The survey data were collected from 291 household foresters, who were growing Eucalyptus urophylla and Acacia mangium in Yen Bai Province, Vietnam. The regression exercise suggests that financial status was negatively correlated with forest management practices, and ethnicity and financial status were correlated with carbon sequestration management. The survey results suggest that the mean rotation age employed by household foresters is five years. However, the optimization modelling suggests that the optimal rotation age for maximizing net present value is greater than nine years. The differences between current practices and optimal practices therefore favour a role for government policy interventions.","[Nghiem, Nhung] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Manawatu, New Zealand; [Nghiem, Nhung] Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, Wellington 6021, New Zealand",Massey University; University of Otago,"Nghiem, N (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Private Bag 11 222, Manawatu, New Zealand.",nhung.nghiem@otago.ac.nz,,"Nghiem, Nhung/0000-0003-0078-4549",Economy and Environmental Program for South East Asia; Ministry of Education,Economy and Environmental Program for South East Asia; Ministry of Education,"The author would like to thank to Professor Anton Meister and Dr Brendan Moyle for their excellent guidance.

We use a unique dataset of corporate derivatives positions that enables us to directly observe managerial reactions to their (speculative) gains and losses from market timing when they use derivatives. We find that managers increase their speculative activities using derivatives following speculative cash flow gains, while they do not reduce their speculative activities following speculative losses. This asymmetric response is consistent with the selective self-attribution associated with overconfidence. Our time series approach to measuring overconfidence complements cross-sectional approaches currently used in the literature. Our results show that managerial overconfidence, which has been found to influence a number of corporate decisions, also affects corporate risk management decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This quantity was introduced early in the literature and it is based on the high-low range observed at high frequency during the day. We consider the impact of the microstructure noise in high frequency data and correct our estimations, following a known procedure. Then, we model the realized range accounting for the well-known stylized effects present in financial data and we investigate the role that macroeconomic and financial variables play when forecasting daily stocks volatility. We consider an HAR model with asymmetric effects with respect to the volatility and the return, and GARCH and GJR specifications for the variance equation. Moreover, we consider a non-Gaussian distribution for the innovations. Finally, we extend the model including macroeconomic and financial variables that capture the present and the future state of the economy. We find that these variables are significantly correlated with the first common component of the volatility series and they have a highly in-sample explanatory power. The analysis of the forecast performance in 16 NYSE stocks suggests that the introduction of asymmetric effects with respect to the returns and the volatility in the HAR model result in a significant improvement in the point forecasting accuracy as well and the variables related with the U.S. stock market performance and proxies for the credit risk.

Immigrant-specific disparities are reduced when states do not require five years of residency for CHIP participation.","[Graefe, Deborah Roempke; Galvan, Chris] Penn State Univ, Populat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Hasanali, Stephanie Howe; De Jong, Gordon F.] Penn State Univ, Dept Sociol, Populat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Graefe, DR (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Populat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,(US) National Institutes of Health [P01 HD062498]; NIH [R24 HD041025],(US) National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),This research was supported in part by a program research grant from the (US) National Institutes of Health (P01 HD062498) and a NIH infrastructure grant to the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University (R24 HD041025).

The model is able to consider city size differences caused by wage and amenity differentials, both with and without housing and land use regulation. The surprising conclusion is that per-capita energy use is relatively invariant to city size when growth is driven by wages but falls modestly with growth induced by rising amenity. Common land use policies, specifically density limits and greenbelts, can positively or negatively affect both city welfare and energy use. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The chosen research method is that of quantitative research, resorting to conducting a statistical survey in order to identify the major changes in Generation Y and of the specific way it acts and interacts. The focus is particularly on the implications that this phenomenon has on the innovation process. The Millennials want to be in control of their lives and take active part in processes that involve them.

The paper investigates how different types of banks adjust their balance sheet positions in response to a liquidity shock. It distinguishes between different definitions of lending activities, such as changes in domestic C&I lending, foreign C&I lending, total credit, cross-border claims, foreign offices local claims, and internal borrowing between affiliated banks. The paper finds that (1) smaller banks (parent banks without affiliates) response to liquidity risk depends on core deposit funding for foreign C&I lending and total credit. (2) Cross-sectional differences in large banks (parent banks with affiliates) in response to liquidity risk cannot be uniformly explained by one particular ex ante determinant. The growth of cross-border claims is negatively correlated with a higher share of illiquid assets and with a higher share of capital, and positively correlated with the commitment ratio. Use of official sector liquidity provided by the Austrian government reduces the importance of the commitments share as a driver of cross-sectional differences in lending by Austrian global banks in response to market liquidity risks.","[Segalla, Esther] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Studies Div, Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Segalla, E (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Studies Div, Vienna, Austria.",,,,,,,,9,2,3,0,8,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Studying the South Korean syndicated loan market, we find that during the 90s the safety net protecting business groups (chaebols)-especially the government's bailout policy-affected the structure and pricing of loans to chaebol firms. However, after the chaebol reform of the late 90s dismantled the chaebol safety net, the differences in loan contracts between chaebol and non-chaebol firms narrowed or disappeared. The results suggest that the reform restored lenders' incentives to monitor chaebol firms and properly assess their risk.","[Minetti, Raoul] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yun, Sung-Guan] Bank Korea, Seoul, South Korea",Michigan State University; Bank of Korea,"Minetti, R (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,50,6,6,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Drawing from ethnography, interviews, and document analysis on a set of entrepreneurial trainings delivered to nonentrepreneurial borrowers in urban India, this study argues that parallel, conflicting processes of cultural adaptation within the organization, and tensions between various actors, create an environment in which there is no incentive to cater to the interests of working class clients. Commercialized microfinance, thus, may not necessarily produce accountability to client interests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Some GCC-wide equity sectors/subsectors are found to display segmentation from global markets during periods of high and extreme market volatility, and thus can serve as safe havens for international portfolio investors during such periods. The in- and out-of-sample portfolio analyses further suggest that supplementing global portfolios with positions in the GCC markets yields significant international diversification benefits, consistently offering much improved risk-adjusted returns across the alternative spillover models.

We therefore compare banks' actual portfolios to mean-variance benchmark portfolios that might be observed in the absence of such frictions.

As part of the fiscal consolidation implemented by the UK government, grants to local authorities in England were cut by more than a third in real terms between 2009-10 and 2014-15. With limited revenue-raising powers, these cuts meant drastic reductions in local authority spending in total and per person: local authority spending per person fell in real terms by 23.4 per cent over this period. But the size of spending cuts per person differed greatly across local authorities, ranging from 46.3 per cent to 6.2 per cent. On average, the distribution of the cuts across authorities does not seem to reflect the principle of 'equalisation' that was, at least in theory, in place up until 2013-14; the local authorities with least revenue-raising capacity (which are typically the most deprived) have on average actually seen the largest spending cuts. Moreover, this pattern looks set to continue over the next five years, with those authorities that have seen the largest cuts to date also expected to see the largest cuts in future.","[Innes, David; Tetlow, Gemma] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Innes, D (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",david_i@ifs.org.uk; g.tetlow@ifs.org.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/H021221/1]; Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS (grant reference ES/H021221/1).

I find a form of targeting with one-sided dismissal rules attractive; it discourages the central banker from inflating and minimizes the probability of its dismissal in the presence of aggregate supply shocks. This procedure ties the central banker's performance to observable policy targets, whether the nominal output or the inflation rate, and gives some valuable flexibility in terms of stabilization of shocks Two cases of targeting procedures, nominal output targeting and inflation targeting, are compared to the full discretionary case without any dismissal rule. The central banker, accountable to hit the policy target, implements a dominant policy whenever she takes a hawkish stance against inflation, and targets the variable that is most affected by the unobservable supply shock. This type of reappointment contract implies that monetary policy would become fully transparent, consistently more credible and more effective than the discretionary case without dismissal.

Whether this is beneficial to long horizon investors like employees enrolled in defined contribution (DC) plans, however, has been subject to criticism. We conduct historical simulation since 1928 to examine the effectiveness of active and passive tail risk hedging using out of money put options for hypothetical equity portfolios of DC plan participants with 20 years to retirement. Our findings show that the cost of tail hedging exceeds the benefits for a majority of the plan participants during the sample period. However, for a significant number of simulations, hedging result in superior outcomes relative to an unhedged position. Active tail hedging is more effective when employees confront several panic-driven periods characterized by short and sharp market swings in the equity markets over the investment horizon. Passive hedging, on the other hand, proves beneficial when they encounter an extremely rare event like the Great Depression as equity markets go into deep and prolonged decline.","[Basu, Anup K.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Drew, Michael E.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University,"Basu, AK (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",a.basu@qut.edu.au; michael.drew@griffith.edu.au,,"Basu, Anup/0000-0002-7977-0467; Drew, Michael/0000-0002-2822-9611",,,,,29,1,1,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

We show that the threshold to a crisis regime for Italy and Spain is reached when (i) their 5-year sovereign yield spreads amount to about 90 basis points; (ii) their 5-year CDS spreads amount to about 155 basis points or (iii) the 5-year spread between the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) bond and the German Bund amounts, to about 30-40 basis points. Using impulse responses, we find that the STCC-GARCH with the KfW-Bund spread has leading properties, a feature corroborated by the fact that this indicator suggested a shift to a crisis regime already in August 2007 and has been signaling an improvement of the situation already in the autumn of 2012. An out-of-sample forecast of the STCC-GARCH model is also provided, which is both a novelty and a further robustness check for the stability of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that the extent of cross-asset volatility spillovers within each G7 country is low. Volatility persistence is dominant in all domestic asset markets. The main contributor to the total volatility spillovers is the general equity portfolio. Evidence of co-integration among the volatility spillover cycles implies the presence of unobserved common shocks. Finally, the co-movements between the spillover cycles of domestic business cycle fluctuations and financial/asset market return volatility cycles are correlated, but in different manner according to the frequencies considered. These empirical findings provide fresh insights in cross-asset and cross-market volatility spillovers for central bank policy makers, as well as risk management and portfolio diversification for international investors.

We find that the average tax rate plays a larger role in determining the income redistribution effect of PIT than tax progressivity does. Although tax progressivity decreased as a result of rising personal incomes and a constant PIT policy prior to 2005, the income redistribution effect of the PIT improved as a result of the higher average tax rate. The tax reform beginning in 2006 increased tax progressivity while decreasing the average tax rate, thereby weakening the income redistribution effect of the PIT. Further analysis indicates that the middle-income group was the only net loser before 2005, but it benefited from the PIT policy reform. A cross-country comparison shows that China has a lower PIT burden and higher progressivity than developed countries; in fact, China's levels of progressivity and tax burden are similar to those of Latin American countries.

In our economy, excessively optimistic investors are subject to an endogenous funding constraint that prevents default due to ex-ante-limited commitment. When the funding constraint binds, optimists use their savings to increase their consumption share, deterring default. This allows them to place speculative trades, increasing market liquidity. Their losses on these trades make them prone to default, leading to a renewed binding of the funding constraint. This feedback between funding illiquidity, disagreement, and market liquidity is consistent with several empirical features of liquidity and financial asset prices.","Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Osambela, E (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",osambela@cmu.edu,,"Osambela, Emilio/0000-0002-0166-1631",Swiss Finance Institute; NCCR FINRISK of the Swiss National Science Foundation; Weiss Center for International Financial Research,Swiss Finance Institute; NCCR FINRISK of the Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Weiss Center for International Financial Research,"Financial support from the Swiss Finance Institute, from NCCR FINRISK of the Swiss National Science Foundation, and from the Weiss Center for International Financial Research is gratefully acknowledged.",,40,19,19,4,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Based on fieldwork in a Jiangsu county and drawing on national data, the author shows that rapid urbanization has fundamentally altered the nature of rural industry, with previous village-based rural enterprises replaced by large industrial corporations and urban real estate. While urbanization seems to many an inevitable outcome of economic development, this paper argues and shows that the current form of urbanization in China has been driven by an unsustainable accumulation regime that prioritizes the needs of local revenue, real estate development and large capital at the expense of the previous broad-based rural industry. This is thrown into sharp relief by comparing with the accumulation regime based on local state corporatism during the early reform period.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Sociol, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Zhan, SH (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sociol, HSS-05-38,14 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",shzhan@ntu.edu.sg,"Zhan, Shaohua/G-3634-2019","Zhan, Shaohua/0000-0002-9996-8833",National Science Foundation (USA); Henry Luce Foundation/ACLS postdoctoral fellowship in China studies,National Science Foundation (USA)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Henry Luce Foundation/ACLS postdoctoral fellowship in China studies,"I wish to thank Yihong Jin for her all-round support for my study.

We use a consumption-CAPM with Epstein-Zin-Weil recursive preferences. Our model introduces two sources of risk: uncertainty about current consumption (reflected in contemporaneous consumption growth) and uncertainty about prospects of consumption in a long run (reflected in innovations to expectations about future consumption growth). We use a novel approach to estimate pricing factors in our model: we employ a factor-augmented VAR model with common factors, extracted from a large panel of macroeconomic and financial data, as state variables. We find that the important source of risk in US bonds is related to uncertainty in prospects in future consumption and it induces a positive and significant risk premium. We find as well that covariance risk related to innovations in expectations about future consumption growth is greater for long term bond portfolios than for short term bond portfolios, which is consistent with a duration measure of risk and justifies why long term bonds require greater premium than short term bonds. Our model explains well the cross-sectional variation in average excess returns of bonds with different maturities over the period 1975-2011 and compares favorably with competing models.

In this paper, we fit a dynamic factor model to decompose the sovereign CDS spreads of ten OECD economies into three components: a common factor, a second factor driven by European peripheral countries and an idiosyncratic component. We use this decomposition to propose a novel methodology based on the real-time estimates of the model to characterize contagion among the ten series. Our procedure allows the country that triggers contagion in each period, which can be any peripheral economy, to be disentangled. According to our findings, since the onset of the sovereign debt crisis, contagion has played a non-negligible role in the European peripheral countries, which confirms the existence of significant financial linkages between these economies.

This is because risk sharing implies redistribution, as lucky individuals support the unlucky ones. We hypothesize that responsibility for risky choices decreases individuals' willingness to share risk by dampening redistribution motives, and investigate this conjecture with a laboratory experiment. Responsibility is created by allowing participants to choose between two different risky lotteries before they decide how much risk they share with a randomly matched partner. Risk sharing is then compared to a treatment where risk exposure is randomly assigned. We find that average risk sharing does not depend on whether individuals can control their risk exposure. However, we observe that when individuals are responsible for their risk exposure, risk sharing decisions are systematically conditioned on the risk exposure of the sharing partner, whereas this is not the case when risk exposure is random.","[Cettolin, Elena] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Tausch, Franziska] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Tilburg University; Max Planck Society,"Cettolin, E (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",e.cettolin@uvt.nl; tausch@coll.mpg.de,,"Cettolin, Elena/0000-0002-3634-496X","Network for Studies on Pensions, Aging and Retirement (Netspar)","Network for Studies on Pensions, Aging and Retirement (Netspar)","Financial support by the Network for Studies on Pensions, Aging and Retirement (Netspar) is gratefully acknowledged.

By estimating the model we find evidence that, while some of the recent movements in sovereign CDS spreads can be explained by deteriorating fundamentals for core European Union (EU) countries, momentum has also played a destabilizing role since the GFC in all sovereign credit markets studied.

Further, we document that, within RLBOs, public-to-private RLBOs, outperform private-to-private and division-to-private RLBOs. We also find support for the underwriter signaling effect for public-to-private RLBOs. Our analysis identifies for the first time what private period restructuring activities contribute to superior post-re-IPO stock price performance. Further, the beneficial effects of private period restructurings are enhanced for deals associated with prestigious underwriters.

Following Eichner and Pethig (J Environ Econ Manag, 2013) we set up a two-country two-period model in which one of the countries represents a climate coalition that implements a binding ceiling on the world's first-period emissions. The other country is the rest of the world and refrains from taking action. The coalition can make use of production-based carbon emission taxes in both periods, as in Eichner and Pethig (J Environ Econ Manag, 2013), but here we consider consumption-based carbon emission taxes as an additional instrument. The central question is whether and how the coalition employs the consumption-based taxes along with the production-based taxes in its unilateral cost-effective ceiling policy. All cost-effective policies identified analytically and numerically consist of a mix of both types of taxes implying that there is a tax mix which is less expensive for the coalition than stand-alone consumption-based or stand-alone production-based taxes. With full cooperation both taxes are perfect substitutes (in our model), but in case of unilateral action they are imperfect substitutes, because coalition's total welfare loss from two different but moderate distortions is smaller than that from a single but severe distortion.","[Eichner, Thomas] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany; [Pethig, Ruediger] Univ Siegen, Dept Econ, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",thomas.eichner@fernuni-hagen.de; pethig@vwl.wiwi.uni-siegen.de,,"Pethig, Ruediger/0000-0002-4037-4416",CESifo sponsorship,CESifo sponsorship,"An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title The carbon budget approach to climate stabilization: Cost-effective subglobal versus global action.

Our main result is that spontaneous compliance with a non-self-interested norm of distribution is likely to occur if individuals have been part of the same process of ex ante agreement on the distributive norm under a 'veil of ignorance,' to which the emergence of reciprocal expectations of conformity is also related.

These kinds of products, however, can be quite complex. Regulatory authorities and consumers currently ask for more cost transparency with respect to product components (e.g., risk premium for death benefits, savings premium, cost of investment guarantee) and administration costs. The aim of this article is to measure the effects of different forms of presenting the price of life insurance contract components and especially of embedded investment guarantees on consumer evaluation of those products. The intention is to understand the extent to which price presentation affects consumer demand. This is done by means of an experimental study and by focusing on unit-linked life insurance products. Our findings reveal that contrary to other consumer products, there are no precise effects of price bundling and price optic on consumer evaluation and purchase intention in the case of life insurance.

In order to address this gap, this paper proposes that the relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation and regional growth is governed by a series of network dynamics. Drawing upon aspects of endogenous growth theory and the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship, it is proposed that the nature of the networks formed by entrepreneurial firms is a key determinant of regional growth differentials. In particular, network capital, in the form of investments in strategic relations to gain access to knowledge, is considered to mediate the relationship between entrepreneurship and innovation-based regional growth. It is suggested that network dynamics should be further incorporated into theories concerning the link between knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurship and regional growth. The paper concludes with a series of theoretical, entrepreneurial and policy implications emerging from the study.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Thompson, Piers] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",Cardiff University; Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",hugginsr@cardiff.ac.uk; piers.thompson@ntu.ac.uk,"Thompson, Piers/R-5828-2019","Thompson, Piers/0000-0003-1961-7441",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-171-25-0023]; European Union [320131],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Union(European Union (EU)),The authors are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) (Grant Award Reference RES-171-25-0023) and the Smart Specialisation for Regional Innovation project funded by the European Union under the FP7 Cooperation Programme: Social Sciences and the Humanities (Grant Number 320131) for partly funding the research upon which this article is based.,,265,169,211,6,358,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Coral reef fisheries are extensively overexploited worldwide, but the discount rates of reef fishers are largely unknown, and there is little information about how discount rates relate to the exploitation status of fisheries. We address these two research gaps for 48 small-scale reef fisheries around the world. We use a life history based method to derive fishery level intrinsic growth rates, and then apply fisheries economics theory to investigate the compatibility of 2 different discount rates (official and private) with the exploitation status of reef fisheries. We find that official discount rates that are normally used for policy making appear to be too low to fully reflect the short term outlook of reef fishers. Instead, our inferred annual average private discount rate of 107 % for fishers may better reflect the general overexploited state of reef fisheries. Our results indicate that in order to improve the chances of success, fisheries policies, which affect local fishers, may need to be evaluated using private discount rates rather than the currently used official discount rates.","[Teh, Louise S.

Spatial autocorrelation (SA) is also a focus of interest in transportation planning, but has been neglected in analyzing job accessibility in metropolitan areas. In this study, GIS-based job accessibilities by walking, transit, and car are computed for the metropolitan area of Columbus, Ohio, and three transport-based spatial autoregressive (SAR) models are estimated to account for the SA of job accessibility among neighboring block groups, while controlling for built-environment and socioeconomic factors. SA intensities and extents are compared in order to better understand local spatial clusters of job accessibility across the region. Direct and indirect spillover effects due to an investment change in transportation facilities are estimated and provide important transportation planning information. The results also show that walking-accessed jobs are primarily related to physical settings (e.g., land uses) at the local level. Locations with a higher share of zero-vehicle housing units have better job accessibility by transit. There is a spatial mismatch between Asian population clusters and transit-accessed jobs, possibly because of the car-oriented residential clusters around Honda of America Manufacturing in suburban areas. More importantly, locations with a higher share of single-pareht households are at a disadvantage in overall job accessibility. Due to its complex transportation needs, a society friendly to single parents should spatially integrate accessible jobs with other needed activities via land-use and transportation planning. Alternatively, car-ownership programs and non-spatial social supports also might be effective to help secure job opportunities and perform daily life activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Motivated by this contention, we examine the relation between put-call ratios, short-selling activity, and constraints to short selling. Results show that (1) put-call ratios are inversely related, instead of directly related, to proxies for short-sale constraints and (2) the significant negative relation between current put-call ratios and future returns (Pan and Poteshman in Rev Financ Stud 19:871-908, 2006) is orthogonal to proxies for short-sale constraints. These results indicate that short-sale constraints do not influence bearish option activity. While prior studies show that short sellers are generally contrarian in contemporaneous and past returns, we find that put-call ratios follow periods of negative returns. However, any observed return predictability contained in put-call ratios is driven by ratios that follow periods of positive returns.","[Blau, Benjamin M.; Brough, Tyler J.] Utah State Univ, Huntsman Sch Business, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Blau, BM (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Huntsman Sch Business, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ben.blau@usu.edu; tyler.brough@usu.edu,,"Blau, Benjamin/0000-0002-5260-3378",,,,,27,9,9,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We find that bribery is positively related to firms' total bank debt ratios, which provides evidence that bribing bank officials facilitates firms' access to bank loans. This impact varies with the maturity of the bank debt, as bribery contributes to higher short-term bank debt ratios but lower long-term bank debt ratios. Finally, we find that the institutional characteristics of the banking industry influence the relation between bribery and firms' bank debt ratios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although there are many studies on the environmental Kuznets curve, very few address the issue of municipal solid waste, and there is still controversy concerning the validity of the waste version of the Kuznets curve hypothesis. It is demonstrated that the turning point for household municipal solid waste is approximately 3.7 million yen per person, which is far less than the maximum income in the sample and valid evidence for absolute decoupling. The success of our study partially stems from our highly disaggregated data and use of spatial econometrics. The former aspect indicates that distinguishing between household and business waste reveals the waste-income relationship, whereas the latter indicates the importance of peer effects when municipal governments formulate waste-reduction policies.","[Ichinose, Daisuke] Rikkyo Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo 171, Japan; [Yamamoto, Masashi] Toyama Univ, Ctr Far Eastern Studies, Toyama 9308555, Japan; [Yoshida, Yuichiro] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, Higashihiroshima 724, Japan",Rikkyo University; University of Toyama; Hiroshima University,"Ichinose, D (通讯作者)，Rikkyo Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo 171, Japan.",d.ichinose@rikkyo.ac.jp; myam@eco.utoyama.ac.jp; yuichiro@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Yamamoto, Masashi/B-3621-2016; Yoshida, Yuichiro/M-2925-2013","Yamamoto, Masashi/0000-0003-1583-6882; Yoshida, Yuichiro/0000-0002-3061-4594",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530295] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,40,32,32,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Posted quotes adjust after the change in fee composition, but the transaction costs for liquidity demanders remain unaffected once fees are taken into account.

We show how labor market effects can explain why in the former regions value-adding activities (processing, certification) are undertaken while in the latter regions off-farm activities are adopted. Farm size favors value-adding activities as well as on-farm diversification.

To govern water usage, pastoral communities in Namibia have specific sanctions at their disposal and yet these are almost never applied. Interestingly, this does not lead to a breakdown in water supply. To understand collective action in small communities it is important to take into account that people share multiple resources. Combining ethnography and network analysis we reveal that people cannot separate the sharing of water from the sharing of ancestries, food, and work. This discourages the application of formal sanctions while opening other means of maintaining institutional regimes. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Interestingly, this is the case even if the individuals' earnings are unaffected by the subjective performance appraisal. Hence, performance feedback which falls short of agents' self-evaluations can be interpreted as an unkind act that triggers a negatively reciprocal response not only if the assessment determines agents' earnings but also when it lacks monetary consequences. We propose a principal-agent model formalizing that agents might engage into conflict in response to ego-threatening performance appraisals and show that these conflicts stabilize principal-agent relationships based on subjective performance evaluations. In particular, we identify conditions for a positive welfare effect of increasing costs of conflict and a negative welfare effect of more capable agents.

Based on their experiences of working with a master woodworker in Bloomington, they envisioned a workshop setting. From a simple tradition of voluntarily organized weekly colloquia with their colleagues across campus, they crafted an academic environment in which students, visiting scholars, and colleagues from diverse disciplines interacted daily, studying issues of institutional analysis and collective action.

However, by valuing the call option on negative shadow yields, we provide estimates of a three-factor shadow-rate model of Japanese yields. We validate our option-based results by closely matching them using a simulation-based approach.

This paper investigates how the standard formula's stock risk calibration influences the equity position and investment strategy of a share-holder-value-maximising insurer with limited liability. The capital requirement for stock risks is determined by multiplying a regulation-defined stock risk parameter by the value of the insurer's stock portfolio. Intuitively, a higher stock risk parameter should reduce risky investments as well as insolvency risk. However, we find that the default probability does not necessarily decrease when reducing the investment risk (by increasing the stock risk parameter). We also find that, depending on the precise interaction between assets and liabilities, some insurers will invest conservatively, whereas others will prefer a very risky investment strategy, and a slight change of the stock risk parameter may lead from a conservative to a high-risk asset allocation.","[Fischer, Katharina; Schluetter, Sebastian] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Int Ctr Insurance Regulat, Chair Insurance & Regulat, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Fischer, K (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Int Ctr Insurance Regulat, Chair Insurance & Regulat, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,36,15,16,0,15,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

One reason for this diversity might be that studies are typically settled in a variety of institutional environments. To assess the extent to which the local political system might shape the effects of fragmentation, this study measures the causal effect of a change in the nomination scheme of the city manager on the council size effect. I combine a regression discontinuity design with a difference-in-differences approach in a large panel dataset of German municipalities. The study finds that when the manager is appointed by council, there is no significant council size effect, but that there is a negative effect when the manager is elected by voters for those expenditure categories over which the manager has the most discretion. These findings suggest that the nature of the political system does indeed matter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

They can be seen as a means of internalizing energy-use externalities and addressing energy efficiency market failures. This paper reviews existing evaluations of experiences with white certificate obligations in Great Britain, Italy and France. Ex ante microeconomic analysis find that the obligation is best modelled as a hybrid subsidy-tax instrument, whereby energy companies subsidize energy efficiency and pass-through the subsidy cost onto energy prices. Ex post static efficiency assessments find largely positive benefit-cost balances, with national differences reflecting heterogeneity in technical potentials. Compliance involved little trading between obligated parties. Whether the cost borne by obligated parties was recovered through increased energy revenue could not be ascertained. Ex post dynamic efficiency assessments find that in addition to addressing liquidity constraints through subsidies, white certificate obligations seem to have addressed informational and organisational market failures. Confidence in these conclusions is limited by the fact that no econometric analysis was performed. Yet the lack of publicly available data, a counterpart to the rationale of the instrument of harnessing private financing, makes any empirical evaluation of white certificate obligations challenging.","[Giraudet, Louis-Gaetan] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Paris, France; [Finon, Dominique] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Giraudet, Louis-Gaetan; Finon, Dominique] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Oak Ridge, TN USA",Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Giraudet, LG (通讯作者)，45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",giraudet@centre-cired.fr,,,,,,,51,15,15,3,20,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Consistent with the predictions of structural models of credit risk, we find that the slope of CDS spread term structure increases with firm leverage and volatility, but decreases with the level and the slope of the Treasury yield curve. However, these variables together have rather limited explanatory power for CDS slope and there is a significant common component in the regression residuals. In addition, we find that CDS slope predicts future changes in the CDS spreads, even after controlling for the contemporaneous variables that determine changes in the CDS spreads according to the structural models. Our results suggest that while structural models are qualitatively useful for understanding the shape of credit term structure, there are missing factors that importantly affect the term structure of CDS spreads.

In this augmented setting, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is placed between 0.74 and 0.90 in Japan, and around 0.30 in the US. We also find evidence of biased technical change, which is capital-saving in Japan but labor-saving in the US. These differences help us explain the diverse experience in the capital deepening process of these economies, and lead us to conclude that demand-side drivers, quite relevant in the US, may also be relevant to account for different growth experiences.

The idea originally referred to the willingness of foreigners to hold large quantities of US government debt at extremely low interest rates, due to the dollar's world reserve currency status. In recent years, the term exorbitant privilege has been expanded to explain why the US appears to be enjoying excess return from its external assets over liabilities across all asset classes, including foreign direct investment, equities and other forms of portfolio investment. In this paper, we give a brief review of the recent literature on exorbitant privilege, and then proceed to discuss exorbitant privilege in the context of another country, Japan, which has been the world's largest creditor nation for more than two decades. In contrast to the common perception that japan has been a particularly poor international investor, we find that Japan enjoys exorbitant privilege in both the broad and narrow sense. Japan also earns higher expected returns from maturity transformation. Thus although the dollar is the reserve currency, the yen also has enjoyed a safe haven effect in the recent period. J.

Using a textual algorithm to identify the degree to which filings of bidders and targets exhibit negative/cautious tones vs positive/optimistic tones, we find that bidders employing the most optimistic language in their filings actually experience the worst longrun performance following the transactions. In contrast, bidding managers who appear to acknowledge and understand the risks of the transactions experience relatively better postmerger performance. Thus our analysis of the textual content of merger filings appears to give us a new method for investigating the role of bidder and target attitudes and beliefs on merger outcomes.

We find that greater market competition increases the amount of bribes paid. Results are robust across several measures of market competition.

This phenomenon has been little explored so far. Our analysis focusses on cash-in-advance financing. With the help of a theoretical model, we show that firms intensively use cash-in-advance because it serves as a quality signal that reduces the high uncertainty related to international transactions. Specifically, cash-in-advance provided from a foreign buyer to an exporter can alleviate adverse selection and the risk of moral hazard. Thus, exporting becomes more profitable which allows less productive firms to start exporting. We use unique survey data on German enterprises from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey to test the effect of cash-in-advance financing on firms' exporting participation. Accounting for endogeneity, we find that cash-in-advance has a positive impact on the firms' probability to export. Moreover, our results suggest that this effect is particularly strong for less productive firms.","[Eck, Katharina] Univ Munich, Bavarian Grad Program Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Engemann, Martina] Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Schnitzer, Monika] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80799 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich; University of Munich,"Eck, K (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Bavarian Grad Program Econ, Akad Str 1-3, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",katharina.eck@gmx.de; martina.engemann@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; schnitzer@econ.lmu.de,,,,,,,34,21,21,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

From the worker's perspective, this is because such jobs are likely to pay higher wages than jobs in domestic firms, at least in developing countries, and because foreign employers tend to offer more training than local firms do.

Entrepreneurship sustainability is conditioned by how the national business environment influences the education and mentality of the population to have the desire and courage to initiate and develop performance measures in a changing business environment more and more fluctuating and unpredictable. Our research, conducted over nearly two years aims, as main objective, to outline how implementing crowdsourcing as a way of solving, online, some problems regarding activities of major interests at organizational level (in our case, external communication), may contribute to the development of entrepreneurship in Romanian tourism. In this regard, we assumed that, despite the empirical mode of action (of priority being intuition and personal experience), only having reliable information on the perception, primarily, of their customers about the quality of the benefits they received, entrepreneurs in the tourism and hospitality industry will be able to adapt and/or develop their businesses in accordance with the main trends and characteristics of the environment in which they operate. The methodology used (analysis of variance - ANOVA correlated with SPSS for Windows, version 15) to test research hypotheses was the logical consequence of the questions used in questionnaires launched on two websites specially created. In this context, we investigated the biunivocal relationship between the phenomenon of entrepreneurship and business tourism and hospitality industry from the perspective of external organizational communication trends of profile units in the digital age, trends expressed by both managers and also by their customers. Finally, based on hypotheses testing, we found that, in a world of rapidly changing, boosting entrepreneurship became dependent on both the accuracy of the image the managers of tourism units have about their own activity and also on their customer perception on the quality of services they receive. So, on the one hand, crowdsourcing has become a viable resultant for the development of entrepreneurship in tourism and hospitality industry as, on the other hand, entrepreneurs need to motivate the participation of their own customers at crowdsourcing.","[Popescu, Dan; State, Cristina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Popescu, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dan.popescu@man.ase.ro,"POPESCU, DAN P./J-8620-2014; STATE, Cristina/AHC-1283-2022; State, Cristina/AAZ-2886-2021","POPESCU, DAN P./0000-0001-7164-9155; State, Cristina/0000-0002-1514-9831",European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115],European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115, project title Performance and Excellence in Doctoral and Postdoctoral Research in Romanian Economics Science Domain.",,49,4,6,1,57,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,162,179,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800011,0

Our study demonstrates how this choice depends on whether the start-up was founded out of necessity. Our results, based on a representative data set of 4,568 German start-ups, show that necessity entrepreneurs are more likely than other entrepreneurs to pursue a cost leadership strategy and less likely to pursue a differentiation strategy. Decomposition analyses further show that up to half of the difference in choice of strategy can be attributed to distinct endowments of human capital, socioeconomic attributes, and start-up project characteristics that correlate with necessity entrepreneurship.","[Block, Joern H.] Univ Trier, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Block, Joern H.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Kohn, Karsten; Ullrich, Katrin] KfW Bankengrp, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kohn, Karsten] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Miller, Danny] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Miller, Danny] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Alberta,"Block, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Univ Ring 15, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",block@uni-trier.de,"Miller, Danny/J-9308-2014; Block, Joern/K-2208-2016","Miller, Danny/0000-0001-8428-7640; Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346",,,,,49,126,151,6,94,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The primary purpose of the article is defining game theory as one of the creative methods of successful managing of educational projects of different sizes, with respect to economic and management specifics of post-crisis Czech Republic. From the examples mentioned in presented paper will be clear, that game theory has its place in project management and is for it quite utilizable. Besides, a well-defined communication strategy built on the principles of game theory may reduce or eliminate the probability of risk (problem) creation in project management. The practical implication of presented paper is the confirmation of Bilton and Cumming's hypothesis published in (Bilton, Cummins, 2014) stating that using game theory helps understand the needs and interests of the involved participants in the educational project and eliminate eventual communication risks, hindering the successful completion of the project.

The low interest rate environment makes this question critical to public institutional investors and potentially their asset-liability management. There exists a trade-off between the potential level income generated for the medium/long term on one side, and, the uncertainty of this income and its associated mark-to-market volatility through time, on the other side. First, we develop the foundations of the Libor market model (LMM) initially calibrated using data from swaptions for USD and EUR markets. Then different types of eligible strategies for the stabilization of the net income are provided. The strategies are mostly based on interest rate derivatives - swaps, caps, floors and swaptions - , and they may be partially rule-based and/or self-financed and may allow for tactical decision. Finally, the importance of the institutional framework and the role of the governance are discussed, e.g. the impact of mark-to-market based investment rules on the degree of path-dependency of the implemented strategies.

Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries are significantly behind in this area, what is documented by the level of their life insurance density and penetration. However, during the last few decades, we have observed extensive growth in these markets. In addition, CEE countries also overcome dynamic changes in economy and demography, during this period. The main aim of the paper is to uncover whether these trends affected the development of life insurance industry in CEE and to identify the most relevant economic and demographic factors. For the analysis, we chose data from the block of four Central European counties: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic. We decided to analyse these four CEE countries based on their common cultural, historical and economic similarities.

It defines main sources of interest rate volatility and studies how specific source of volatility influences optimal interest margin. Special attention is focused on unexpected shock in liquidity of banking system, actual central bank's decision on targeted level of interest rate, long-term deviation of inflation and output from central bank's targeted values and potential impact of these factors on term premium instability. Sources of interest rates are discussed in term of bank's refinancing/reinvestment risk with an attempt to formalize interest rate volatility for further empirical research. The conclusion is that dealer's model of optimal interest margin is consistent with only permanent shocks to banking system liquidity and long-lasting central bank's surprises with its monetary policy that increase a level of refinancing/reinvestment risk faced up by banks. On the other hand it is not consistent with interest rate volatility caused by transitory liquidity shocks, expected current changes in central bank's targeted main policy rate and long run trends in main policy rate based on disinflation.

The sample was split to avoid the five pictures from influencing the perception and each participant was shown only one picture. Overall, the evaluation of the pictures was very negative. Only the picture showing day-old-chicks was perceived as favorable (stocking density: 0.8 kg/m(2)).

Utilization of local institutions that grow and thrive in the life of rural communities has helped many poor households in order to survive. Therefore, it is suggested that the government should pay attention to local institutions by providing reinforcement to those institutions to be able to serve as a forum for the fishermen in the villages in order to empower them without having to bring in outside agencies because, in principle, institutions that grow and thrive in society have helped fishermen in rural life; and it is a social capital.

In China the invasion of natural disasters is also very serious, the frequent occurrence of the catastrophe is a big obstacle and destruction to our national economy and people's lives. In the past 10 years, the average insurance payment for world catastrophe was 34.34%. For a long time in the course of our country dealing with catastrophe losses, the insurance industry has played a minimal role. For example, in 2014 the earthquake in Yunnan Ludian insurance payments was only 3.7% of the total losses. The practice in countries where the catastrophe risks dispersion is developed shows that the role of property insurance industry is very critical in dispersing catastrophe risks. Therefore, China's property insurance industry should give full play to its compensation function and be initiative to undertake more social responsibility, then provide channels to transfer and disperse catastrophe risks in our catastrophe risks dispersion system. In this context, China's property insurance industry in what extent can it provide to underwriting catastrophe losses is a question worth to considering. The paper use the reaction model of underwriting capacity of catastrophe risks. And make the empirical study on the underwriting capacity of China property insurance companies and property insurance industry in facing with catastrophic loss. First, analysis the conditions that the catastrophe risks transform into insurable risks. Secondly, summarize the model of catastrophe insurance system. Then assess the gap of underwriting catastrophic risks of China property insurance industry. Finally, propose the recommendations on improving the ability of underwriting capacity of China property industry according to the results of empirical analysis and the successful international experience. The results shows that there are significant gaps in the underwriting capacity of insurance industry in our country. And there are many reasons for this outcome. From a market perspective, the imperfections and irrational structure of China's property insurance market, capital market and the reinsurance market have resulted in a large gap in the underwriting of catastrophe risks. From the perspective of the operating of property insurance industry, the underwriting business, investment business, and operational risks will affect the capacity of underwriting the catastrophe risks of its own. Therefore, in order to enhance and improve underwriting capacity of property insurance industry, the government and each subject of the market should be coordination with each other and build a sound catastrophe risks management system.","[Chen Zhichu] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China; [Fan Zhiping] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics; Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"Fan, ZP (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",tjchenzhichu@126.com; fanzhiping706@163.com,"Chen, Zhichu/K-7204-2014",,,,,,20,0,0,6,7,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,248,266,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500016,0

The yield spread decomposition is achieved using a multi-market, no-arbitrage affine term structure model with a unique pricing kernel. More specifically, we use the canonical representation proposed by Joslin et al. (2011) and introduce next to standard spanned factors a set of unspanned macro factors, as in Joslin et al. (forthcoming). The model is applied to yield curve data from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain over the period 2005-2013. Overall, our results show that economic fundamentals are the dominant drivers behind sovereign bond spreads. Nevertheless, shocks unrelated to the fundamental component of the spread have played an important role in the dynamics of bond spreads since the intensification of the sovereign debt crisis in the summer of 2011.

However, achieving the proper balance is difficult and it is uncertain which of the two instrumental variables have the strongest effect on economic activity. Traditional Keynesian theory holds that the changes within public expenditure are more effective instrumental variables than tax changes. This is because the concerned procurement of goods and services have a direct impact on GDP, while taxes shows its indirect effect trough decisions of households and businesses on consumption and investment.

The paper first calculated the degree of vertical specialization and agglomeration respectively by using statistics of 2-digit manufacturing sub-industries at province level from year 2003 to 2008. And then it further built a panel data model to estimate the impact of vertical specialization on the agglomeration of manufacturing sector at both national and regional level. The results of the research reveal the existence of strong regional disparity as to the impact of vertical specialization on agglomeration of China's manufacturing sector. Vertical specialization is found to be significantly positive related to the formation and development of manufacturing agglomeration at national level. However, this positive effect on national level, as suggested by a more thorough estimation, owes mainly to the positive relation of the two subjects in eastern China. Different from the case in eastern and western China, where vertical specialization stimulates manufacturing sector to be agglomerated, the impact of vertical specialization on agglomeration is negative in the middle part of China.","[Fan, Qi; Hu, Hahui] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Hu, HH (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",metalrobin@126.com; huhh@seu.edu.cn,,,,,,,16,1,2,0,5,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,213,225,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_17,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400017,0

First, regarding the suburb economic development in Tianjin, there is a decreasing positive influence from export trade and actually utilized foreign capital. Second, the actual use of foreign investment in Tianjin suburbs plays a more important role than exports, and it also enjoys a stronger anti-risk capability.

The aim of this paper is to calculate premiums of Critical Illness policy, specifically for the homogeneous groups generated by sex and relation to smoking. In the calculation of the actuarial value of the insurer's payments, we have employed the claim diagnosis rates for accelerated Critical Illness Insurance estimated by the members of the Continuous Mortality Investigation Critical Illness Committee (UK).

Despite the potential for improving organizational performance through supply chain activities, little scholarly evidence exists in management literature to establish an association between organizational factors and SCM performance outcomes. Businesses that are seeking to achieve competitive advantage are forced to compete beyond the firm level to the supply chain level. As a supply chain competes with other supply chains, businesses would see that supply chains that are flexible will outperform those that are less agile in an increasingly uncertain environment. What it means is that, supply chain flexibility has emerged as an important management strategy to achieve competitive advantage and so businesses now have to look into improving their supply chain management practices to become flexible and responsive to an unpredictable environment and to cope with changing customers' requirements.

The main emphasis of the study has been given to Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and to evaluate how well Conditional EVT model performs in modeling tails of distributions and in estimating and forecasting VaR measures. We have followed McNeil and Frey's (2000) two stage approach called Conditional EVT to estimate dynamic VaR In stage 1, we model the conditional volatility of each series using an appropriate asymmetric GARCH model which serves to filter the return series such that the asymmetric GARCH residuals are closer to lid than the raw return series. In stage 2, we apply EVT to model the fat tails of the asymmetric GARCH residuals. We have compared the accuracy of Conditional EVT approach to VaR estimation with other competing models. The best performing model is found to be the Conditional EVT for the entire sample. To confirm whether the Conditional EVT would still be the best for a sub-period, we have compared the forecasting accuracy for the sub-sample of bull market. Here too the Conditional EVT maintains its superiority even more precisely. Since the Conditional EVT approach clearly dominates other competing models in terms of VaR forecasting, we would advocate the use of the model when managing tail related market risk in such equity markets.

The main objective of the study is to identify links between the use of disaster loans and selected hallmarks of farms in the region of Middle Pomerania. The study used secondary data sources and primary data obtained in the course of empirical studies. The population consisted of farms in the region of Middle Pomerania. In the research problem process, the authors used a literature analysis and a data analysis - a descriptive and graphical method of data presentation and survey research. The measurement technique was a survey. The research tool was a questionnaire. The purpose of the study is to identify connections between the use of disaster loans and the selected features that characterize arable farms in the Middle Pomerania region. To realize the abovementioned goal, a multidimensional analysis of correspondence was also used. This analysis allows one to obtain an answer to the question: what factors imply the use of disaster preferential loans by farmers in the Middle Pomerania region? Based on the results obtained, it can be found that farmers in the Middle Pomerania region do not use very willingly loans with preferential interests (as little as 11% of the respondents used this form of public support). The analysis demonstrated that farmers aged below 45 with secondary or higher education and who run farms which specialize in plant or animal production did not use any disaster loans. Close to 30% of farmers who received funding were of the opinion that the compensation was insufficient to cover the losses caused by natural disasters.","[Kurdys-Kujawska, Agnieszka; Rosa, Anna] Koszalin Univ Technol, Fac Econ Sci, Kwiatkowskiego 6E, PL-75343 Koszalin, Poland",Koszalin University of Technology,"Kurdys-Kujawska, A (通讯作者)，Koszalin Univ Technol, Fac Econ Sci, Kwiatkowskiego 6E, PL-75343 Koszalin, Poland.",agnieszka.kurdys-kujawska@tu.koszalin.pl; anna.rosa@tu.koszalin.pl,"Kurdyś-Kujawska, Agnieszka/D-1835-2019","Kurdyś-Kujawska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6024-2947",,,,,9,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,232,239,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600025,0

The government could make full use of the leverage of personal tax-deferral policy to improve the living standards of the assured after retirement and to reduce the pressure of primary endowment insurance and to give full play to the role of commercial pension insurance in social old-age security system. At last, on the basis of the results, the paper gave some suggestions for personal tax-deferred pension policy.","[Li Hongjuan] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Econ, Complex Bldg,Room412, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China; [Li Luyang] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Grad Fac, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics; Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"Li, HJ (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Econ, Complex Bldg,Room412, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",982806830@qq.com; 524079249@qq.com,"Li, Luyang/HLV-9812-2023",,,,,,13,0,0,1,4,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,623,633,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500045,0

Under this new regulatory framework the increase of capital adequacy ratios is a matter of utmost importance for promoting the soundness and stability of the financial system. With regard to the operational risk, Basel III suggests a greater convergence in the measurement methodologies as well as a higher supervision. To this extent, the objective of this paper is threefold: (i) to test the over-dispersed nature of operational losses; (ii) to capture the extra-Poison variance into the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA); (iii) to assess its potential impact on the capital adequacy requirements (CARs) for operational risk Our findings point out a higher capital charge associated to the alternative extra-Poisson distributions; even more significant under heavy-tailed scenarios. In consequence, the over-dispersion phenomenon should be addressed very carefully not only by the financial institutions when designing their internal measurement approaches, but also, by the supervisors when validating such models, both ensuring the appropriate specifications to provide with a more realistic capital charges.

However, currently only a few leading firms succeed in reaping the full potential of BIM. Especially, specialist designers remain excluded from innovative practices. Reasons include the technical hurdles of BIM adoption and a misfit between human agency versus the affordances of BIM. Not all designers have the capabilities required to actively partake in BIM. Thus, BIM practice is often 'messy' and characterized by a large degree of unnecessary rework and workarounds. How and why digital workarounds unfold in BIM design? is at the core of the inquiry reported in this paper. Based on a 'fresh' theoretical approach entitled Theory of Workarounds, we explicate the nature of BIM related workarounds. The industrial setting involves an office refurbishment project in Oslo, Norway. Many specialist designers remained excluded from BIM in this project and a range of different workarounds have been conducted. We portray how and why digital workarounds happened. This provides valuable learning for researchers and practitioners interested in digital workarounds in construction. We contribute to better understanding of messy practices surrounding BIM and to drawing the attention of scholars to workarounds as an area in need of further research. Lastly, our work constitutes an early application of Alter's Theory of Workarounds in the setting of a construction project. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The results showed that fixed transaction costs associated with market information and household characteristics such as gender and education level of the household head had a statistically significant influence on market participation. Proportional transaction costs (distance to market) and variables such as output prices, farm size, labour force, membership of farmer associations and geographical location of households influenced both market participation and intensity of participation.

The world factor underlying common fluctuations in budget surpluses across countries explains an average of 28 to 44 percent of the variation in individual country surpluses. The world factor, which can be interpreted as a global budget surplus index, declines substantially in the 1980s, rises throughout much of the 1990s, peaks in 2000, and declines again after the financial crisis of 2008. The authors then estimate similar world factors in national output gaps, dividend-to-price ratios, and military spending that significantly explain the variation in the world budget surplus factor. Idiosyncratic components of national budget surpluses correlate with well-known unusual country circumstances, such as the Swedish banking crisis of the early 1990s.","[Neely, Christopher J.; Rapach, David E.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Rapach, David E.] St Louis Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Saint Louis University,"Neely, CJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",,"Neely, Chris/N-8182-2019","Neely, Chris/0000-0003-2852-9419",,,,,31,2,2,0,6,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

It has caused many banks to collapse, and many investors and depositors funds were trapped. In fact, it has prevented many banks from achieving their goals and many businesses went into liquidation. Since the last few decades, asset misappropriation is prevalent especially in financial service industry. In addition, employee fraud is the most prevalent type of fraud experienced by organizations. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to provide a more in depth view on the reasons of assets perpetrations conducted by bank employees in Iran. The exploratory study adopts quantitative methods to reach a better grasp of the reasons of why bank staffs commit fraud at work. The sample size of the current research is comprised of 200 bank managers and employees from top three banks in the banking industry of Iran, namely Bank Melli Iran, Bank Saderat Iran and Bank Tejarat Iran. All the respondents were chosen based on the stratified selection method among those who have two in common characteristics, firstly, being informed about details of fraud in the banking industry of Iran, and secondly being decision maker. The result of the paper enhanced the existing literature further in understanding the concept of fraud and assets misappropriation in Iran. Findings are useful for policy makers, managers at banking system and practitioners to improve safety of banking mechanisms in Iran.

Hand in hand with this trend importance of sustainability reporting, which includes reporting on human resources, also increases. In this paper we examine the existence and extent of reporting on human resources in annual reports of the largest companies domiciled in the Czech Republic, which belong to selected industrial sectors. We also investigate which firm characteristics (size, listing status, industry) are potential determinants of the level of disclosure on human resources practices. To fulfil our goals we utilized methods of content analysis and linear regression. In total 45 annual reports were examined. We found that at least some information related to human resources is disclosed in each of these reports. Nevertheless the amount of disclosed information is often very superficial and organizations do not use any standards or guidelines for non-financial reporting. Comparison of the published annual reports with requirements defined by the GRI Guidelines version 4 highlighted how little information on human resources is published by majority of organizations. Regarding potential determinants of level of disclosure, our results show that organization size (measured by number of employees) and listing status (i.e. ownership type) have a significant positive association with composite disclosure index on human resources (CDI). On the contrary, industry had no influence on level of disclosure.

The number of educational programmes in entrepreneurship at all levels of education is steadily increasing worldwide. It is often said that entrepreneurship education is one of the most important development and economic mechanisms. Organizational structure, content, methodology and pedagogy differ from programme to programme, but all of them are created because of similar motives: to stimulate economic development of the environment in which they operate. Entrepreneurship education has a positive influence on the development of entrepreneurial spirit of young people, their intentions towards starting their own business, their employability and, ultimately, their role in society and economy. Although the importance of entrepreneurship education is almost universally accepted, there are numerous problems in measuring the impact of such education. In the case of entrepreneurship education, the traditional tools for assessing the knowledge acquired are not applicable. The objective of the paper is to present the different approaches in evaluation of impact of entrepreneurship education and to introduce a tool for assessing the impact of entrepreneurship education, developed within the European project ASTEE1. The aim of the ASTEE project was to develop a joint European tool for measuring the effects of education for development of entrepreneurial competences at all educational levels ( primary, secondary and tertiary education).

In its Strategy for modernising social protection, the European Union requires all Member States to pay close attention to this issue. The expenditure on pension insurance benefits has been rising on a long-term basis in the Czech Republic, with steady increase of the share of expenditure on old-age pensions within the expenditure structure; since 1993, the expenditure on pensions has exceeded the pension insurance premium revenue by about CZK 350 billion. It is clear that the demands for the pension system will continue to mount in the years to come as a result of the population ageing; the parametric changes implemented under the first pillar of the pension system can only ensure its sustainability on a lower level. Considering the existing settings of parameters of the basic pension insurance scheme, solutions that would contribute to its long-term sustainability on a higher level should mainly be sought within the supplementary pension savings scheme.","[Prusa, Ladislav] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Prusa, L (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10000 10, Czech Republic.",ladislav.prusa@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Literature provides that information sharing is widely regarded as one of the key returns of social capital which has a significant impact on firm performance (Wu 2008). Various dimensions of social capital in the form of network ties, trust and shared vision in strategic alliances and social alliances of SMEs have unique influences on information sharing among their exchange partners. This study attempts to examine the effects of the dimensions of social capital on information sharing advantages of the SMEs and its influence on firm performance, while drawing a comparison between firms engaged in strategic and social alliances. Analyzing the data from 100 small firms in West Bengal largely support the hypothesis that social capital contributes significantly towards information sharing, the effect of which is consequently translated into firm performance. The influence is found to be more pronounced for firms embedded in strategic alliances as compared to other firms.","[Saha, Mausumi] Savitri Girls Coll, Dept Commerce, Kolkata, India; [Banerjee, Sharmistha] Univ Calcutta, Dept Business Management, Kolkata, India",University of Calcutta,"Saha, M (通讯作者)，Savitri Girls Coll, Dept Commerce, Kolkata, India.",mousumi.jishnu@gmail.com; sharmisthabanerjee@hotmail.com,,,,,,,49,3,3,1,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,193,211,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_16,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400016,0

But the process is lacking of service abilities if a customer wants to modify the given information due to a change in circumstances, albeit such a change is easily caused due turbulent economic situations and long spans in real-estate development projects. Hence the customer perspective regarding the construction management (CM) process should be accommodated better. In this paper, the case studies of the four premises improvement projects are reported upon, where the CM process was altered to include and apply the concepts of continuous improvement and co-creation. The process documentation covered the impacts of the case project on the usability of the premises, the indoor climate conditions (carbon dioxide and temperature) metering, the time lapse cameras and the on-line user feedback system. The documentation consists of the minutes of the meetings, the financial reporting and the time tables. Both the processes and the results of the projects are analysed.

By combining increase in longevity and expected wealth at retirement, we confirm that savings decisions using bond pension funds as a low risk pension saving vehicle stipulated by left-wing political actors in many CEE countries are suboptimal and lead to a substantial decrease in replacement ratios not only for higher income cohorts but also for the lowest ones. At the same time, we prove that using bond pension funds do not allow savers avoiding the ultimate risk-uncertainty in expected wealth at time of retirement.","[Sebo, Jan; Sebova, L'ubica] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia; [Virdzek, Tomas] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Inst Econ Sci, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Sebo, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia.",jan.sebo@umb.sk; tomas.virdzek@umb.sk; lubica.sebova@umb.sk,"Virdzek, Tomáš/ACQ-0740-2022; Sebova, Lubica/AAU-5705-2021; Sebo, Jan/ABE-5606-2020",,,,,,16,4,4,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,244,249,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500042,0

This study employs 2,955 of Shariah-compliant companies for a period of five years from 2009 to 2013.

A close relationship among these variables may be suspected. The purpose of this article is to discover this relationship and determine the impact of these variables on changes in the ruble exchange rate with the aid of cointegration analysis.

The commodities produced have been changed several times and at last in 70'-80' the industrial production was moved away from the centre. Old industrial buildings were transformed for commercial purposes and former storage areas were built residential blocks. This development opened the former closed industrial area and revealed the view to Nasijarvi see. The property owner and city decided to build a new waterfront housing area. Also the traffic agency supported the plan and promised state funding for the tunnel what was important part of the project. The decision was made and the planning was underway when some parties took the project their theme in local elections. The election promise was termination of the Rantavayla project. For the sake of the election results a new project design phase was needed. In addition to all previous studies some new kind of decision supporting instruments were used. One of them was the virtual model of options. After this expensive and intense second design phase the decision was the same as original one. Also the arguments were the same: the chosen solution is the most economical and the best for Tampere city centre development. In the decision making the input-output analysis had important role.

The parietal lobe, cerebellum, frontal lobe and the average of the three reference regions, as determined by the slopes of the fitted curves, are 1.6207, 1.5931, 1.5293, and 1.5803, respectively. The F-test values are 5552.4, 2943.6, 3756.8, and 5650.2, respectively; the average F-test value is the largest. Thus, we determined the K3/K4 as 0.5803; therefore, the transfer constant K4 is 1.7216 times that of K3 for the clinical use of N-13-NH3 PET tracer for brain tumors. The N-13-NH3PET tracer is feasible for clinical use with brain tumors. The transfer constant, K4, is approximately two times of K3 in the three-compartment modeling of the parietal lobe, cerebellum, frontal lobe and the average of the three reference regions. This method is feasible and effective.","[Wang, Zhenyou; Huang, Xueling; Song, Changxiu; Liang, Xiaogang] Guangdong Univ Technol, Fac Appl Math, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Bi, Ning] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Math & Computat Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Technology; Sun Yat Sen University,"Wang, ZY (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Technol, Fac Appl Math, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhenyouw@gdut.edu.cn; 919688935@qq.com; scx168@sohu.com; 93242431@qq.com; 30037151@qq.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,368,373,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700072,0

This was accompanied by a multiple increase in public expenditure in the social sector and the welfare state has found itself in a crisis since the 1990's. Given the fiscal unsustainability of the present social systems, measures and reforms addressing the fiscal crisis of the welfare state are being introduced. The European Union introduces some measures at the central level; however, the social systems in the individual countries are unique and historically shaped. The current keynote is to narrow down the role of the state to the provider of basic social protection and encourage the general public towards more responsible behaviour. The objective of this paper is to assess the current social expenditure of the EU member countries (compared to the OECD) and identify their fiscal trend, including the assessment of social expenditure in selected countries.","[Wildmannova, Mirka] Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Wildmannová, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",mirkaw@econ.muni.cz,"Wildmannová, Mirka/C-4390-2015",,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,678,685,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200089,0

To realize which factors affect the profit of insurance companies, if these factors could indicate the profit, and how to indicate profit more precisely in Chinese insurance market - which is full of vitality but also behindhand-to improve the operating strategy, is a very important task. This article has a conclusion of the sources of insurance companies' profit, which include underwriting and investing. It surveys the factors of insurance company's profit from its solvency, profitability, operation capability and growth ability. Selecting the factors of Solvency margin ratio, insurance liability reserve ratio, intrinsic value, market shares, return ratio on investment, operating expense ratio, surrender rate, premium income growth rate and owner's equity growth rate. The source of China Life Insurance Company's profit and its factors was studied in this paper. We used generalized regression neural (GRNN) network to predict the profit of the insurance company, a nd its prediction accuracy was compared with gray model and BP networks. Then the result was get as below. The GRNN network, which overcomes limitations of other prediction model was obtained better performance both in the historical data fitting and model extrapolation than other prediction models by setting the proper smoothness factors. This special network, with excellent ability on self-learning and re-recognition, was very useful in the prediction of insurance company's profit to characterize the complex nonlinear relationship between profit and its factors. For GRNN network, the relative errors of training data fitting were all less than 5% in examples. The relative errors of simulation of GRNN network was calculated as 1.76%, which are approximately 22% and 13% respectively compared with BP networks and gray model.","[Zhang Daijun] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wan Yuting] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Insurance, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wan Yuting] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, DJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zdj0303@126.com; 408306625@qq.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,314,328,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500021,0

Prior research has primarily focused on how VCs adjust aggregate investment to public equity market conditions. We develop a more inclusive measure of exit market conditions that accounts for recent secular changes that have affected the industry return structure, specifically, the sharp rise in the number of failures and M&A relative to IPO exits. We show that the dollars gained relative to dollars lost in recent exits and failures are significantly positively related to VCs' allocations to early-stage companies over the period 1990-2008. The changes in allocations are large enough to have an effect on the availability of funding for early stage companies. In sum, our evidence shows that exit market conditions have a significant and economically meaningful influence on VCs' allocations to riskier investments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, we find that during 2007-2008 the direction of connectedness was clearly from the United States to Europe, but that connectedness became bidirectional starting in late 2008. Second, we find an unprecedented surge in directional connectedness from European to U.S. financial institutions in June 2011, consistent with massive deterioration in the health of EU financial institutions. Third, we identify particular institutions that played disproportionately important roles in generating connectedness during the U.S. and the European crises.","[Diebold, Francis X.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Yilmaz, Kamil] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Pennsylvania; Koc University,"Diebold, FX (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",fdiebold@sas.upenn.edu,"Yilmaz, Kamil/AAV-2482-2021","Yilmaz, Kamil/0000-0003-2455-2099",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [111K500],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"For constructive comments and guidance we thank the Editor (Eric Ghysels) and two anonymous referees, as well as Mert Demirer, Domenico Giannone, Laura Liu, Matteo Luciani, and David Veradas, and seminar participants at ECARES, Koc, and Penn.

The results of a hedonic spatial Durbin model show a negative impact on transaction price of 20.1% for foreclosed apartments and 24.6% for foreclosed single-family houses. Furthermore, the price discount increases when the number of attempted auctions is limited, which is the case for forced apartment sales owing to a lost membership in a housing association (forfeited).

Despite a plethora of reforms intended to increase efficiency and productivity, some policies are perverse and longstanding problems of implementation remain. The share of manufacturing has declined, the real exchange rate has appreciated, exports have dwindled, and growth has been trending downwards. The banking sector is stable but inefficient, with wide net interest margins and numerous barriers to competition. Trade protection, particularly in basic food commodities, has created high costs that weigh particularly heavily on the poor. Declining government revenues have placed increasing pressure on the public budget, even as the current administration aims to increase spending on infrastructure and welfare and to enhance productivity. In an effort to increase revenues, the government has announced a tax amnesty program and other measures. In addition, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the new finance minister, has taken steps to cut non-essential expenditure in order to secure high spending on infrastructure and at the same time keep within the 3% budget deficit limit stipulated by law. Although the overall debt situation is not yet alarming, declining revenues and budget cuts that do not fully reflect this decline are putting pressure on increasing debt levels. The government's high-profile tax amnesty program was the major policy initiative implemented in the second half of 2016 that aimed to relieve this pressure. Despite widespread criticism of, and scepticism about, the tax amnesty (both within and outside Indonesia), its first phase had a much higher participation rate than most independent accounts expected. Revenues raised so far through the amnesty are less than 60% of the official target, but this is actually a strong result for the short term. The bigger question, however, is whether the amnesty is a key element of a more encompassing strategy to overhaul the system of taxation and tax administration. Pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia naik sedikit pada pertengahan 2016 namun masih berada di bawah angka yang diharapkan oleh pemerintah dan masyarakat. Terlepas dari berbagai reformasi yang dilakukan untuk meningkatkan efisiensi dan produktivitas, beberapa kebijakan memang buruk dan permasalahan implementasi masih tetap ada. Kontribusi sektor pengolahan telah turun, nilai tukar riil terapresiasi, nilai ekspor turun, dan pertumbuhan ekonomi mengalami tren penurunan. Sektor perbankan stabil meski tak efisien, ditandai dengan marjin bunga yang besar serta berbagai hambatan kompetisi. Proteksi perdagangan, khususnya dalam komoditas makanan pokok, telah menciptakan biaya ekonomi tinggi yang terutama membebani orang miskin. Turunnya penerimaan pemerintah telah memberi tambahan tekanan pada anggaran negara, sekalipun pemerintah berusaha menambah belanja infrastruktur dan kesejahteraan dan meningkatkan produktivitas. Dalam upaya menambah penerimaan, pemerintah telah mengumumkan program pengampunan pajak beserta program lainnya. Selain itu, menteri keuangan yang baru Sri Mulyani Indrawati telah mengambil langkah-langkah untuk memangkas pengeluaran-pengeluaran yang tidak perlu guna mengamankan pos belanja infrastruktur yang tinggi dan pada saat yang sama menjaga defisit anggaran di bawah 3% seperti yang diamanatkan undang-undang. Meskipun kondisi utang secara keseluruhan tidak menguatirkan, penerimaan yang turun serta pemotongan anggaran yang tidak sepenuhnya merefleksikan kondisi penurunan ini, telah memberikan tekanan pada naiknya tingkat utang. Program tingkat tinggi pemerintah untuk pengampunan pajak merupakan inisiatif utama yang diimplementasikan pada semester ke-2 2016 yang bertujuan untuk mengurangi tekanan tersebut. Terlepas dari kritik dan skeptisme yang tajam, tahap pertama pengampunan pajak (baik di dalam dan luar Indonesia) menunjukkan tingkat partisipasi yang lebih tinggi dibandingkan ekspektasi. Penerimaan yang dihasilkan melalui pengampunan pajak kurang dari 60% target resmi, namun ini merupakan hasil yang baik untuk jangka pendek. Namun pertanyaan yang lebih besar adalah apakah pengampunan pajak merupakan elemen kunci dari sebuah strategi yang lebih menyeluruh untuk memperbaiki sistem pajak dan administrasi perpajakan.","[Hamilton-Hart, Natasha] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Schulze, Guenther G.] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Schulze, Guenther G.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Auckland; University of Freiburg; Australian National University,"Hamilton-Hart, N (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.",,"Hamilton-Hart, Natasha/G-8857-2019","Hamilton-Hart, Natasha/0000-0002-6264-4931",,,,,66,15,16,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Banks using the internal model approach are required to use a two-factor model and a 99.9% VaR capital charge. This model prescription is intended to reduce risk-weighted asset variability, a known feature of internal models, and improve their comparability among financial institutions. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical foundations and relevance of these proposals. We investigate the practical implications of the two-factor and correlation calibration constraints through numerical applications. We introduce the Hoeffding decomposition of the aggregate unconditional loss to provide a systematic-idiosyncratic representation. In particular, we examine the impacts of a J-factor correlation structure on risk measures and risk factor contributions for long-only and long-short credit-sensitive portfolios.

First, we find that firms with lower growth, low working capital, and high internal cash were more likely to end lending relationships with banks. Supply-side effects on the determinants of the end of relationships are insignificant. Second, when firms experienced credit demand during the financial shock, those with lending relationships increased bank borrowings while those without lending relationships reduced internal cash.

Takeovers and recapitalizations are potential alternatives used to shore up financial institutions. We find that takeovers occur when the bank has low net interest margins. Instead, private recapitalizations occur for banks with lower equity, higher net interest margins, and positive growth at the bank level. Public recapitalizations occur for larger, less liquid banks with positive prospects that operate in bigger banking systems. Both types of recapitalizations occur in countries with lower growth. The determinants for takeovers and recapitalization differ between the pre-crisis and crisis periods. Overall, a need for corporate control exists when traditional banking suffers lower performance, whereas the search for stability explains recapitalizations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In most countries, acquisition decisions are delegated to boards, and shareholder approval is discretionary, which makes existing empirical studies inconclusive. We study the U.K. setting in which shareholder approval is imposed exogenously via a threshold test that provides strong identification. U.K. shareholders gain 8 cents per dollar at announcement with mandatory voting, or $ 13.6 billion over 1992-2010 in aggregate; without voting, U.K. shareholders lost $ 3 billion. Multidimensional regression discontinuity analysis supports a causal interpretation.

The setting is composed of two profit-maximizing downstream retailers and two upstream firms in which one of them or both may act consumer-friendly. It considers wholesale versus retail pricing strategy of upstream firms with retailers' effort in a simultaneous game under such setting. It shows that under different pricing rules, the impacts of a higher upstream firms' concern over CSR on market equilibrium outcomes either with symmetric case (two consumer-friendly upstream firms) or asymmetric case (one consumer-friendly upstream firm) are different. In particular, it finds that higher concern over CSR is beneficial to upstream consumer-friendly firm(s) both under wholesale pricing and retail pricing, except in the case of one consumer-friendly upstream firm with strategic leverage under retail pricing, who will benefit. It also compares the corresponding consumer and social welfare under different pricing rules and finds that the retailers' efforts play a key role. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

On the one hand, some of the literature in the economics and political science fields argues that this function should be federal because of factor mobility; on the other hand, because of the distance factor, which makes citizens more sensitive to poverty, others argue that it should a subnational responsibility. Finally, others in both fields argue that it is more accurate to view the recent trends witnessed in developing countries as delegation of service delivery by the central government to different sets of agents. The fact is that the different levels of government across countries intervene in this government obligation. This paper employs the case of Mexico to test the different implications of the theories. This country is studied because it decentralized this activity in 1998, and thus, it is subject to evaluation. The results suggest that decentralizing the poverty relief function has not delivered results; thus, they suggest that this task should be a national one. However, the reason for this is the lack of political accountability at the subnational level and not mobility. That is, when accountability is introduced, a subnational government may in fact perform well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since tax planning can increase both cash flow and accounting earnings, firms with a concentrated customer base may be more likely to engage in tax avoidance. We find evidence of a positive association between the level of corporate customer concentration and the extent of tax avoidance. In addition, we find that the positive relation between corporate customer concentration and tax avoidance is more pronounced when a firm has a lower Market Share in its industry, enjoys less revenue diversification, and engages less in real earnings management. In contrast to corporate major customers, governmental major customers provide stable cash flow to suppliers, which is likely to alleviate supplier firms' need for tax avoidance. We find that firms engage in lower levels of tax avoidance when they have a governmental major customer, and that this association is less pronounced under Democratic presidencies. Taken together, our findings indicate that a firm's customer concentration (i.e., corporate and governmental major customers) has a significant effect on the extent to which it avoids taxes.

This paper proposes a carefully designed structural model that faithfully models typical complex debt structures containing multiple bonds with various covenants. For example, the ability for an issuing firm to meet an obligation is modeled to rely on its ability to meet previous repayments, and the default trigger is shaped according to the characteristics of its debt structure such as the amount and schedule of bond repayments. Thus our framework reliably provides theoretical insight and concrete quantitative measurements consistent with extant empirical research such as the shapes of yield spread curves under various firm's financial statuses, and the impact of payment blockage covenants on newly-issued and other outstanding bonds. We also develop the forest, a novel quantitative method to handle contingent changes in the debt structure due to premature bond redemptions. A forest consists of several trees that capture different debt structures, for instance those before or after a bond redemption. This method can be used to analyze how poison put covenants in the target firm's bonds influence the bidder's costs of debt financing for a leveraged buyout, or investigate how the presence of wealth transfer among the remaining claim holders due to a bond redemption influences the firm's call policy, or further reconcile conflicts among previous empirical studies on call delay phenomena.

I discuss how Bernard's findings advance our understanding of the incentives and disincentives for disclosure.

We examine whether and how social, economic, political and population policy factors contribute to the decline in fertility rates in countries with different income levels, and our findings suggest that these factors can have very different effects on fertility rates in these countries. Political freedom is found to play a role in shaping people's perceptions of fertility and has different effects on fertility for countries in different income categories. Worsening political freedom in Upper Middle income countries exerts downward pressure on fertility rates, while it contributes a positive effect to fertility rates in Lower Middle- and Low-income countries. Urbanization, if implemented successfully, can be an effective approach to further reduce the fertility rate for countries with lower income levels and higher rural populations. Population policies, measured by the contraception prevalence rate, have been found to be effective in reducing the TFR in Upper Middle-income, Lower Middle-income and Low-income countries. From the intra-country analysis, population policies are confirmed to be the main tool used by China and Bangladesh to cut down their TFR. Human capital is confirmed to be one of the most important determinants in explaining the decline in fertility rates across all income categories. The significant policy implication of these findings for policy makers in those Lower Middle-income and Low-income countries is to invest more in education which can have a notable impact on people's perceptions of fertility, and eventually this could help to effectively reduce their fertility levels in a more natural way than could be achieved by aggressive population policies.

When managers cannot move across firms after being hired, employers learn about their talent, efficiently allocate them to projects, and provide insurance to low-quality managers. When, instead, managers can move across firms, firm-level coinsurance is no longer feasible, but managers may self-insure by switching employer to delay the revelation of their true quality. However, this results in inefficient project assignment, with low-quality managers handling projects that are too risky for them.

Faced with the possibility of using a misspecified model, analysts issue forecasts that are robust to model misspecification. We estimate that this mechanism explains approximately 60% of the autocorrelation in analysts' forecast errors. The remainder stems from the cross-sectional variation in mean forecast errors and in analysts' estimation errors of the persistence of earnings growth shocks. Consistent with our model, we find that analysts learn about some features of the earnings process but not others, and this learning reduces, but does not eliminate, the autocorrelation of forecast errors as firms age. Other potential explanations for the autocorrelation of analyst forecast errors are rejected. Our model of robust forecasting applies not only to analysts' forecasts but also to all model-based forecasts.

Many institutional, strategic and organizational factors have been discussed as components or contingencies of the process that makes universities more entrepreneurial. Yet we miss an understanding of the contribution that internationalization, crucial strategy for university competitiveness, can provide to such process. Our study addresses this gap, by looking at the effect of university internationalization on students' progressive engagement in entrepreneurship. We do so by studying internationalization along each of the three university institutional missions (teaching, research and third mission). Based on multilevel analysis on a sample of 25,855 university students across 130 European universities, our findings indicate that university internationalization matters, and with different mechanisms along the three missions; in fact, the effect of internationalization is both direct and indirect as it increases students' human capital but also enhances the impact of traditional university support and training mechanisms in favor of students' entrepreneurship.","[Minola, Tommaso; Meoli, Michele] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Via Pasubio 7b, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy; [Minola, Tommaso] Univ Bergamo, CYFE Ctr Young & Family Enterprise, Via Salvecchio 19, I-24129 Bergamo, BG, Italy; [Donina, Davide; Meoli, Michele] Univ Bergamo, CCSE Cisalpino Inst Comparat Studies Europe, HERe Higher Educ Res Grp, Via Salvecchio 19, I-24129 Bergamo, BG, Italy; [Donina, Davide] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Bergamo; University of Bergamo; University of Pavia,"Minola, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Via Pasubio 7b, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy.",tommaso.minola@unibg.it,"Minola, Tommaso/AAE-3049-2020; Donina, Davide/O-4329-2019; Meoli, Michele/X-2093-2019","Minola, Tommaso/0000-0003-0337-9741; Donina, Davide/0000-0003-2462-876X; Meoli, Michele/0000-0002-9438-0782",,,,,107,36,42,4,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Since household ability to bear children declines with age, the postponement of birth associated with the increased earnings risk drives down the number of birth per family further.

The addition of the constraint leads to significantly lower transaction costs, to a reduction of negative portfolio weights, and to a decrease in volatility and misspecification risk. Furthermore, it allows investors to implement any desired level of leverage. In this study, we include 12 characteristics, thereby extending the classical size, book-to-market and momentum paradigm. We report several key indicators such as the proportion of negative weights, Sharpe ratio, volatility, transaction costs, the transaction cost-adjusted certainty equivalent returns, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. Analyzing the sensitivity of these key indicators to the choice of multiple combinations of the 12 characteristics, to risk aversion, and to estimation sample size, we show that constrained policies are much less sensitive to these parameters than their unconstrained counterparts. Finally, for quadratic utility, we derive a semi-closed analytical form for the portfolio weights. Overall, we provide a comprehensive extension of characteristics-based portfolio choice and contribute to a better understanding and implementation of the allocation process.

Using bank credit default swap (CDS) data, we provide a framework for the evaluation of contagion among banks in different countries and regions during a period of prolonged financial distress. We measure contagion in terms of return spillovers, following a Generalized VAR (GVAR) approach. In addition, we propose an innovative framework to distinguish between two types of contagion: systematic (linked to global factors), and idiosyncratic (linked to bank specific factors). We find evidence of both types of contagion, although the spillover dynamics changed over time. Our measure of systematic contagion is always greater than the idiosyncratic component, thus highlighting the importance of common factors in the propagation of risk spillovers. This indicates that international linkages among banking markets are central to the transmission of shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, we estimate a variant of the International Asset Pricing Model developed by Carried et al. (2007), allowing for time-varying stock market integration, in which we include the foreign currency risk. Our sample consists of monthly data for 12 emerging stock markets over the period 1988M3-2015M3. We find that while the financial integration of emerging stock markets has registered short-term reversals episodes in countries that have been exposed to national or/and regional financial crises, it has decreased in most of the emerging countries of our sample since the global crisis. Moreover, the upward trend in financial integration has not reduced the local market risk premium component as much as could be expected. However, the recent global crisis has induced a reassessment of the world market risk premium for all emerging countries, highlighting the global nature of the crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We address this omission by investigating two core issues. One is whether commercial banks that ended up being subject to FDIC resolution received CPP funds. The other is whether the non allocation of CPP funds made FDIC receivership more likely for viable commercial banks. Our findings show almost no overlap between CPP-funded and FDIC-resolved commercial banks, but we provide evidence that a significant number of FDIC-resolved banks could have avoided receivership if they had been allocated CPP funding. By comparing estimated funding and resolution costs we also show that bailing out more banks would have been cost-efficient. While our results do not allow for any policy suggestion on the optimality of bailouts per se, they suggest that once a bailout program is already on the table, it is better to err on the side of rescuing too many rather than too few banks.

Using a sample of 1091 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms from Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) during the 2005 to 2013 period, we find a positive association between family ownership and the number of outside directorships held by board members. This finding is consistent with the notion that family ownership reduces a board's monitoring capabilities. We also test whether the recent corporate governance reforms in GCC, which were designed to protect investors and minority shareholders, affect firms' incentives to establish a board nomination committee (NC). We find the existence of a board NC and the quality and characteristics of NC membership act to suppress the positive association between outside directorships and family ownership. Our results are robust to the use of alternative measures of outside directorships and family ownership and models that test for endogeneity. Overall, our results suggest that the institutional specificities of emerging economies such as those in the GCC can sustain high levels of multiple directorships, which could impair the quality of corporate governance.

The underlying intuition is that a clear fiscal policy communication can coalesce expectations, reducing disagreement.

From 2000 to 2013, premium subsidies increased sevenfold and acres enrolled increased by 77%. Although designed for nonenvironmental goals, subsidized insurance may affect the use of land, fertilizer, and agrochemicals and, therefore, environmental externalities from agriculture. Using novel panel data, we examine farmer responses to changes in coverage with an empirical approach that exploits program limits on coverage that were more binding for some farmers than for others. Estimates indicate that expanded coverage had little effect on the share of farmland harvested, crop specialization, productivity, or fertilizer and chemical use. More broadly, we construct and describe a new nationwide, farm-level panel data set with nearly 32,500 farms observed at least twice over the 2000-2013 period, a resource that should enrich US agro-environmental research.","[Weber, Jeremy G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Weber, Jeremy G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Key, Nigel; O'Donoghue, Erik] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Weber, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Weber, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jgw99@pitt.edu; nkey@ers.usda.gov; eodonoghue@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,47,45,57,3,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The rapid expansion of Beijing's subway system over the last decade provides a precious opportunity to research the transit-retail amenities-property value connection. This paper enhances our knowledge by studying how local consumer amenities react to urban rail transit development and subsequently reflect in consumers' willingness to pay. Using multiyear subway construction history, station neighborhoods' restaurant activities and rental housing transactions in Beijing, we find a new subway station positively contributes to the number of new openings and the diversity of nearby restaurants. The changes in neighborhood restaurant activities capture 20-40% of the home value appreciation following the construction of a subway station. Our findings support the multiplier effect of neighborhood retail amenities in rail transit's impact on local home value. The public investment in transit and the private market responses complement each other and together contribute toward urban quality of life, as revealed by the appreciation in local property values.

Aggregate income rose, but real labour earnings stagnated. Employment rose, too, but mainly in low-skill sectors with predominantly informal employment arrangements. In this article, we reveal causal connections from the aggregate phenomenon of Dutch disease to these labour-market outcomes. We first explain broad sectoral trends, and then, integrating data from several national surveys, investigate sources of variation in boom-era labour earnings. We use instrumental variables to address issues of endogeneity and selection in earnings equations. After controlling for individual and district features, we find that the intensity of palm oil productionpalm oil having been a key booming resource exportrobustly predicts diminished formal employment, and that lower formality, in turn, robustly predicts lower earnings. Our findings establish causal linkages absent from prior studies, and so provide a structural dimension to ongoing debates over persistent poverty, rising inequality, and the lack of educational progress in Indonesia.","[Coxhead, Ian] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Shrestha, Rashesh] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Australian National University,"Coxhead, I (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Coxhead, Ian/0000-0001-6958-038X",,,,,35,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Using data from the March 2013 round of the National Socio-economic Survey (Susenas) and the fourth round of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (2007-8), I explore the sensitivity of Indonesia's poverty profile to different assumptions about the relative costs of individuals, taking into account differences in age, gender, body weight, and physical activity levels. I adopt parameter estimates for my simulation exercises from various Indonesia-specific publications, as well as from a joint intergovernmental consultation on nutrition. I compare my estimates with the per capita scale used by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), the central statistics agency. My findings suggest that the age-poverty relationship in Indonesia is sensitive to assumptions about the relative costs of individuals, with all alternative scales showing substantially lower poverty incidence among young children than by BPS's estimate. Overall, however, I find that Indonesia's poverty profile is relatively robust.","[Priebe, Jan] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Priebe, Jan] TNP2K, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Gottingen,"Priebe, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.;Priebe, J (通讯作者)，TNP2K, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,35,6,6,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

We find a significant non-linear association between ownership concentration and tax avoidance that exhibits an inverted U-shaped pattern. At a lower level, increased ownership concentration is positively associated with tax avoidance due to the entrenchment effect. However, beyond the minimum level necessary for effective control, concentrated ownership through voting rights is negatively associated with tax avoidance because of the alignment effect. We also find a significantly positive association between pyramidal ownership structure and tax avoidance due to the entrenchment effect. When voting rights and cash-flow rights diverge, a lower level of cash-flowrights fails to offer the controlling owner incentive alignment sufficient to reduce the entrenchment effect and tax avoidance.

Each index is derived from a dynamic factor model based on twelve underlying variables capturing various aspects of metro area economic activity. To accommodate mixed-frequency data and differences in data-publication lags, we estimate the dynamic factor model using a maximum likelihood approach that allows for arbitrary patterns of missing data. Our indices highlight important similarities and differences in business cycles across MSAs. While a number of MSAs experience sizable recessions during the national recessions of the early 1990s and early 2000s, other MSAs escape recessions altogether during one or both of these periods. Nearly all MSAs suffer relatively deep recessions near the recent Great Recession, but we still find significant differences in the depth of recent metro recessions. We relate the severity of metro recessions to a variety of MSA characteristics and find that MSAs with less-educated populations and less elastic housing supplies experience significantly more severe recessions.

Our finding that fast trading indicates informed (noisy) trading in the ITM (OTM) options remains unchanged despite controlling for the effects of trade volume, market liquidity, and intraday time periods.

In contrast to the usual DFP, our newly developed DFP has two protection levels and protection is activated only when the value of underlying asset reaches upper protection levels. This kind of product has a structure similar to that of the chained barrier option proposed by Jun and Ku (2012). In this context, we name our newly designed equity-linked product as chained dynamic fund protection (CDFP). Buying CDFP can be advantageous for both vendors and investors compared to buy usual DFP. Relatively small downside risk for CDFP is beneficial for vendors. Also for investors, the price they cost for protection of CDFP is cheaper than that of usual DFP. Furthermore, investors can handle the price of protection by adjusting the level of upper protection as they desired. In this paper, we derive a closed-form formula for CDFP using reflection principle under Black-Scholes framework. Furthermore, we represent numerical results for values of CDFP according to various parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Government policies and weak property rights contribute to this process by encouraging landowners and landless to accelerate land clearing. Using panel data common to previous studies, we add the dimension of new political regimes, democratic and non-democratic, and investigate how the rate of agricultural land expansion in tropical countries depends on the nature and persistence of each regime. We find that both new autocratic and democratic regimes have accelerated the expansion of agricultural land, thus yielding support to some of the findings in the earlier literature. Interesting differences emerge between regions, with the impact being most pronounced in Latin America. We interpret these results mainly in the context of increasing tenure and ownership insecurity, which in turn is driven by the tendency of new regimes to implement land reforms as a form of social and economic policy or voter payback. The argument is developed more formally using a simple competitive land use model that incorporates political regime dependent confiscation risk and agricultural subsidy policy.","[Kuusela, Olli-Pekka] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Amacher, Gregory S.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Kuusela, OP (通讯作者)，Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",olli-pekka.kuusela@luke.fi; gamacher@vt.edu,,"Kuusela, Olli-Pekka/0000-0003-3878-5440",,,,,50,20,21,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We show that the feedback between them can amplify a small shock into interbank market freezing with liquidity evaporating. Credit crunches of the interbank market drive up the interbank rate. For an individual institution, a higher interbank rate - meaning a higher funding cost - results in more severe coordination problems among creditors in debt rollover decisions. Creditors thus behave more conservatively and run more often. Facing an increased chance of creditor runs, institutions demand more and supply less liquidity, tightening the interbank market.

The majority of drivers earn enough from the activity to meet their day to day needs and to invest to increase human and economic capital. The arduous working conditions, the impacts on health and the risk of accidents and aggression explain however why the activity is perceived as temporary and undertaken for want of anything better. There is a need to identify measures to professionalize the occupation and improve its image, and also find the best way to implement them.

We demonstrate in a simple game-theoretical model how murders can serve as an enforcer of corrupt deals under certain regime assumptions. Testing the main implications in an unbalanced panel of 179 countries observed through four periods, we find that corruption is strongly related to the incidence of murders of journalists in countries with almost full press freedom.

In this article, we argue that such disappointing performance can be largely attributed to the estimation error incurred in sample mean-variance portfolios, and therefore could be improved by utilizing more efficient estimating strategies. In particular, we show that this Markowitz optimization enigma (Michaud, 1989) could be resolved by carefully balancing the tradeoff between the estimation error and systematic error through the so-called subspace mean-variance analysis. In addition to the consistent improvement observed on real and simulated data sets, we prove that, under an approximate factor model, it is possible to use this strategy to construct portfolio rules whose performance closely resemble that of theoretical mean-variance efficient portfolios in a large market.","Bank Amer, Charlotte, NC USA; Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Bank of America Corporation; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Yuan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, 1300 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",myuan@stat.wisc.edu,"yuan, ming/JPL-4196-2023; Yuan, Ming/J-6153-2019","Yuan, Ming/0000-0002-4415-8606",NSF CAREER [DMS-1321692]; FRG [DMS-1265202]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1265202] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF CAREER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); FRG; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),This research was supported in part by the NSF CAREER Award DMS-1321692 and FRG Grant DMS-1265202.,,45,20,23,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Our empirical analysis identifies thresholds of interest bill indicators beyond which governments appear to intensify efforts to curb the debt trajectory. Hence, in the current context of historically high public debts, a country experiencing high and rising borrowing costs and interest payments would be more likely to enact a more aggressive fiscal consolidation than one benefitting from persistently low interest rates - even though both consolidation paths would be consistent with solvency.

Various hypotheses from the West have been tested in leading Chinese metropolises, but so far no attention has been paid to the role of hukou, a rather unique Chinese institution causing the emergence of invisible walls within cities. To address this deficiency, the present paper places hukou at the forefront in its analysis of commuting in Guangzhou and reveals that in comparison with hukou holders, non-hukou residents tend to have more balanced jobs-housing relationship, rely less on motorized transport, and spend less time on commuting than hukou holders. Furthermore, some variables have influence on commuting time for one hukou type but not the other; some other variables that have influence on both groups differ systematically in their effects.

We propose a novel estimation strategy for affine term structure models that jointly fits yields and bond excess returns, thereby capturing predictive information otherwise hidden to standard estimations. The model predicts excess returns with high regression Res and high forecast accuracy but cannot outperform the expectations hypothesis out-of-sample in terms of economic value, showing a general contrast between statistical and economic metrics of forecast evaluation. More specifically, the model mostly generates positive (negative) economic value during times of high (low) macroeconomic uncertainty. Overall, the expectations hypothesis remains a useful benchmark for investment decisions in bond markets, especially in low uncertainty states. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use laboratory experiments to compare welfare outcomes and underlying behavior in games with dynamic externalities under two distinct settings: traditionally studied games with infinitely-lived decision makers, and more realistic intergenerational games. We show that if decision makers change across generations, resolving dynamic externalities becomes more challenging for two distinct reasons. First, decision makers' actions may be short-sighted due to their limited incentives to care about future generations' welfare. Second, even when the incentives are perfectly aligned across generations, the increased strategic uncertainty of the intergenerational setting may lead to an increased inconsistency of own actions and beliefs about others, making own actions more myopic. Access to history and advice from previous generations may improve dynamic efficiency but may also facilitate coordination on noncooperative action paths.","[Sherstyuk, Katerina; Tarui, Nori] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tarui, Nori] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Econ Res Org UHERO, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ravago, Majah-Leah V.] Univ Philippines, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ, Res Ctr Future Design, Kochi, Japan",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; Hitotsubashi University; Kochi University,"Tarui, N (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Tarui, N (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Econ Res Org UHERO, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",nori@hawaii.edu,"Ravago, Majah-Leah/AAD-2323-2021; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012; Sherstyuk, Katerina/AAH-7020-2021","Sherstyuk, Katerina/0000-0003-2666-9987; Tarui, Nori/0000-0003-2114-5332",,,,,41,32,34,6,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Fishermen can participate in fisheries managed by multiple councils, and effort controls in one region could lead to effort leakage into another. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that positive, negative, and no leakage are possible. Using difference-in-differences, we test for leakage across regional boundaries for a catch share program in New England and find evidence that the New England groundfish sector program caused spillover into adjacent Mid-Atlantic fisheries. Aggregate Mid-Atlantic harvest volume increased among sector members after the policy change.

On average, the data are consistent with a liquidity management regime in which banks targeted the traditional loans-to-core deposits (LTCD) ratio. Perhaps surprisingly, the data are also consistent on average with the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), a regulatory liquidity ratio that was not formally introduced by the Bank for International Settlements until 2010. We find evidence of LTCD and (implicit) NSFR targeting at banks of all sizes, but concordance is strongest for small banks and weakest for so-called SIFI banks. As banks increase in size, they set lower liquidity targets often in violation of the coming Basel III standards but manage those targets more efficiently. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the growing polycentricity of North American metropolises means transit providers face the difficult task of serving ever more dispersed employment centers. Deciding where limited project resources would provide the most benefit for disadvantaged populations should be a concern for transit planners and elected officials. The purpose of this research is to determine where low-wage employment zones are, where different types of low-wage jobs concentrate, and determine if job type and location have an effect on transit ridership for low-wage workers. We use a previously proposed method to identify low-wage employment zones in the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area, Canada and measure job type concentration using a gravity approach. We then test to see if job type concentration and employment centres relate to ridership, while controlling for other factors that influence mode share. Our results indicate significant differences in transit use for different occupations exist. These results can help guide more transit investment and research by tackling specific occupation's travel needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By employing both real options and portfolio selections theories, we propose an optimal decision regarding shareholders' portfolio choices in order to identify their preferences in terms of corporate investment choices. Making decisions about stockholdings involves taking into accountthe risk-return characteristics of firm value, equity value, and project value. We find that shareholders prefer to keep more corporate stocks if the firm invests in a project with a high initial value, high growth rate, and low risk. Moreover, shareholders favor a corporate investment policy with low capital expenditures and a low debt-financing policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the conditions under which sustainable growth is both feasible and optimal, where the latter takes the form of second-best optimal environmental Ramsey policies. We also investigate the conditions for an inverted U-shaped relation between environmental policies and sustainable growth. We show that the combination of environmental production externalities and second-best optimal Ramsey policies can lead to both local and global indeterminacy. The introduction of environmental policy, although well-intentioned and designed to correct for market inefficiencies, triggers an expectations coordination problem; thereby differences in environmental quality and economic growth can be explained among countries with the same fundamentals.","[Park, Hyun] Kyung Hee Univ, 001 Hoeki Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Philippopoulos, Apostolis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, 76 Patiss St, Athens, Greece",Kyung Hee University; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, 001 Hoeki Dong, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",econhyun@khu.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea [2014S1A3A2044459],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"Park (Corresponding author): Kyung Hee University 001 Hoeki-Dong, Dongdaemoon-Gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.

Also, we use endogenously determined time varying weights with random coefficients. In this context, we utilize the proposed model to a selected panel of world economies that account for more than 90% of global production. Our work identifies and estimates the link between countries based on the global variables of trade and finance, which act as the transmission channels that have been documented in the literature as being important. To this end, we investigate how the dominant economies of USA and EU17 will be affected by a potential slowdown in the BRICs. Consistent with international evidence, the empirical findings show that both monetary and financial variables, such as interest rates and total credit, have a significant impact on the transmission of shocks. According to our findings, the EU17 economy seems to be more vulnerable than the US economy to shocks from the BRICs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal contract can be interpreted as an explicit contract that specifies a minimum bonus pool as a function of the verifiable measure and an implicit contract that gives the principal discretion to increase the size of the pool and to allocate it among the agents. To mitigate the threat of collusion, the optimal contract often converts any exogenous productive interdependence into strategic payoff independence for the agents.

The quantile regression approach allows the coefficient on the independent variable (idiosyncratic risk) to vary across the distribution of the dependent variable (return). Our sample consists of stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ during 1980-2010: 80,324 firm-year observations and 8,123 firms in total. The quantile regression results show that idiosyncratic risk is positively (negatively) related to returns at the high (low) quantiles of returns. The findings are consistent with the prospect theory that investors have a tendency to be less (more) willing to gamble with profits (losses). The results also demonstrate that the least-squares and least-sum optimization methods commonly used in prior research do not capture the relations between idiosyncratic risk and returns at the tail parts of the distribution of returns. Therefore, our empirical results provide new insights into the idiosyncratic risk-return relation in the literature.","[Lee, Bong-Soo] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Li, Leon] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Waikato,"Li, L (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Finance, Finance, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton, New Zealand.",leonli@waikato.ac.nz,"Li, Leon/H-9013-2016","Li, Leon/0000-0002-2865-6568",,,,,94,8,11,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

We find that the proportion of outsiders on the board is unrelated to performance; rather it is outsiders' financial expertise that has the most significant financial performance impact. In addition, superior performance can also be related to the financial expertise of inside directors, thereby reinforcing the importance of board-level financial expertise in the insurance industry.

I find that stocks with both large unrealized gains and large unrealized losses outperform others in the following month (trading strategy monthly alpha = 0.5-1%, Sharpe ratio = 1.5). This supports the conjecture that these stocks experience higher selling pressure, leading to lower current prices and higher future returns.

We examine the structural changes in the relationship between the sovereign and financial institutions' credit default swap spreads during the European sovereign debt crisis. Before the first Greek bailout by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the sovereign and financial sectors exhibit a two-way feedback effect for both the short and the long runs. Crucially, we find that after the first Greek bailout, shocks in the financial sector either exert significantly negative impacts or lose influences on the sovereign sector. In contrast, all the later bailouts by the EFSF (the second Greek bailout, Irish and Portugal bailouts) do not show this pattern change in the two-way risk transfer relationship.

The analysis is performed on both intra-day and daily data. We show that heterogeneity in correlations across a number of investment horizons between pairs of assets is a dominant feature during times of economic downturn and financial turbulence for all three pairs of the assets under research. Heterogeneity prevails in correlations between gold and stocks. After the 2008 crisis, correlations among all three assets increase and become homogenous: the timing differs for the three pairs but coincides with the structural breaks that are identified in specific correlation dynamics. A strong implication emerges: during the period under research, and from a different-investment-horizons perspective, all three assets could be used in a well diversified portfolio only during relatively short periods.

This paper develops a model of stock returns where dispersion in returns across different stocks is modeled jointly with aggregate volatility. Although specifications that allow for feedback from cross-sectional dispersion to aggregate volatility have a better fit in sample, they prove not to be robust for purposes of out-of-sample forecasting. Using a full cross-section of stock returns jointly, however, I find that use of cross-sectional dispersion can help improve parameter estimates of a GARCH process for aggregate volatility to generate better forecasts both in sample and out of sample. Given this evidence, I conclude that cross-sectional information helps predict market volatility indirectly rather than directly entering in the data-generating process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical findings based on the instrumental variable method of estimation confirm statistically significant inverse correlation of contract enforcement with New Zealand's exports to and imports from Asia. The findings also reveal that New Zealand's exports to Asia are negatively and statistically significantly correlated with Asian political rights and New Zealand's imports from Asia are negatively but statistically insignificantly correlated with Asian political rights. We conclude that as part of wider trade integration New Zealand's Asian trading partners should invest more resources in improving their governance such as instituting mechanisms for better enforcement of contracts and allowing greater political openness.

With habit formation, both the risk aversion and intertemporal substitution channels enhance the market price of short-run consumption risk. With long-run risks, intertemporal substitution reduces the market prices of long-run consumption risks, working against risk aversion. The contrasting effects of the intertemporal substitution channel drive key differences in the model implications of habit formation and long-run risks.","[Yang, Wei] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Yang, W (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,41,4,4,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The export tax increases the urban unemployment rate, but improves the quality of the environment. Here, the optimal export tax is lower than the adjusted marginal environmental damage. Reducing the number of harvesters has a similar resource allocation effect to that of an export tax.

Our study investigates this claim for sector-specific aid and for bilateral and multilateral donors using data on 136 recipient countries for the 1986-2009 period. We employ a two-part quantitative model to match the donor decision-making process, consisting of a first-stage recipient selection equation and a second-stage allocation equation on selected recipients. We find strong support that IMF programs catalyze aid on aggregate, but the evidence varies across different types of aid. Aid catalysis is stronger and more robust in sectors linked to the IMF's core competency areas, namely debt-related relief and general budget support, but weaker and less robust for infrastructure, production, multisector, and humanitarian aid, and non-existent for health and education. Across donors, IMF programs are associated with increases in aid by countries with larger voting shares in the IMF, such as the United States and Japan, but less so by countries with few votes or for multilateral agencies. This finding is consistent with research in international political economy arguing that the IMF's powerful stakeholders drive the organization's decisions and policies. Taken together, our findings emphasize the IMF's multi-dimensional impact on the global development agenda an erstwhile overlooked factor in studies of aid allocation while refuting the purported positive effects of IMF programs on aid for social policy.

Specifically, using intraday tick data, we examine the spreads, asymmetric information component of the bid-ask spread, autocorrelations of intraday returns, variance ratios and return predictability of the order flow for foreign IPO firms. We contrast these measures against those of comparable IPO firms on both the Chinese stock exchanges and the Hong Kong stock exchange matched based on the year of IPO, industry and firm size. We find that while the foreign IPO firms largely operate in China, they are generally perceived as having a similar level of information asymmetry and price efficiency as Hong Kong IPO firms. In contrast, IPOs on the Chinese exchanges have much higher proportions of information asymmetry in their spreads and lower price efficiency than foreign IPO firms. Our findings are generally robust to the use of the Heckman two-stage procedure that controls for potential self-selection bias. Our results provide further evidence that it is the location of trading that is important for pricing of firms rather than the location of their business. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that many of the aspects emphasized in the fund management literature, such as returns generated by the average manager and emphasis on past performance, play a relatively minor role in decisions. In contrast, judgment is found to play a central role, particularly the evaluation of people when selecting managers, the role of confidence in retaining managers, and self-perceptions about capability to identify skilled managers. Past performance is not taken at face value, but analyzed to understand underlying sources of returns. Stated reasons for preferring active management relate to whether a handful of skilled active managers can be identified and combined to generate a better expected portfolio outcome; and are only vaguely associated with the performance of the average manager.","[Foster, F.

Group, additive and multiplicative methodologies of inequality decomposition are employed. The first allows us to understand the role of regional groups; the second allows us to investigate the role of different fossil energy sources (coal, oil and gas); and the third allows us to clarify the separated role of the carbonisation index and the energy intensity in the pattern observed for inequalities in intensities. The results show that, first, the reduction in global emissions intensity has coincided with a significant reduction in international inequality. Second, the bulk of this inequality and its reduction are attributed to differences between the groups of countries considered. Third, coal is the main energy source explaining these inequalities, although the growth in the relative contribution of gas is also remarkable. Fourth, the bulk of inequalities between countries and its decline are explained by differences in energy intensities, although there are significant differences in the patterns demonstrated by different groups of countries. The policy implications of these results are discussed.","[Antonio Duro, Juan; Teixido-Figueras, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Antonio Duro, Juan; Teixido-Figueras, Jordi] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Padilla, Emilio] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Bellaterra,Edificio B, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Padilla, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Bellaterra,Edificio B, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",juanantonio.duro@urv.net; jordijosep.teixido@urv.cat; emilio.padilla@uab.es,"Padilla Rosa, Emilio/J-8332-2013; Teixido, Jordi/AAA-1596-2019; Teixido, Jordi/J-2854-2017","Padilla Rosa, Emilio/0000-0002-9510-8262; Teixido, Jordi/0000-0002-2530-388X; Teixido, Jordi/0000-0002-2530-388X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45380-P, ECO2012-34591]; XREAP (DGR)",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); XREAP (DGR),"We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers and the editor.

Innovation (understood as the creation of new knowledge) is fundamentally linked with intangible resources. Actually, intellectual capital has been widely considered as one of the main drivers of innovation, but the particularities embedded in this relationship remain unclear. The existing body of literature has repeatedly demonstrated that intellectual capital enhances innovation performance, though the analysis made has hardly considered how this relationship varies according to the technology intensity of the firm. High technology companies deal with more complex and tacit knowledge that should be frequently renewed. Since high and low technology firms differ in terms of knowledge, the relationship between intellectual capital and the development of new products and services is also expected to differ between both types of firm. Therefore, this study will address this gap by analysing how intellectual capital stocks influence product and service innovations in high and low technology companies. Data from 180 Spanish firms (representing both manufacturing and service industries) was collected by means of a questionnaire. Structural equation modelling based on partial least squares was then utilized for analysing the data. The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that the relationship between intellectual capital and innovation differs according to the technology level of the firm. In high-tech companies managers should enhance human capital and external relational capital, whereas in low-tech firms, structural capital and external relational capital should be promoted. In other words, the management of intellectual capital should be dependent on the technology level of the firm. This study adds to the existing literature by showing that the technology level of the corporation is an important contingency factor in the relationship between intellectual capital and innovation.","[Buenechea, Marta] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Informat Syst, San Sebastian, Spain; [Buenechea, Marta; Kianto, Aino] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Dept Management & Int Business, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Saenz, Josune] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Dept Finance & Accountancy, San Sebastian, Spain",University of Deusto; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; University of Deusto,"Buenechea, M (通讯作者)，Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Informat Syst, San Sebastian, Spain.;Buenechea, M (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Dept Management & Int Business, Lappeenranta, Finland.",marta.buenechea@deusto.es; aino.kianto@lut.fi; josune.saenz@deusto.es,"Saenz, Josune/U-7543-2019; Kianto, Aino/Y-6931-2019; Elberdin, Marta Buenechea/AAZ-3706-2020","Saenz, Josune/0000-0001-7788-7867; Kianto, Aino/0000-0001-7173-3525;",,,,,47,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,45,53,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300006,0

Applying a two-way random-effects regression model to the daily sales data of four megastores and four super supermarkets, we find the net sales decrease of superstores is on average 5.61% of daily sales after taking into account sales increases due to consumers' switching to weekdays. Only about 17%-19% of the reduced superstore sales are transferred to traditional markets.

J,"DuBois, FL; Primo, MAM",,,,"DuBois, Frank L.; Mendes Primo, Marcos Andre",,,State capitalism and clusters: the case of Brazilian shipbuilding,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Emerging markets; Brazil; Strategic alliances; Cluster analysis; Public sector/state-owned enterprises,GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; KNOWLEDGE,"Purpose - State capitalism is an economic model that relies on the role of a strong central government to support chosen firms and industries with subsidies, tax benefits and other advantages to which non-favored firms or industries do not have access (Bremmer, 2010). From an economic development perspective state capitalism is often used to redirect economic activity to underdeveloped regions (Wickham, 2009; Chobanyan and Leigh, 2006; Porter, 2008). The purpose of this paper is to examine the case of the Brazilian shipbuilding to illustrate the use of state capitalism to direct economic activity. Design/methodology/approach - Using Porter's diamond factor model the authors analyze the development of an economic cluster focussed on the shipbuilding industry in northeastern Brazil. Using interviews with company executives and archival information, the authors profile the investments and incentives that the government has made in this region with particular attention to the mechanisms and policy directives designed to support local involvement in cluster activity. Findings - The authors find that the Brazilian shipbuilding industry offers a unique perspective on the role that governments play in the inducement of economic activity. The authors document the challenges that confront the local enterprise in meeting the requirements of the state controlled buyer and the difficulties associated with developing a local supplier base and finding a qualified workforce. The authors conclude with comments with regard to the applicability of this model to economic development activity in other country contexts. Research limitations/implications - This research adds to the body of literature on the role of governments in the creation of economic clusters. Practical implications - Economic development in emerging markets is often associated with strong government intervention. The authors use the Brazilian shipbuilding industry to illustrate the role of a state owned enterprise in facilitation of economic development. Social implications - Some countries may suffer from what has been known as the resource curse, that is, the misallocation of resource wealth into non-productive activities. In this paper, the authors illustrate and attempt by the Brazilian government to use this wealth to create employment opportunities in an underdeveloped region of the country. Originality/value - Emerging markets are challenged in developing viable enterprises that are competitive in global markets. Most research on the development of industrial clusters is focussed on developed markets. These markets do not have to confront the same challenges found in emerging markets. The research illustrates these challenges and the efforts that may be made to surmount them.","[DuBois, Frank L.] Amer Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Mendes Primo, Marcos Andre] Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Management, Recife, PE, Brazil",American University; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"DuBois, FL (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jetfrank@yahoo.com,"pRIMO, MARCOS/X-4219-2019","pRIMO, MARCOS/0000-0001-8126-9252; DuBois, Frank/0000-0002-1198-7731",FGV; American University on Brazil,FGV; American University on Brazil,"The authors would like to thank Leslie Armijo of Portland State University, the participants in the workshop sponsored by FGV and American University on Brazil and the Liberal Order: Brazil's Influence on Global Norms and Institutions as well the anonymous reviewers for their comments on earlier drafts of the paper.",,61,8,8,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Methodology/methods Goal realization was based on a case study which in social sciences, including economic sciences, is a recognized research method allowing for the observation of a wide perspective of the issue being studied. Other than the case study method the method of scientific description was also used employing subject literature, Polish regulations of accounting law and international standards of accounting. Scientific aim The aim of this article is to try to identify areas of integration between marketing and accounting in the realization of research and development activities. Findings The first field of integration of marketing and accounting is the need to conduct an initial market analysis and ascertain the prospects of its development in terms of demand for the new product at the moment of progressing from the research stage to the development stage, to make changes in the records of expenditures and to express them in the financial report. The next stage of integration is the expression of accrued expenditures for development work at the time of their completion. Conclusions The case of the surveyed enterprise confirms the complexity and importance of the innovation processes, especially in the context of research and development activities being carried out. The analysis shows that the implementation of this research is the result of the involvement of all functional areas of the organization, among which the accounting and marketing functions are significant. The indicated case study confirmed the benefits of integrating the accounting and marketing functions in connection with the implementation of research and development activities, thus having an influence on reducing the risk of failure of a new product on the market.","[Dyhdalewicz, Anna; Widelska, Urszula] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Dyhdalewicz, A (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",a.dyhdalewicz@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,430,437,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200054,0

A simple specification is used in which the global economy can produce a single homogeneous consumption good with two different technologies. The old technology has global diminishing returns to scale and depends on the use of fossil energy that gives rise to long-lived, damaging climate change. The new technology has convex-concave production due to set-up cost and is not vulnerable to climate change. Through simulations we show that if output with the new technology does not grow fast enough to move through the phase of increasing returns, then the economy could experience an environmental growth trapaEurolingering at a low level of income indefinitely, or achieving some progress but then getting driven back to a lower level of income by productivity-reducing environmental degradation.

The study is based on empirical data collected through a postal questionnaire sent to 2,250 Swedish farmers in 2013 (response rate similar to 40%). Exploratory factor analysis of a set of attitudinal measurement items was used to assess members' attitudes to agricultural cooperatives. Seemingly unrelated regression analysis was used to identify the impact of members' perceptions of agency problems on the attitude measures obtained from the exploratory factor analysis. The results suggest that perceived agency problems significantly explain members' attitudes to their cooperatives. Therefore, working with these problems can be a way for directors of cooperatives to influence members' attitudes and, in continuation, behaviors to these. This would be one way of developing more sustainable member-director relationships in these cooperatives.","[Hakelius, Karin; Hansson, Helena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hakelius, K (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",karin.hakelius@slu.se,"Hansson, Helena/AAR-2089-2021","Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275; Hansson, Helena/0000-0001-9609-4387",,,,,65,16,20,1,26,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

In last few years spatial and temporal data presentation, analysis and prediction became much more developed and used. GIS data that few years ago could be displayed and used only in specialized software can now be used and presented by web applications. But web applications conform to special requirements, especially in terms of storing data effectively in specialized data models and in terms of special structure of data needed when showing data to user via web interface. When working with data used in agriculture it's often needed to not only work with current spatial data, but we often want to work with history, more specifically seasonal data. We need to work with multiple data sets gathered in recurring time frames. This requires special type of data model that works effectively with not only data but also with metadata. Used data and methods include data modeling, relational modeling, normalization, UML, work with metadata according to Inspire Directive and ISO19115. Work with spatio-temporal data in relation database and KML format. This paper presents data model for storing seasonal data often used in agriculture. This model is optimized for use as base for web application and deals with problems that come with it, including optimalization for commonly used queries and storing and easy use of metadata. Resulting data model is presented in UML. This model can be generalized for use with other similar types of spatio-temporal data. Research presented in this paper describes problems occurring when designing data models for web GIS including problems specific for web environment and working with seasonal data and their metadata. Paper offers solution in form of optimized data model for simple spatio-temporal agricultural data and metadata, then can be further easily expanded and generalized to accommodate other similar types of data sets.","[Konopasek, Jakub; Klimesova, Dana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Konopásek, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",konopasek@pef.czu.cz; klimesova@pef.czu.cz,"Konopásek, Jakub/ABA-8610-2021; Klimesova, Dana/F-3511-2015","Klimesova, Dana/0000-0002-3003-7205",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,155,161,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000019,0

However, through detailed ethnographic description of the everyday practices of soybean farmers in Malwa, this paper argues that there is no direct link between scientific methods and high productivity, defined as yield per unit of land, because the outcome is dependent on variables that cannot be controlled by farmers. Rather, the metaphor of a 'good farmer' was selectively used by upper-caste farmers to reinforce their power and authority in the face of declining state support to emphasize their continued importance to agriculture and the state. When upper-caste farmers were less productive, they placed the blame on the environment, but when lower-caste farmers produced less, the blame was placed on their (lack of) capability to understand scientific techniques that were expected to increase productivity. This paper suggests that instead of using the productivity discourse to evaluate farming, a different valuation reveals the positive contribution of soybean as a poor farmer's crop due to its agronomic characteristics and market environment.","[Kumar, Richa] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Kumar, R (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, MS 624, New Delhi 110016, India.",richa@hss.iitd.ac.in,,,Wenner Gren Anthropological Foundation; American Institute of Indian Studies,Wenner Gren Anthropological Foundation; American Institute of Indian Studies,"I thank Dominic Glover, Sudha Narayanan, Reetika Khera, Debasis Mondal, Dr A.

Methodology/methods The present work is based upon the general methodological approaches, such as: analysis, synthesis, deduction, and induction. When working on the article, we applied the instruments of the economic analysis as well as the methods of the financial statement analysis, namely - ratio analysis. Numerous works of both the georgian and foreign authors have been studied regarding the given topic. Scientific aim The scientific aim of the paper is to introduce novelties in the field of the financial statements analysis, in particular, to introduce the traditional liquidity and activity ratios in the adjusted and modified form, with taking into consideration the peculiarities of the development business. Findings As revealed after getting familiarized with the features of the development business and as a result of a practical analysis of the financial statements of the residential real estate development companies, the traditional financial ratios fail to reflect realistically a degree of the liquidity and business activity of the companies. Therefore, their upgrading is required. Conclusions For an objective assessment the liquidity and activity of the residential real estate development companies, upgrading some financial ratios were deemed to be reasonable. In particular, the traditional Acid-test (Quick) Ratio has been introduced with a modified form. The current ratio and the cash ratio were adjusted; Overbillings turnover ratio was added to the traditional ratios of the activity. The inventory turnover ratio and the total assets turnover ratio were adjusted. Based upon the analysis of the ratios introduced herein, the liquidity and activity of the development companies were assessed and the relevant conclusions made.","[Lomidze, Nino] Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 1 Chavchavadze Ave, Tbilisi 0179, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Lomidze, N (通讯作者)，Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 1 Chavchavadze Ave, Tbilisi 0179, Georgia.",ninola.lomidze@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,47,55,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200005,0

This study aims at finding the factors that affect consumer in-store behaviour. Methodology/methods Analysis and synthesis of scientific literature, and logical analysis were provided to substantiate the components of the theoretical model. Scientific aim is to elaborate the conceptual model for the determination of consumer in-store behaviour. Findings The scientific analysis revealed the significance of store atmosphere as a driver of consumer in-store behaviour. The researches provided by various authors substantiate the existence of three to five store atmospherics which are important determinants of consumer in-store behaviour, namely: external variables; interior variables; layout and design variables; point-of-purchase and decoration variables; and human variables. According to neobehaviouristic approach, all these variables determine consumer cognitive and affective reactions which result in conative behaviour. The conative reaction can be classified into approach or avoidance behaviour; moreover, the approach behaviour can take a long-term perspective, resulting in customer loyalty. Conclusions Specific elements of store atmosphere can be observed or missing regarding particular stores. Nevertheless, the elaborated conceptual model becomes the base for the general consumer in-store behaviour empirical researches, allowing not only broadening marketing theories of consumer behaviour, but applying the results of empirical researches in practice as well, which would enhance the possibility of improved customer loyalty.","[Pileliene, Lina; Grigaliunaite, Viktorija] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Mkt Dept, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Grigaliunaite, V (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Mkt Dept, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",v.grigaliunaite@evf.vdu.lt,"Pileliene, Lina/B-3293-2014; Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/GXG-1429-2022; Pileliene, Lina/AAP-2315-2020","Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314; Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/0000-0001-8340-2993; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314",Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-098/2014],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-098/2014) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,34,0,0,1,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,198,205,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200023,0

Since Ankara is the capital, all policies and decisions including financial laws and regulations, selection and appointment of high level officials of financial authorities have been made in this city under formal or informal meetings. However, perspectives of Ankara and Istanbul toward financial issues including dosages of financial regulations and selection criteria of high level officials are different from each other. In this respect, following questions have been raised: Does this situation have a potential factor to create instability on management and governance of financial authorities? Is this a potential weakness for the Istanbul Financial Center Project? Considering the relevant questions, this paper has been developed on the following hypothesis: Being a capital city is a significant / major factor for a financial center. If the hypothesis is proved to be true, then the Istanbul Financial Center Project has a low chance of success. This paper discusses a paradox which is not a phenomenon for all countries but emerges from mostly improper institutional structures and governance of financial authorities and poor rule of law implementations and policies.

Results indicate that more than 1.0 million hectares (Mha) of maize in the study countries is exposed to a seasonal drought frequency exceeding 20% while an additional 1.6 Mha experience a drought occurrence of 10-20%. Spatial modeling indicates that new DT varieties could give a yield advantage of 5-40% over the commercial check variety across drought environments while crop management and input costs are kept equal. Results indicate a huge potential for DT maize seed production and marketing in the study countries.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate and compare the selected aspects of access to finance of SMEs in V4 countries based on the last SAFE survey's results from April to September 2015. When measuring financial access, a variety of proxy variables may be used. Our chosen variables or aspects are: the perception of access to finance as the most pressing problem, the percentage of firms with bank loans, the outcome of negotiation for bank loan financing (only firms which applied for a bank loan), the reason why the bank loans are irrelevant for a firm, and the size of the last bank loan that a firm obtained in the past six months.","[Thiessen, Alzbeta] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Kosice, Dept Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Presov,"Thiessen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Kosice, Dept Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",alzbeta.thiessen@euke.sk,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4261-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,366,373,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8MD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392433400043,0

Meanwhile, rail companies in liberalized markets need to adapt to market conditions. The theoretical achievements in the field of management science and theory of enterprise can be utilized to achieve the abovementioned goals. One of the most interesting models based on practical research of organizational structures is the theory of structural configuration, developed by H. Mintzberg in 1979. This model was used to design the organizational structure of Koleje Slaskie Sp. z o.o. Mintzberg's model is based on five main parts of organization, five coordination mechanisms, nine design parameters, and four groups of conditions. It is a powerful diagnostic and planning tool. Mintzberg's model has proven to be useful in the evaluation and design changes to the organizational structure of Koleje Slaskie Sp. z o.o. The company was established as a so-called internal operator with the objective of providing passenger rail service in Silesia. It has been proven that H. Mintzberg's model can be successfully used in the creation of a flexible organizational structure adapted to the liberalization of transport markets. The proposed model was used in the construction of the organizational structure and organizational regulations that have been adopted by the company in 2014. The next step of the restructuring was a significant change in the corporate strategy of Koleje Slaskie Sp. z o.o. The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the possibility of a successful application of the theoretical output of Henry Mintzberg in the field of railway transport.","[Tomanek, Robert] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Tomanek, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",tomanek@ue.katowice.pl,"Tomanek, Robert/R-7697-2018","Tomanek, Robert/0000-0002-5090-939X",,,,,8,0,0,1,14,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-26848-4; 978-3-319-26846-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,231,239,,10.1007/978-3-319-26848-4_21,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics; Transportation,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Transportation,BG0LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386325500021,0

We provide evidence that this connection is stronger than previously thought. We use a modified version of the Bry-Boschan algorithm to identify long-run swings in the stock market. We call these swings long-run bull and bear episodes. We find that there is a high correlation between stock returns and fundamentals across bull and bear episodes.

In this study, we examine how financial crises affect collective labor rights. We posit that the economic effects of these crises likely undermine the protection of collective labor rights. To test these propositions, we examine the impact of financial crises on collective labor rights in 46 developing countries from 1985 through 2002. We find that crises are detrimental to labor rights practices while having no significant effect on labor rights laws, and that their effect persists for up to five years after the crisis subsides. Our analysis thus suggests that financial crises pose a challenge to supporters of labor rights, as they are pivotal events that call into question the balance that exists between the state, capital, and labor, and that labor loses power in both the short and medium terms.

We propose a corporate finance model to assess the effect of these exemptions on a firm's cost of borrowing and incentives to engage in derivative transactions. While derivatives are value-enhancing risk management tools, seniority for derivatives can lead to inefficiencies: it transfers credit risk to debtholders, even though this risk is borne more efficiently in the derivative market. Seniority for derivatives is efficient only if it provides sufficient cross-netting benefits to derivative counterparties that provide hedging services.","[Bolton, Patrick; Oehmke, Martin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Bolton, Patrick] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bolton, Patrick] CEPR, London, England",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Bolton, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,39,34,38,1,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Corruption constrains the fiscal capacity to tax and increases the reliance on inflation (seigniorage). Given the restrictions that corruption imposes, a monetary reform strengthening central bank independence induces strategic debt accumulation; the government has the incentive to use debt and indirectly 'force' the central bank to pursue expansionary monetary policy. This result is augmented by the size of bureaucratic corruption, posing difficulties on the achievement of both a balanced debt process and price stability. The adverse implication of corruption on debt accumulation, given central bank independence, is supported in a large cross-sectional event study for developed and developing countries. Complementing the analysis with a measure for the level of independence each central bank reform enacted, the impact of corruption is greater, the higher the degree of independence granted. The results are also confirmed when accounting for countries that did not forego meaningful reforms and our findings are robust to different sub-samples, control variables and unobserved heterogeneity.

Not surprisingly, the time series properties of the GARCH-X process with a nonstationary covariate are qualitatively different from those of the GARCH-X process with a stationary covariate.

When we introduce explicit costs of class conflict, the model yields cases of alternating seniorities and other cases in which firms issue only one class of debt. The implications of the model are consistent with the observed regularities in a large database of debt issues. We test several other implications of our model as well.","[Ravid, S.

We test our model using inward and outward FDI data on OECD countries. The empirical results confirm the theory and indicate that FDI activity declines with institutional distance.

Many of the investors in these two markets are asset management firms or pension funds, some of which may offer guaranteed returns to their clients. To these investors, modeling and managing the risk associated with their equity investments are highly important. In this paper, we use a multivariate threshold autoregressive (TAR) process to model the non-linear relationship between the two markets. This model may help fund managers better plan or execute their risk management decisions, as it captures the difference in investment return behavior when one market significantly out- or under-performs the other. We also contribute a risk-neutral version of the multivariate TAR model to the literature. This contribution permits one to price exotic options written on multiple stock indexes, and consequently helps fund managers calculate the cost of an option-based risk management strategy for funds involving the two Chinese markets.

In order to stay on the market and to make profit the companies must change or improve their way of thinking, such that they can be more adaptable to the rapid information changes. A solution to this problem is innovation, which is a complex phenomenon that needs to be understood and measured in every company. The aim of this paper is to present a measurement tool to analyse the extent of innovation. The authors have divided the complex phenomenon of innovation in seven types of innovation according to their influence in the company, for each type of innovation proposing a set of measuring indicators. To widen the extent of analysis, this paper used two research methods, namely: the expert method - using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) that focuses on the requirements for innovation performance and on a different set of indicators to calculate the importance of each type of indicator; and the survey method - using a questionnaire, a representative sample of firms to check the current extent of innovation and to offer suggestions for improving innovation management.","[Maier, Dorin; Anastasiu, Livia] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Sarbu, Roxana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Eidenmueller, Thorsten] European Educ Grp AG, Eschen, Liechtenstein",Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Maier, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",dorin.maier@gmail.com,"Maier, Dorin/C-1931-2015; Sarbu, Roxana/Q-9937-2017; Anastasiu, Livia/K-6454-2019; Sarbu, Roxana/K-1659-2016; Dorin, Maier/S-3377-2019","Maier, Dorin/0000-0002-3888-2251; Dorin, Maier/0000-0002-3888-2251; anastasiu, livia/0000-0001-8681-7510",,,,,12,7,7,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1156,1166,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300004,0

The benefits from the Fairtrade label, including transaction costs reduction are indicated. The assumption is that to achieve them, consumer acceptance of the idea and willingness to buy Fairtrade products are necessary. The empirical research was focused on answering the question whether a market niche for Fairtrade goods exists in Poland and how to develop it by the means of communication tools. The market niche, although very small, has been identified and described. It is apparent that, in order to develop it, a public policy, aimed at raising the awareness of Fair Trade idea, is necessary as well as marketing activities like social marketing Internet campaigns and better and more prominently products display.","[Smigielska, Grazyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Dabrowska, Anna; Radziukiewicz, Malgorzata] Inst Market Consumpt & Business Cycles Res, Warsaw, Poland","Cracow University of Economics; Institute for Market, Consumption and Business Cycles Research","Smigielska, G (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",smigielg@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1244,1258,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300010,0

SRI reduces water consumption by half, which makes it a promising farming system in the adaptation to climate change in moisture-constrained areas, and it does not require flooding of rice fields, resulting in reduced methane emissions. Endogenous switching regression results suggest that SRI indeed improves yield in rain-dependent areas, but its profitability hinges on the actual market price farmers face. SRI becomes profitable only when the rice variety sells at the same market price as that of traditional varieties, but results in loss when SRI rice sells at a lower price. We argue that the effort of promoting adoption of such types of climate-friendly agricultural practices requires complementary institutional reform and support in order to ensure their profitability to small-holder farmers.","[Alem, Yonas; Eggert, Hakan; Ruhinduka, Remidius] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Ruhinduka, Remidius] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Econ, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Gothenburg; University of Dar es Salaam,"Alem, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",yonas.alem@economics.gu.se; hakan.eggert@economics.gu.se; remidius.ruhinduka@economics.gu.se,,"Eggert, Hakan/0000-0001-7607-3394","Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through the Environmental Economics Unit of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg; Gothenburg Centre of Globalisation and Development (GCGD); Swedish Research Council Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS)","Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through the Environmental Economics Unit of the Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg; Gothenburg Centre of Globalisation and Development (GCGD); Swedish Research Council Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources (COMMONS)","We would like to thank the Editor (Thomas Sterner), an anonymous reviewer, Travis Lybbert, Haileselassie Medhin, Mans Soderbom, Marcella Veronishi and participants of the 8th Environment for Development Initiative annual meeting at Barahi Beach Hotel, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, October 23-26, 2014; participants of the Environment and Climate Research Centre (ECRC) seminar series at the Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI) for useful comments on earlier versions of the paper.

We find that firms that have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed loans are 1.67% more likely to miss payments on their guaranteed loans, but are not more likely to default on these loans. These findings suggest that guarantees affect firms' incentives to repay loans but not their long-term performance. We also find that firms selected into the guarantee programs are 1.17% more likely to default on their loans compared with similar firms that borrow without guarantees. Since we find evidence that long-term performance is not affected by guarantees, the higher default rates among firms selected into the guarantee programs must be the consequence of adverse selection.

The extent to which estimates of retirement predictors are biased by the clustering of older workers (50 years of age or older) into dual-earner households remains unclear. Using longitudinal data on 11 European countries from the first (2004/2005) and second (2006/2007) waves of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this study investigated the retirement timing of older workers aged 50+ living in dual-earner households in 11 European countries. We questioned how measures that are significantly related to retirement timing differ according to whether one takes into account the household context in the retirement analysis. The results showed that covariates that are dependent among partners (e.g., household size, educational level) changed the least between the Cox model and the shared frailty model. The effects of controlling for clustering between partners, although fairly modest, appeared to be important as they revealed a systematic pattern in the direction of bias in estimates that assume an independent sample.","[De Preter, Hanne; Van Looy, Dorien; Mortelmans, Dimitri] Univ Antwerp, Res Ctr Longitudinal & Life Course Studies CELLO, St Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"De Preter, H (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Res Ctr Longitudinal & Life Course Studies CELLO, St Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",hanne.depreter@uantwerpen.be,"Mortelmans, Dimitri/B-3860-2010","Mortelmans, Dimitri/0000-0003-3285-8223","European Commission through 5th framework programme [QLK6-CT-2001-00360]; European Commission through 6th framework programme [SHARE-I3, RII-CT-2006-062193, CIT5-CT2005-028857, CIT4-CT-2006-028812]; European Commission through 7th framework programme [211909, 227822]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, Y1-AG-4553-01, OGHA 04-064, IAG BSR06-11, R21 AG025169]",European Commission through 5th framework programme; European Commission through 6th framework programme(European Union (EU)); European Commission through 7th framework programme(European Union (EU)); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This paper uses data from SHARE release 2.5.0, as of May 24 2011.

This study analyzes the valuation implications of ERM Maturity. We use data from the industry leading Risk and Insurance Management Society Risk Maturity Model over the period from 2006 to 2011, which scores firms on a five-point maturity scale. Our results suggest that firms that have reached mature levels of ERM are exhibiting a higher firm value, as measured by Tobin's Q. We find a statistically significant positive relation to the magnitude of 25 percent. Upon decomposition of the maturity score, we find that the most important aspects of ERM from a valuation perspective relate to the level of top-down executive engagement and the resultant cascade of ERM culture throughout the firm. Firms that have successfully integrated the ERM process into both their strategic activities and everyday practices display superior ability in uncovering risk dependencies and correlations across the entire enterprise and as a consequence enhanced value when undertaking the ERM maturity journey ceteris paribus.","[Farrell, Mark] Queens Univ, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Gallagher, Ronan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",Queens University Belfast; University of Edinburgh,"Farrell, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",mark.farrell@qub.ac.uk; ronan.gallagher@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,65,100,120,6,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

In this paper, focusing on the aggressive monetary easing of Abenomics, the first arrow, we evaluate its role in guiding public perceptions on monetary policy stance through the management of expectations. In order to end chronic deflation, such as that which Japan has been suffering over the last two decades, policy regime change must be perceived by economic agents. Analysis using the QUICK survey system (QSS) monthly survey data shows that monetary policy reaction to inflation rates has been in a declining trend since the mid 2000s, implying intensified forward guidance well before Abenomics. However, Japan seems to have moved closer to a long-term liquidity trap, where even long-term bond yields are constrained by the zero lower bound. Consequently, no sizable difference in perceptions has been found before and after the introduction of Abenomics. Estimated changes in perceptions are not abrupt enough to satisfy Sargent's (1982) criteria for regime change termed by Eggertsson (2008). This poses a serious challenge to central banks: what is an effective policy option left under the long-term liquidity trap?

We find that the degree of pass-through of wholesale prices to retail gasoline prices is on average 0.77 for diesel and 0.67 for petrol and depend on local market characteristics. The duration for a shock to be fully transmitted into prices is about 10 days. There is no significant asymmetry in the transmission of wholesale price to retail prices. Finally, the duration since the last price change has a significant effect on thresholds triggering price changes but a large variance of idiosyncratic shocks on thresholds is also crucial to replicate the size distribution of price changes.","[Gautier, Erwan] Univ Nantes, LEMNA TEPP, F-44035 Nantes, France; [Gautier, Erwan] Res Associate Banque France, Paris, France; [Le Saout, Ronan] Ronan Saout is Economist INSEE CREST, Paris, France; [Le Saout, Ronan] Ecole Polytech, F-75230 Paris, France",Nantes Universite,"Gautier, E (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA TEPP, F-44035 Nantes, France.",erwan.gautier@univ-nantes.fr; ronan.le.saout@ensae.fr,,"Gautier, Emmanuele/0000-0001-5725-3576",Chaire Finance from the Fondation de projets de l'Universite de Nantes,Chaire Finance from the Fondation de projets de l'Universite de Nantes,"We would like to thank Guillaume Retout and Laurent Baudry for their research assistance.

However, it is often of scientific and practical importance to also explain why such impacts occur. In this paper, we introduce causal mediation analysis, a statistical framework for analyzing causal mechanisms that has become increasingly popular in social and medical sciences in recent years. The framework enables us to show exactly what assumptions are sufficient for identifying causal mediation effects for the mechanisms of interest, derive a general algorithm for estimating such mechanism-specific effects, and formulate a sensitivity analysis for the violation of those identification assumptions. We also discuss an extension of the framework to analyze causal mechanisms in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized evaluation studies. The methods are illustrated via applications to two intervention studies on pre-school classes and job-training workshops.

Drawing on network theory, we develop a framework that delineates how the pattern of linkages among reinsurers determines three reinsurance costs (loadings, contagion costs, and search and monitoring costs) and characterizes an insurer's optimal network structure. Consistent with empirical evidence based on longitudinal data from the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry, our model predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between the insurer's optimal percentage of reinsurance ceded and the number of its reinsurers. Moreover, we find that a linked network may be optimal ex ante even though linkages among reinsurers may spread financial contagion, supporting the model's prediction regarding social capital benefits associated with network cohesion. Our theoretical model and empirical results have implications for other networks such as loan sale market networks and over-the-counter dealer networks.","[Lin, Yijia; Peterson, Manferd O.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Yu, Jifeng] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Lin, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, POB 880488, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",yijialin@unl.edu,"Yu, Jifeng/N-4499-2018",,,,,,51,20,22,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

This paper reviews the policy changes and sets out where they leave the UK corporate tax system.","[Miller, Helen; Pope, Thomas] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Miller, H (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",helen_m@ifs.org.uk; thomas_p@ifs.org.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/H021221/1]; Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS (grant reference ES/H021221/1).

This results in part from agents rationally updating their expectations during good times and hence becoming more optimistic about future economic prospects. Investors then increase their leverage and shift their portfolios toward projects that would previously have been considered too risky. So, when a downturn does eventually occur, the financial crisis and the extent of default become more severe. Whereas a general appreciation of this syndrome dates back to Minsky (1992) and even beyond, to Irving Fisher (), we model it formally. In addition, endogenous default introduces a pecuniary externality since investors do not factor in the impact of their decision to take risk and default on the borrowing cost. We explore the relative advantages of alternative regulations in reducing financial fragility and suggest a novel criterion for improvement of aggregate welfare.","[Bhattacharya, Sudipto; Goodhart, Charles A.

In addition, the omission of major production inputs or the use of proxies to estimate unobservable inputs leads to biased estimation results. This study addresses the above issues by employing a novel econometric approach and provides empirical evidence that a fixed production input, and therefore a country's income, is positively correlated with the existence of British-style institutions and negatively correlated with cultural heterogeneity and Spanish-style institutions. Our methodology is twofold. First, using data for 62 countries from 1980 to 2004, we regressed a random-coefficients stochastic production frontier that allows estimating a fixed unobservable production input without using proxies. Second, the estimated fixed production input is shown to be related to colonial institutions and cultural heterogeneity by means of ordinary least squares and feasible generalized least squares regressions.","[Kuroda, Toshifumi] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kuroda, Toshifumi] Tokyo Keizai Univ, Fac Econ, Kokubunji, Tokyo 1858502, Japan; [Forero, Maria del Pilar Baquero; Ida, Takanori] Kyoto Univ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Michigan State University; Tokyo Keizai University; Kyoto University,"Kuroda, T (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Commun Arts & Sci Bldg,Room 538,404 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kuroda@tku.ac.jp,"Ida, Takanori/GQI-1188-2022; Kuroda, Toshifumi/O-2235-2019","Ida, Takanori/0000-0002-9229-9243; Kuroda, Toshifumi/0000-0003-2492-9255","Monbukagakusho scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Government of Japan","Monbukagakusho scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Government of Japan","This study was supported by the Monbukagakusho scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Government of Japan.",,33,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It scrutinizes the policy conflicts that can arise when a central bank that has adopted a formal inflation target to guide the conduct of monetary policy simultaneously manages the exchange rate and pursues financial stability objectives. To this end, it empirically investigates the importance of exchange rate and terms of trade movements as determinants of inflation rates across East Asian economies and discusses the role of central banks in guarding financial stability and the ways this may conflict with an IT regime. The article argues that IT never really has been a suitable monetary framework for East Asian countries and that it should hence be supplanted by transparent monetary frameworks that explicitly recognize the multiple goals that are being pursued by East Asian central banks.","[Volz, Ulrich] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Volz, Ulrich] German Dev Inst, DIE, Berlin, Germany",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Volz, U (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",uv1@soas.ac.uk,,"Volz, Ulrich/0000-0001-9917-8068",,,,,47,4,4,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The government determines tariffs by balancing the political support from producers vs. consumers, while placing a higher political weight on producers' welfare relative to average citizens. We then expand the model in several directions to guide our subsequent estimations at the three-digit industry level for Colombia between 1983 and 1998. We account for import substitution motives for protection but describe how the government's move away from these policies leads to unilateral trade liberalization. We innovatively allow the political weights to vary based on key industry variables beyond a common denominator. The sectors with higher employment, labor cost, and preferential trade agreement (PTA) import shares receive a larger political weight compared to otherwise similar sectors. The novelty of our approach is estimating the effect of sectoral characteristics on protection filtered through the political weights. We obtain more realistic estimates for these weights and provide some evidence for a slowing down effect of PTAs on trade liberalization.","[Karacaovali, Baybars] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Karacaovali, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders Hall 542, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",baybars@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,9,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

(1) To what extent do shocks motivate rural household members to move to urban areas?, (2) Are migrants in the new urban settings better off in terms of working conditions and quality of life?, and (3) What is the effect of migration on rural household's welfare and vulnerability to poverty? The analysis uses panel data of 2200 households from rural Vietnam covering the period 2007-2010, and a tracking survey of 299 migrants from 2010. The empirical evidence from a probit model shows that migration, especially migration for employment, is a livelihood support strategy for households exposed to agricultural and economic shocks. Migration for education is more likely observed among households with higher human capital and being financially better off. Nevertheless, the probability of migration decreases with the employment opportunity in the village. Migrants perceive themselves to be better off at the place of destination, but income losses from shocks of their rural households may reduce their employment quality. The results from difference-in-difference specifications with propensity score matching techniques suggest that migration has positive income growth effects, and that these effects are more pronounced in provinces with fewer job opportunities. These effects help not only migrant households moving out of poverty, but it also improves the poverty situation in rural areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the incentive effect of loan rates becomes stronger with greater collateral, with the two credit terms having larger incentive effects on lower-quality firms.

We construct an infinite-horizon consumption-savings model that allows, but does not require, temptation and self-control in preferences. In the presence of temptation, a wealth-consumption ratio, in addition to consumption growth, becomes a determinant of the asset-pricing kernel, and the importance of this additional pricing factor depends on the strength of temptation. To identify the presence of temptation, we exploit an implication of the theory that a more tempted individual should be more likely to hold commitment assets such as individual retirement account (IRA) or 401(k) accounts. Our estimation provides empirical support for temptation preferences. Based on our estimates, we explore some quantitative implications of this class of preferences for capital accumulation in a neoclassical growth model and the welfare cost of the business cycle.","[Huang, Kevin X.

Four operational models of etailing are discussed in the context of their intertwining relations with different forms of parcel express services. This co-evolution generated compound outcomes because of the late start of PEI and the fast growth of online shopping in China. These four models coexist, with two standing out as major types that suggest future directions. Two major geographical imprints of this process are explained and conceptualized: (1) the zonal delivery strategy by supply-chain-based e-merchants, which is conceptualized into a choice model of order-fulfilling locations to strengthen timely delivery; and (2) the Baoyou strategy advocated by e-market-based retailers and their logistic support for a slower, low-cost market of larger geographical coverage compared to the first strategy. Both strategies demonstrate that co-evolution is not only a path-dependent process but is also associated with place-dependent institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Temporarily explosive dynamics emerge when there is substantial disagreement between perceived and actual feedback parameters, making the transition highly volatile.

Finally, we examine the impact of the LIBOR on the Islamic DFM-UAE return. Our first finding is that the two markets DFMLUAE, and (GCC and Saudi) are converging, in the long run, to the same level of risk and volatility with the Global Sukuk index. The wavelet analysis based on betas indicates a strong non-homogeneous correlation across scales and for different periods of time. Closer markets tend to suggest a contagion effect showing higher correlation and higher interdependence with a certain time delay. Evidence shows a flight to quality to the less risky Sukuk market mostly during the last financial crisis. The lead-lag analysis tends to indicate that the GCC leads DFM-UAE which leads Sukuk. Finally, this study sheds further light on the important leading impact of the overnight LIBOR on the returns of Islamic stock indices especially during the big changes or under shocks indicating policy implications for portfolio diversification for the international investors. The results are plausible and intuitive and have strong policy implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier By.

This paper dissects a new firm-level dataset that covers sales made through eBay by sellers based in 21 emerging economies to provide a new lens through which to look at the effect of trade costs on the extensive margin of trade. Comparing eBay sellers with offline firm-level data from the World Bank's Exporter Dynamics Database allows us to test whether the observed trade patterns on eBay fit with the trade-liberalization predictions of heterogeneous-firm models. We find that eBay firms export to more destinations, suggesting low destination-specific fixed costs on eBay. We then show that the distribution of export destinations across eBay sellers is well approximated by a balls-and-bins model of frictionless trade, suggesting eBay indeed lowers fixed export costs. Finally, we compare the gravity of eBay with that of offline trade and find geographic distance, languages, and trade agreements to matter less for online trade.","[Vezina, Pierre-Louis] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Lendle, Andreas] Forum Isl Countries, Port Vila, Vanuatu",University of Birmingham,"Vézina, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",p.vezina@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,10,14,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Other not quantitative (subjective) factors affect human capital to a degree not less than quantitative are like motivation, commitment, vision. These factors have to be accounted for if an adequate fit for proxy of human capital in growth models in future prospective research on endogenous growth models and theories.","[Skare, Marinko; Lacmanovic, Sabina] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr,"Lacmanović, Sabina/AAV-3747-2021; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Lacmanovic, Sabina/0000-0003-2827-1307",Croatian Science Foundation [9481],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

We have presented three perspectives - new structural economics, transition economics and the Neo-Schumpetarian approach - all of them emphasising different aspects of structural transformation. Their relative explanatory power depends on the context - for example, the extent of distortions in the economy, the quality of the institutions and where a country finds itself relative to the world technology frontier - and the questions we are interested in understanding. We suggest that, to date, the Neo-Schumpetarian approach offers the most promising and persuasive story line to think about this difficult challenge.","LSE, Inst Global Affairs, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Berglof, E (通讯作者)，LSE, Inst Global Affairs, London, England.",e.berglof@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,7,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Complementarily, according to their institutional characteristics, we also show the moderating effect of investor protection and bank regulatory regime on this previous relationship, analysing their substitution or complementary roles.

This paper examines how the discursive construction of ethnic identity has facilitated the particular form of agrarian intensification and labour restructuring under way in the uplands of Thailand. Agricultural intensification, followed by the promotion of safe' and then organic' production, has relied upon the construction of Hmong farmers as environmentally destructive and in need of development, while Shan labour arriving from Burma are simultaneously constructed as illegal migrants' (as opposed to refugees), a social nuisance and hard workers, helping to make them into an available, willing and preferred labour force. We argue that the construction of ethnic identity in these instances enables the agricultural changes under way and, thus, the particularities of agricultural change cannot be understood without careful attention to ethnic politics.","[Latt, Sai] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Roth, Robin] York Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",Simon Fraser University; York University - Canada,"Latt, S (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",sai_latt@sfu.ca; rothr@yorku.ca,,"Latt, Sai/0000-0002-5724-9849",,,,,74,7,10,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Although Regulation FD prevents firms from selectively disclosing material information to market professionals in the equity market, firms can still do so to banks and rating agencies in the debt market. The standard's differential disclosure requirements lead to differential changes in the information environments between the two markets, providing a reasonably useful setting to examine the effect of information asymmetry on firms' capital structure. I find that firms with a high level of information asymmetry increase debt more than firms with a low level of information asymmetry post-Regulation FD. The results suggest that managers adjust the target leverage ratios to rely more on debt when facing higher costs of equity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We then use cluster and correlation analysis to categorize FBOs on the basis of their health and correlate these typologies with various performance indicators. Our findings reveal that organizational health is generally low as there are only a few organizations that manage to provide member-farmers with both risk-sharing and cost-saving opportunities.

We explore whether ASD mandates are associated with out-of-pocket costs, financial burden, and cost or insurance-related problems with access to treatment among privately insured children with special health care needs (CSHCNs). We use difference-in-difference and difference-in-difference-in-difference approaches, comparing pre-post mandate changes in outcomes among CSHCN who have ASD versus CSHCN other than ASD. Data come from the 2005 to 2006 and the 2009 to 2010 waves of the National Survey of CSHCN. Based on the model used, our findings show no statistically significant association between state ASD mandates and caregivers' reports about financial burden, access to care, and unmet need for services. However, we do find some evidence that ASD mandates may have beneficial effects in states in which greater percentages of privately insured individuals are subject to the mandates. We caution that we do not study the characteristics of ASD mandates in detail, and most ASD mandates have gone into effect very recently during our study period.","[Chatterji, Pinka; Markowitz, Sara] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chatterji, Pinka] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Decker, Sandra L.] Natl Ctr Hlth Stat, New York, NY USA; [Decker, Sandra L.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Hyattsville, MD 20782 USA; [Markowitz, Sara] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; CDC National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Emory University,"Chatterji, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pchatterji@albany.edu; sdecker@cdc.gov; smarko2@emory.edu,,"Markowitz, Sara/0000-0002-3892-2145",University at Albany Center for Social and Demographic Analysis (CSDA) Junior Researcher Program; University at Albany College of Arts Sciences FRAP,University at Albany Center for Social and Demographic Analysis (CSDA) Junior Researcher Program; University at Albany College of Arts Sciences FRAP,"We would like to thank Jennifer Madans, Matthew Bramlett, Scott Grosse, and Jennifer Parker of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for helpful comments on a previous draft.

We study the regulation of these externalities when insurance companies have market power. Some of the results we derive have close resemblance to the earlier literature on externality regulation with market power in aviation and private roads, but there are important differences, too. Using analytical models, we compare the first-best public welfare-maximizing outcome with a private profit-maximizing monopoly, and oligopoly. We find that insurance companies will internalize some of the externalities, depending on their degree of market power. We derive optimal insurance premiums, and regular parametric taxes as well as manipulable ones that make the companies set socially optimal premiums.

The cost benefits from the non-separability of outputs available to banks that imply the role of OBS activities on bank scale economies are also examined. We further test whether the role of OBS operations on bank scale economies changes across heterogeneous banks. Results suggest that banks can realize more scale economies by increasing OBS operations and that scale economies can be reaped particularly for non-state-owned banks. Therefore, diversification and deregulation should be included in the policy agenda for the subsequent marketization reform of China's banking sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To quantify the causal link going from political representation to transfers, we identify two sets of exogenous changes in political representation and use an instrumental variable approach. Using Belgian data for the 1995-2010 period, we find that transfers to inhabitants of a particular electoral district increase significantly with every extra federal minister originating from that electoral district.

One problem comes from adverse selection, whereby the lead has a private informational advantage over participants. A second problem comes from moral hazard, whereby the lead puts less effort in monitoring when it retains a smaller loan share. Applying an instrumental variables strategy using lending limits, borrower performance is improved by increasing the lead's share. The focus is on separating moral hazard from adverse selection and the results are consistently indicative of monitoring. First, the lead's share is more important for revocable credit lines than for fully funded term facilities. Second, a lead with greater liquidity risk reduces its share resulting in worse borrower performance, but its liquidity risk does not affect the quality of credits it chooses to syndicate in the first place. Third, covenants are paired with a higher lead share, and the sensitivity between share and borrower ex post performance is greater on loans with more covenants.","Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Mora, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA.",nada.mora@kc.frb.org,,,,,,,46,11,12,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

In the treatment group, an environmental organization mobilized individuals to attend a participatory local government planning meeting. Mobilization had a large and significant effect on citizen participation. Despite this effect, mobilization did not lead to increased adoption of either the organization's preferred projects or the projects requested by citizens. Instead, the intervention changes the type of discrepancies observed in final allocations, indicating that elite control over planning institutions can adapt to increased mobilization and participation.

Working with unique data on land values in 35 major Chinese markets and a panel of firms outside the real estate industry, we estimate investment equations that yield no evidence of a collateral channel effect. Further analysis indicates that China's debt is not characterized by the frictions that give rise to collateral channel effects elsewhere. Essentially, financially constrained borrowers appear able credibly to commit to repay debt in China. While there is no impact on investment via the collateral channel, our results should not be interpreted as implying there will be no negative fallout from a potential real estate bust on the Chinese economy. There likely would be, but through different channels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

At the firm level, we find insurers with less diversified business, sufficient cash flow, high return on equity, lower leverage, fewer failed Insurance Regulatory Information System ratio tests, and membership in a larger group are less likely to become insolvent. Our findings support the argument that insolvency likelihood increases for insurers domiciled in states with stricter solvency supervision and/or states with less favorable insurance market conditions, and during soft markets; insolvency risk is negatively related to the slope of the yield curve.

Air services provide important economic and social benefits but very little research has been done on assessing the value of regional aviation. This research provides the first empirical evidence that there is short and long run causality between regional aviation and economic growth. The authors analysed 88 regional airports in Australia over a period of 1985-86 to 2010-11 to determine the catalytic impacts of regional air transport on regional economic growth. The analysis was conducted using annual data related to total airport passenger movements - for the level of airport activity, and real aggregate taxable income - to represent economic growth. A significant bi-directional relationship was established: airports have an impact on regional economic growth and the economy directly impacts regional air transport. The economic significance of regional air transport confirms the importance of the airport as infrastructure for regional councils and the need for them to maintain and develop local airports. Funding should be targeted at airports directly to support regional development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on samples from Canadian provinces, G-7, and OECD countries spanning the years 1961-2008, we show that the empirical procedure used by Crucini tends to overstate the average degree of risk sharing and understate the dispersion of risk sharing, when compared to our unequal income pooling model. The empirical results from our unequal pooling model show that (i) the degree and dispersion of risk sharing across Canadian provinces, G-7 countries, and OECD countries remain stable over time; (ii) the degree of risk sharing across Canadian provinces is higher than that across the G-7 and OECD countries; and (iii) the degree of risk sharing seems positively related to equity and trade diversification.","[Ho, Chun-Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Ho, Wai-Yip Alex] Hong Kong Monetary Author HKMA, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Ho, CY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",chunyu.ho@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Ho, Chun-Yu/0000-0002-4498-9610",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301103],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank Eric van Wincoop for his comments and suggestions.

Such credit is valuable as it allows arbitrageurs to exploit the limited arbitrage opportunities that emerge endogenously in reaction to the demand imbalance generated by the portfolio constraint The model is solved in closed-form, and we show that, in contrast to existing models with frictions and logarithmic agents, arbitrage activity has an impact on the price level and generates both excess volatility and the leverage effect We show that these results are due to the fact that arbitrageurs amplify fundamental shocks by levering up in good times and deleveraging in bad times.

Since tips are an expense that consumers are free to avoid, tipping is an anomalous behavior that many economists regard as irrational or mysterious. In this paper, I present a motivational framework that offers plausible explanations for: (1) why people tip, (2) how tipping norms came into existence and evolve overtime, (3) why tipping varies across individuals and situations, (4) why tipping is more common for some occupations than others, and (5) why tipping varies across nations. Many hypotheses generated from this framework are supported by existing research, but many other implications of the framework have yet to be adequately tested. Thus, the framework provides a promising and much needed theoretical guide for future research on a fascinating consumer behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Distinguished in the psychology literature from the concept of self-esteem, our study examines the role of SCC in selected consumer behaviors. A survey of 301 consumers established that SCC contributes to consumers' general satisfaction with life and its absence leads to such consumer behaviors as susceptibility to interpersonal influence, materialism, post purchase doubt, shopping as escape, and use of products as identity bolsters. This last set of results shows that low SCC consumers, who by definition are inflicted with self-confusion and concomitant anxiety, use the marketplace as a coping resource. These results suggest the concept's utility in extending our understanding of certain important consumer behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Analysts are 80% more likely to cover local firms than non-local ones, and nearby non-underwriter analysts initiate coverage one to three weeks earlier than distant ones. Proximity matters most for smaller, less visible firms, for firms with less complex operations and for lower status analysts.

Equally important is getting feedback that indicates how others perceive your leadership behavior. Purpose of Study: To investigate the degree of self-awareness regarding military cadets' leadership behaviour and how this was correlated with others perceptions of the same leadership behavior. Method: This study was an explorative and descriptive study. 26 cadets at the Norwegian Military Academy filled out the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire (DLQ) measuring their degree of developmental leadership, as well as their degree of transactional leadership and non-leadership. The cadets also had to send the same DLQ to 6-10 commanders, colleagues and subordinates in order to get feedback from them on their leadership behavior. Findings and Results: It was found that the cadets scored themselves lower on both developmental leadership and on the positive parts of transactional leadership and higher on both the negative parts of transactional leadership and on non-leadership as compared to their respondents. Conclusions and Recommendations: In the scores the cadets gave themselves they scored quite high on developmental leadership and on the positive sides of transactional leadership, and quite low on the negative sides of transactional leadership and on non-leadership; one may conclude that they have a high degree of self-awareness. This also indicates that they are developmental leaders although they may not see this as clearly as their respondents do. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Our research confirmed that presented information about gross written premium in various jurisdictions is based on different methodologies and proved that for the comparability of data and for their information capability there is crucial to develop a precise definition of gross written premium; only in such case there would be possible to ensure the credibility of statistical data.

Utilizing five alternative measures of financial development, it employs a panel threshold regression approach to reexamine the effect of financial development and income on energy consumption. The analysis relies on a sample of 53 countries for the period 1999-2008, showing a single-threshold effect on energy consumption when private credit, domestic credit, value of traded stocks, and stock market turnover are used as financial development indicators. It implies that the sample can be split into two regimes: high income, and non-high income. Energy consumption increases with income in emerging market and developing economies, while in advanced economies energy consumption increases with income beyond a point at which the economy achieves a threshold level of income. In addition, in the non-high income regime, energy consumption increases with financial development when both private and domestic credit are used as financial development indicators. However, when the value of traded stocks and stock market turnover are used as financial development indicators, it slightly declines with financial development in advanced economies, especially in high-income countries, but increases in the higher income countries of emerging market and developing economies.

The empirical application provides evidence of significant volatility and tail risk spillovers from the financial sector to many real sectors in the U.S. economy from 2001 to 2011. These spillovers increase in crisis periods. The CCX in a given sector is positively related to its amount of debt financing and negatively related to its valuation and investment. Therefore, real economy sectors which require relatively high debt financing and whose value and investment activity are relatively lower are prime candidates for stock price volatility and depreciation in the wake of a financial sector crisis. Evidence also suggests that the higher the industry's degree of competition, the stronger the tail risk spillover from the financial sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Capital markets are specialized in trading financial assets in the medium and long term. These securities are mainly represented by stocks and bonds. Choosing an optimal portfolio of securities is based on certain criteria that determine their optimal choice, criteria which will be presented in this paper. Portfolio risk is a very delicate issue because the behavior of investors in the capital markets is mainly determined by the risk- return relationship. This paper proposes an analysis of the development of the domestic capital market in order to capture the main issues faced, developments and perspectives. For the purpose to capture these aspects we will consider the time period from 2004 to the present, analyzing the evolution of market capitalization, number of transactions in shares and bonds, market volume and value of shares and bonds. Within the final part of the paper we will present the stock activity for Romania, a stock that activates in a fairly low level, and this conclusion is valid regardless of the criterion of analysis used (capitalization value, transaction value, number of investors, issuers structure, etc). However, the low level of activity is not due to exchange market maximum development or capping, its potential for future development remains still rather high.

In OECD economies over the period 1970-2012, changes in country specific aggregate volatility are, after controlling for a wide array of factors, significantly positively associated with net foreign asset position. A standard open economy model with time varying macroeconomic uncertainty can quantitatively account for this relationship. The key mechanism is precautionary motive: more uncertainty induces residents to save more, and higher savings are in part channeled into foreign assets.

Restrictive policies and internal devaluation process adopted to restructure economy, underestimated the social impact. The State, choosing a different welfare model with emphasis on commodification and selective services, gradually withdraws from the implementation of social policy, seeking, through administrative reforms, to transfer responsibilities to local government, without, however, the necessary funding. At the same time, European Union's social policy, despite its rhetoric and some initially ambitious efforts, particularly with the Treaty of Lisbon, shows inability to create a community acquis, which would contribute decisively to the Europeanization of the southern countries. By applying soft law measures and always based on the principle of subsidiarity, European strategy is confined, almost entirely, to an application of employment support measures, primarily seeking to improve competitiveness and meet the financial objectives of Monetary Union. The study of basic economic and social EU-28 indices for the period 2008-2012, confirms that diversification of welfare models has a crucial effect in mitigating income inequality and reducing the risk of poverty, enhancing therefore, the dispute over theoretical approaches that support the adequacy of policies related to economic growth. This paper attempts, given the aforementioned conditions, to present the current situation in local government organizations, both from the structures and the financing means perspective, based on a primary research, conducted for this purpose using a structured questionnaire filled by competent executives of all municipalities in the Prefecture (now regional unit) of Thessaloniki. Research findings, though highlighting the efforts to substitute central government's role in an institutional context, constantly under reform, indicate that municipalities are facing significant efficiency problems. Social policy is exercised by different organizational units without integrated strategic planning, new structures which were created primarily to address poverty are inadequate to meet the actual needs and funding is limited in an effort to replace the reduced own resources through European programs, without seeking future alternative sources. The acute lack of human resources and coordination, adversely affects evaluation of local government's social policy. The findings also intensify the concern about structures sustainability and the capacity of municipalities overall support, but at the same time detect needed interventions in order to implement an efficient decentralized policy, which will become an essential factor of social cohesion and prevent escalation of social exclusion.

It is a topic of interest in Romania as well, given that the development gaps among counties continuously increased since the transition to market economy, despite many strategies explicitly targeting them. In this context, the paper introduces a new synthetic index of territorial inequalities that includes three variables: GDP/capita, labour productivity and life expectancy in order to capture various aspects of economic and social spatial disparities. This methodological approach offers a better and more complex image on territorial development gaps, compared to the analyses using individual indicators. We further assessed the impact of territorial disparities (as measured by this synthetic index) on the economic development in Romania over 1995-2012, by means of an economic growth model. We found a cointegrating relationship between GDP and the synthetic index of territorial inequalities, suggesting that the regional development in Romania is systematically unbalanced and the disparities have had the tendency to widen with economic growth.

Concretely we propose results from an empirical investigation of determinants of the demand for real money balances in the Czech Republic. From the methodological point of view we use models of multivariate time series analysis in the co-integrated context, the VAR and VEC models, and the generalized impulse -response functions for an estimation of trajectories of adjustment processes. Based on the results, we can say that the real money balances in the broader definition (in the sense of M2 monetary aggregate) are demanded by economic agents in relation to a long-run evolution of their needs, and during this, they are not systematically influenced by economic shocks. This also implies stability and simple predictability of the demand. Demand in the narrow sense, including currency and demand deposits, exhibits a greater volatility due to different shocks. Therefore this narrow demand is continuously adjusted to arising disequilibriums, going from both inside and outside of the economy. Nevertheless in the long run there exists an equilibrium relationship among the demand for real money balances in the narrow sense, the interest rate, the real effective exchange rate and the rate of unemployment. Majority of observed relationships is consistent with a priori assumptions, which are formulated through a theoretical model. Finally, it is possible to show, that direct long-run equilibrium relationship between the demand for real money balances in the narrow sense and the volume of transactions (or real production) does not exist. On the contrary, we have also found that a transactions demand is influenced by the business cycle. However the elasticity of transactions demand with respect to the business cycle is relatively small and hence we conclude that a considerable part of this demand is constant over time and a speculative demand is more important for the description of the demand for real money balances development. The difference between a behavior of the demand for real money balances in the narrow and in the broader definition, we are explaining by a portfolio re-optimization effect.","Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, CZ-16521 Prague 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Guertler, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, CZ-16521 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",gurtler@petczu.cz,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

A good financial condition at micro level contributes to a good financial condition at macro level, but the favorable evolution of the macroeconomic variables contributes to the proper functioning of a business, too. Therefore, maintaining firms' financial equilibrium is absolutely necessary. Moreover, under globalization, maintaining economy's equilibrium has become a global issue whereas a national problem in the economy can affect the world economy. The impact of the financial crisis, unleashed in 2007 in the United States, on the world economy raises many controversies and questions. This is why it will be a topic debated for a long time from now on. Having as starting point the banking crisis, the effects of the global financial crisis have been propagated in Romania starting with October 2008. The delay took place due to the lower level of financial markets development compared with developed countries. So, it is important to capture the ability of maintaining firms' financial equilibrium given the fact that one of the most important branches of the economy - the banking system - shows strong shocks. In other words, this paper analyses to what extent have companies felt the shocks and risks from the banking sector (which is closely related to them)? Furthermore, the consequences of the financial crisis on the enterprises' financial results in the Romanian economy will be identified. Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to capture the macroeconomic variables' impact on the fines' ability of maintaining balance in tenns of debt service and yield results. This includes identifying any existing imbalances and finding solutions to restore balance and obtain performance. The main objective of an enterprise management is to achieve high company performance. So, the micro and macro financial indicators have a key role in measuring the companies' financial position.

The purpose of this paper is to compare frequency of walking and frequency of activity outside the home, reported environmental barriers and valuation of the outdoor environment between two areas, in one of which there was an intervention in the outdoor environment 5-8 years prior to this study. The paper is based on a questionnaire sent out in 2011, to all residents 65 years and older in two different areas, the Study Area, an area with an intervention, and the Reference Area. The results show that reports on functional limitations, use of mobility devices and walking difficulties were similar in both areas. Despite that, respondents in the Study Area had a significantly higher frequency of walking and they also participated to a higher degree in activities than respondents in the Reference Area, even though they reported more environmental barriers. The valuation of the outdoor environment was, however, similar in both areas. The results indicate that older people benefit from interventions in the outdoor environment. However, the results also emphasize the importance of good maintenance of the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the threats of such crimes and the vulnerabilities of some professions and businesses to such crimes, in 2003 the FATF included them under the AML/CFT regime. Since then, those professions and businesses became the gate-keepers and known as the designated non-financial business and professions (DNFBPs). As a consequence of such inclusion, several mandatory obligations were imposed on these gate-keepers, involving customer due diligence, record-keeping, reporting obligation, the compliance function and training programme for employees. It is within this context that the objective of this paper is to examine the extent to which the FATF is moulding the AML/CFT regime in Malaysia, which in turn, is shaping the compliance of legal profession, who now have to police their clients for evidence of money laundering and terrorist financing. The authors contend that the gate-keeping role of the legal practitioners inevitably raises controversial issues involving the violation of ethical conduct, professional legal privilege and also the independence of the legal profession.

A high degree of rigidity given by the legislation, political decisions that change rules of the state administration's effective performance and, on the other hand, a small degree of responsibility for efficient management of resources set by a direct linkage to the state budget do not as a whole create a sufficient stimulus for the change. One of the possible ways is to introduce modern management methods based on causality of activities and costs of SOU, which include notably the ABC/ABM methodology. The largest group of overhead costs is associated with operation of buildings and management of buildings becomes an increasingly complex system. This is confirmed by the performed regression analysis which indicates that overhead expenses on buildings' management are dependent primarily on the value of buildings and do not depend on the number of workers. At the same time, however, it means that operating costs of running buildings increase with the value of these building as a consequence of their equipment with technologies.","[Hammer, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hammer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, Prague, Czech Republic.",j.hammer@email.cz,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,69,73,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500012,0

Countries with one-sided, pegging exchange rate policies tend to buy more bonds and enjoy larger trade surpluses. This effect is closely related to the level of capital market development: in these two countries, at higher stages of development, the effects of idiosyncratic monetary policy on imbalance are amplified.","[Han, Qiheng] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Secur & Futures, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Junqing] Nankai Univ, Dept Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianbo] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Nankai University; University of Kansas,"Han, QH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Secur & Futures, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",hqheng@mail.shufe.edu.cn; leejqdoc@163.com; jbzhang@ku.edu,"li, ye/GWN-2672-2022",,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,339,365,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024021,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900010,0

These form obstructions to clients' demand for higher value. Within the field of real estate and infrastructure, most clients have to organise projects with external project organisations. Problems escalate when external suppliers are involved. This strategy-to-performance gap is attributed to poorly formulated plans, misapplied resources, breakdown in communication and limited accountability for results. In this paper, this challenge is assessed in the construction project perspective, focusing on what may be a missing link between strategic decisions and project outcomes. The challenge is double, i.e., it concerns clearly expressing the intention of projects and establishing organisations adaptive to project strategies. A major challenge for a design team is to balance functional expertise with a client's need for integrated teams focusing on solutions that enable users to create value. A functional organisation providing resources represented by design and engineering expertise is directed by a respective department's goals. On the other side, a project is directed by a client's goals, but affected by functional goals. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

After several decades of difficulties in the attempts to create and impose European directives on accounting (4th and 7th), the European Commission had subcontracted this task to a specialized private organization: IASB (International Accounting Standard Board). This historic decision was welcomed by financial markets, but also generates controversy and opposition from some players in European societies. The standards issued by IASB International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) - allow the comparability of financial statements from different countries and are accepted by the world's major stock exchanges, including the US ones. But IFRS are criticized for excessive use of the fair value models, for their subsequent theories and, sometimes, for their predominantly Anglo-Saxon origin.

In order for them to develop, a displacement in expectations must occur which will impact the rational perception of the asset's value. Human capital, although not as tangible as other forms of wealth, represents a distinct asset class which increases one's earning potential through education. As the price of an asset is justified by the expectations of future cash flows, the current value of education can be calculated via discounting the value of the future, education-enhanced, earning potential. The aim of this paper is to analyze the newly emerging patterns in the changing educational landscape of the region known as the Western Balkans and identify the possible formation, if not existence, of a bubble. The authors propose an alternative methodology of detecting these market anomalies and utilize empirical evidence to corroborate the finding that the market price of the investment in human capital in Western Balkan countries has started diverging from its fundamental value. Although the focus of this paper is on uncovering a tendency in a highly specific asset class within a narrow geographical area, the preliminary conclusions and related discussions can be extended to detecting such bubbles in other countries and regions that could possibly warn against the eruption of the next big financial crisis.

The loopholes in the standards or the deviation from real operational activities promote this situation to prolong. According to the agency theory, separation of ownership and control gives rise to manager's incentives to select and apply accounting estimates and techniques that can increase their own wealth. This issue has become more important in recent years as more firms are listed on stock exchanges as public firms. In this review, we emphasize studies that advance the managerial understanding of the earnings management and agency theory.

This paper explores the potential of CEM in an office fit-out project in Finland and presents a process model to support future projects. The CEM process was collaboratively designed by a construction management consultant and a Finnish governmental property owner. The work involved a series of workshops, interviews and a pilot project. The results show that CEM requires multi-functional collaboration, new management practices and a cultural shift in construction management. In future projects, the created process model may significantly ease the efforts required to plan end-user experience management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However the amount of academic research on performance of local funds is small in comparison to their recent economic importance. Rare existing studies suffer one major drawback - they are structured mainly upon country evidence, thus limiting the possibility to derive some generalized conclusions about overall mutual funds performance on the regional or country group level. This is caused apparently by lack of all necessary and unified data required for conducting of such a research. Notwithstanding such drawback there is a positive evidence of abnormal returns generated by local funds. In this context the paper aims to test the performance of domestic equity mutual funds from advanced and frontier emerging economies of the Central and Easter Europe for market timing ability. Following established practice mutual funds market timing ability will be tested from three perspectives - market return, market volatility and market liquidity - using data on domestic active and inactive equity mutual funds daily and monthly returns collected from Bloomberg and classified into three groups according to Wiesenberger objective code. Application of such approach gives a threefold result: (1) it allows to reveal and to define the type of timing performed by local funds (return-, volatility- or liquidity-induced); (2) to perform their international comparison with mutual funds from other regions or groups of advanced and emerging economies; and (3) by decomposing the sample into advanced and frontier emerging economies, it allows to track differences across development stages and document important country and regional characteristics.","[Lemeshko, Oleksandra; Rejnus, Oldrich] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 5a, Brno 60100, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Lemeshko, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 5a, Brno 60100, Czech Republic.",lemeshko@mail.muni.cz; rejnus@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,359,366,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200048,0

These buildings constitute about one fourth of the entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal value. Today they do not always meet current building standards and many are in need of refurbishment. The Million Homes programme incorporated a large variety of technical building solutions, and knowledge about former building practices is needed if refurbishment is to be successful. Industrialised builders in Sweden have recognized the use of a platform as one means of sharing knowledge. A platform is essentially the collection of assets that are shared by a set of products. In a platform for housing refurbishment the assets have knowledge and process content (as opposed to product content) and will probably also contain many relationships. The interview study carried out as part of the research shows that the main purpose of a platform concept is to standardize components and processes. To increase the possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of buildings will be used for knowledge sharing the focus should be on the individuals who will actually be sharing their knowledge and especially on social motivations. It is important that managers and leaders demonstrate knowledge sharing behaviors as this will lead to the establishment of a culture where knowledge sharing is the norm; in the context of this study this is especially important for the creation of an efficient platform concept for refurbishment.

In this paper we have shown that fiscal integration is an important piece of a bigger plan that was started more than half of century ago, and that is still undergoing, giving the fact that the European integration process still faces many obstacles that need to be overcome in order to achieve fully integration. The role of fiscal integration is more important in the current context, as we have shown that recent economic and fiscal difficulties may be overcome by using mechanisms like fiscal transfers in order to ensure sound public finances and to earn the trust of the general public and private investors. Through this paper we offered a new and bold point of view on what is fiscal integration, what is its purpose and steps, what was done till present day and what is needed to be done in the near future.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Macsim, FA (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",florin.macsim1@yahoo.ro,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,474,486,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600047,0

To allow IFRS in tax fillings of those entities preparing statutory financial statements in compliance With IFRS may thus represent a comparative advantage for Czech economy: We hypothesize that usage of IFRS for tax purposes is win-win-win situation, as it may (1) significantly decrease the compliance tax costs of IFRS entities; (2) increase the capability of tax authorities to supervise the fulfilment of tax duties by IFRS entities; (3) create a favourable tax regime attracting foreign companies to tax their sources of income in the Czech Republic/mitigating the motives of Czech companies to transfer profits abroad. We support our findings by the analysis of micro- and esp. aggregate tax data showing that (a) taxation rules have a greater influence on tax base than accounting profits, (b) changes in reported accounting profits are a function of business cycle rather than a function of changing tax rates and/or a function of accounting method choices.","[Mejzlik, Ladislav; Arltova, Marketa; Prochazka, David; Vitek, Leos] Univ Econ, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Mejzlík, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",ladislav.mejzlik@vse.cz; marketa.arltova@vse.cz; david.prochazka@vse.cz; leos.vitek@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018; Procházka, David/H-4703-2011; Vitek, Leos/H-5125-2018","Procházka, David/0000-0003-4340-8770; Vitek, Leos/0000-0002-2540-7291; Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927",,,,,43,7,7,0,44,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

However, there are more aspects which can be discussed as a reason for the drop in tax revenues and this is trying to capture them by analyzing the development of the tax revenues and the tax law changes.

The main part of output of education services is considered to be non-market in the Czech Republic and it is estimated a sum of related costs. Deflation has been traditionally done using input method i.e. recalculation of each component separately. The main drawback of this method is an assumption of direct correlation between changes in inputs and changes in output. Productivity can not be estimated therefore output methods based on direct volume measurement are now preferred for individual services. Methodology of direct volume measurement of education services has been developed in the paper. This approach is based on number of students in detailed breakdown weighted by costs in order to include changes in the structure of fields of study. Estimates are available since 2004 as data sources are available.

The most common reason for not using part-time jobs is the nature of the business. Companies, that employ people on part-time, perceive the different position of part-time employees and full-time employees. Although most of respondents claims that these two groups of employees have identical position in the field of career growth, job security and education and development, a relatively large proportion of respondents believes that people working part-time are in a worse position than employees with a full-time job.","[Nemcova, Ivana; Markova, Helena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Bussiness Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Nemcová, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Bussiness Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",nemcova@opf.slu.cz; markova.helena@volny.cz,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,9,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-145-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,485,497,,,,,,13,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BE3SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371199400065,0

Using a previously unexplored data set spanning 25 banking systems, it finds that aggregate intragroup funding is unrelated to fluctuations in either global or local macroeconomic fluctuations, while flightier interbank funding responds procyclically to both worldwide and domestic economic trends. This feature of the data means intragroup funding remains comparatively stable when global conditions deteriorate-even during the global financial crisis. During normal times the paper finds that intragroup funding responds countercyclically to global interest rate changes, with parent banks using affiliates to offset tighter global funding conditions. More generally, it finds that intragroup funding has a closer relationship with domestic banking system profitability and solvency, being used to support banks in weaker banking systems during the global financial crisis.","[Reinhardt, Dennis] Int Directorate Bank England, London, England; [Riddiough, Steven J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Reinhardt, D (通讯作者)，Int Directorate Bank England, London, England.",,,"Riddiough, Steven/0000-0002-5225-1755",,,,,49,9,9,3,12,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

One of the episodes was a substantial surge in Czech currency holdings after the outbreak of the financial crisis in late 2008. Results based on a model of currency demand show that the increase in currency in circulation in the last quarter of 2008 cannot be explained by common variables, which include retail sales, interest rate, innovation in payment systems, and tourism. Separate models of currency demand for small and large denominations revealed significant differences in terms of sensitivity to different variables. While small-value banknotes are mainly driven by domestic transactions, payment system innovations and tourism, the demand for large-value banknotes depends more on a short-term interest rate.

The assumption that is being used as a starting point is that a monetary policy shock is the one that leads to an increase of the interest rates and in the same time to a decrease in inflation and output growth.

Analysis uses panel data regression for 10 sectors of Poland's international trade based on SITC classification and six major trading partners (Czech Republic, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy and Slovakia).

Among other information, auditors are required to specify their total turnover divided into audit fees and non-audit fees. Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is selected as an appropriate analytical tool. Globally recognized Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is complemented by indicators of market share (concentration ratios) and the Lorenz curve which graphically displays the unequal distribution of the turnover on the market of audit services. These data show that in the period under research the companies forming Big4 obtained 88% of total fees, 84% of audit fees and 92% of non-audit fees.
