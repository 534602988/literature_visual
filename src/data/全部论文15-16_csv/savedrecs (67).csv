Since the time horizon of a pension fund management problem is relatively long, two background risks are taken into account: the inflation risk and the salary risk. Meanwhile, there are a risk-free asset, a stock and an inflation-indexed bond available in the financial market. The extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB for short) equation of the equilibrium value function and the verification theorem corresponding to our problem are presented, The closed-form time-consistent investment strategy and the equilibrium efficient frontier are obtained by stochastic control technique. The effects of the inflation and stochastic income on the equilibrium strategy and the equilibrium efficient frontier are illustrated by mathematical and numerical analysis. Finally, we compare in detail the time-consistent results in our paper with the pre-commitment one and find the distinct properties of these two results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In applications, both efficiency scores for individual units as well as average efficiency scores are typically reported. While several bootstrap methods have been developed for making inference about the efficiencies of individual units, until now no methods have existed for making inference about mean efficiency levels. This paper shows that standard central limit theorems do not apply in the case of means of DEA or FDH efficiency scores due to the bias of the individual scores, which is of larger order than either the variance or covariances among individual scores. The main difficulty comes from the fact that such statistics depend on efficiency estimators evaluated at random points. Here, new central limit theorems are developed for means of DEA and FDH scores, and their efficacy for inference about mean efficiency levels is examined via Monte Carlo experiments.","[Kneip, Alois] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Simar, Leopold] Univ Catholique Louvain la Neuve, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC USA",University of Bonn; Clemson University,"Kneip, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Stat Abt, Inst Gessell & Wirtschaftswissennsch, Bonn, Germany.",akneip@uni-bonn.de; leopold.simar@uclouvain.be; pww@clemson.edu,,"Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X","INRA-GREMAQ, Toulouse, France [P7/06]; U.S. National Science Foundation [SMA-1243436]; Cyber Infrastructure Technology Integration group at Clemson University; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1243436] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","INRA-GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cyber Infrastructure Technology Integration group at Clemson University; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Research support from the Interuniversity Attraction Pole, Phase VII (No. P7/06) of the Belgian Science Policy, from the INRA-GREMAQ, Toulouse, France, from U.S. National Science Foundation (grant no.

We analyze how this market information can be integrated into the theoretical framework of convex monetary measures of risk. In particular, we make use of indifference pricing by dynamic convex risk measures, which are given as solutions of backward stochastic differential equations, to establish a link between these two approaches to risk measurement. We derive a characterization of the implied volatility in terms of the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation and provide a small time-to-maturity expansion and numerical solutions. This procedure allows to choose convex risk measures in a conveniently parameterized class, distorted entropic dynamic risk measures, which we introduce here, such that the asymptotic volatility skew under indifference pricing can be matched with the market skew.

Second, by introducing the marginal indemnification functions, we characterize the optimal reinsurance contracts. We show that, for an optimal policy, the associated marginal indemnification function only takes the values zero and one.

Our analysis employs an empirical study that covers the post financial crisis period. We show that the spot commodity considerably improves the value of the portfolio. However, an investment in the whole term structure of futures contracts is optimally achieved through high opposite positions in the spot commodity and distant futures contracts.

The methods are developed by directly connecting the elements of the structural system to be estimated with features of the density of the observable variables, such as ratios of derivatives or averages of products of derivatives of this density. The estimators are therefore easily computed functionals of a nonparametric estimator of the density of the observable variables. We consider in detail a model where to each structural equation there corresponds an exclusive regressor and a model with one equation of interest and one instrument that is included in a second equation. For both models, we provide new characterizations of observational equivalence on a set, in terms of the density of the observable variables and derivatives of the structural functions. Based on those characterizations, we develop two estimation methods. In the first method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated by a simple matrix inversion and matrix multiplication, analogous to a standard least squares estimator, but with the elements of the matrices being averages of products of derivatives of nonparametric density estimators. In the second method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated in two steps. In a first step, values of the instrument are found at which the density of the observable variables satisfies some properties. In the second step, the estimators are calculated directly from the values of derivatives of the density of the observable variables evaluated at the found values of the instrument.

The pricing of an interest rate option in such a model involves evaluating a multidimensional integral of the payoff of the claim on a domain where the payoff is positive. In our method, we approximate the exercise boundary of the state space by a hyperplane tangent to the maximum probability point on the boundary and simplify the multidimensional integration into an analytical form. The maximum probability point can be determined using the gradient descent method.

Our aim was to investigate the cost effectiveness of IDegLira vs. basal insulin intensification therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus uncontrolled on basal insulin (glycosylated haemoglobin; HbA(1c) >7.5 %; 58 mmol/mol) in a UK setting. Research Design and Methods Baseline cohort and clinical parameters were sourced from a pooled analysis comparing IDegLira with basal insulin plus liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, and from the DUAL(TM) V trial comparing IDegLira with up-titrated insulin glargine (IGlar; Lantus (R)). The CORE Diabetes Model simulated lifetime costs and outcomes with IDegLira vs. these comparators from a UK healthcare payers' perspective. All costs were expressed in 2015 GBP. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of key parameters in the model. Results Treatment with IDegLira resulted in mean increases in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.12, 0.41 and 0.24 vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide, basal-bolus therapy and up-titrated IGlar, respectively. IDegLira was associated with lower costs of 971 pound and 1698 pound vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, respectively, and increased costs of 1441 pound vs. up-titrated IGlar. IDegLira was dominant, i.e., both more effective and less costly vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, and highly cost effective vs. up-titrated IGlar with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 6090 pound/QALY gained. Conclusions Once-daily IDegLira may be considered a cost-effective treatment option for prescribers, to improve glycaemic control for type 2 diabetes patients uncontrolled on basal insulin without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia or weight gain, and without adding to their injection burden.","[Davies, Melanie J.] Univ Leicester, Leicester Gen Hosp, Diabet Res Ctr, Leicester, Leics, England; [Glah, Divina; Chubb, Barrie] Novo Nordisk Ltd, 3 City Pl,Beeh Ring Rd, Gatwick RH6 0PA, W Sussex, England; [Konidaris, Gerasimos] IMS Hlth, London, England; [McEwan, Phil] Swansea Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust; Leicester General Hospital; University of Leicester; Novo Nordisk; Swansea University,"Glah, D (通讯作者)，Novo Nordisk Ltd, 3 City Pl,Beeh Ring Rd, Gatwick RH6 0PA, W Sussex, England.",dng@novonordisk.com,,"Davies, Melanie/0000-0002-9987-9371",Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk.,,39,22,22,3,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2016,34.0,9,,,,,953,966,,10.1007/s40273-016-0433-9,0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OM,27438706.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383550900010,0

Some widely employed models are the so-called Lee-Carter model and its extensions, which involve a two-step estimation procedure. Empirical findings from using the Lee-Carter model and its extensions prefer an ARIMA(p, 1, q) model for modeling the dynamics of the logarithms of mortality rates, which is called mortality index and is a key element in forecasting mortality rates and managing longevity risks. In this paper we prove that the proposed two-step estimation procedure in Lee and Carter (1992) cannot detect the true dynamics of the mortality index in general, which means that future mortality projections based on the two step inference procedure for Lee-Carter model and its extensions are questionable.

However, the cost effectiveness of PI monotherapy has yet to be demonstrated. In this study we examine the cost effectiveness of PI monotherapy with prompt return to combination therapy in the event of viral load rebound compared with ongoing triple therapy (OT) in patients with suppressed viral load on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the UK. The analysis used data from the PIVOT trial in which HIV-positive adults with suppressed viral load for a parts per thousand yen24 weeks on combination ART were randomised to maintain OT or to a strategy of PI monotherapy with prompt return to combination therapy if viral load rebounded. A cost-effectiveness analysis including long-term modelling was conducted. Main outcomes included UK National Health Service (NHS) costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with comparative results presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. PI monotherapy was cost saving as a result of large savings in ART drug costs while being no less effective in terms of QALYs in the within-trial analysis and marginally less effective with lifetime modelling. In the base-case analysis over 3 years, the incremental total cost per patient was -A 6424.11 pound (95 % confidence interval -7418.84 to -5429.38) and incremental QALYs were 0.0051 (95 % CI -0.0479 to 0.0582), resulting in PI monotherapy 'dominating' OT. Multiple scenario analyses found that PI monotherapy was cost saving with no marked differences in QALYs. Modelling of lifetime costs and QALYs showed that PI monotherapy was associated with significant cost savings and was marginally less effective; PI monotherapy was cost effective at accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds in all but one scenario analysis. Under most assumptions, PI monotherapy appears to be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared with OT for HIV-infected patients who have achieved sustained virological suppression.","[Oddershede, Lars] Aalborg Univ, Fac Social Sci, Danish Ctr Healthcare Improvements, Aalborg, Denmark; [Oddershede, Lars] Aalborg Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Oddershede, Lars] HEOR Consult ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Walker, Simon; Sculpher, Mark] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Stohr, Wolfgang; Dunn, David T.; Arenas-Pinto, Alejandro; Paton, Nicholas I.] UCL, Inst Clin Trials & Methodol, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England; [Paton, Nicholas I.] Natl Univ Singapore, Yong Loo Lin Sch Med, Singapore, Singapore",Aalborg University; Aalborg University; University of York - UK; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; University of London; University College London; National University of Singapore,"Walker, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",smw501@york.ac.uk,"Kraus, David/D-6921-2014","Arenas-Pinto, Alejandro/0000-0002-3368-5005; Stohr, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6533-2888; Dunn, David/0000-0003-1836-4446; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Walker, Simon Mark/0000-0002-5750-3691",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme [06/403/90]; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12023/23] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [06/403/501] Funding Source: researchfish; Public Health Agency [SPI/3915/08] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Public Health Agency,"PIVOT was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 06/403/90).

This article reviews and presents a framework for constrained estimation and inference to test for shape conditions in parametric models. We show that regional shape-restricting estimators have important advantages in terms of model fit and flexibility (as opposed to standard local or global shape-restricting estimators).

We used a cross-sectional design to evaluate manufacturers' submissions from the beginning of the evaluation process in October 2013 to the end of May 2015 (n = 28). The sources of uncertainty attached to these CEAs were categorized and assessed. Relevant data were extracted independently by two assessors. Adherence to the HAS reference case was generally considered to be acceptable. Methodological uncertainty and parameter uncertainty were the sources of uncertainty that were most frequently explored by manufacturers. The quality of reporting of deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis varied substantially across submissions, with a frequent lack of justification of the plausible range of parameter point estimates in 12 submissions (43 %). Structural uncertainty was explored much less frequently. Concerns related to omission of either important clinical events or relevant health states or extrapolation of the effects of the technology beyond the time horizon of the clinical trials were identified in 16 submissions (57 %). This study presented a characterization of the treatment of uncertainty for the first 28 manufacturers' submissions to the HAS. This work identified important concerns regarding the exploration of sources of uncertainty. The findings may help manufacturers to improve the quality of their submissions and may provide useful insights for extending guidelines on uncertainty analysis in CEAs submitted to the HAS.","[Ghabri, Salah; Hamers, Francoise F.] HAS, Dept Econ & Publ Hlth Evaluat, 5 Ave Stade France, F-93218 La Plaine St Denis, France; [Josselin, Jean Michel] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Econ, Pl Hoche 7, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Josselin, Jean Michel] CREM CNRS, Pl Hoche 7, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Ghabri, S (通讯作者)，HAS, Dept Econ & Publ Hlth Evaluat, 5 Ave Stade France, F-93218 La Plaine St Denis, France.",s.ghabri@has-sante.fr,,,,,,,40,14,14,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2016,34.0,6,,,,,617,624,,10.1007/s40273-016-0381-4,0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DM1KS,26829942.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376104800008,0

Using machine learning techniques, especially statistical classifiers, for day ahead forecasting of the movement of daily close prices of a broad range of several hundreds of liquid stocks is generally not very successful. We suspect that one of the reasons for failure is the relatively high volatility of prices in the last minutes before the market closes. There have been some attempts to use less volatile daily high prices instead, but the studies concentrated only on a specific non-statistical machine learning approach on a small number of specific securities. We show that incorporating statistical classifiers for day ahead daily high price movement predictions in to some simple portfolio management techniques significantly increases their performance. Tests performed on S&P 500 stocks show that such a strategy is robust, i.e. the difference in reliability for different stocks does not vary significantly, and that such a strategy greatly outperforms the S&P 500 index and several other benchmarks while increasing the risk only by a small amount.","[Novak, Marija Gorenc] XLAB Doo, Pot Brdom 100, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Novak, Marija Gorenc; Veluscek, Dejan] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Math & Phys, Jadranska 19, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Veluscek, Dejan] Univ Ljubljana, Inst Math Phys & Mech, Jadranska 19, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Veluscek, Dejan] J Stefan Inst, Jamova Cesta 39, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana; Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Jozef Stefan Institute,"Novak, MG (通讯作者)，XLAB Doo, Pot Brdom 100, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.;Novak, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Math & Phys, Jadranska 19, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",manja.gorenc@xlab.si,,,"European Union, European Social Fund, Operational Programme for Human Resources, Development [P-MR-10/134]; Slovenian Research Agency [P1-0222, L1-4292]","European Union, European Social Fund, Operational Programme for Human Resources, Development; Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia)","This study was funded in part by the European Union, European Social Fund, Operational Programme for Human Resources, Development for the Period 2007-2013 [P-MR-10/134] and Slovenian Research Agency [programme number P1-0222] and [programme number L1-4292].",,37,27,33,2,104,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

SOME METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS,ASTIN BULLETIN-THE JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL ACTUARIAL ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Actuarial models; dependence; capital margin; correlation; real data; reserving; risk margin,PERIOD-COHORT MODEL; CHAIN-LADDER; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD,"This paper is concerned with dependency between business segments in the non-life insurance industry. When considering the business of an insurance company at the aggregate level, dependence structures can have a major impact in several areas of Enterprise Risk Management, such as in claims reserving and capital modelling. The accurate estimation of the diversification benefits related to the dependence structures between lines of business (LoBs) is crucial for (i) capital efficiency, as one should avoid holding unnecessarily high levels of capital, and (ii) solvency of the insurance company, as an underestimation, on the other hand, may lead to insufficient capitalisation and safety. There seems to be a great deal of preconception as to how dependent insurance claims should be. Often, presence of dependence is taken as a given and rarely discussed or challenged, perhaps because of the lack of extensive datasets to be publicly analysed. In this paper, we take a different approach, and consider how much correlation some real datasets actually display (the Meyers-Shi dataset from the USA, and the AUSI dataset from Australia). We develop a simple theoretical framework that enables us to explain how and why correlations can be illusory (and what we mean by that). We show with some real examples that, sometimes, most (if not all) of the correlation can be explained by an appropriate methodology. Two major conclusions stem from our analysis. 1. In any attempt to measure cross-LoB correlations, careful modelling of the data needs to be the order of the day. The exercise will not be well served by rough modelling, such as the use of simple chain ladders, and may indeed result in the prescription of excessive risk margins and/or capital margins. 2. Such empirical evidence as examined in the paper reveals cross-LoB correlations that vary only in the range zero to very modest. There is little evidence in favour of the high correlation assumed in some jurisdictions. The evidence suggests that these assumptions derived from either poor modelling or a misconception of the cross-LoB dependencies relevant to the purpose to which they are applied.","[Avanzi, Benjamin; Taylor, Greg; Wong, Bernard] UNSW Sydney, UNSW Australia Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Avanzi, Benjamin] Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",University of New South Wales Sydney; Universite de Montreal,"Taylor, G (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, UNSW Australia Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",b.avanzi@unsw.edu.au; greg.taylor@unsw.edu.au; bernard.wong@unsw.edu.au,"Avanzi, Benjamin/C-3888-2008","Avanzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-5424-4292",Australian Research Council [LP130100723]; Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd; Insurance Australia Group Ltd; Suncorp Metway Ltd; Australian Research Council [LP130100723] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd; Insurance Australia Group Ltd; Suncorp Metway Ltd; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported under Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme (project number LP130100723, with funding partners Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd, Insurance Australia Group Ltd and Suncorp Metway Ltd).

J,"Fersini, P; Melisi, G",,,,"Fersini, Paola; Melisi, Giuseppe",,,Stochastic model to evaluate the fair value of motor third-party liability under the direct reimbursement scheme and quantification of the capital requirement in a Solvency II perspective,INSURANCE MATHEMATICS & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Chain Ladder; Claims reserve; Best estimate; Direct compensation; Multistate model; Copula; Dependence,,"As commonly known, to evaluate the claims reserve (otherwise known as the provision for outstanding claims), the loss adjuster uses as a first component the claims reserve given by the sum of the estimated provision for each outstanding claim (known as case reserve). Traditional statistical-actuarial methods are used to control and/or asseverate the evaluation and recent developments have tended to ensure that these enable an independent assessment of the claims reserve. In some European countries, a large subset of motor liability claims is managed within a direct reimbursement (DR) scheme. In Italy, the introduction of the direct compensation CARD system for third-party liability insurance has resulted in greater attention in the use of these traditional methods due to the heterogeneity of the data available for evaluations. This paper presents the results of a study undertaken to define a calculation method that, using the different assumptions that describe the evolution of settlement mechanisms, is able to quantify the claims reserve. The proposed methodology reduces the loss adjuster's discretion in applying statistical methods since all assumptions must be made explicit and can hence be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, a stress test can be performed on all the parameters that influence the settlement and thus the claims reserve. Finally, in a backtesting perspective, the proposed methodology enables an ex-post analysis of actual cash flow deviations compared to expected values, identifying the variables that lead to these differences. In particular, a calculation method is presented that using the different assumptions describing the evolution of the settlement of different claim handling procedures (Non-Card, Card, Handler Forfait and Debtor Forfait) is able to quantify the claims reserve. Via simulations, future payments, the expected value of the claims reserve and some indicators of variability are also estimated. The numerical application allows comparing the results obtained with those deriving from the application of traditional statistical methods. The problem of aggregating the four claim handling procedures is dealt with by using copulas with the goal of building a single distribution of the aggregate claims reserve. Furthermore, in a Solvency II perspective, the capital requirement is determined against the reserve risk based on the internal model proposed and is compared with the standard formula proposed by EIOPA.

Such models typically require (nested) evaluation of expected values of nonlinear functionals of multi-dimensional stochastic processes. Except in the simplest cases, no closed-form expressions are available, necessitating numerical approximation. To complement various analytic approximations, we advocate the use of modern statistical tools from machine learning to generate a flexible, non-parametric surrogate for the true mappings. This method allows performance guarantees regarding approximation accuracy and removes the need for nested simulation. We illustrate our approach with case studies involving (i) a Lee-Carter model with mortality shocks; (ii) index-based static hedging with longevity basis risk; (iii) a Cairns-Blake-Dowd stochastic survival probability model; (iv) variable annuities under stochastic interest rate and mortality.

Use of discrete-time steps can introduce errors when calculating cumulative outcomes such as costs and quality-adjusted life-years. There are a number of myths or misconceptions concerning how to correct these errors and the need to do so. This tutorial shows that, by neglecting to apply within-cycle (sometimes referred to as half-cycle or continuity) correction methods to the results of discrete-time models, the analyst may arrive at the wrong recommendation regarding the use of a technology. We show that the standard half-cycle correction method results in the same cumulative outcome as the trapezoidal rule and life-table method. However, the trapezoidal rule has the added advantage of applying the correction at each cycle, not just the initial and final cycle.

A decision analytic Markov model was developed that stratified individuals according to their risk of falling and accounted for the risk of injury following a fall. The effectiveness of the interventions was derived from two Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials for falls/fall-related injury prevention in RACFs. Interventions were considered effective if they reduced the risk of falling or reduced the risk of injury following a fall. The interventions that were modelled included vitamin D supplementation, annual medication review, multifactorial intervention (a combination of risk assessment, medication review, vision assessment and exercise) and hip protectors. The cost effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost relative to the incremental benefit, in which the benefit was estimated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Uncertainty was explored using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Vitamin D supplementation and medication review both dominated 'no intervention', as these interventions were both more effective and cost saving (because of healthcare costs avoided). Hip protectors are dominated (less effective and more costly) by vitamin D and medication review. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for medication review relative to vitamin D supplementation is AU$2442 per QALY gained, and the ICER for multifactorial intervention relative to medication review is AU$1,112,500 per QALY gained. The model is most sensitive to the fear of falling and the cost of the interventions. The model suggests that vitamin D supplementation and medication review are cost-effective interventions that reduce falls, provide health benefits and reduce health care costs in older adults living in RACFs.","[Church, Jody L.; Haas, Marion R.; Goodall, Stephen] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Church, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",jody.church@chere.uts.edu.au; stephen.goodall@chere.uts.edu.au,"Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017","Goodall, Stephen/0000-0001-6611-6565",NSW Health; Cancer Institute NSW,NSW Health; Cancer Institute NSW,"This study was funded as part of the Costing for Health Economic Evaluation Program (CHEEP), funded by NSW Health and the Cancer Institute NSW.

Treatment options include noncalcium-based phosphate binders such as sevelamer carbonate (SC) and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21). The aim of this study was to determine the health economic impact of PA21-based strategies compared with SC-based strategies, from the perspective of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS). A Markov model was constructed based on data from a randomised clinical trial comparing PA21 and SC. Model input parameters were derived from published literature, national statistics and unpublished sources. Costs (price year 2012) and effects were discounted at 3.5 %. Analysis with a lifelong time horizon yielded the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost or savings per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or forgone. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore uncertainties around assumptions and model input parameters. In the base-case analysis, phosphorus reductions for PA21 and SC were 1.93 and 1.95 mg/dL. Average undiscounted survival was estimated to be 7.61 years per patient in both strategies. PA21 patients accrued less QALYs (2.826) than SC patients (2.835), partially due to differential occurrence of side effects. Total costs were a,currency sign13,119 and a,currency sign14,728 for PA21 and SC, respectively (difference per patient of a,currency sign1609). By using PA21 versus SC, one would save a,currency sign174,999 (or a,currency sign123,463 when including dialysis and transplantation costs) for one QALY forgone. A scenario modelling the nonsignificant reduction in mortality (relative risk 0.714) observed in the trial yielded an ICER for PA21 of a,currency sign22,621 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the base-case, PA21 was dominant in 11 %, and at least cost-effective in 53 %, of iterations, using a threshold of a,currency sign20,000 per QALY gained. The use of PA21 versus SC in hyperphosphataemic patients being intolerant of calcium-based phosphate binders may be cost saving and yields only very limited disadvantages in terms of quality-adjusted survival. PA21 appears to be cost-effective from the perspective of the Scottish NHS.","[Gutzwiller, Florian S.; Pfeil, Alena M.; Ademi, Zanfina; Blank, Patricia R.; Szucs, Thomas D.; Schwenkglenks, Matthias] Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med ECPM, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Braunhofer, Peter G.] Vifor Pharma AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland",University of Basel; Vifor Pharma,"Gutzwiller, FS (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med ECPM, Klingelbergstr 61, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",fgutzwiller@gmx.ch,"Gutzwiller, Florian S/B-1022-2011","Blank, Patricia/0000-0002-0180-3468; Szucs, Thomas/0000-0003-0195-3316; Schwenkglenks, Matthias/0000-0001-7217-1173; Gutzwiller, Florian S./0000-0001-7754-5744","Vifor Pharma Ltd, Switzerland","Vifor Pharma Ltd, Switzerland","This study was supported by a research grant from Vifor Pharma Ltd, Switzerland.",,36,7,8,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2015,33.0,12,,,,,1311,1324,,10.1007/s40273-015-0320-9,0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CX5BW,26334991.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365717000008,0

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors can increase progression-free survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EGFR mutation analysis and first-line therapy with erlotinib for mutation-positive patients compared with non-individualized standard chemotherapy from the perspective of German statutory health insurance. A state transition model was developed for a time horizon of 10 years (reference year 2014). Data sources were published data from the European Tarceva versus Chemotherapy (EURTAC) randomized trial for drug efficacy and safety and German cost data. We additionally performed deterministic, probabilistic and structural sensitivity analyses. The individualized strategy incurred 0.013 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and additional costs of a,not sign200, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a,not sign15,577/QALY. Results were most sensitive to uncertainty in survival curves and changes in utility values. Cross-validating health utility estimates with recent German data increased the ICER to about a,not sign58,000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the individualized strategy is cost-effective, with a probability exceeding 50 % for a range of possible willingness-to-pay thresholds. The uncertainty of the predicted survival curves is substantial, particularly for overall survival, which was not a primary endpoint in the EURTAC study. Also, there is limited data on quality of life in metastatic lung cancer patients. Individualized therapy based on EGFR mutation status has the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to non-individualized care for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma. Further clinical research is needed to confirm these results.","[Schremser, Katharina; Rogowski, Wolf H.; Stollenwerk, Bjoern] Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany; [Rogowski, Wolf H.] Univ Munich, Ctr Clin, Inst & Outpatient Clin Occupat Social & Environm, Munich, Germany; [Adler-Reichel, Sigrid] Univ Munich, Div Hematol & Oncol, Med Clin & Policlin 4, Munich, Germany; [Tufman, Amanda L.

The interaction impacts among complex policy provisions and the randomness of the account value of the policy, the prevailing interest rate, as well as the mortality rate may significantly influence the evaluations of GMWBs/GMLBs, especially when the guaranteed payments are made over a long, or even a lifelong, horizon. To deal with aforementioned risk factors and policy provisions, this paper proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) tree that can analyze how different policy provisions influence the evaluation of GMWB/GLWBs under investment interest rate, and mortality risks simultaneously. The orthogonalization method is used to convert correlated dynamics of the account value of the policy and the short-term interest rate into two independent processes that can be easily simulated by our 3D tree. Besides, the structure of our 3D tree is sophisticatedly designed to avoid the unstable (oscillating) pricing results phenomenon that has characterized many numerical pricing methods. Rigorous numerical experiments are given to analyze the interaction effects among policy provisions and the aforementioned risk factors on the evaluation of GMWBs/GLWBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The health economics of adhering to these guidelines in clinical practice remains to be elucidated. This paper offers a health economic evaluation of two stroke-prophylactic treatment strategies: complete national adherence to the ESC guidelines on stroke prophylaxis in AF versus stroke-prophylactic treatment prior to 2012 in Denmark. A cost-utility analysis was performed to compare two treatment strategies. The first strategy reflected national guideline adherence with the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (i.e. dabigatran etexilate), warfarin, and no treatment. The second strategy reflected observed stroke prophylaxis prior to 2012 with the utilization of warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, and no treatment. A Danish health sector perspective was adopted. A Markov model was designed and populated with information on input parameters from the literature and local cost data reflecting 2014 values. A modeled patient cohort was constructed with a risk profile intended to reflect that of the Danish patient population with AF. The applied outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to a,not sign3557 per QALY for the guideline-adherent treatment strategy (GTS) compared with the pre-2012 treatment strategy.

Both assumptions are however unrealistic. This paper proposes a new methodology with a focus on volatility estimation that is able to account for nonstationarity and heavy tails simultaneously. In particular, a local exponential smoothing (LES) approach is developed, in which weak estimates with different memory parameters are aggregated in a locally adaptive way. The procedure is fully automatic and the parameters are tuned by a new propagation approach. The extensive and practically oriented numerical results confirm the desired properties of the constructed estimate: it performs stable in a nearly time homogeneous situation and is sensitive to structural shifts. Our main theoretical oracle result claims that the aggregated estimate performs as good as the best estimate in the considered family. The results are stated under realistic and unrestrictive assumptions on the model.","[Chen, Ying] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Spokoiny, Vladimir] Karl Weierstrass Inst Math, Berlin, Germany; [Spokoiny, Vladimir] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Dolgoprudnyi, Moscow Oblast, Russia",National University of Singapore; Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis & Stochastics; Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",stacheny@nus.edu.sg,"Spokoiny, Vladimir/AAF-4942-2021; Chen, Ying/C-5548-2013","Spokoiny, Vladimir/0000-0002-2040-3427;",NUS FRC [R-155-000-117-112]; Laboratory for Structural Methods of Data Analysis in Predictive Modeling; MIPT; RF government [ag.11.G34.31.0073]; German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Collaborative Research Center,NUS FRC(National University of Singapore); Laboratory for Structural Methods of Data Analysis in Predictive Modeling; MIPT; RF government; German Research Foundation (DFG) through the Collaborative Research Center(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was supported by the NUS FRC grant R-155-000-117-112.

The high-frequency trader chooses to post either market orders or limit orders, which are represented, respectively, by impulse controls and regular controls. We discuss the consequences of the two main features of this microstructure: first, the limit orders are only partially executed, and therefore she has no control on the executed quantity. Second, the high-frequency trader faces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of large variations in her inventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of optimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic control and dynamic programming methods, and we provide the associated numerical resolution procedure and prove its convergence. We propose dimension reduction techniques in several cases of practical interest. We also detail a high-frequency trading strategy in the case where a (predictive) directional information on the price is available. Each of the resulting strategies is illustrated by numerical tests.","[Guilbaud, Fabien] Univ Paris 07, F-75251 Paris, France; [Pham, Huyen] Univ Paris 07, CREST ENSAE, JVN Inst, F-75251 Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite Paris Cite,"Pham, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 07, Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoire, 2 Pl Jussieu, F-75251 Paris, France.",pham@math.univ-paris-diderot.fr,,,,,,,17,19,22,0,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We employ Li, Ouyang, and Racine's (2009) categorical and continuous data kernel method, and extend this so that a mix of continuous and/or categorical variables can appear in the nonparametric part of a partially linear time-series model. The estimator appearing in the linear part is shown to be -consistent, which is of course the case for Robinson's (1988) estimator. Asymptotic normality of the nonparametric component is also established. A modest Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that the proposed estimator can outperform existing nonparametric, semiparametric, and popular parametric specifications that appear in the literature. An application using Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data to model a dynamic labor supply function is undertaken that provides a robustness check and demonstrates that the proposed method is capable of outperforming popular parametric specifications that have been used to model this dataset.","[Gao, Qi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Long] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX USA; [Racine, Jeffrey S.] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); McMaster University,"Racine, JS (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Kenneth Taylor Hall,Rm 431,1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",racinej@mcmaster.ca,"Racine, Jeffrey/N-9476-2014","Racine, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5680-3705",,,,,18,5,5,0,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

It is an alternative to the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from general volatility by taking into account the standard deviation of negative asset returns, a quantity called semideviation. Indeed, the semideviation is generally preferred to the standard deviation when the distribution of the returns is skewed. A common method to annualize it is to use the square-root-of-time rule, where an estimated quantile of a return distribution is scaled to a lower frequency by the square root of the time horizon. However, this relation does not generally hold for this risk measure and often gives a terrible estimation of it. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical approach to semideviation by explaining how it should be computed. We propose and justify the use of a new model, which delivers a more accurate estimation of the downside risk. It is a generalization of the Ball-Torous approximation of a jump-diffusion process, which can be applied when the volatility is constant or stochastic. In the latter case, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit our stochastic volatility model. We also derive an exact formula for the semideviation when the volatility is kept constant, explaining how it should be scaled when considering a lower frequency. For the tests, we apply our methodology to a highly skewed set of returns based on the Barclays US High Yield Index, where we compare different time scalings for the semideviation. Our work shows that the square-root-of-time rule provides a poor approximation of the semideviation, and that the simplification brought by Ball and Torous should be replaced by our new methodology, as it gives much better results.","[Oeuvray, R.] Pictet Asset Management SA, CH-1211 Geneva 73, Switzerland; [Junod, P.] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland HEIG VD, CH-1401 Yverdon, Switzerland",,"Oeuvray, R (通讯作者)，Pictet Asset Management SA, Route Acacias 60, CH-1211 Geneva 73, Switzerland.",roeuvray@pictet.com,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Liabilities are evaluated at fair-value and, as a consequence, interest-rate risk can affect both the assets and the liabilities. Longevity risk is described via a continuous-time cohort model. We evaluate the effects of natural hedging strategies on the risk profile of an insurance portfolio in run-off. Numerical simulations, calibrated to UK historical data, show that systematic longevity risk is of particular importance and needs to be hedged. Natural hedging can improve the solvency of the insurer, if interest-rate risk is appropriately managed. We stress that asset allocation choices should not be independent of the composition of the liability portfolio of the insurer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our approximation is based on analysing the evolution of the present value function through a linear differential equation. The outcome is far more accurate than the standard approach achieved by a Taylor expansion. Furthermore, we derive an approximation formula of second order that produces nearly accurate results. In particular, we prove that our method is superior to any known alternative approximation formula based on duration. In order to demonstrate the power of this improved approximation we apply it to coupon bonds, level annuities, and level perpetuities. We finally generalise the approach to a non-flat term structure. As for applications in insurance, we estimate the change of the discounted value of future liabilities due to a proportional shift in the set of capital accumulation factors. These findings are of particular importance to capital adequacy calculations with respect to interest rate stress scenarios that are part of regulatory solvency requirements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Collectively, the structures are called pooled annuity funds. Since the pooled annuity funds propose different methods of poolingmortality risk, we investigate the connections between them and find that they are genuinely different for a finite heterogeneous membership profile. We discuss the importance of actuarial fairness, defined as the expected benefits equalling the contributions for each member, in the context of pooling mortality risk and comment on whether actuarial unfairness can be seen as solidarity between members. We show that, with a finite number of members in the fund, the group self-annuitization scheme is not actuarially fair: some members subsidize the other members.

It also helps to select and determine factors influencing farmers' perception and adaptation to uptake organic vegetable farming and to investigate if this in turn supports sustainable development of farmers' livelihood in the study zone. A total of 108 organic farmers of Chiang Mai Organic Agriculture Cooperative were randomly selected from three districts based on current farming practices experience, in transforming to organic vegetable farming in 2013. Information was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussion from January to April 2013. Adaptation of organic farming and farm practice's were analyzed using the three point rating scale method. In order to fulfill the objectives mentioned above, descriptive was used. The findings revealed that a number of farmers in three study areas had previous experience in organic vegetable production, organic vegetable farming practice, i.e., land preparation, vegetable seed, types of crop, planting method, soil nutrient management, pest management, weed management and harvesting. The disadvantages or constraints in small-farmer adoption of organic agriculture include: debt and income, bio-physical and knowledge constraints. The multiple regression analysis results indicated that age, education level, household labor, farm income and extension visit significantly contributed to farmers' perception on organic vegetable production. Moreover, education level, experience, natural water and farmers' networks or membership significantly contributed to farmers' adaptation on organic vegetable production.

However, previous reviews have indicated that adherence to methodological guidelines is variable. In this methodological review, we assess the extent to which US budget-impact analyses for new drugs use recommended practices. We describe recommended practice for seven key elements in the design of a budget-impact analysis. Targeted literature searches for US studies reporting estimates of the budget impact of a new drug were performed and we prepared a summary of how each study addressed the seven key elements. The primary finding from this review is that recommended practice is not followed in many budget-impact analyses. For example, we found that growth in the treated population size and/or changes in disease-related costs expected during the model time horizon for more effective treatments was not included in several analyses for chronic conditions. In addition, all drug-related costs were not captured in the majority of the models. Finally, for most studies, one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses were very limited, and the ranges used in one-way sensitivity analyses were frequently arbitrary percentages rather than being data driven. The conclusions from our review are that changes in population size, disease severity mix, and/or disease-related costs should be properly accounted for to avoid over- or underestimating the budget impact. Since each budget holder might have different perspectives and different values for many of the input parameters, it is also critical for published budget-impact analyses to include extensive sensitivity and scenario analyses based on realistic input values.","[Mauskopf, Josephine; Earnshaw, Stephanie] RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,,"Earnshaw, Stephanie/0000-0003-2975-6509; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",,,,,67,33,36,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2016,34.0,11,,,,,1111,1131,,10.1007/s40273-016-0426-8,0,,,21,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EA6RE,27334107.0,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386755700005,0

We consider both linear and nonlinear models where the regression coefficients are heterogeneous across groups but homogeneous within a group and the group membership is unknown. Two approaches are consideredpenalized profile likelihood (PPL) estimation for the general nonlinear models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM) estimation for linear models with endogeneity. In both cases, we develop a new variant of Lasso called classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) that serves to shrink individual coefficients to the unknown group-specific coefficients. C-Lasso achieves simultaneous classification and consistent estimation in a single step and the classification exhibits the desirable property of uniform consistency. For PPL estimation, C-Lasso also achieves the oracle property so that group-specific parameter estimators are asymptotically equivalent to infeasible estimators that use individual group identity information. For PGMM estimation, the oracle property of C-Lasso is preserved in some special cases. Simulations demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the approach in both classification and estimation. Empirical applications to both linear and nonlinear models are presented.","[Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Shi, Zhentao] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Phillips, Peter C.

Essentially, P&L from model risk corresponds to P&L realized on a perfectly hedged position. Model uncertainty is expressed by a set of pricing models, each of which represents alternative asset price dynamics to the model used for pricing. P&L from model risk is determined relative to each of these models. Using market data, a unified loss distribution is attained by weighing models according to a likelihood criterion involving both calibration quality and model parsimony. Examples demonstrate the magnitude of model risk and corresponding capital buffers necessary to sufficiently protect trading book positions against unexpected losses from model risk.

In this method, the hedging strategy is derived by first reformulating the assumed multi-population stochastic mortality model in a state-space representation, and then considering the sensitivities of the hedge portfolio and the liability being hedged to all relevant hidden states. Inter alia, this method allows us to decompose the underlying longevity risk into components arising solely from the hidden states that are shared by all populations and components stemming exclusively from the hidden states that are population-specific. The latter components collectively represent an explicit measure of the population basis risk involved. Through this measure, we can infer that a portion of population basis risk depends on how the longevity hedge is constructed while another portion exists no matter what the notional amounts of the hedging instruments are. We present the proposed hedging method in both static and dynamic settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This has sometimes been regarded as implausible and led to the feeling that the expectations coefficient is biased upwards. A relatively general argument that has been advanced is that the bias could be due to structural changes in the means of the variables entering the structural equation. An alternative explanation is that the bias comes from weak instruments. In this article, we investigate the issue of upward bias in the estimated coefficients of the expectations variable based on a model where we can see what causes the breaks and how to control for them. We conclude that weak instruments are the most likely cause of any bias and note that structural change can affect the quality of instruments. We also look at some empirical work in Castle et al. (2014) on the new Kaynesian Phillips curve (NYPC) in the Euro Area and U.S. assessing whether the smaller coefficient on expectations that Castle et al. (2014) highlight is due to structural change. Our conclusion is that it is not. Instead it comes from their addition of variables to the NKPC. After allowing for the fact that there are weak instruments in the estimated re-specified model, it would seem that the forward coefficient estimate is actually quite high rather than low.","[Kulish, Mariano] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Pagan, Andrian] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Pagan, Andrian] Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Kulish, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.kulish@unsw.edu.au,,"Kulish, Mariano/0000-0002-1668-8343",,,,,9,1,1,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The proposed concept of benchmarked risk minimization leads beyond the classical no-arbitrage paradigm. It provides in incomplete markets a generalization of the pricing under classical risk minimization, pioneered by Follmer, Sondermann, and Schweizer. The latter relies on a quadratic criterion, requests square integrability of claims and gains processes, and relies on the existence of an equivalent risk-neutral probability measure. Benchmarked risk minimization avoids these restrictive assumptions and provides symmetry with respect to all primary securities. It employs the real-world probability measure and the numeraire portfolio to identify the minimal possible price for a contingent claim. Furthermore, the resulting benchmarked (i.e., numeraire portfolio denominated) profit and loss is only driven by uncertainty that is orthogonal to benchmarked-traded uncertainty, and forms a local martingale that starts at zero. Consequently, sufficiently different benchmarked profits and losses, when pooled, become asymptotically negligible through diversification. This property makes benchmarked risk minimization the least expensive method for pricing and hedging diversified pools of not fully replicable benchmarked contingent claims. In addition, when hedging it incorporates evolving information about nonhedgeable uncertainty, which is ignored under classical risk minimization.","[Du, Ke] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Financial Studies, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Platen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.;Platen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",eckhard.platen@uts.edu.au,,"Platen, Eckhard/0000-0003-4595-3123",,,,,31,7,8,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

The surplus value process is both refracted (paying tax) at its running maximum and reflected (injecting capital) at a lower constant boundary. The new model incorporates practical features from the Omega risk model (Albrecher et al., 2011), the risk model with tax (Albrecher and Hipp, 2007), and the risk model with capital injections (Albrecher and Ivanovs, 2014). The study of this new risk model is closely related to the Azema-Yor process, which is a process refracted by its running maximum. We explicitly characterize the Laplace transform of the occupation time of an Azema-Yor process below a constant level until the first passage time of another Azema-Yor process or until an independent exponential time. We also consider the case when the process has a lower reflecting boundary. This result unifies and extends recent results of Li and Zhou (2013) and Zhang (2015). We explicitly characterize the Laplace transform of the time of bankruptcy in the Omega risk model with tax and capital injections up to eigen-functions, and determine the expected present value of tax payments until default. We also discuss a further extension to occupation functionals through stochastic time-change, which handles the case of a non-constant bankruptcy function. Finally we present examples using a Brownian motion with drift, and discuss the pricing of quantile options written on the Azema-Yor process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Insurance demand is characterised by an iso-elastic function with a single elasticity parameter. We characterise the equilibrium by three quantities: equilibrium premium; level of adverse selection (in the economist's sense); and loss coverage, defined as the expected population losses compensated by insurance. We consider both equal elasticities for high and low risk-groups, and then different elasticities. In the equal elasticities case, adverse selection is always higher under pooling than under risk-differentiated premiums, while loss coverage first increases and then decreases with demand elasticity. We argue that loss coverage represents the efficacy of insurance for the whole population; and therefore that if demand elasticity is sufficiently low, adverse selection is not always a bad thing.","[Hao, Mingjie; Tapadar, Pradip; Thomas, R.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from a randomised, double-blind, phase III, placebo-controlled trial of rivaroxaban (either 2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) in patients with recent ACS [unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)]. In addition, all patients received antiplatelet therapy [aspirin alone or aspirin and a thienopyridine either as clopidogrel (approximately 99 %) or ticlopidine (approximately 1 %) according to national or local guidelines]. The higher dose of rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily) did not form part of the marketing authorisation. A post hoc subgroup analysis of the licensed patients who had ACS with elevated cardiac biomarkers (that is, patients with STEMI and NSTEMI) without prior stroke or transient ischaemic stroke showed that compared with standard care, the addition of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) to existing antiplatelet therapy reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction or stroke, but increased the risk of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage. However, there were a number of limitations in the evidence base that warrant caution in its interpretation. In particular, the evidence may be confounded because of the post hoc subgroup analysis, modified intention-to-treat analyses, high dropout rates and missing vital status data. Results from the company's economic evaluation showed that the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel or with aspirin alone compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin alone was A 6203 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In contrast, the ERG's preferred base case estimate was A 5622 pound per QALY gained. The ICER did not rise above A 10,000 pound per QALY gained in any of the sensitivity analyses undertaken by the ERG, although the inflexibility of the company's economic model precluded the ERG from formally undertaking all desired exploratory analyses. As such, only a crude exploration of the impact of additional bleeding events could be undertaken. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that the ICERs presented were all within the range that could be considered cost effective and that the results of the ERG's exploratory sensitivity and scenario analyses suggested that the ICER was unlikely to increase to the extent that it would become unacceptable. The Appraisal Committee therefore concluded that rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel, or with aspirin alone, was a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with ACS and elevated cardiac biomarkers.","[Pandor, Abdullah; Pollard, Daniel; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Chico, Tim] Univ Sheffield, Dept Cardiovasc Sci, Sheffield S10 2RX, S Yorkshire, England; [Henderson, Robert] Univ Nottingham Hosp, Trent Cardiac Ctr, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Nottingham,"Pandor, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",a.pandor@sheffield.ac.uk,"Chico, Tim/E-6169-2010; Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Pollard, Daniel/0000-0001-5630-0115; Chico, Timothy/0000-0002-7458-5481; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [11/119/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 11/119/01).

Although it is believed that mortality rates are also related to other factors (e.g. smoking, overweight, and especially marriage), data availability and marketing often limit the possibility of including them. Many studies have shown that married people (particularly men) benefit from the marriage, and generally have lower mortality rates than unmarried people. However, most of these studies used data from a population sample; their results might not apply to the whole population. In this study, we explore if mortality rates differ by marital status using mortality data (1975-2011) from the Taiwan Ministry of the Interior. In order to deal with the problem of small sample sizes in some marital status groups, we use graduation methods to reduce fluctuations in mortality rates. We also use a relational approach to model mortality rates by marital status, and then compare the proposed model with some popular stochastic mortality models. Based on computer simulation, we find that the proposed smoothing methods can reduce fluctuations in mortality estimates between ages, and the relational mortality model has smaller errors in predicting mortality rates by marital status. Analyses of the mortality data from Taiwan show that mortality rates differ significantly by marital status. In some age groups, the differences in mortality rates are larger between marital status groups than between smokers and non-smokers. For the issue of practical consideration, we suggest modifications to include marital status in pricing of life insurance products.","[Wang, Hsin Chung] Aletheia Univ, Dept Finance & Actuarial Sci, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Yue, Jack C.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Stat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Hsin Chung] Natl Chengchi Univ, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsai, Yi-Hsuan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan",Aletheia University; National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University,"Wang, HC (通讯作者)，Aletheia Univ, Dept Finance & Actuarial Sci, New Taipei, Taiwan.",au4369@mail.au.edu.tw; csyue@nccu.edu.tw; isuan.tsai@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-156-005],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors are grateful for the insightful comments from two anonymous reviewers.

The techniques we propose are applicable whenever the joint characteristic function of the vector of log-returns is known. Moreover, the basket value is not required to be positive. We test our new price approximations on different multivariate models, allowing for jumps and stochastic volatility. Numerical examples are discussed and benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations. All bounds are general and do not require any additional assumption on the characteristic function, so our methods may be employed also to non-affine models. All bounds involve the computation of one-dimensional Fourier transforms; hence, they do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and can be applied also to high-dimensional problems where most existing methods fail. In particular, we study two kinds of price approximations: an accurate lower bound based on an approximating set and a fast bounded approximation based on the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also show how to improve Monte Carlo accuracy by using one of our bounds as a control variate.","[Caldana, Ruggero; Fusai, Gianluca] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Via Perrone 18, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Fusai, Gianluca] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Gnoatto, Alessandro] LMU, Math Inst, Munich, Germany; [Grasselli, Martino] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Matemat, Via Trieste 63, Padua, Italy; [Grasselli, Martino] Leonard da Vinci Pole Univ, Finance Lab, Paris, France; [Caldana, Ruggero] Accenture, Via Maurizio Quadrio 17, I-20154 Milan, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; City University London; University of Munich; University of Padua; Accenture,"Fusai, G (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Via Perrone 18, I-28100 Novara, Italy.;Fusai, G (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",gianluca.fusai@eco.unipmn.it,"Fusai, Gianluca/F-1992-2013","GNOATTO, Alessandro/0000-0002-2119-7792",,,,,66,26,26,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Using the estimates, we simulate demand under alternative pricing and find that usage-based pricing eliminates low-value traffic. Furthermore, we show that the costs associated with investment in fiber-optic networks are likely recoverable in some markets, but that there is a large gap between social and private incentives to invest.","[Nevo, Aviv] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Nevo, Aviv] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Turner, John L.] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Williams, Jonathan W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Gardner Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Nevo, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Nevo, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Turner, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Brooks Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Williams, JW (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Gardner Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",nevo@northwestern.edu; jlturner@uga.edu; jonwms@unc.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1324851, SES-1324717]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1324851] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful to the North American Internet Service Providers that provided the data used in this paper.

Using direct martingale arguments we first show that when mu <= 0 it is optimal to stop at once and when mu >= sigma(2)/2 it is optimal not to stop at all. By employing the method of Lagrange multipliers we then show that the nonlinear problem for 0 < mu < sigma(2)/2 can be reduced to a family of linear problems. Solving the latter using a free-boundary approach we find that the optimal stopping time is given by tau(*) = inf{t >= 0 vertical bar X-t >= gamma/c(1-gamma)} where gamma = mu/(sigma(2)/2). The dynamic formulation of the problem and the method of solution are applied to the constrained problems of maximising/minimising the mean/variance subject to the upper/lower bound on the variance/mean from which the nonlinear problem above is obtained by optimising the Lagrangian itself.","[Pedersen, J.

Criteria vary across societies but are typically based on subjective judgments concerning the merit of individuals who are nominated for fellowships. These subjective assessments may be made by existing fellows as they vote in elections to determine the new fellows or they may be decided by a selection committee of fellows and officers of the society who determine merit after reviewing nominations and written assessments. Human judgment inevitably plays a central role in these determinations and, notwithstanding its limitations, is usually regarded as being a necessary ingredient in making an overall assessment of qualifications for fellowship. The present article suggests a mechanism by which these merit assessments may be complemented with a quantitative rule that incorporates both subjective and objective elements. The goal of measuring merit may be elusive, but quantitative assessment rules can help to widen the effective electorate (for instance, by including the decisions of editors, the judgments of independent referees, and received opinion about research) and mitigate distortions that can arise from cluster effects, invisible college coalition voting, and inner sanctum bias. The rule considered here is designed to assist the selection process by explicitly taking into account subjective assessments of individual candidates for election as well as direct quantitative measures of quality obtained from bibliometric data. Audit methods are suggested to mitigate possible gaming effects by electors in the peer review process. The methodology has application to a wide arena of quality assessment and professional ranking exercises. Some specific issues of implementation are discussed in the context of the Econometric Society fellowship elections.","[Phillips, Peter C. B.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Phillips, Peter C.

There is exogenous firm turnover as new (small) startups enter the market over time, while some existing firms fail and exit. Individual firm growth rates are disperse and evolve stochastically. The paper highlights how dynamic monopsony, where firms trade off lower wages against higher (endogenous) employee quit rates, yields excessive job-to-job quits. Such quits directly crowd out the reemployment prospects of the unemployed.

Moreover, in the model with a bad status quo, arbitrary outcomes can be supported for arbitrary positive discount factors. We formulate sufficient conditions for supporting arbitrary alternatives in terms of a system of equations. The system has a straightforward solution in the model with no discounting, and after verifying non-singularity of this system, we use the implicit function theorem to derive the folk theorem when agents are sufficiently patient.","[Cho, Seok-ju] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Duggan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",dugg@ur.rochester.edu,"Cho, Seok-ju/AAK-5456-2020","Duggan, John/0000-0001-8554-2594; Cho, Seok-ju/0000-0001-6417-0517",,,,,19,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

This paper investigates tail conditional expectation (TCE) and tail variance premium (TVP) risk measures for the family of symmetric generalised hyperbolic (SGH) distributions. In contrast to a widely used Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure, TCE satisfies the requirement of the coherent risk measure taking into account the expected loss in the tail of the distribution while TVP incorporates variability in the tail, providing the most conservative estimator of risk. We examine various distributions from the class of SGH distributions, which turn out to fit well financial data returns and allow for explicit formulas for TCE and TVP risk measures. In parallel, we obtain asymptotic behaviour for TCE and TVP risk measures for large quantile levels. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the multivariate framework, allowing multivariate distributions to model combinations of correlated risks, and demonstrate how TCE can be decomposed into individual components, representing contribution of individual risks to the aggregate portfolio risk.

The comparator was abiraterone acetate (AA) or best supportive care (BSC). The School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company submission (CS), ERG review, and subsequent decision of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence of sipuleucel-T based upon the CS. Clinical-effectiveness data relevant to the decision problem were taken from three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of sipuleucel-T and a placebo (PBO) comparator of antigen-presenting cells (APC) being re-infused (APC-PBO) (D9901, D9902A and D9902B), and one RCT (COU-AA-302) of AA plus prednisone vs. PBO plus prednisone. Two trials reported a significant advantage for sipuleucel-T in median overall survival compared with APC-PBO: for trial D9901, an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.29, 0.76) p < 0.002; for D9902B, adjusted HR 0.78 (95 % CI 0.61, 0.98) p = 0.03. There was no significant difference between groups in D9902A, unadjusted HR 0.79 (95 % CI 0.48, 1.28) p = 0.331. Sipuleucel-T and APC-PBO groups did not differ significantly in time to disease progression, in any of the three RCTs. Most adverse events developed within 1 day of the infusion, and resolved within 2 days. The CS included an indirect comparison of sipuleucel-T (D9902B) and AA plus prednisone (COU-AA-302). As trials differed in prior use of chemotherapy, an analysis of only chemotherapy-na < ve patients was included, in which the overall survival for sipuleucel-T and AA was not significantly different, HR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.69, 1.28) p = 0.699. The ERG had several concerns regarding the data and assumptions incorporated within the company's cost-effectiveness analyses and conducted exploratory analyses to quantify the impact of making alternative assumptions or using alternative data inputs. The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for sipuleucel-T vs. BSC when using the ERG's preferred data and assumptions was A 108,585 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in the whole licensed population and A 61,204 pound/QALY in the subgroup with low prostate-specific antigen at baseline. The ERG also conducted an incremental analysis comparing sipuleucel-T with both AA and BSC in the chemotherapy-na < ve subgroup. Sipuleucel-T had a deterministic ICER of A 111,682 pound/QALY in this subgroup, when using the ERG's preferred assumptions, and AA was extendedly dominated. The ERG also concluded that estimates of costs and benefits for AA should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the indirect comparison. The AC noted that the ICER for sipuleucel-T was well above the range usually considered cost effective, and did not recommend sipuleucel-T for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic, non-visceral hormone-relapsed prostate cancer.","[Simpson, Emma L.; Davis, Sarah; Thokala, Praveen; Breeze, Penny R.; Wong, Ruth] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Bryden, Peter] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England",University of Sheffield; University of Bristol,"Simpson, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court,Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",e.l.simpson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Davis, Sarah E/A-2801-2010","Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366; Davis, Sarah/0000-0002-6609-4287; Breeze, Penny/0000-0002-4189-8676",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [12/56/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme,This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 12/56/01 STA).

In particular, this allows us to come up with an explicit drift term for the short-term process whereas the long-term process is primarily driftless due to inherent high volatility of commodity prices excluding an almost negligible mean reversion term. Not unexpectedly, the information used to build the short-term process relies on more than just historical prices but takes into account additional information about the state of the market. This work is done in the context of copper prices but a similar approach should be applicable to wide variety of commodities although certainly not all since commodities come with very distinct characteristics. In addition, our model also takes into account inflation which leads us to consider a multi-dimensional system for which one can generate explicit solutions.","[Wets, Roger J. -B.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rios, Ignacio] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",University of California System; University of California Davis; Universidad de Chile,"Wets, RJB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rjbwets@ucdavis.edu; irios@ing.uchile.cl,"Rios, Ignacio/ABE-6175-2021","Rios, Ignacio/0000-0002-8526-9353",,,,,25,13,14,1,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

We also link the long memory exponent of the sign of market orders with the impact function exponent.

In the limit of a very small simulation time step [GRAPHICS] , this singularity appears for any volatility and reproduces the Hogan-Weintraub singularity, which is generic for short rate interest rate models with log-normally distributed rates. The singular behaviour arises from a region in the state space which is usually truncated off in finite difference and grid methods, and poorly sampled in Monte Carlo methods, and thus is not observed under usual simulation methods.

The burden of obesity is particularly relevant in old age, due to accumulating co-morbidities and changes in body composition. Sarcopenic obesity, a mix of over- and under-nutrition, causes frailty, disability, and problems in social and psychological areas, impacting overall health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The relationship between obesity, aging, and HR-QOL is, however, much more complex than generally acknowledged and is difficult to disentangle. The impact of obesity on HR-QOL is particularly strong in young people, who are free of co-morbidities. It progressively attenuates, compared with the general population, with advancing age, when co-morbid conditions are diffusely present and reduce the perceived health status, independent of obesity. However, even this apparent 'obesity paradox' should not minimize the importance of obesity on HR-QOL, as other obesity-associated limitations and disabilities do impact HR-QOL in older age. A patient-centered approach aimed at reducing the disability and social isolation of advancing age is mandatory to improve HR-QOL in any class of obesity.","[Corica, Francesco] Univ Messina, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Messina, Italy; [Bianchi, Giampaolo] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ, Dept Internal Med & Geriatr, I-40138 Bologna, Italy; [Corsonello, Andrea; Lattanzio, Fabrizia] INRCA Ancona, Sci Direct, Ancona, Italy; [Mazzella, Natalia; Marchesini, Giulio] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ, Dept Clin Med, Unit Metab Dis & Clin Dietet, Policlin S Orsola, I-40138 Bologna, Italy",University of Messina; University of Bologna; IRCCS INRCA; University of Bologna; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna,"Marchesini, G (通讯作者)，Alma Mater Studiorum Univ, Dept Clin Med, Unit Metab Dis & Clin Dietet, Policlin S Orsola, Via Massarenti 9, I-40138 Bologna, Italy.",giulio.marchesini@unibo.it,"Corsonello, Andrea/A-5637-2013; bianchi, giampaolo/AAD-6147-2021; Andrea, Corsonello/AAC-1845-2022; Lattanzio, Fabrizia/D-2896-2018; Corica, Francesco/AAM-9945-2020","Lattanzio, Fabrizia/0000-0003-4051-1289; Corica, Francesco/0000-0001-8253-5057; Marchesini, Giulio/0000-0003-2407-9860; Corsonello, Andrea/0000-0002-7276-3256",,,,,197,21,29,1,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2015,33.0,7,,,,,655,672,,10.1007/s40273-014-0237-8,0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CL6EN,25420750.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357060500005,0

In particular, they allow us to quantify the population basis risk when longevity hedges are built from broad-based mortality indexes. In this paper, we propose and illustrate a systematic process for constructing a two-population mortality model for a pair of populations. The process encompasses four steps, namely (1) determining the conditions for biological reasonableness, (2) identifying an appropriate base model specification, (3) choosing a suitable time-series process and correlation structure for projecting period and/or cohort effects into the future, and (4) model evaluation. For each of the seven single-population models from Cairns et al. (2009), we propose two-population generalizations. We derive criteria required to avoid long-term divergence problems and the likelihood functions for estimating the models. We also explain how the parameter estimates are found, and how the models are systematically simplified to optimize the fa based on the Bayes Information Criterion. Throughout the paper, the results and methodology are illustrated using real data from two pairs of populations. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the limiting bootstrap distribution is random and unknown. The conventional remedy for this problem, at least asymptotically, is either the m out of n bootstrap or subsampling. However, we show that both these procedures can be unreliable in other than very large samples. We introduce a parametric bootstrap that overcomes the failure of Efron's bootstrap and performs better than the m out of n bootstrap and subsampling. The quality of inference based on the parametric bootstrap is examined in a simulation study, and is found to be satisfactory with heavy-tailed distributions unless the tail index is close to 1 and the distribution is heavily skewed.","[Cornea-Madeira, Adriana] Univ York, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England; [Cornea-Madeira, Adriana] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",University of York - UK; McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Cornea-Madeira, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Freboys Lane, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England.",adriana.cornea-madeira@york.ac.uk; russell.davidson@mcgill.ca,"Cornea-Madeira, Adriana/AGE-3917-2022","Cornea-Madeira, Adriana/0000-0002-0889-7145","British Academy's [PDF/2009/370]; Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture","British Academy's; Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture","We thank Michael Jansson, Keith Knight, Peter C.B.

Non-stationary variances generally invalidate standard structural change tests by introducing an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter in the limit distribution, and we propose robust alternatives. We also show that the practical relevance of the non-monotonic power issue, which is peculiarly associated with the test for changing mean, is mitigated (although the power against a small change is reduced) if there is comparable change in volatility levels.

We exploit asymptotic approximations assuming an ever increasing set of option prices in the moneyness (cross-sectional) dimension, but with a fixed time span. We develop consistent estimators for the parameters and the dynamic realization of the state vector governing the option price dynamics. The estimators converge stably to a mixed-Gaussian law and we develop feasible estimators for the limiting variance. We also provide semiparametric tests for the option price dynamics based on the distance between the spot volatility extracted from the options and one constructed nonparametrically from high-frequency data on the underlying asset. Furthermore, we develop new tests for the day-by-day model fit over specific regions of the volatility surface and for the stability of the risk-neutral dynamics over time. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study indicates that the inference procedures work well in empirically realistic settings. In an empirical application to S&P 500 index options, guided by the new diagnostic tests, we extend existing asset pricing models by allowing for a flexible dynamic relation between volatility and priced jump tail risk. Importantly, we document that the priced jump tail risk typically responds in a more pronounced and persistent manner than volatility to large negative market shocks.","[Andersen, Torben G.; Todorov, Viktor] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Andersen, Torben G.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Andersen, Torben G.] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark; [Fusari, Nicola] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; CREATES; Johns Hopkins University,"Andersen, TG (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",t-andersen@northwestern.edu; nicola.fusari@jhu.edu; v-todorov@northwestern.edu,"Todorov, Viktor/KCX-9394-2024","Todorov, Viktor/0000-0002-2360-7812","CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; NSF [SES-0957330]","CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We wish to thank the co-editor and anonymous referees for their detailed comments that led to significant improvements of the paper.

We provide a brief description of the most common questionnaire used to calculate patient level utility scores, the EQ-5D, followed by a discussion of other ways to calculate patient level utility scores alongside a trial including other generic measures of health-related quality of life and condition- and population-specific questionnaires. Detail is provided on how to calculate the mean QALYs per patient, including discounting, adjusting for baseline differences in utility scores and a discussion of the implications of different methods for handling missing data. The methods are demonstrated using data from a trial. As the methods chosen can systematically change the results of the analysis, it is important that standardised methods such as patient-level analysis are adhered to as best as possible.

Cost-of-illness (COI) studies provide useful information on the economic burden that BD imposes on a society. Furthermore, COI studies are pivotal sources of evidence used in economic evaluations. This study aims to give a general overview of COI studies for BD and to discuss methodological issues that might potentially influence results. This study also aims to provide recommendations to improve practice in this area, based on the review. A search was performed to identify COI studies of BD. The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, HMIC and openSIGLE. The primary outcome of this review was the annual cost per BD patient. A narrative assessment of key methodological issues was also included. Based on these findings, recommendations for good practice were drafted. Fifty-four studies were included in this review. Because of the widespread methodological heterogeneity among included studies, no attempt has been made to pool results of different studies. Potential areas for methodological improvement were identified. These were: description of the disease and population, the approach to deal with comorbidities, reporting the rationale and impact for choosing different cost perspectives, and ways in which uncertainty is addressed. This review showed that numerous COI studies have been conducted for BD since 1995. However, these studies employed varying methods, which limit the comparability of findings. The recommendations provided by this review can be used by those conducting COI studies and those critiquing them, to increase the credibility and reporting of study results.","[Jin, Huajie; McCrone, Paul] Kings Coll London, Ctr Econ Mental & Phys Hlth, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London SE5 8AF, England",University of London; King's College London,"Jin, HJ (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Ctr Econ Mental & Phys Hlth, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Box 024,De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, England.",huajie.jin@kcl.ac.uk,"Jin, Huajie/J-1332-2014","Jin, Huajie/0000-0002-3872-3998",,,,,102,30,36,0,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2015,33.0,4,,,,,341,353,,10.1007/s40273-014-0250-y,0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CF1AQ,25576148.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352276300003,0

To account for counterparty risk and funding issues, we use the calibrated multiple-curve model as an underlying model for CVA computation. We follow a reduced-form methodology through which the problem of pricing the counterparty risk and funding costs can be reduced to a pre-default Markovian BSDE, or an equivalent semi-linear PDE.

Our purpose is to investigate for the first time whether cost efficiency in CEE banks differs across quantiles of the conditional distribution. We employ stochastic frontier analysis across quantiles using the Distribution-Free Approach. The reported evidence demonstrates lower efficiency scores for higher conditional distributions. The paper goes further into a second-stage analysis to investigate how risk, measured by non-performing loans and loans loss provisions, affects bank efficiency across quantiles. This second-stage analysis finds that risk asserts a negative impact on cost efficiency, especially in high-order quantiles. Finally, the paper investigates the relationship between bank-specific 'z' variables, such as structural reforms, bank concentration and profitability, and cost efficiency across quantiles.","Univ Sussex, Business Management & Econ Sch, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England",,"Mamatzakis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Business Management & Econ Sch, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England.",e.mamatzakis@sussex.ac.uk,"MAMATZAKIS, E/ABE-3804-2021; MAMATZAKIS, E/JFA-7402-2023","MAMATZAKIS, E/0000-0002-2623-0029",,,,,46,11,11,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

It is based on the following observations: (a) A distinction between what agents are willing to pay for consumption and what they actually pay. The former is a function of a number of factors including the agent's wealth and risk preferences and the latter is a function of all other agents' aggregate consumption or equivalently, their wealth committed to consumption. (b) Unlike traditional pricing models that define a representative agent underlying the pricing model, this paper assumes that each agent is in fact 'Cournot-gaming' a market defined by all other agents. This results in a decomposition of an n-agents game into n games of two agents, one a specific agent and the other a synthetic agent (a proxy for all other agents), on the basis of which an equilibrium consumption price solution is defined. The paper's essential results are twofold. First, a Martingale pricing model is defined for each individual agent expressing the consumer willingness to pay (his utility price) and the market price-the price that all agents pay for consumption. In this sense, price is unique defined by each agent's 'Cournot game' Agents' consumption are then adjusted accordingly to meet the market price. Second, the pricing model defined is shown to account for agents wealth distribution pointing out that all agents valuations are a function of their and others' wealth, the information they have about each other and other factors which are discussed in the text. When an agent has no wealth or cannot affect the market price of consumption, then this pricing model is reduced to the standard CCAPM model while any agent with an appreciable wealth compared to other agents, is shown to value returns (and thus future consumption) less than wealth-poor agents. As a result, this paper will argue that even in a financial market with an infinite number of agents, if there are some agents that are large enough to affect the market price by their decisions, such agents have an arbitrage advantage over the poorer agents. The financial CCAPM MA pricing model has a number of implications, some of which are considered in this paper. Finally, some simple examples are considered to highlight the applicability of this paper to specific financial issues.","NYU, Dept Finance & Risk Engn, Polytech Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Tapiero, CS (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Finance & Risk Engn, Polytech Sch Engn, 6 Metro Tech, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",cst262@nyu.edu,,,Sloan Foundation,Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

The risk of the loss of the policyholder's human capital the mortality risk to the household can be partially hedged by a term life insurance policy. Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (GMDB) in Variable Annuities (VA) can also help policyholders hedge the risk of the loss of human capital. Therefore, GMDB options and term life insurance can be considered as substitute goods. However, they are not perfect substitute as GMDB and term life have their own properties: Term life insurance has no correlation with equity markets, and it is purely regarded as a protection for human capital; the variable annuity products follow the performance of equity markets, and the GMDB is a protection against downside risks on equity markets as well as human capital. We find that fairly priced GMDB options fail to add value to a VA contract if a term life policy is available. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed test employs a random normalizing matrix computed from recursive M-estimators to eliminate the nuisance parameters arising from the asymptotic covariance matrix. It does not require consistent estimation of any nuisance parameters, in contrast with the conventional heteroscedasticity-autocorrelation consistent (HAC)-type test and the Kiefer-Vogelsang-Bunzel (KVB)-type test. Our test reduces to the KVB-type test in simple location models with ordinary least-squares estimation, so the error in the rejection probability of our test in a Gaussian location model is Op(T-1logT). We discuss robust testing in quantile regression, and censored regression models in detail. In simulation studies, we find that our test has better size control and better finite sample power than the HAC-type and KVB-type tests.","[Lee, Wei-Ming] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan; [Hsu, Yu-Chin] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Peoples R China; [Kuan, Chung-Ming] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 106, Peoples R China",National Chung Cheng University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Taiwan University,"Lee, WM (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.",ecdwml@ccu.edu.tw; ychsu@econ.sinica.edu.tw; ckuan@ntu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of the Republic of China [NSC94-2415-H-194-009],"National Science Council of the Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank the editor Michael Jansson, Anil Bera, Joon Park, Werner Ploberger, Jeffrey Racine, two anonymous referees, and the participants at the 2006 Far Eastern Meeting of the Econometric Society in Beijing for helpful suggestions and comments.

We analyze the endogenous interaction arising between the stock and the defaultable bond via the interplay between equilibrium behavior of investors, risk preferences and cyclicality properties of the default intensity. We find that the equilibrium price of the stock experiences a jump at default, despite that the default event has no causal impact on the underlying economic fundamentals. We characterize the direction of the jump in terms of a relation between investor preferences and the cyclicality properties of the default intensity. We conduct a similar analysis for the market price of risk and for the investor wealth process, and determine how heterogeneity of preferences affects the exposure to default carried by different investors.","[Capponi, Agostino] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Larsson, Martin] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Capponi, A (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, N Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",capponi@purdue.edu,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

This study focuses on the chestnut supply chain in South Tyrol (Alto Adige/Sudtirol), a northern Italian province where chestnuts are currently of minor importance in relation to other crops such as apples and grapes. Nevertheless, a small number of chestnut farmers keep a historically rooted tradition alive. A detailed survey of the chestnut supply chain, involving interviews of 138 producers, 49 distributors and 272 consumers revealed the strengths and weaknesses of the local niche market. Moreover, it appeared that a significant production and marketing heterogeneity exists when analysing four sub-regions separately. Three different characteristics, regarding orchard management as well as purchasing and consumption habits, could be identified: (i) commercial chestnut production and direct sales around Merano; (ii) chestnut wood production around Bressanone; and (iii) the use of chestnut trails as spare time activities around Chiusa. New regional development strategies will therefore have to take into account the geographical disparities when trying to innovate a traditional agricultural activity.

I exploit the impact of the U.S. Civil War on the British cotton textile industry, which reduced supplies of cotton from the Southern United States, forcing British producers to shift to lower-quality Indian cotton. Using detailed new data, I show that this shift induced the development of new technologies that augmented Indian cotton. As these new technologies became available, I show that the relative price of Indian/U.S. cotton rebounded to its pre-war level, despite the increased relative supply of Indian cotton. This is the first paper to establish both of these patterns empirically, lending support to the two key predictions of leading directed technical change theories.","[Hanlon, W.

While there is a large number of existing theories of the Pareto tail of the long-run income distributions, almost none of these address the fast rise in top inequality observed in the data. We show that standard theories, which build on a random growth mechanism, generate transition dynamics that are too slow relative to those observed in the data. We then suggest two parsimonious deviations from the canonical model that can explain such changes: scale dependence that may arise from changes in skill prices, and type dependence, that is, the presence of some high-growth types. These deviations are consistent with theories in which the increase in top income inequality is driven by the rise of superstar entrepreneurs or managers.","[Gabaix, Xavier] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lasry, Jean-Michel] Univ Paris 09, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Lions, Pierre-Louis] Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France; [Moll, Benjamin] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, 106 Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Harvard University; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; College de France; Princeton University,"Gabaix, X (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",xgabaix@fas.harvard.edu; 2007lasry@gmail.com; pierre-louis.lions@college-de-france.fr; moll@princeton.edu,"Gabaix, Xavier/B-8227-2008",,Kauffman Foundation,Kauffman Foundation,"We thank the editor and referees for many constructive suggestions, Fernando Alvarez, Roland Benabou, Jess Benhabib, Fatih Guvenen, Chad Jones, Greg Kaplan, Erzo Luttmer, Wojciech Kopczuk, Makoto Nirei, Ezra Oberfield, Jonathan Parker, Jesse Perla, John Shea, Joe Sullivan, and Gabriel Zucman for their insights, and seminar participants at UQAM, Queen's University, Cornell, the Chicago Fed, Princeton, the University of Maryland, the University of Chicago, the 2015 NBER Summer Institute on Income Distribution and Macroeconomics, the NBER EFG meeting, and 2015 SAET conference for useful comments, and Moll thanks the Kauffman Foundation for financial support.

In each period, each individual receives private information about the current state and forms an opinion (a posterior belief). She also chooses a target individual and observes the target's opinion. This choice involves a trade-off between well-informed targets, whose signals are precise, and well-understood targets, whose perspectives are well known. Opinions are informative about the target's perspective, so observed individuals become better understood over time. We identify a simple condition under which long-run behavior is history independent. When this fails, each individual restricts attention to a small set of experts and observes the most informed among these. A broad range of observational patterns can arise with positive probability, including opinion leadership and information segregation.

In the dynamic setting, a CVaR/wcCVaR constraint is equivalent to a VaR constraint under a higher confidence level. Applying dynamic programming technique, we obtain closed form expressions of the optimal reinsurance strategies and corresponding survival probabilities under both proportional and excess-of loss reinsurance. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact caused by dynamic VaR/CVaR/wcCVaR limit in both types of reinsurance policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methods This was a secondary analysis of data collected in an internet survey as part of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R)) project. To estimate Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3) preference scores, we used the ten PROMIS (R) global health items, the PROMIS-29 V2.0 single pain intensity item and seven multi-item scales (physical functioning, fatigue, pain interference, depressive symptoms, anxiety, ability to participate in social roles and activities, sleep disturbance), and the PROMIS-29 V2.0 items. Linear regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors, followed by simple linear equating to avoid regression to the mean. Results The regression models explained 48 % (global health items), 61 % (PROMIS-29 V2.0 scales), and 64 % (PROMIS-29 V2.0 items) of the variance in the HUI-3 preference score. Linear equated scores were similar to observed scores, although differences tended to be larger for older study participants. Conclusions HUI-3 preference scores can be estimated from the PROMIS (R) global health items or PROMIS-29 V2.0. The estimated HUI-3 scores from the PROMIS (R) health measures can be used for economic applications and as a measure of overall HR-QOL in research.","[Hays, Ron D.; Spritzer, Karen L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, 911 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Revicki, Dennis A.] Evidera, Outcomes Res, Bethesda, MD USA; [Feeny, David] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Feeny, David] Hlth Utilities Inc, Dundas, ON, Canada; [Fayers, Peter] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Fayers, Peter] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Canc Res & Mol Med, Trondheim, Norway; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Evidera; McMaster University; University of Aberdeen; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Hays, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, 911 Broxton Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",drhays@ucla.edu,"Fayers, Peter M/A-5999-2010; Hays, Ron D./D-5629-2013","Hays, Ron D./0000-0001-6697-907X; Fayers, Peter/0000-0003-4778-1513",National Cancer Institute [1U2-CCA186878-01]; [3U54AR057951-04S4],National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI));,"This work was supported by a grant from National Cancer Institute (1U2-CCA186878-01) and a supplement to the PROMIS statistical center grant (3U54AR057951-04S4).

However, as two parties of a reinsurance contract, an insurer and a reinsurer have conflicting interests. An optimal form of reinsurance from one party's point of view may be not acceptable to the other party. In this paper, we study optimal reinsurance designs from the perspectives of both an insurer and a reinsurer and take into account both an insurer's aims and a reinsurer's goals in reinsurance contract designs. We develop optimal reinsurance contracts that minimize the convex combination of the Value-at-Risk (VaR) risk measures of the insurer's loss and the reinsurer's loss under two types of constraints, respectively. The constraints describe the interests of both the insurer and the reinsurer. With the first type of constraints, the insurer and the reinsurer each have their limit on the VaR of their own loss. With the second type of constraints, the insurer has a limit on the VaR of his loss while the reinsurer has a target on his profit from selling a reinsurance contract. For both types of constraints, we derive the optimal reinsurance forms in a wide class of reinsurance policies and under the expected value reinsurance premium principle. These optimal reinsurance forms are more complicated than the optimal reinsurance contracts from the perspective of one party only. The proposed models can also be reduced to the problems of minimizing the VaR of one party's loss under the constraints on the interests of both the insurer and the reinsurer.","[Cai, Jun; Lemieux, Christiane; Liu, Fangda] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Liu, Fangda] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",University of Waterloo; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.;Liu, FD (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",jcai@uwaterloo.ca; clemieux@uwaterloo.ca; andrealfd@gmail.com,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada [238959, 250031]; Waterloo Research Institute in Insurance, Securities and Quantitative Finance (WatRISQ)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Waterloo Research Institute in Insurance, Securities and Quantitative Finance (WatRISQ)","The authors thank the two anonymous referees for the insightful suggestions that improved the presentation of the paper.

Effective interventions for opioid use disorders are available; however, given the scarce resources faced by substance use treatment providers and payers of all kinds, evidence of effectiveness is not always sufficient to encourage adoption of a given therapy-nor should it be. Economic evaluations can provide evidence that will help stakeholders efficiently allocate their resources. Objective The purpose of this study was to review the literature on economic evaluations of opioid use disorder interventions. Methods We performed a systematic review of the major electronic databases from inception until August 2015. A sensitive approach was used to ensure a comprehensive list of relevant articles. Given the quality of the existing reviews, we narrowed our search to studies published since 2007. The Drummond checklist was used to evaluate and categorize economic evaluation studies according to their quality. Results A total of 98 articles were identified as potentially relevant to the current study. Of these 98 articles, half (n = 49) were included in this study. Six of the included articles were reviews. The remaining 43 articles reported economic evaluation studies of interventions for opioid use disorders. In general, the evidence on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) supports previous findings that MMT is an economically advantageous opioid use disorder therapy. The economic literature comparing MMT with other opioid use disorder pharmacotherapies is limited, as is the literature on other forms of therapy. Conclusion With the possible exception of MMT, additional high-quality economic evaluations are needed in order to assess the relative value of existing opioid use disorder interventions.","[Murphy, Sean M.] Washington State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, POB 1495, Spokane, WA 99210 USA; [Polsky, Daniel] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Washington State University; University of Pennsylvania,"Murphy, SM (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, POB 1495, Spokane, WA 99210 USA.",sean.murphy@wsu.edu,,,,,,,74,72,77,1,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2016,34.0,9,,,,,863,887,,10.1007/s40273-016-0400-5,0,,,25,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OM,27002518.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383550900004,0

Traditional prediction methods (such as pretesting) are based on model selection followed by prediction in the selected model, but the reported prediction and the reported prediction variance ignore the uncertainty from the selection procedure. This article proposes a weighted-average least squares (WALS) prediction procedure that is not conditional on the selected model. Taking both model and error uncertainty into account, we also propose an appropriate estimate of the variance of the WALS predictor. Correlations among the random errors are explicitly allowed. Compared to other prediction averaging methods, the WALS predictor has important advantages both theoretically and computationally. Simulation studies show that the WALS predictor generally produces lower mean squared prediction errors than its competitors, and that the proposed estimator for the prediction variance performs particularly well when model uncertainty increases.","[Magnus, Jan R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wang, Wendun] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Zhang, Xinyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xinyu] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Capital University of Economics & Business","Magnus, JR (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jan@janmagnus.nl,,"Magnus, Jan/0000-0002-3390-639X; Wang, Wendun/0000-0002-5612-7065","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71101141, 11271355, 11471324]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Zhang's work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers 71101141, 11271355, and 11471324) and took place during a visit to Texas A&M University.",,44,2,2,0,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

To effectively harvest rebalancing gains, we apply ideas from elliptical-copula graphical modelling and stability inference to select stocks that are as independent as possible. The proposed elliptical-copula graphical model has a latent Gaussian representation; its structure can be effectively inferred using the regularized rank-based estimators. The resulting algorithm is computationally efficient and scales to large data-sets. To show the efficacy of the proposed method, we apply it to conduct equity selection based on a 16-year health care stock data-set and a large 34-year stock data-set. Empirical tests show that the proposed method is superior to alternative strategies including a principal component analysis-based approach and the classical Markowitz strategy based on the traditional buy-and-hold assumption.","[Liu, Han; Mulvey, John; Zhao, Tianqi] Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Mulvey, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mulvey@princeton.edu,"Liu, Han/HMD-9231-2023; Liu, Hanlong/JPE-5810-2023","Liu, Han/0000-0002-5269-8477;","NSF [DMS1454377, IIS1408910, IIS1332109]; NIH [R01MH102339, R01GM083084, R01HG06841]; SandPointe, LLC; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1454377] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1546462] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); SandPointe, LLC; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","This research is partially supported by [NSF CAREER Award DMS1454377], [NSF IIS1408910], [NSF IIS1332109], [NIH R01MH102339], [NIH R01GM083084], [NIH R01HG06841], and SandPointe, LLC.",,47,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This is the first study to quantify the redistributive effects of a rule change by a real world scheme (the Universities Superannuation Scheme, USS) where the sponsor underwrites the pension promise. In October 2011 USS closed its final salary scheme to new members, opened a career average revalued earnings (CARE) section, and moved to 'cap and share' contribution rates. We find that the pre-October 2011 scheme was not viable in the long run, while the post-October 2011 scheme is probably viable in the long run, but faces medium term problems. In October 2011 future members of USS lost 65% of their pension wealth (or roughly 100,000 pound per head), equivalent to a reduction of roughly 11% in their total compensation, while those aged over 57 years lost almost nothing. The riskiness of the pension wealth of future members increased by a third, while the riskiness of the present value of the sponsor's future contributions reduced by 10%. Finally, the sponsor's wealth increased by about 32.5 pound billion, equivalent to a reduction of 26% in their pension costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and the Centre for Health Economics (CHE) Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the evidence review group (ERG). This article provides a summary of the company's submission, the ERG report and NICE's subsequent guidance. In the company's initial submission, a sequence of treatments including apremilast was found to be both more effective and cheaper than a comparator sequence without it in both populations considered. However, this result was found to be highly sensitive to a series of assumptions made by the company, primarily reflecting the costs of best supportive care once no further treatments are available, and the source of utility estimates. A re-estimation of the cost effectiveness of apremilast by the ERG suggested that the apremilast sequence in the two populations was more effective, but due to high additional costs was not indicative of a cost-effective use of NHS resources. As such, in the final appraisal decision NICE concluded that apremilast was not cost effective in either population.","[Hinde, Sebastian; Palmer, Stephen; Spackman, Eldon] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Wade, Ros; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Hinde, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Sebastian.hinde@york.ac.uk,"Wade, Ros/AAB-7268-2019","Hinde, Sebastian/0000-0002-7117-4142; Wade, Rosalind Fay/0000-0002-8666-8110",NIHR HTA (National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment) Programme [13/168/01],NIHR HTA (National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment) Programme,"We would like to thank Dr Phil Hampton, Consultant Dermatologist at the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, for clinical advice throughout the project.

Using an expanding rolling window approach, the empirical results confirm that LQR with the error-minimizing quantile point has better and more robust out-of-sample performance than its competing alternatives, in the sense of yielding more accurate predicted recovery rates.

The model is based on an idea from Boucher and Couture-Piche (2015), who use a queuing theory model to estimate the number of insured cars on an insurance contract. Similarly, the proposed model includes households already insured, but the modeling approach is modified to include new households that could be added to the portfolio. For each household, we also use the queuing theory model to estimate the number of insured cars. We analyze an insurance portfolio from a Canadian insurance company to support this discussion. Statistical inference techniques serve to estimate each parameter of the model, even in cases where some explanatory variables are included in each of these parameters. We show that the proposed model offers a reasonable approximation of what is observed, but we also highlight the situations where the model should be improved. By assuming that the insurance company makes a $1 profit for each one-year car exposure, the proposed approach allows us to determine a global value of the insurance portfolio of an insurer based on the customer equity concept.","[Boucher, Jean-Philippe; Couture-Piche, Guillaume] Univ Quebec Montreal, Quantact Dept Math, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Boucher, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Quantact Dept Math, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",boucher.jean-philippe@uqam.ca; couture-piche.guillaume@courrier.uqam.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The authors would like to thank anonymous referees for their careful reading of the manuscript and the resulting comments that greatly helped to improve the paper.

Allowing for general heterogeneity is needed for correct welfare comparisons. We consider general heterogeneous demand where preferences and linear budget sets are statistically independent. Only the marginal distribution of demand for each price and income is identified from cross-section data where only one price and income is observed for each individual. Thus, objects that depend on varying price and/or income for an individual are not generally identified, including average exact consumer surplus. We use bounds on income effects to derive relatively simple bounds on the average surplus, including for discrete/continuous choice. We also sketch an approach to bounding surplus that does not use income effect bounds. We apply the results to gasoline demand.

We will use copula models for this purpose. After assessing whether there is evidence of financial contagion in the stock markets, we will examine whether the 'wealth constraints' transmission mechanism prevails over the 'portfolio rebalancing' channel. An additional test looks at the interaction between stock and bond markets during the crisis and allows us to determine if the transmission occurred due to the 'cross market rebalancing' channel or the 'flying to quality' phenomenon. The tests suggest that (i) financial contagion is present in all analyzed stock markets, (ii) a 'portfolio rebalancing' channel is the most important crisis transmission mechanism, (iii) and the 'flight-to-quality' phenomenon is also present in all analyzed stock markets.","[Horta, Paulo] CMVM, Portuguese Secur Market Commiss, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lagoa, Sergio] ISCTE Lisbon Univ Inst, Dept Polit Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Luis] ISCTE Lisbon Univ Inst, Sch Business, Dept Quantitat Methods, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Horta, P (通讯作者)，CMVM, Portuguese Secur Market Commiss, Lisbon, Portugal.",paulohorta@cmvm.pt,"Martins, Luis Filipe F S/B-8660-2009","Martins, Luis Filipe F S/0000-0001-9422-7027; Lagoa, Sergio/0000-0003-2790-6518",,,,,53,28,30,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In fact, most studies assume that the initial value is either zero or bounded. As a response to this, the current paper considers a model in which the initialization is in the past, which is shown to have several distinctive features that makes it attractive, even in comparison to the common time series practice of making the initial value a draw from its unconditional distribution under the stationary alternative. The results have implications not only for theory, but also for applied work. In particular, and in contrast to the time series case, in panels the effect of the initialization need not be negative but can actually lead to improved test performance.","[Westerlund, Joakim] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",joakim.westerlund@nek.lu.se,,,Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation,Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation),Thank you also to the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation for financial support through a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship.,,23,3,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Our empirical study has two major findings. First, our generalized model outperforms all nested specifications in terms of (a) statistical fit (when model selection is based on likelihood ratio tests) and (b) out-of-sample volatility forecasting performance.

We consider a set of independent subunits collaborating in order to reduce risk: that is, when subunit portfolios are merged a diversification benefit arises and the risk of the group as a whole is smaller than the sum of the risks of the individual subunits. The question is how to allocate the risk capital of the group among the subunits in a fair way. In this paper we propose to use the Lorenz set as an allocation method. We show that the Lorenz set is operational and coherent. Moreover, we propose three fairness tests related directly to the problem of risk capital allocation and show that the Lorenz set satisfies all three tests in contrast to other well-known coherent methods.

By employing a working propensity score and two working regression models for treatment and control groups, Robins et al. (1994, 1995) introduced the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) method for estimation of average treatment effects, which extends the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method of Horvitz and Thompson (1952); the AIPW estimators are locally efficient and doubly robust. In this paper, we study a hybrid of the empirical likelihood method and the method of moments by employing three estimating functions, which can generate estimators for average treatment effects that are locally efficient and doubly robust. The proposed estimators of average treatment effects are efficient for the given choice of three estimating functions when the working propensity score is correctly specified, and thus are more efficient than the AIPW estimators. In addition, we consider a regression method for estimation of the average treatment effects when working regression models for both the treatment and control groups are correctly specified; the asymptotic variance of the resulting estimator is no greater than the semiparametric variance bound characterized by the theory of Robins et al. (1994, 1995). Finally, we present a simulation study to compare the finite-sample performance of various methods with respect to bias, efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification.","[Zhang, Biao] Univ Toledo, Dept Math & Stat, Toledo, OH 43606 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Zhang, B (通讯作者)，Univ Toledo, Dept Math & Stat, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",bzhang@utnet.utoledo.edu,,,National Security Agency [H98230-11-1-0128],National Security Agency(National Security Agency),This research was supported by the National Security Agency under Standard Grant H98230-11-1-0128.,,37,6,7,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

For example, design decisions regarding gaps and overlaps in prescription fill data are necessary for measuring adherence using prescription claims data. However, little is known regarding the impact of these decisions on measures of medication possession (e.g., medication possession ratio). The goal of the study was to demonstrate the use of visualization tools for pattern discovery, hypothesis generation, and study design. Method We utilized EventFlow, a novel discrete event sequence visualization software, to investigate patterns of prescription fills, including gaps and overlaps, utilizing large-scale healthcare claims data. The study analyzes data of individuals who had at least two prescriptions for one of five hypertension medication classes: ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. We focused on those members initiating therapy with diuretics (19.2 %) who may have concurrently or subsequently take drugs in other classes as well. We identified longitudinal patterns in prescription fills for antihypertensive medications, investigated the implications of decisions regarding gap length and overlaps, and examined the impact on the average cost and adherence of the initial treatment episode. Results A total of 790,609 individuals are included in the study sample, 19.2 % (N = 151,566) of whom started on diuretics first during the study period. The average age was 52.4 years and 53.1 % of the population was female. When the allowable gap was zero, 34 % of the population had continuous coverage and the average length of continuous coverage was 2 months. In contrast, when the allowable gap was 30 days, 69 % of the population showed a single continuous prescription period with an average length of 5 months. The average prescription cost of the period of continuous coverage ranged from US$3.44 (when the maximum gap was 0 day) to US$9.08 (when the maximum gap was 30 days). Results were less impactful when considering overlaps. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study illustrates the use of visual analytics tools in characterizing longitudinal medication possession.

Evaluating if these guidelines are used in practice requires methods that can identify such structures and thresholds. Classification and regression trees (CART) were used to analyse prescribing patterns of Australian general practitioners (GPs) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our aim was to identify if GPs use absolute risk (AR) guidelines in favour of individual risk factors to inform their prescribing decisions of lipid-lowering medications. We employed administrative prescribing information that is linked to patient-level data from a clinical assessment and patient survey (the AusHeart Study), and assessed prescribing of lipid-lowering medications over a 12-month period for patients (n = 1903) who were not using such medications prior to recruitment. CART models were developed to explain prescribing practice. Out-of-sample performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and optimised via pruning. We found that individual risk factors (low-density lipoprotein, diabetes, triglycerides and a history of CVD), GP-estimated rather than Framingham AR, and sociodemographic factors (household income, education) were the predominant drivers of GP prescribing. However, sociodemographic factors and some individual risk factors (triglycerides and CVD history) only become relevant for patients with a particular profile of other risk factors. The ROC area under the curve was 0.63 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.64). There is little evidence that AR guidelines recommended by the National Heart Foundation and National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, or conditional individual risk eligibility guidelines from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, are adopted in prescribing practice. The hierarchy of conditional relationships between risk factors and socioeconomic factors identified by CART provides new insights into prescribing decisions. Overall, CART is a useful addition to the analyst's toolkit when investigating healthcare decisions.","[Schilling, Chris; Dalziel, Kim; Clarke, Philip] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne, Vic 3051, Australia; [Mortimer, Duncan] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Heeley, Emma; Chalmers, John] Univ Sydney, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2050, Australia; [Heeley, Emma; Chalmers, John] Royal Prince Alfred Hosp, Sydney, NSW 2050, Australia",University of Melbourne; Monash University; George Institute for Global Health; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; NSW Health; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,"Schilling, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne, Vic 3051, Australia.",chris.schilling@unimelb.edu.au,,"Mortimer, Duncan Stuart/0000-0002-7211-6454; Chalmers, John/0000-0002-9931-0580; Clarke, Philip/0000-0002-7555-5348; Dalziel, Kim/0000-0003-4972-8871; Heeley, Emma/0000-0001-9190-2832",Monash University; George Institute for Global Health; University of Melbourne,Monash University(Monash University); George Institute for Global Health; University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),"This work was supported by Monash University, the George Institute for Global Health, and the University of Melbourne.",,46,17,18,0,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2016,34.0,2,,,,,195,205,,10.1007/s40273-015-0342-3,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DE7UU,26578402.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370843000012,0

As most financial markets exhibit randomly varying volatility, in this paper we introduce an approximation of an American option price under stochastic volatility models. We achieve this by using the maturity randomization method known as Canadization. The volatility process is characterized by fast and slow-scale fluctuating factors. In particular, we study the case of an American put with a single underlying asset and use perturbative expansion techniques to approximate its price as well as the optimal exercise boundary up to the first order. We then use the approximate optimal exercise boundary formula to price an American put via Monte Carlo. We also develop efficient control variates for our simulation method using martingales resulting from the approximate price formula. A numerical study is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the least squares regression method popular in the financial industry, in typical settings where values of the scaling parameters are small. Further, it is empirically observed that in the regimes where the scaling parameter value is equal to unity, fast and slow-scale approximations are equally accurate.","[Agarwal, Ankush; Juneja, Sandeep] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Sch Technol & Comp Sci, Bombay 400005, Maharashtra, India; [Sircar, Ronnie] Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Princeton University,"Sircar, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, ORFE Dept, Sherrerd Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",sircar@princeton.edu,,"Agarwal, Ankush/0000-0001-7826-9665",Tata Consultancy Services; NSF [DMS-1211906]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1211906] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Tata Consultancy Services; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),This work was partially supported by Tata Consultancy Services Ph.D. scholarship; NSF [grant number DMS-1211906].,,28,16,19,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We consider a dynamic moral-hazard model of governors serving a sovereign prince, who must deter them from rebellion and hidden corruption which could cause costly crises. To minimize costs, a governor's rewards for good performance should be deferred up to the maximal credit that the prince can be trusted to pay. In the long run, we find that high officials can become an entrenched aristocracy with low turnover and large claims on the ruler. Dismissals for bad performance should be randomized to avoid inciting rebellions, but the prince can profit from reselling vacant offices, and so his decisions to dismiss high officials require institutionalized monitoring. A soft budget constraint that forgives losses for low-credit governors can become efficient when costs of corruption are low.","[Myerson, Roger B.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Myerson, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",myerson@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,32,20,25,4,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2015,83.0,6,,,,,2083,2126,,10.3982/ECTA9737,0,,,44,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DB3IW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368405400001,0

Multivariate covariance driven Gaussian or mixed normal time varying models have only a limited ability to capture important features of the data such as heavy tails, asymmetry, and nonlinear dependencies. The present paper tackles this problem by proposing and analyzing a hidden Markov model (HMM) for hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC). The HAC constitute a wide class of models for multi-dimensional dependencies, and HMM is a statistical technique for describing regime switching dynamics. HMM applied to HAC flexibly models multivariate dimensional non-Gaussian time series. We apply the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. Consistency results for both parameters and HAC structures are established in an HMM framework. The model is calibrated to exchange rate data with a VaR application. This example is motivated by a local adaptive analysis that yields a time varying HAC model. We compare its forecasting performance with that of other classical dynamic models. In another, second, application, we model a rainfall process. This task is of particular theoretical and practical interest because of the specific structure and required untypical treatment of precipitation data.","[Haerdle, Wolfgang Karl; Okhrin, Ostap; Wang, Weining] Humboldt Univ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Wang, WN (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair Stat, Nonparametr Stat & Dynam Risk Management, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",wangwein@cms.hu-berlin.de,"Härdle, Wolfgang K/C-5963-2013","Hardle, Wolfgang Karl/0000-0001-5600-3014",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 649]; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; IRTG High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; IRTG High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,"The financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via SFB 649 Okonomisches Risiko, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin and IRTG 1972 High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series is gratefully acknowledged.",,32,20,20,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The disentangling procedure is actually a two step process: First, a preliminary analysis is carried out to determine the number of risks groups present. Once that is decided, the underlying model for the frequency of each type of risk is worked out. After that we use the maxentropic techniques in the decompounding stage to determine the distribution of individual losses that aggregated yield the observed total loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Their cost to society extends well beyond lives lost, as the impact of survivorship is increasingly felt. A review of the medical literature was completed in MEDLINE using the search phrases severe sepsis and septic shock and the MeSH terms epidemiology, statistics, mortality, economics, and quality of life. Results were limited to human trials that were published in English from 2002 to 2014. Articles were classified by dominant themes to address epidemiology and outcomes, including quality of life of both patient and family caregivers, as well as societal costs. The severity of sepsis is determined by the number of organ failures and the presence of shock. In most developed countries, severe sepsis and septic shock account for disproportionate mortality and resource utilization. Although mortality rates have decreased, overall mortality continues to increase and is projected to accelerate as people live longer with more chronic illness. Among those who do survive, impaired quality of life, increased dependence, and rehospitalization increase healthcare consumption and, along with increased mortality, all contribute to the humanistic burden of severe sepsis. A large part of the economic burden of severe sepsis occurs after discharge. Initial inpatient costs represent only 30 % of the total cost and are related to severity and length of stay, whereas lost productivity and other indirect medical costs following hospitalization account for the majority of the economic burden of sepsis. Timeliness of treatment as well as avoidance of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired illness/morbidity lead to important differences in both cost and outcome of treatment for severe sepsis and represent areas where improvement in care is possible. The degree of sophistication of a health system from a national perspective results in significant differences in resource use and outcomes for patients with serious infections. Comprehensive understanding of the cost and humanistic burden of severe sepsis provides an initial practical framework for health policy development and resource use.","[Tiru, Bogdan; DiNino, Ernest K.; Orenstein, Abigail; Mailloux, Patrick T.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Tiru, Bogdan; DiNino, Ernest K.; Orenstein, Abigail; Mailloux, Patrick T.; Gupta, Abhinav; McGee, William T.] Baystate Med Ctr, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Springfield, MA USA; [Pesaturo, Adam] Baystate Med Ctr, Dept Pharm, Springfield, MA USA; [McGee, William T.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Med & Surg, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts University; Baystate Medical Center; Baystate Medical Center; Tufts University,"Tiru, B (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",bogdan.tirumd@baystatehealth.org,,,,,,,95,78,87,0,23,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2015,33.0,9,,,,,925,937,,10.1007/s40273-015-0282-y,0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CQ7WZ,25935211.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360818000004,0

We apply this framework to examine the effects of regulations that govern insurers' ability to use health status information in pricing. We investigate the welfare implications of these regulations with an emphasis on two potential sources of inefficiency: (i) adverse selection and (ii) premium reclassification risk. We find substantial adverse selection leading to full unraveling of our simulated exchange, even when age can be priced. While the welfare cost of adverse selection is substantial when health status cannot be priced, that of reclassification risk is five times larger when insurers can price based on some health status information. We investigate several extensions including (i) contract design regulation, (ii) self-insurance through saving and borrowing, and (iii) insurer risk adjustment transfers.","[Handel, Ben] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hendel, Igal] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Whinston, Michael D.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Whinston, Michael D.] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Northwestern University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Handel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",handel@berkeley.edu; igal@northwestern.edu; whinston@mit.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1259770]; NSF; Toulouse Network for Information Technology; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1260949] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Toulouse Network for Information Technology; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank five referees, the co-editor, Gautam Gowrisankaran, Bruno Jullien, Kei Kawai, Pierre-Thomas Leger, Neale Mahoney, and numerous conference and seminar participants for their comments.

Specifically, we use time-varying copula models to capture the mortality dependence structure across countries, examining both symmetric and asymmetric dependence structures. In addition, to capture the phenomenon of a heavy tail for the multi-country mortality index, we consider not only the setting of Gaussian innovations but also non-Gaussian innovations under the Lee-Carter framework model. As tests of the goodness of fit of different dynamic copula models, the pattern of mortality dependence, and the distribution of the innovations, we used empirical mortality data from Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. To understand the effect of mortality dependence on longevity derivatives, we also built a valuation framework for pricing a survivor index swap, then investigated the fair swap rates of a survivor swap numerically. We demonstrate that failing to consider the dynamic copula mortality model and non-Gaussian innovations would lead to serious underestimations of the swap rates and loss reserves.

In the first step, we utilize high-frequency data to estimate daily realized volatility from returns. Then, we use stochastic cusp catastrophe theory on data normalized by the estimated volatility in the second step to study possible discontinuities in the markets. We support our methodology through simulations in which we discuss the importance of stochastic noise and volatility in a deterministic cusp catastrophe model. The methodology is empirically tested on nearly 27years of US stock market returns covering several important recessions and crisis periods. While we find that the stock markets showed signs of bifurcation in the first half of the period, catastrophe theory was not able to confirm this behaviour in the second half. Translating the results, we find that the US stock market's downturns were more likely to be driven by the endogenous market forces during the first half of the studied period, while during the second half of the period, exogenous forces seem to be driving the market's instability. The results suggest that the proposed methodology provides an important shift in the application of catastrophe theory to stock markets.","[Barunik, Jozef; Kukacka, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Barunik, Jozef; Kukacka, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18200, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Barunik, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 21, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",barunik@fsv.cuni.cz,"Kukacka, Jiri/J-1974-2014; Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014","Kukacka, Jiri/0000-0001-8680-2896; Barunik, Jozef/0000-0001-5097-2607","European Union [FP7-SSH- 612955]; Czech Science Foundation [402/09/0965, 13-32263S]; Grant Agency of Charles University [588912]",European Union(European Union (EU)); Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Grant Agency of Charles University,We are grateful to the editors and two anonymous referees for many useful comments and suggestions.

Our Monte Carlo experiments indicate that, for the single equation spatial error components 2SLS estimators, there is a slight gain in efficiency when Lee (2003) type rather than Kelejian and Prucha (1998) instruments are used.

CoVaR stands for conditional Value-at-Risk, i.e. it indicates the Value at Risk for a financial institution that is conditional on a certain scenario. In this paper, two alternative extensions of the classic univariate Conditional Value-at-Risk are introduced in a multivariate setting. The two proposed multivariate CoVaRs are constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions (resp. of multivariate survival distribution functions). These vector-valued measures have the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. Several characterizations of these new risk measures are provided in terms of the copula structure and stochastic orderings of the marginal distributions. Interestingly, these results are consistent with existing properties on univariate risk measures. Furthermore, comparisons between existent risk measures and the proposed multivariate CoVaR are developed. Illustrations are given in the class of Archimedean copulas. Estimation procedure for the multivariate proposed CoVaRs is illustrated in simulated studies and insurance real data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We explore whether a justification that is derived from an economic perspective has been provided, in Canada or elsewhere, for cancer drugs to have a separate reimbursement review process (i.e. to be 'treated separately') relative to drugs in all other disease areas. Literature reviews and internet searches were undertaken to identify, collect and analyze relevant documents that would provide information regarding whether an economic rationale has been provided for cancer drugs to be treated separately for resource allocation purposes. Although a number of reasons for cancer drugs to be treated separately were cited both by the JODR and pCODR and in the peer-reviewed literature, a rationale derived from an economic perspective did not appear to be documented. From an economic perspective, separating cancer drugs for resource allocation purposes is likely to impede drug plan decision makers' ability to allocate resources in a manner that maximizes the total aggregate health benefit for the population from available resources. While we acknowledge the challenges that cancer drugs pose to drug reimbursement decision makers, we suggest that separating the reimbursement review of cancer drugs requires further scrutiny.","[McDonald, Heather] McMaster Univ, Hlth Res Methodol HRM Program, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Charles, Cathy; Gafni, Amiram] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Anal, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Elit, Laurie] McMaster Univ, Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Obstet & Gynecol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University; McMaster University,"McDonald, H (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Hlth Res Methodol HRM Program, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",heatherpauline@me.com; charlesc@mcmaster.ca; laurie.elit@jcc.hhsc.ca; gafni@mcmaster.ca,"Elit, Lorraine/AGR-8830-2022",,,,,,18,10,11,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2015,33.0,3,,,,,235,241,,10.1007/s40273-014-0238-7,0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CC6NB,25424496.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350480700005,0

All restrictions imposed on the preferences are satisfied in the case of approximate optimization of a bounded-above utility function. In the context of the choice of a single agent, the transitivity of strict preferences ensures that the best response correspondence is increasing in the sense of a natural preorder; if the preferences are represented by an interval order, there is an increasing selection from the best response correspondence. In a strategic game, a Nash equilibrium exists and can be reached from any strategy profile after a finite number of best response improvements if all strategy sets are chains, the single crossing conditions hold w.r.t. pairs (one player's strategy, a profile of other players' strategies), and the strict preference relations are transitive. If, additionally, there are just two players, every best response improvement path reaches a Nash equilibrium after a finite number of steps. If each player is only affected by a linear combination of the strategies of others, the single crossing conditions hold w.r.t. pairs (one player's strategy, an aggregate of the strategies of others), and the preference relations are interval orders, then a Nash equilibrium exists and can be reached from any strategy profile with a finite best response path.","Russian Acad Sci, Dorodnicyn Comp Ctr, Moscow 119333, Russia","Federal Research Center Computer Science & Control of RAS; Russian Academy of Sciences; Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre, RAS","Kukushkin, NS (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Dorodnicyn Comp Ctr, 40 Vavilova, Moscow 119333, Russia.",ququns@inbox.ru,,"Kukushkin, Nikolai/0000-0001-9200-7901","Russian Foundation for Basic Research [11-07-00162, 14-07-00075]",Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"Financial support from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (projects 11-07-00162 and 14-07-00075) is acknowledged.

Both types of manager show negative stock-picking skills, correct size and book-to-market style-timing skills, and an absence of ability to time the market as a whole and the momentum style. Other notable findings are that the size of the fund does not affect the style-timing abilities of both conventional and SR mutual fund managers. In terms of the age of the fund, we observe that the results obtained for conventional funds are driven by older funds, while younger funds, both conventional and SR mutual funds, show perverse market-timing skills.

We show that the optimal contract not only insures large losses above a deductible but also insures small losses fully. This is consistent, for instance, with the demand for warranties.

In contrast to previous work, we focus on the effectiveness of management decisions regarding the product mix and the riskiness of the asset side under different surplus appropriation schemes. We propose a model setting that comprises temporary life annuities and endowment insurance contracts. Our numerical results show that the effectiveness of management decisions in regard to risk reduction strongly depends on the surplus appropriation scheme offered to the customer and their impact on guaranteed benefit payments, which thus presents an important control variable for the insurer.

It is said to have applications to companies with economical activities involved in research and development. This model is dual to the well-known Cramer-Lundberg risk model with applications to insurance. Most existing results on the study of the dual model assume that the random waiting times between consecutive gains follow an exponential distribution, as in the classical Cramer-Lundberg risk model. We generalize to other compound renewal risk models where such waiting times are Erlang(n) distributed. Using the roots of the fundamental and the generalized Lundberg's equations, we get expressions for the ruin probability and the Laplace transform of the time of ruin for an arbitrary single gain distribution. Furthermore, we compute expected discounted dividends, as well as higher moments, when the individual common gains follow a Phase-Type, PH(m), distribution. We also perform illustrations working some examples for some particular gain distributions and obtain numerical results.","[Rodriguez-Martinez, Eugenio V.; Egidio Dos Reis, Alfredo D.] Univ Lisbon, Dept Math, ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodriguez-Martinez, Eugenio V.; Egidio Dos Reis, Alfredo D.] Univ Lisbon, Dept Math, CEMAPRE, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cardoso, Rui M.

Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) contains only one of the two B-lineage strains, resulting in mismatches between vaccine strains and the predominant circulating B lineage. Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) includes both B-lineage strains. The objective was to estimate the cost-utility of introducing QIV to replace TIV in Germany. An individual-based dynamic transmission model (4Flu) using German data was used to provide realistic estimates of the impact of TIV and QIV on age-specific influenza infections. Cases were linked to health and economic outcomes to calculate the cost-utility of QIV versus TIV, from both a societal and payer perspective. Costs and effects were discounted at 3.0 and 1.5 % respectively, with 2014 as the base year. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Using QIV instead of TIV resulted in additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost savings from the societal perspective (i.e. it represents the dominant strategy) and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of a,not sign14,461 per QALY from a healthcare payer perspective. In all univariate analyses, QIV remained cost-effective (ICUR < a,not sign50,000). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, QIV was cost-effective in > 98 and > 99 % of the simulations from the societal and payer perspective, respectively. This analysis suggests that QIV in Germany would provide additional health gains while being cost-saving to society or costing a,not sign14,461 per QALY gained from the healthcare payer perspective, compared with TIV.","[Dolk, Christiaan; Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [Eichner, Martin] Epimos GmbH, Uhlandstr 3, D-72144 Dusslingen, Germany; [Eichner, Martin] Univ Tubingen, Clin Epidemiol & Appl Biometry, Silcherstr 5, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Welte, Robert; Anastassopoulou, Anastassia] GSK Germany, Prinzregentenpl 9, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Van Bellinghen, Laure-Anne; Van Vlaenderen, Ilse; Schmidt-Ott, Ruprecht] CHESS, Zwarte Leeuwstraat 69, B-2820 Bonheiden, Belgium; [Nautrup, Barbara Poulsen] EAH Consulting, Karlsgraben 12, D-52064 Aachen, Germany; [Schmidt-Ott, Ruprecht] GSK Vaccines, Ave Fleming 20, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium; [Schwehm, Markus] ExploSYS GmbH, Otto Hahn Weg 6, D-70771 Leinfelden Echterdingen, Germany; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Healthy Aging & healthcaRE SHARE, Hanzeplein 1, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Hanzeplein 1, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Dolk, C (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands.",christiaandolk@gmail.com,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Dolk, Christiaan/0000-0001-7191-115X",GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA [HO-14-14994],GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA(GlaxoSmithKline),"GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA funded this study (GSK Study Identifier: HO-14-14994) and was involved in all stages of the study, including analysis of the data.

This systematic review aims to provide a critical summary of EEs of PCVs and identify key drivers of EE findings in LMICs. We searched Scopus, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central from their inception to 30 September 2015 and limited the search to LMICs. The search was undertaken using the search strings 'pneumococc* AND conjugat* AND (vaccin* OR immun*)' AND 'economic OR cost-effectiveness OR cost-benefit OR cost-utility OR cost-effectiveness OR cost-benefit OR cost-utility' in the abstract, title or keyword fields. To be included, each study had to be a full EE of a PCV and conducted for an LMIC. Studies were extracted and reviewed by two authors. The review involved standard extraction of the study overview or the characteristics of the study, key drivers or parameters of the EE, assumptions behind the analyses and major areas of uncertainty. Out of 134 records identified, 22 articles were included. Seven studies used a Markov model for analysis, while 15 studies used a decision-tree analytic model. Eighteen studies performed a cost-utility analysis (CUA), with disability-adjusted life-years, quality-adjusted life-years or life-years gained as a measure of health outcome, while four studies focused only on cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Both CEA and CUA findings were provided by eight studies. Herd effects and serotype replacement were considered in 10 and 13 studies, respectively. The current evidence shows that both the 10-valent and 13-valent PCVs are probably cost effective in comparison with the 7-valent PCV or no vaccination. The most influential parameters were vaccine efficacy and coverage (in 16 of 22 studies), vaccine price (in 13 of 22 studies), disease incidence (in 11 of 22 studies), mortality from IPD and pneumonia (in 8 of 22 studies) and herd effects (in 4 of 22 studies). The findings were found to be supportive of the products owned by the manufacturers. Our review demonstrated that an infant PCV programme was a cost-effective intervention in most LMICs (in 20 of 22 studies included). The results were sensitive to vaccine efficacy, price, burden of disease and sponsorship. Decision makers should consider EE findings and affordability before adoption of PCVs.","[Saokaew, Surasak] Univ Phayao, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res & Therapeut Safety COHORTS, Phayao, Thailand; [Saokaew, Surasak; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, CPOR, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Saokaew, Surasak; Rayanakorn, Ajaree; Wu, David Bin-Chia; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, 46150 Bandar Sunway, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, 425 N Charter St, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Phayao; Naresuan University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; University of Queensland; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, CPOR, Phitsanulok, Thailand.;Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, 46150 Bandar Sunway, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.;Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, 425 N Charter St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nathorn.chaiyakunapruk@monash.edu,"Wu, David Bin-Chia/H-3267-2019; Saokaew, Surasak/AAI-9804-2021","Saokaew, Surasak/0000-0002-1382-0660; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn/0000-0003-4572-8794; Rayanakorn, Ajaree/0000-0002-5961-8978",,,,,61,35,43,0,27,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2016,34.0,12,,,,,1211,1225,,10.1007/s40273-016-0439-3,0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EC4ZK,27510721.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388142700002,0

Apparently, the withdrawal and investment policy depends substantially on the retiree's health condition and her time preferences (subjective discount factor). We assume that the health of the retiree can worsen or improve in an unpredictable way over her lifetime and model the retiree's mortality intensity by a stochastic process. In order to make the decision about the consumption and investment policy more realistic, we assume that the retiree applies a non-exponential discount factor (an exponential discount factor with a small amount of hyperbolic discounting) to value her future income. In other words, we consider an optimization problem by combining four important aspects: asset allocation, sustainable withdrawal, longevity risk and non-exponential discounting. Due to the non-exponential discount factor, we have to solve a time-inconsistent optimization problem. We derive a non-local HJB equation which characterizes the equilibrium optimal investment and consumption strategy. We establish the first-order expansions of the equilibrium value function and the equilibrium strategies by applying expansion techniques. The expansion is performed on the parameter controlling the degree of discounting in the hyperbolic discounting that is added to the exponential discount factors. The first-order equilibrium investment and consumption strategies can be calculated in a feasible way by solving PDEs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The tests based on the two statistics are extensions to the cross-sectional dependence test and the bias-adjusted Lagrange multiplier test. Unlike the two existing tests that are justified under sequential limits, the newly developed tests can be justified under simultaneous limits without any additional restriction imposed on the cross-sectional and time-series dimensions. Moreover, it is proved that the new tests can even be justified under high dimension, low sample size limits, provided that a homo-rank condition holds. Several simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the newly introduced tests. The simulation results show that use of the tests can bring significant improvement, especially in cases of large cross-sectional dimension and small time-series dimension.","[Mao, Guangyu] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 3 Shuangyuancun, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Mao, GY (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 3 Shuangyuancun, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",gymao@bjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71601016]; Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [16YJC790074],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China,"The author is grateful to Liangjun Su, Arthur Lewbel, Yundong Tu and the anonymous referees for providing valuable comments and suggestions.

It is important to understand the methods used in the existing models of AD and how they could impact results, as they could inform new model-based economic evaluations of treatments for AD. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to provide a detailed description on the relevant aspects and components of existing decision-analytic models of AD, identifying areas for improvement and future development, and to conduct a quality assessment of the included studies. Methods We performed a systematic and comprehensive review of cost-effectiveness studies of pharmacological treatments for AD published in the last decade (January 2005 to February 2015) that used decision-analytic models, also including studies considering patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The background information of the included studies and specific information on the decision-analytic models, including their approach and components, assumptions, data sources, analyses, and results, were obtained from each study. A description of how the modeling approaches and assumptions differ across studies, identifying areas for improvement and future development, is provided. At the end, we present our own view of the potential future directions of decision-analytic models of AD and the challenges they might face. Results The included studies present a variety of different approaches, assumptions, and scope of decision-analytic models used in the economic evaluation of pharmacological treatments of AD. The major areas for improvement in future models of AD are to include domains of cognition, function, and behavior, rather than cognition alone; include a detailed description of how data used to model the natural course of disease progression were derived; state and justify the economic model selected and structural assumptions and limitations; provide a detailed (rather than high-level) description of the cost components included in the model; and report on the face-, internal-, and cross-validity of the model to strengthen the credibility and confidence in model results. The quality scores of most studies were rated as fair to good (average 87.5, range 69.5-100, in a scale of 0-100). Conclusion Despite the advancements in decision-analytic models of AD, there remain several areas of improvement that are necessary to more appropriately and realistically capture the broad nature of AD and the potential benefits of treatments in future models of AD.","[Hernandez, Luis; Getsios, Denis] Evidera, 430 Bedford St 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Ozen, Asli; DosSantos, Rodrigo] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA",Evidera; Evidera,"Hernandez, L (通讯作者)，Evidera, 430 Bedford St 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",luis.hernandez@evidera.com,"Hernandez, Luis/AAH-1819-2021","Hernandez, Luis/0000-0002-9532-546X",Evidera,Evidera,This study was fully sponsored by Evidera.,,63,13,14,1,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2016,34.0,7,,,,,681,707,,10.1007/s40273-016-0392-1,0,,,27,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DO7CT,26899832.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377940500008,0

This quantile optimization problem is known as the quantile formulation of the original investment problem. Under certain monotonicity assumptions, several schemes to solve such quantile optimization problems have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a change-of-variable and relaxation method to solve the quantile optimization problems without using the calculus of variations or making any monotonicity assumptions. The method is demonstrated through a portfolio choice problem under rank-dependent utility theory (RDUT). We show that this problem is equivalent to a classical Merton's portfolio choice problem under expected utility theory with the same utility function but a different pricing kernel explicitly determined by the given pricing kernel and probability weighting function. With this result, the feasibility, well-posedness, attainability, and uniqueness issues for the portfolio choice problem under RDUT are solved. It is also shown that solving functional optimization problems may reduce to solving probabilistic optimization problems. The method is applicable to general models with law-invariant preference measures including portfolio choice models under cumulative prospect theory (CPT) or RDUT, Yaari's dual model, Lopes' SP/A model, and optimal stopping models under CPT or RDUT.","[Xu, Zuo Quan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Xu, ZQ (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maxu@polyu.edu.hk,"Xu, Zuo Quan/E-6896-2012","Xu, Zuo Quan/0000-0001-6824-1634",Hong Kong General Research Fund [529711]; Hong Kong Early Career Scheme [533112]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Hong Kong General Research Fund; Hong Kong Early Career Scheme; Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"The author acknowledges financial supports from Hong Kong General Research Fund (No. 529711), Hong Kong Early Career Scheme (No. 533112), and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

With unconditional heteroskedasticity, the ordinary least squares (OLS) t statistic is affected in the unit root case; but the paper shows that, by using some nonlinear transformation behaving asymptotically like the sign as instrument, limiting normality of the IV t-type statistic is maintained when the series to be tested has no deterministic trends. Neither estimation of the so-called variance profile nor bootstrap procedures are required to this end. The Cauchy unit root test has power in the same 1/T neighborhoods as the usual unit root tests, also for a wide range of magnitudes for the initial value. It is furthermore shown to be competitive with other, bootstrap-based, robust tests. When the series exhibit a linear trend, however, the null distribution of the Cauchy test for a unit root becomes nonstandard, reminiscent of the Dickey-Fuller distribution. In this case, inference robust to nonstationary volatility is obtained via the wild bootstrap.","[Demetrescu, Matei] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Hanck, Christoph] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Essen, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Duisburg Essen,"Demetrescu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",mdeme@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Demetrescu, Matei/ABD-6488-2021","Demetrescu, Matei/0000-0003-0815-5384","German Research Foundation (DFG) [DE 1617/4-1, HA 6766/2-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"An early version of this paper was previously circulated as Section 2 of Unit Root Testing in Heteroskedastic Panels using the Cauchy Estimator.

We also consider the extension of the result when both players have private information.","[Forges, Francoise] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris, France; [Forges, Francoise; Salomon, Antoine] Univ Paris 09, PSL, LEDa, Paris, France; [Horst, Ulrich] Humboldt Univ, Dept Math, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Forges, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris, France.;Forges, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, PSL, LEDa, Paris, France.",francoise.forges@gmail.com; horst@math.hu-berlin.de; antoine.salomon@dauphine.fr,,,Institut Universitaire de France; [SFB 649],Institut Universitaire de France;,"We are grateful to Gorkem Celik, Marie Laclau, Antoine Loeper, Jero me Renault, Rann Smorodinsky, Bernhard von Stengel, Roland Strausz, an anonymous referee and seminar participants at Vanderbilt University for useful comments.

These games arise in various competitive allocation setups (e.g., contests, research and development races, political campaigns, Colonel Blotto games). A Captain Lotto game is a Lotto game with caps, which are upper bounds on the numbers that may be chosen. First, we solve the Captain Lotto games. Second, we show how to reduce all-pay auctions to simpler games-expenditure games-using the solution of the corresponding Lotto games. As a particular application we solve all-pay auctions with unequal caps, which may yield a significant increase in the seller's revenue (or, the players' efforts).","[Hart, Sergiu] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, Einstein Inst Math, Feldman Bldg, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Hart, S (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, Einstein Inst Math, Feldman Bldg, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel.",hart@huji.ac.il,"Hart, Sergiu/B-4724-2008","Hart, Sergiu/0000-0001-8851-6009",European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Previous versions: January 2013, December 2013, November 2014 (Federmann Center for the Study of Rationality DP-670).

To protect the rights of a plan member who dies before retirement, a clause on the return of premiums for the plan member is adopted. We assume that the manager of the pension plan is allowed to invest the premiums in a financial market, which consists of one risk-free asset and one risky asset whose price process is modeled by a jump-diffusion process. The precommitment strategy and the corresponding value function are obtained using the stochastic dynamic programming approach. Under the framework of game theory and the assumption that the manager's risk aversion coefficient depends on the current wealth, the equilibrium strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function are also derived. Our results show that with the same level of variance in the terminal wealth, the expected optimal terminal wealth under the precommitment strategy is greater than that under the equilibrium strategy with a constant risk aversion coefficient; the equilibrium strategy with a constant risk aversion coefficient is revealed to be different from that with a state-dependent risk aversion coefficient; and our results can also be degenerated to the results of He and Liang (2013b) and Bjork et al. (2014). Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our derived results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We consider test statistics formed using nonparametric covariance matrix estimators that account for heteroskedasticity and spatial correlation (spatial HAC). We provide distributions of commonly used test statistics under fixed-b asymptotics, in which HAC smoothing parameters are proportional to the sample size. Under this sequence, spatial HAC estimators are not consistent but converge to nondegenerate limiting random variables that depend on the HAC smoothing parameters, the HAC kernel, and the shape of the spatial region in which the data are located. We illustrate the performance of the fixed-b approximation in the spatial context through a simulation example.","[Bester, C.

We introduce a new renormalization of the strike variable with the property that the implied volatility converges to a nonconstant limiting shape, which is a function of both the diffusion component of the process and the jump activity (Blumenthal-Getoor) index of the jump component. Our limiting implied volatility formula relates the jump activity of the underlying asset price process to the short-end of the implied volatility surface and sheds new light on the difference between finite and infinite variation jumps from the viewpoint of option prices: in the latter, the wings of the limiting smile are determined by the jump activity indices of the positive and negative jumps, whereas in the former, the wings have a constant model-independent slope. This result gives a theoretical justification for the preference of the infinite variation Levy models over the finite variation ones in the calibration based on short-maturity option prices.","[Mijatovic, Aleksandar] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Tankov, Peter] Univ Paris Diderot, LPMA, Paris, France",Imperial College London; Universite Paris Cite,"Tankov, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 07, LPMA, Case 7012, F-75205 Paris, France.",tankov@math.univ-paris-diderot.fr,,"Mijatovic, Aleksandar/0000-0003-0531-3551",,,,,26,28,30,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Prior studies have called for standardization in COI methods. We investigated trends, identified factors associated with variation in COI estimation methods, and characterized reporting of heterogeneity in COI estimates. The review of COI studies was implemented following (i) a structured search of PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE; (ii) a review of abstracts; (iii) a full-text review; and (iv) classification of articles according to six COI estimation methods: Sum_All Medical, Sum_Diagnosis Specific, Matched, Regression, Other_Total and Other_Incremental. Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Of the 993 studies included in the full-text review, 186 (18.7 %) were Sum_All Medical, 458 (46.1 %) were Sum_Diagnosis Specific, 96 (9.7 %) were Matched, 97 (9.8 %) were Regression, 70 (7.1 %) were Other_Incremental, and 68 (6.9 %) were Other_Total. Compared with the early period, publications in the middle and late period were associated with lower odds of using Sum_All Medical compared with Sum_Diagnosis Specific (adjusted odds ratio [AOR](middle) 0.14; 95 % CI 0.07-0.28; AOR(late) 0.44; 95 % CI 0.29-0.67). Overall, 640 articles (64 %) reported COI estimates across patient groups defined by patient-level factors, while 247 articles (25 %) reported COI estimates across patient groups defined by non-patient-level factors. The disease-specific total costing method (Sum_Diagnosis Specific) was most commonly used and its use increased over the time period covered by this review. The investigation of subgroup heterogeneity in COI estimates represents an area for future research.","[Onukwugha, Eberechukwu; Kravetz, Alex; Khairnar, Rahul; Mullins, C.

In the known-variance case, we provide an exact analysis of the coverage properties of such intervals in finite samples. We show that these intervals are always larger than the standard interval based on the least-squares estimator. Asymptotically, the intervals based on the thresholding estimators are larger even by an order of magnitude when the estimators are tuned to perform consistent variable selection. For the unknown-variance case, we provide nontrivial lower bounds and a small numerical study for the coverage probabilities in finite samples.

We demonstrate that both the conditional mean and conditional variance functions in a nonparametric regression model can be estimated adaptively based on the local profile likelihood principle. Both the one-step Newton-Raphson estimator and the local profile likelihood estimator are investigated. We show that the proposed estimators are asymptotically equivalent to the infeasible local likelihood estimators [e.g., Aerts and Claeskens (1997) Journal of the American Statistical Association 92, 1536-1545], which require knowledge of the error distribution. Simulation evidence suggests that when the distribution of the error term is different from Gaussian, the adaptive estimators of both conditional mean and variance can often achieve significant efficiency over the conventional local polynomial estimators.","[Jin, Sainan; Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Xiao, Zhijie] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Singapore Management University; Boston College,"Jin, SN (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",snjin@smu.edu.sg,"SU, Liangjun/D-1445-2009","Su, Liangjun/0000-0002-0565-6928",SMU research grant [09-C244-SMU-011]; Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund [MOE2012-T2-2-021]; Boston College,"SMU research grant; Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Boston College","We would like to thank Oliver Linton, Wolfgang Hardle, Peter Phillips, and two referees for helpful comments on early versions of the paper.

Literature suggests that this value may depend on the equity context in which health gains are produced, but the value of a QALY in relation to equity considerations has remained largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to estimate the social marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for QALY gains in different equity subgroups, using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Both severity of illness (operationalized as proportional shortfall) and fair innings (operationalized as age) were considered as grounds for differentiating the value of health gains. We obtained a sample of 1205 respondents, representative of the adult population of the Netherlands. The data was analysed using panel mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) and latent class models. The panel MMNL models showed counterintuitive results, with more severe health states reducing the probability of receiving treatment. The latent class models revealed distinct preference patterns in the data. MWTP per QALY was sensitive to severity of disease among a substantial proportion of the public, but not to the age of care recipients. These findings emphasize the importance of accounting for preference heterogeneity among the public on value-laden issues such as prioritizing health care, both in research and decision making. This study emphasises the need to further explore the monetary value of a QALY in relation to equity considerations.","[van de Wetering, Liesbet; van Exel, Job; Bobinac, Ana; Brouwer, Werner B.

It is carried out under the framework of a structural default model in which the asset-value process is of infinite activity but finite variation. The recovery rate is assumed to depend on the undershoot of the asset value below the default threshold when default occurs. The key part is to evaluate a generalized expected discounted penalty function, which is a special case of the so-called Gerber-Shiu function in actuarial ruin theory. We first obtain its double Laplace transform in time and in spatial variable, and then implement a numerical Fourier inversion integration.

The resulting risk model may be viewed as a first step in developing models with more realistic claim investigation mechanisms. Related to claim investigations, claim settlement delays and time dependent payments have been studied in a ruin context by, e.g. Taylor (1979), Cai and Dickson (2002), and Trufin et al. (2011). However, little has been done on queue-based investigation mechanisms. We first demonstrate the impact of a particular claim investigation system on some common ruin-related quantities when claims arrive according to a compound Poisson process, and investigation times are of a combination of exponential form. Probabilistic interpretations for the defective renewal equation components are also provided. Finally, via numerical examples, we explore various risk management questions related to this problem such as how claim investigation strategies can help an insurer control its activities within its risk appetite.

Pooling HSUVs is problematic because of the fact that different valuation methods and different preference-based measures (PBMs) can generate different values on exactly the same clinical health state. Existing meta-analyses of HSUVs are characterised by high levels of heterogeneity, and meta-regressions have identified significant (and substantial) impacts arising from the elicitation method used. The use of meta-regression with few utility values and inclusion criteria that extend beyond the required utility value has not helped. There is the potential to explore greater use of mapping between different PBMs and valuation methods prior to data synthesis, which could support greater use of pooling values. Researchers wishing to populate decision-analytic models have a responsibility to incorporate all high-quality evidence available. In relation to HSUVs, greater understanding of the differences between different methods and greater consistency of methodology is required before this can be achieved.","[Peasgood, Tessa; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Peasgood, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court,Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",T.Peasgood@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Peasgood, Tessa/0000-0001-8024-7801; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,34,34,34,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2015,33.0,11,,,,,1101,1105,,10.1007/s40273-015-0310-y,0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CT8LF,26133293.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363067200001,0

Using smooth wavelets and maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform, we allow for the decomposition of the realized variance into several investment horizons and jumps. Basing our estimator in the two-scale realized variance framework, we are able to utilize all available data and obtain a feasible estimator in the presence of microstructure noise as well. The estimator is tested in a large numerical study of the finite sample performance and is compared to other popular realized variation estimators. We use different simulation settings with changing noise as well as jump level in different price processes including the long memory fractional stochastic volatility model. The results reveal that our wavelet-based estimator is able to estimate and forecast the realized measures with the greatest precision. Our time-frequency estimators not only produce feasible estimates, but also decompose the realized variation into arbitrarily chosen investment horizons. We apply them to study the volatility of forex futures during the recent crisis at several investment horizons and obtain results which provide us with better understanding of the volatility dynamics.","[Barunik, Jozef; Vacha, Lukas] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Barunik, Jozef; Vacha, Lukas] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague 18200, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Barunik, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 21, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",barunik@fsv.cuni.cz,"Vacha, Lukas/G-6896-2014; Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014","Vacha, Lukas/0000-0002-4032-3096; Barunik, Jozef/0000-0001-5097-2607","Czech Science Foundation [13-32263S, 13-24313S]; European Union [FP7-SSH-612955]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Union(European Union (EU)),The support from the Czech Science Foundation under the [13-32263S] and [13-24313S] projects is gratefully acknowledged.

Assuming that the number of factors used in estimation is larger than the true number of factors in the data, we establish the limiting distribution of the LS estimator for the regression coefficients as the number of time periods and the number of cross-sectional units jointly go to infinity. The main result of the paper is that under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution of the LS estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the estimation as long as this number is not underestimated. The important practical implication of this result is that for inference on the regression coefficients, one does not necessarily need to estimate the number of interactive fixed effects consistently.","[Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Univ So Calif, USC Dornsife INET, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Weidner, Martin] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Weidner, Martin] CeMMaP, London, England",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; Yonsei University; University of London; University College London,"Moon, HR (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",moonr@usc.edu; m.weidner@ucl.ac.uk,,"Weidner, Martin/0000-0001-6135-6164",NSF [SES-0920903]; USC; Economic and Social Research Council through ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice [RES-589-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USC; Economic and Social Research Council through ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the participants of the 2009 Cowles Summer Conference Handling Dependence: Temporal, Cross-Sectional, and Spatial at Yale University, the 2012 North American Summer Meeting of the Econometric Society at Northwestern University, the 18th International Conference on Panel Data at the Banque de France, the 2013 North American Winter Meeting of the Econometric Society in San Diego, the 2014 Asia Meeting of Econometric Society in Taipei, the 2014 Econometric Study Group Conference in Bristol, and the econometrics seminars at USC and Toulouse for many interesting comments, and we thank Dukpa Kim, Tatsushi Oka, and Alexei Onatski for helpful discussions.

While many studies have reported on the cost-effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors for treating type 2 diabetes, a systematic review of economic evaluations of DPP-4 inhibitors is currently lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the cost effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors for patients with type 2 diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Web of Science, EconLit databases, and the Cochrane Library were searched in November 2013. Studies assessing the cost effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes were eligible for analysis. DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy or combinations with other antidiabetic agents were included in the review. The DPP-4 inhibitors were all marketed drugs. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles sequentially to select studies for data abstraction based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The quality of included studies was assessed according to the 24-item checklist of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement. The costs reported by the included studies were converted to US dollars via purchasing power parities (PPP) in the year 2013 using the CCEMG-EPPI-Center Cost Converter. A total of 11 published studies were selected for inclusion; all were cost-utility analyses. Nine studies were conducted from a payer perspective and one used a societal perspective; however, the perspective of the other study was unclear. Four studies were of good quality, six were of moderate quality, and one was of low quality. Of the seven studies comparing DPP-4 inhibitors plus metformin with sulfonylureas plus metformin, six concluded that DPP-4 inhibitors were cost effective in patients with type 2 diabetes who were no longer adequately controlled by metformin monotherapy. Five studies compared DPP-4 inhibitors with thiazolidinediones, and whether DPP-4 inhibitors were cost effective was uncertain. Only two economic evaluations provided data to compare DPP-4 inhibitors versus insulin, and the results favored the use of DPP-4 inhibitors as second-line therapy. Synthesis of the data was impossible because of heterogeneity in the methodology and data sources of the economic evaluations, and the inclusion criteria excluded conference abstracts. It was difficult to find reliable weightings for each of the items of the CHEERS checklist, and the ratings were dichotomous. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of DPP-4 inhibitors for patients with type 2 diabetes. It found that, in patients with type 2 diabetes who do not achieve glycemic targets with antidiabetic monotherapy, DPP-4 inhibitors as add-on treatment may represent a cost-effective option compared with sulfonylureas and insulin. However, high-quality cost-effectiveness analyses that utilize long-term follow-up data and have no conflicts of interest are still needed.","[Geng, Jinsong; Mao, Yiwei; Zhang, Peng; Chen, Yingyao] Fudan Univ, Natl Key Lab Hlth Technol Assessment, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Social Risks Governance Hl, Minist Hlth,Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hao] RAND Corp, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Fudan University; RAND Corporation,"Chen, YY (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Natl Key Lab Hlth Technol Assessment, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Social Risks Governance Hl, Minist Hlth,Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",yychen@shmu.edu.cn,"geng, jinsong/DKQ-0885-2022","Geng, Jinsong/0000-0003-3389-9051","Bristol-Myers Squibb (Shanghai, China); China Medical Board [11-067]; Shanghai Public Health 3-Year Program [GWDTR 201205, GWHW 2012S10]","Bristol-Myers Squibb (Shanghai, China)(Bristol-Myers Squibb); China Medical Board; Shanghai Public Health 3-Year Program","The evidence synthesis upon which this article was based was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Shanghai, China) for Jinsong Geng, Yiwei Mao, Peng Zhang, and Yingyao Chen.

These modeling issues are manifest in all applied work but they are particularly acute in multivariate time series settings such as cointegrated systems where multiple interconnected decisions can materially affect the form of the model and its interpretation. In cointegrated system modeling, empirical estimation typically proceeds in a stepwise manner that involves the determination of cointegrating rank and autoregressive lag order in a reduced rank vector autoregression followed by estimation and inference. This paper proposes an automated approach to cointegrated system modeling that uses adaptive shrinkage techniques to estimate vector error correction models with unknown cointegrating rank structure and unknown transient lag dynamic order. These methods enable simultaneous order estimation of the cointegrating rank and autoregressive order in conjunction with oracle-like efficient estimation of the cointegrating matrix and transient dynamics. As such they offer considerable advantages to the practitioner as an automated approach to the estimation of cointegrated systems. The paper develops the new methods, derives their limit theory, discusses implementation, reports simulations, and presents an empirical illustration with macroeconomic aggregates.","[Liao, Zhipeng] UC Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Phillips, Peter C.

We show that in such a model, (0) and m() can be exactly identified while sigma() can be identified up to scale as long as sigma(X,Z) permits sufficient nonlinearity in X. A two-stage estimation procedure motivated by the identification strategy is described and its large sample properties are formally established. Moreover, our strategy is flexible enough to allow for both fixed and random censoring in the dependent variable.

(2000). The idea is to replace the asymptotic covariance matrix in conventional M tests with an alternative normalization matrix, constructed using moment functions estimated from (K + 1) recursive subsamples. The new tests are simple to implement. They automatically account for the effect of parameter estimation and allow for conditional heteroskedasticity and serial correlation of general forms. They converge to central F distributions under the fixed-K asymptotics and to chi-square distributions if K is allowed to approach infinity. We illustrate their applications using three simulation examples: (1) specification testing for conditional heteroskedastic models, (2) non-nested testing with serially correlated errors, and (3) testing for serial correlation with unknown heteroskedasticity. The results show that the new tests exhibit good size properties with power often comparable to the conventional M tests while being substantially higher than that of Kuan and Lee (2006).","[Chen, Yi-Ting] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Qu, Zhongjun] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Boston University,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",qu@bu.edu,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

A brief summary of his 1944 monograph is followed by an analysis of the six important papers he contributed during 1943-47. Four of them were devoted to macroeconomic models including estimation of the Keynesian marginal propensity to consume; the first two introduced the methodology of a system of structural equations; the third marked a milestone in econometric method by deriving the reduced form of such a system; and the fourth analyzed the contrast between time-series and cross-section analysis. The fifth (joint with M.A. Girshick) on the demand for food provided a definitive treatment of estimation of demand and supply functions; it carried out the execution of a five-equation structural model of the U.S. economy. The sixth was an interesting policy model of the interrelationship between the agricultural and the rural sector of the economy, which was fitted to U.S. data and addressed to questions of policy.","Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Chipman, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jchipman@umn.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

In this paper, we solve this inference problem by showing the novel result that a bootstrap test where the null hypothesis is imposed on the bootstrap sample is asymptotically valid. That is, not only does it have asymptotically correct size, but, in contrast to what is claimed in existing literature, it is consistent under the alternative. Compared to the theory for bootstrap tests on the co-integration rank (Cavaliere, Rahbek, and Taylor, 2012), establishing the validity of the bootstrap in the framework of hypotheses on the co-integrating vectors requires new theoretical developments, including the introduction of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with random (reduced rank) drift parameters. Finally, as documented by Monte Carlo simulations, the bootstrap test outperforms existing methods.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Cavaliere, Giuseppe; Nielsen, Heino Bohn; Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Bologna; University of Copenhagen,"Cavaliere, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",giuseppe.cavaliere@unibo.it; heino.bohn.nielsen@econ.ku.dk; anders.rahbek@econ.ku.dk,"; CAVALIERE, GIUSEPPE/O-7592-2015","Rahbek, Anders/0000-0002-2549-1913; Nielsen, Heino Bohn/0000-0001-8516-161X; CAVALIERE, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-2856-0005",Danish National Research Foundation [12-124980],Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We thank the co-editor and three anonymous referees for their very helpful and constructive comments on a previous version of this paper.

Vigilance is satisfied by a large class of risk measures, including all distortion risk measures and some classes of robust risk measures. As an illustration, we consider a problem of optimal insurance design where the premium principle satisfies the vigilance property, hence covering a large collection of commonly used premium principles, including premium principles that are not law-invariant.

(Theor Econ 8:165-192, 2013). An example demonstrates that this correspondence can be very different from the standard best-response correspondence. In two-player games, however, the refined best-response correspondence of a given game is the same as the best-response correspondence of a slightly modified game. The modified game is derived from the original game by reducing the payoff by a small amount for all pure strategies that are weakly inferior. Weakly inferior strategies, for two-player games, are pure strategies that are either weakly dominated or are equivalent to a proper mixture of pure strategies. Fixed points of the refined best-response correspondence are not equivalent to any known Nash equilibrium refinement. A class of simple communication games demonstrates the usefulness and intuitive appeal of the refined best-response correspondence.","[Balkenborg, Dieter] Univ Exeter, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hofbauer, Josef] Univ Vienna, Dept Math, Vienna, Austria; [Kuzmics, Christoph] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Exeter; University of Vienna; University of Bielefeld,"Kuzmics, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",d.g.balkenborg@exeter.ac.uk; josef.hofbauer@univie.ac.at; ckuzmics@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Kuzmics, Christoph/0000-0003-2732-2838",,,,,36,6,6,1,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Clinicopathological parameters and molecular tests such as EndoPredict((R)) (EPclin) can support decision making in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative cancer. Objective Using a life-long Markov state transition model, we determined the health economic impact and incremental cost effectiveness of EPclin-based risk stratification in combination with clinical guidelines [German-S3, National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network (NCCN), and St. Gallen] to decide on chemotherapy use. Methods Information on overall and metastasis-free survival came from Austrian Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group clinical trials 6/8 (n = 1,619) and published literature. Effectiveness was assessed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs (2010) were assessed from a German third-party payer perspective. Results Lifetime costs per patient ranged from a,not sign28,268 (St.Gallen and EPclin) to a,not sign33,756 (NCCN). Due to an imperfect prognostic value and differences in chemotherapy use, strategies achieved between 13.165 QALYs (NCCN) and 13.173 QALYs (EPclin alone) per patient. Using German-S3 as reference, three strategies showed dominant results (St. Gallen and EPclin, German-S3 and EPclin, EPclin alone). Compared to German-S3, the addition of EPclin saved a,not sign3,388 and gained 0.002 QALYs per patient. Combining guidelines with EPclin remained preferable in sensitivity analysis. Conclusion Our study suggests that molecular markers can be sensibly combined with clinical guidelines to determine the risk profile of adjuvant breast cancer patients. Compared with the current German best practice (German-S3), combinations of EPclin with the St. Gallen, German-S3 or NCCN guideline and EPclin alone were dominant from the perspective of the German healthcare system.","[Blank, Patricia R.; Gutzwiller, Florian; Szucs, Thomas D.; Schwenkglenks, Matthias] Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med ECPM, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Filipits, Martin] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Med 1, Vienna, Austria; [Dubsky, Peter; Gnant, Michael] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Surg, Vienna, Austria; [Lux, Michael P.] Univ Klinikum Erlangen, Frauenklin, Univ Brustzentrum Franken, Erlangen, Germany; [Brase, Jan C.; Weber, Karsten E.; Kronenwett, Ralf] Sividon Diagnost GmbH, Cologne, Germany; [Rudas, Margaretha] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Pathol, Vienna, Austria; [Greil, Richard] Paracelsus Univ Salzburg, Dept Med, Salzburg, Austria; [Loibl, Sibylle] German Breast Grp, Neu Isenburg, Germany",University of Basel; Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Medical University of Vienna; Paracelsus Private Medical University; German Breast Group,"Blank, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Inst Pharmaceut Med ECPM, Klingelbergstr 61, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",patricia.blank@unibas.ch,"Greil, Richard F/C-7673-2017; Gutzwiller, Florian S/B-1022-2011; Gnant, Michael/AAN-7054-2020","Gnant, Michael/0000-0003-1002-2118; Lux, Michael Patrick/0000-0002-2781-2178; Brase, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-1325-2528; Filipits, Martin/0000-0003-2847-4534; Blank, Patricia/0000-0002-0180-3468; Schwenkglenks, Matthias/0000-0001-7217-1173; Szucs, Thomas/0000-0003-0195-3316",European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [278659],European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 278659 and from Sividon Diagnostics GmbH, Cologne, Germany.",,53,14,16,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2015,33.0,2,,,,,179,190,,10.1007/s40273-014-0227-x,0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AZ7FJ,25404424.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348384300009,0

Rejection of attractive gambles is explained by loss aversion, while counterproductive risk seeking is attributed to limited level of reasoning. The current research highlights a shortcoming of this popular (but often implicit) contradicting biases assertion. Studies of negative-sum betting games reveal high rate of counterproductive betting even when limited level of reasoning and loss aversion imply no betting. The results reflect two reasons for the high betting rate: initial tendency to participate and slow learning. Under certain conditions, the observed betting rate was higher than the rate predicted under random choice even after 250 trials with immediate feedback. These results can be captured with a model that assumes a tendency to select strategies that have led to good outcomes in a small set of similar past experiences, and allows for an initial framing effect.","[Erev, Ido] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Gilat-Yihyie, Sharon] Western Galilee Coll, Dept Psychol, IL-24121 Akko, Israel; [Marchiori, Davide] Univ Southern Denmark, Strateg Org Design Unit, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Sonsino, Doron] Coll Management Acad Studies, Sch Business, IL-75190 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; University of Southern Denmark; College of Management Academic Studies,"Erev, I (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",erev@tx.technion.ac.il,"Sonsino, Doron/AFF-0052-2022; Gilat Yihyie, Sharon/AHD-9246-2022","Sonsino, Doron/0000-0002-0593-561X; Gilat Yihyie, Sharon/0000-0002-9034-4709; Erev, Ido/0000-0001-9889-4070; Marchiori, Davide/0000-0001-7914-5568",Israel Science Foundation,Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"This paper was supported by a grant from the Israel Science Foundation.

Using data on equity exchange traded funds, and models for both the returns and the volatility of the underlying assets, we compare the performance of the suggested models with the standard benchmarks of a buy-and-hold strategy and an equally weighted portfolio. The underlying intuition for the use of such a strategy rests with literature on sign and volatility predictability. The rotation strategy, as we apply it in this paper, is not risk-neutral and assumes the presence of arbitrage opportunities in the markets and short-term trends. Furthermore, the model specification uses the interplay between relative returns and relative volatilities in picking-up the asset with the highest return. Our results show that even a naive model that is based on a moving average of relative returns can outperform both benchmarks and that more elaborate specifications for the rotation model may yield additional performance gains. We also find that, in many cases, the rotation strategy yields statistically significant sign predictions of the relative returns and volatility. While our results are conditional on the data that we have used in our analysis they, nevertheless, support the market-timing literature and show that an active trading strategy can be based on the concept of rotation.","[Schizas, Panagiotis] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Econ, Sparti 22100, Greece; [Schizas, Panagiotis; Thomakos, Dimitrios D.] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Business Adm, Komotini 69100, Greece",University of Peloponnese; Democritus University of Thrace,"Schizas, P (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Dept Econ, Sparti 22100, Greece.",pschizas@uop.gr; thomakos@uop.gr,,"Thomakos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-2896-8163",,,,,36,1,1,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, little is known about the competitiveness of biosimilars versus their originators and other biologics belonging to the same therapeutic class. Objective The main goal of this study was to analyse the type of competition generated by the first biosimilars commercialised on key global biologic markets and to grasp their economic model. The secondary goal was to distinguish the main factors likely to influence the uptake of biosimilars on national markets. Methods To be included in this study, countries had to meet three conditions: the regulatory framework for the development of biosimilars closely resembled that in Europe, biosimilars were marketed in 2014, and the value of the biologics market was >US$3 billion. We analysed granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSFs) and erythropoietins (EPOs) over the period 2007-2014 because these are the two main therapeutic classes that have been 'biosimilarised' and thus have many years of experience available. We assessed market sizes, retail/hospital distribution mixes, incentives for using biosimilars and price discounts for originators versus biosimilars. We conducted a linear regression analysis to assess the relationship between uptakes of biosimilars and the market shares of other biologics. Results The EU-5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and Japanese GCSF and EPO markets are highly-country-specific. Uptake of biosimilars seems to depend on retail/hospital distribution mixes and on medical practice. Depending on the therapeutic class and the market sector (retail or hospital), biosimilars may compete with first-generation or second-generation products or both. Some incentives implemented to encourage the use of biosimilars had mixed results. Overall, discounts for biosimilars versus originators are not factors that determine global uptake of biosimilars. Conclusion Unlike generics, there appears to be no unique economic model for biosimilars. Moreover, a new phenomenon occurs with biosimilars: sometimes, they are able to take market shares from subsequent generations of biologics.","[Bocquet, Francois; Paubel, Pascal] Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Pharm, Hlth Law & Hlth Econ Dept, 4 Ave Observ, F-75006 Paris, France; [Bocquet, Francois; Paubel, Pascal] Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM, Hlth Law Inst,UMR S 1145, Paris, France; [Bocquet, Francois; Loubiere, Anais; Fusier, Isabelle; Cordonnier, Anne-Laure; Paubel, Pascal] Gen Agcy Equipment & Hlth Prod AGEPS, AP HP, Dept Pharm, Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); AGEPS Agence Generale des Equipements et Produits de Sante - APHP,"Bocquet, F (通讯作者)，Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Pharm, Hlth Law & Hlth Econ Dept, 4 Ave Observ, F-75006 Paris, France.;Bocquet, F (通讯作者)，Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM, Hlth Law Inst,UMR S 1145, Paris, France.;Bocquet, F (通讯作者)，Gen Agcy Equipment & Hlth Prod AGEPS, AP HP, Dept Pharm, Paris, France.",francois.bocquet@parisdescartes.fr,"Bocquet, François/GWZ-5108-2022; BOCQUET, François/D-2374-2017; Bocquet, François/M-6525-2015",,,,,,37,17,18,0,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2016,34.0,11,,,,,1173,1186,,10.1007/s40273-016-0428-6,0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EA6RE,27412251.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386755700009,0

However, existing observational study designs cannot identify the causal impact of disease on healthcare costs. This paper explores the possibilities for causal inference offered by Mendelian randomization, a form of instrumental variable analysis that uses genetic variation as a proxy for modifiable risk exposures, to estimate the effect of health conditions on cost. Well-conducted genome-wide association studies provide robust evidence of the associations of genetic variants with health conditions or disease risk factors. The subsequent causal effects of these health conditions on cost can be estimated using genetic variants as instruments for the health conditions. This is because the approximately random allocation of genotypes at conception means that many genetic variants are orthogonal to observable and unobservable confounders. Datasets with linked genotypic and resource use information obtained from electronic medical records or from routinely collected administrative data are now becoming available and will facilitate this form of analysis. We describe some of the methodological issues that arise in this type of analysis, which we illustrate by considering how Mendelian randomization could be used to estimate the causal impact of obesity, a complex trait, on healthcare costs. We describe some of the data sources that could be used for this type of analysis. We conclude by considering the challenges and opportunities offered by Mendelian randomization for economic evaluation.","[Dixon, Padraig; Smith, George Davey; Davies, Neil M.; Hollingworth, William] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Smith, George Davey; Davies, Neil M.] Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Oakfield House, Bristol BS8 2BN, Avon, England; [von Hinke, Stephanie] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",padraig.dixon@bristol.ac.uk,"Davey Smith, George/A-7407-2013","Davey Smith, George/0000-0002-1407-8314; s, hema/0000-0002-3440-9475; Davies, Neil/0000-0002-2460-0508; Dixon, Padraig/0000-0001-5285-409X; Venkatasubramanian, Siddharth/0000-0002-5860-0768; Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254","Medical Research Council (MRC); University of Bristol [MC_UU_12013/1, MC_UU_12013/9]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N000757/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12013/9, MR/K025643/1, G1002345, MC_UU_12013/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0514-10114] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/N000757/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MC_UU_12013/1, MC_UU_12013/9, MR/K025643/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); University of Bristol; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"No funding from external sources was provided for this work.

When an insurer concerns about the relative performance in a two-insurer economy, she maximizes the expected utility of her terminal wealth benchmarked against her competitor's. The problem formulation for a general utility, a general interest rate process and cointegrated mortality rates uses a nonzero sum stochastic differential game approach. Explicit solution of the Nash equilibrium is derived for constant relative risk adverse insurers under the Vasicek-type stochastic interest and mortality rates. Existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are established for the CIR-type models, which rule out negative interest and mortality rates. While previous studies based on the single-agent approaches have shown a high investment demand in longevity bonds, the launch of it was unsuccessful in reality. Ours supplements that the demand is much lower subject to the relative performance concerns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper provides a description of the ERG review of the company's submission, the ERG report and submission and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (December 2015). In the company's initial submission, the base-case analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 14,683 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the sequence including apremilast (positioned before tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha inhibitors) versus a comparator sequence without apremilast. However, the ERG considered that the base-case sequence proposed by the company represented a limited set of potentially relevant treatment sequences and positions for apremilast. The company's base-case results were therefore not a sufficient basis to inform the most efficient use and position of apremilast. The exploratory ERG analyses indicated that apremilast is more effective (i.e. produces higher health gains) when positioned after TNF-alpha inhibitor therapies. Furthermore, assumptions made regarding a potential beneficial effect of apremilast on long-term Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression, which cannot be substantiated, have a very significant impact on results. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC), when taking into account their preferred assumptions for HAQ progression for patients on treatment with apremilast, placebo response and monitoring costs for apremilast, concluded that the addition of apremilast resulted in cost savings but also a QALY loss. These cost savings were not high enough to compensate for the clinical effectiveness that would be lost. The AC thus decided that apremilast alone or in combination with DMARD therapy is not recommended for treating adults with active PsA that has not responded to prior DMARD therapy, or where such therapy is not tolerated.","[Sideris, Eleftherios; Palmer, Stephen; Bojke, Laura] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Corbett, Mark; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Sideris, E (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Eleftherios.sideris@york.ac.uk,,,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme [13/169/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 13/169/01).

The key parameters, such as the bank interest rate, or expected returns and covariance matrix of stocks, will change according to the market state. By virtue of Lagrange duality technique, dynamic programming approach and matrix representation method, we derive expressions of efficient investment strategy and its efficient frontier in closed-form.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost utility of add-on omalizumab treatment compared with standard of care (SOC) in moderate or severe CSU patients with inadequate response to SOC, from the UK societal perspective. A Markov model was developed, consisting of health states based on Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS7) and additional states for relapse, spontaneous remission and death. Model cycle length was 4 weeks, and total model time horizon was 20 years in the base case. The model considered early discontinuation of non-responders (response: UAS7 a parts per thousand currency sign6) and retreatment upon relapse (relapse: UAS7 a parts per thousand yen16) for responders. Clinical and cost inputs were derived from omalizumab trials and published sources, and cost utility was expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Scenario analyses included no early discontinuation of non-responders and an altered definition of response (UAS7 < 16). With a deterministic ICER of A 3183 pound in the base case, omalizumab was associated with increased costs and benefits relative to SOC. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported this result. Productivity inputs were key model drivers, and individual scenarios without early discontinuation of non-responders and adjusted response definitions had little impact on results. ICERs were generally robust to changes in key model parameters and inputs. In this, the first economic evaluation of omalizumab in CSU from a UK societal perspective, omalizumab consistently represented a treatment option with societal benefit for CSU in the UK across a range of scenarios.","[Graham, Jonathan; Stull, Donald] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [McBride, Doreen] RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Halliday, Anna; Alexopoulos, Stamatia Theodora] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley Business Pk, Camberley, Surrey, England; [Balp, Maria-Magdalena] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Griffiths, Matthew; Agirrezabal, Ion] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, Cambridge, England; [Zuberbier, Torsten] Charite, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Allergy Ctr Charite, Berlin, Germany; [Brennan, Alan] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Research Triangle Institute; Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Costello Medical Consulting; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Sheffield,"Halliday, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley Business Pk, Camberley, Surrey, England.",anna.halliday@novartis.com,"Griffiths, Matt/HTR-2285-2023; Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009","Griffiths, Matt/0000-0002-7325-9668; Graham, Jonathan/0000-0002-3227-5928; Zuberbier, Torsten/0000-0002-1466-8875; Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Stull, Donald/0000-0001-9808-5417; Agirrezabal, Ion/0000-0003-3170-7845",Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),This research was funded by Novartis.,,41,27,28,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2016,34.0,8,,,,,815,827,,10.1007/s40273-016-0412-1,0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DQ4LJ,27209583.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379175100008,0

Discretely integrated condition event (DICE) simulation is proposed as a unifying approach that has been deliberately designed to meet the modeling requirements in a straightforward transparent way, without forcing assumptions (e.g., only one transition per cycle) or unnecessary complexity. At the core of DICE are conditions that represent aspects that persist over time. They have levels that can change and many may coexist. Events reflect instantaneous occurrences that may modify some conditions or the timing of other events. The conditions are discretely integrated with events by updating their levels at those times. Profiles of determinant values allow for differences among patients in the predictors of the disease course. Any number of valuations (e.g., utility, cost, willingness-to-pay) of conditions and events can be applied concurrently in a single run. A DICE model is conveniently specified in a series of tables that follow a consistent format and the simulation can be implemented fully in MS Excel, facilitating review and validation. DICE incorporates both state-transition (Markov) models and non-resource-constrained discrete event simulation in a single formulation; it can be executed as a cohort or a microsimulation; and deterministically or stochastically.","[Caro, J.

Several biosimilars have been approved in Europe, and a number of top-selling biological medicines have lost, or will lose, patent protection over the next 5 years. We look at the experience in Europe so far. The USA has finally implemented a regulatory route for biosimilar approval. We recommend that European and US governments and payers take a strategic approach to get value for money from the use of biosimilars by (1) supporting and incentivising generation of high-quality comprehensive outcomes data on the effectiveness and safety of biosimilars and originator products; and (2) ensuring that incentives are in place for budget holders to benefit from price competition. This may create greater willingness on the part of budget holders and clinicians to use biosimilar and originator products with comparable outcomes interchangeably, and may drive down prices. Other options, such as direct price cuts for originator products or substitution rules without outcomes data, are likely to discourage biosimilar entry. With such approaches, governments may achieve a one-off cut in originator prices but may put at risk the creation of a more competitive market that would, in time, produce much greater savings. It was the creation of competitive markets for chemical generic drugs-notably, in the USA, the UK and Germany-rather than price control, that enabled payers to achieve the high discounts now taken for granted.","[Mestre-Ferrandiz, Jorge; Towse, Adrian; Berdud, Mikel] Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England",,"Mestre-Ferrandiz, J (通讯作者)，Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England.",jmestre-ferrandiz@ohe.org,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Berdud, Mikel/H-4304-2015","Berdud, Mikel/0000-0002-4816-5272",Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry; Amgen,Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry; Amgen(Amgen),"The Office of Health Economics receives a programme research grant from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.

Financial reporting standards such as IFRS2 and AASB2 require public corporations to report on the cost of providing ESOs, and mandate the incorporation of voluntary and involuntary early exercise. In this paper we extend the exercise multiple approach of Hull and White (2004) and decompose the attrition unadjusted voluntary exercise ESO into a gap call option and two partial-time barrier options. We use exit probabilities obtained from empirically determined multiple decrement or life tables to model involuntary early exercise or forfeiture. We provide a new analytic valuation formula which expresses the ESO value in terms of a portfolio of exotic European bivariate power options and which correctly accounts for both voluntary exercise and employee attrition. Recent approaches seek to model employee attrition using a constant hazard rate. Our approach uses an empirically driven actuarial method for incorporating employee attrition in the valuation.

In contrast to the standard small-diffusion asymptotic expansion method, the dynamics of variables given by the forward SDEs is treated exactly. Although it requires a special form of the quadratic covariation terms of the continuous part, it allows rather generic drift as well as jump components to exist. The resultant approximation is given by a polynomial function in terms of the unperturbed forward variables whose coefficients are uniquely specified by the solution of a recursive system of linear ordinary differential equations.

First, the presented trading strategy appears very lucrative in the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) framework. In fact, to such an extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a sense, incompatible with the CAPM. Second, if one wishes to adapt these models together, then the adjustment of the consistent pricing rule (i.e. modifying state price densities) inevitably leads to some form of volatility smile, which is the main point of the paper. Moreover, these observations arise from purely structural considerations and only one hypothetical equity or equity index with many European options on it (such as S&P500) is required.","[Talponen, Jarno] Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Math, Box 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Talponen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Math, Box 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland.",talponen@iki.fi,,"Talponen, Jarno/0000-0002-9034-379X",,,,,34,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The AAI's surplus process is assumed to follow the classical Cramer-Lundberg model, and the AAI is allowed to purchase proportional reinsurance or acquire new business and invest in a financial market to manage her risk. The financial market consists of a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price process is described by a jump-diffusion model. By applying stochastic control theory, we establish the corresponding extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system of equations. Furthermore, we derive both the robust equilibrium reinsurance-investment strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function by solving the extended HJB system of equations. In addition, some special cases of our model are provided, which show that our model and results extend some existing ones in the literature.

The process is decentralized, very little information is available and trade takes place at many different prices simultaneously. We propose a completely uncoupled learning process that selects a subset of the core of the game with a natural equity interpretation. This happens even though agents have no knowledge of other agents' strategies, payoffs, or the structure of the game, and there is no central authority with such knowledge either. In our model, agents randomly encounter other agents, make bids and offers for potential partnerships and match if the partnerships are profitable. Equity is favored by our dynamics because it is more stable, not because of any ex ante fairness criterion.","[Nax, Heinrich H.] ETH, Dept Social Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pradelski, Bary S.

The central bank's objective is to maximize a functional, which measures the classical trade-off between output and inflation over time plus income from the sales of inflation-indexed bonds minus payments for the liabilities that the inflation-indexed bonds produce at maturity. Private agents are assumed to have adaptive expectations. The financial market is modeled in continuous-time Black-Scholes-Merton style and financial agents are averse against inflation risk, attaching an inflation risk premium to nominal bonds. Following this route, we explain demand for inflation-indexed securities on the financial market from a no-arbitrage assumption and derive pricing formulas for inflation-linked bonds and calls, which lead to a supply-demand equilibrium. Furthermore, we study the consequences that the sales of inflation-indexed securities have on the observed inflation rate and price level. Similar to the study of Walsh, we find that the inflationary bias is significantly reduced, and hence that markets for inflation-indexed bonds provide a mechanism to reduce inflationary bias and increase central bank's credibility.","[Ewald, Christian-Oliver] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Geissler, Johannes] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, Ctr Dynam Macroecon Anal, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of St Andrews,"Ewald, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",christian.ewald@glasgow.ac.uk,"Ewald, Christian/HTN-7407-2023; Ewald, Christian/GSN-6992-2022","Ewald, Christian/0000-0003-3288-0164",Australian Research Council [DP1095969]; Australian Research Council [DP1095969] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Both authors are thankful to Prof. Charles Nolan for useful comments and suggestions.

Guidance for the reporting of mapping studies is currently lacking. The overall objective of this research was to develop a checklist of essential items, which authors should consider when reporting mapping studies. The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a checklist, which aims to promote complete and transparent reporting by researchers. This paper provides a detailed explanation and elaboration of the items contained within the MAPS statement. In the absence of previously published reporting checklists or reporting guidance documents, a de novo list of reporting items and accompanying explanations was created. A two-round, modified Delphi survey, with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies and the biomedical journal editorial community, was used to identify a list of essential reporting items from this larger list. From the initial de novo list of 29 candidate items, a set of 23 essential reporting items was developed. The items are presented numerically and categorised within six sections, namely, (i) title and abstract, (ii) introduction, (iii) methods, (iv) results, (v) discussion and (vi) other. For each item, we summarise the recommendation, illustrate it using an exemplar of good reporting practice identified from the published literature, and provide a detailed explanation to accompany the recommendation. It is anticipated that the MAPS statement will promote clarity, transparency and completeness of reporting of mapping studies. It is targeted at researchers developing mapping algorithms, peer reviewers and editors involved in the manuscript review process for mapping studies, and the funders of the research. The MAPS working group plans to assess the need for an update of the reporting checklist in 5 years' time.","[Petrou, Stavros; Froud, Robert] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford, England; [Dakin, Helen; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ London, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Oppe, Mark] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Froud, Robert] Norges Helsehoyskole, Oslo, Norway",University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Brunel University,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Froud, Robert/AAQ-2429-2021; Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Froud, Robert/0000-0002-9193-2297; Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Gray, Alastair/0000-0003-0239-7278","Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,55,56,55,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2015,33.0,10,,,,,993,1011,,10.1007/s40273-015-0312-9,0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CR8TE,26232200.0,"Bronze, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361626100002,0

There remains no evidence of its cost-effectiveness in Thailand. Objective Our objective was to estimate the cost utility of IVIG as a second-line therapy in steroid-refractory DM in Thailand. Methods A Markov model was developed to estimate the relevant costs and health benefits for IVIG plus corticosteroids in comparison with immunosuppressant plus corticosteroids in steroid-refractory DM from a societal perspective over a patient's lifetime. The effectiveness and utility parameters were obtained from clinical literature, meta-analyses, medical record reviews, and patient interviews, whereas cost data were obtained from an electronic hospital database and patient interviews. Costs are presented in $US, year 2012 values. All future costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3 % per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results Over a lifetime horizon, the model estimated treatment under IVIG plus corticosteroids to be cost saving compared with immunosuppressant plus corticosteroids, where the saving of costs and incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were $US4738.92 and 1.96 QALYs, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that probability of response of immunosuppressant plus corticosteroids was the most influential parameter on incremental QALYs and costs. At a societal willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand of $US5148 per QALY gained, the probability of IVIG being cost effective was 97.6 %. Conclusions The use of IVIG plus corticosteroids is cost saving compared with treatment with immunosuppressant plus corticosteroids in Thai patients with steroid-refractory DM. Policy makers should consider using our findings in their decision-making process for adding IVIG to corticosteroids as the second-line therapy for steroid-refractory DM patients.","[Bamrungsawad, Naruemon; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn; Upakdee, Nilawan; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn; Sruamsiri, Rosarin; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Ctr Pharmaceut Outcomes Res, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pratoomsoot, Chayanin] Naresuan Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Phitsanulok, Thailand",Naresuan University; Naresuan University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; University of Queensland; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Naresuan University,"Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia.",nathorn.chaiyakunapruk@monash.edu,"Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/AFR-0151-2022","Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/0000-0002-6981-1771; Pratoomsoot, Chayanin/0000-0002-1073-5145","NLEM, Thailand","NLEM, Thailand","This work was funded by the Subcommittee for Development of the NLEM, Thailand.

Objective This study aims to identify all recent economic evaluations on drugs for postmenopausal osteoporosis, to critically appraise the reporting quality, and to summarize the results. Methods A literature search using Medline, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation database and the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry was undertaken to identify original articles published between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013. Studies that assessed cost effectiveness of drugs in postmenopausal osteoporosis were included. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement was used to assess the quality of reporting of these articles. Results Of 1,794 articles identified, 39 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They were conducted in 14 different countries and nine active interventions were assessed. When compared with no treatment, active osteoporotic drugs were generally cost effective in postmenopausal women aged over 60-65 years with low bone mass, especially those with prior vertebral fractures. Key drivers of cost effectiveness included individual fracture risk, medication adherence, selected comparators and country-specific analyses. Quality of reporting varied between studies with an average score of 17.9 out of 24 (range 7-21.5). Conclusion This review found a substantial number of published cost-effectiveness analyses of drugs in osteoporosis in the last 6 years. Results and critical appraisal of these articles can help decision makers when prioritizing health interventions and can inform the development of future economic evaluations.","[Hiligsmann, Mickael; Evers, Silvia M.] Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Serv Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Ben Sedrine, Wafa; Reginster, Jean-Yves] Univ Liege, Dept Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Liege, Belgium; [Kanis, John A.] Univ Sheffield, Ctr Metab Bone Dis, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ramaekers, Bram] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, CAPHRI, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Silverman, Stuart] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Med, Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Beverly Hills, CA USA; [Silverman, Stuart] OMC Clin Res Ctr, Beverly Hills, CA USA; [Wyers, Caroline E.] VieCuri Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Venlo, Netherlands; [Wyers, Caroline E.] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, NUTRIM Sch Nutr Toxicol & Metab, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Boonen, Annelies] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, CAPHRI, Dept Internal Med, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; University of Liege; University of Sheffield; Maastricht University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Cedars Sinai Medical Center; VieCuri Medical Center; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC),"Hiligsmann, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Serv Res, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.hiligsmann@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Evers, Silvia/ABG-2128-2020; Reginster, Jean-Yves/AGC-6097-2022; Velez, Edna Vazquez/M-5919-2019; Velez, Edna Vazquez/B-6311-2017; Wyers, Caroline/F-6221-2013","Evers, Silvia/0000-0003-1026-570X; Velez, Edna Vazquez/0000-0002-2154-0116; Wyers, Caroline/0000-0001-7662-3990; Ramaekers, Bram/0000-0001-5785-9228",Amgen; Pfizer; Novartis; Servier and SMB; Servier; Negma; Lilly; Wyeth; GlaxoSmithKline; Roche; Merckle; Nycomed; NPS; Theramex; UCB; Merck Sharp and Dohme; Rottapharm; IBSA; Genevrier; Teijin; Teva; Ebewee Pharma; Zodiac; Analis; Novo-Nordisk; Bristol Myers Squibb; Genentech; Pfizer/Wyeth; Merck; Abbot; Amgen and Pfizer,Amgen(Amgen); Pfizer(Pfizer); Novartis(Novartis); Servier and SMB; Servier(Servier); Negma; Lilly(Eli Lilly); Wyeth(Wyeth); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Roche(Roche Holding); Merckle; Nycomed; NPS; Theramex; UCB(UCB Pharma SA); Merck Sharp and Dohme(Merck & Company); Rottapharm; IBSA; Genevrier; Teijin; Teva(Teva Pharmaceutical Industries); Ebewee Pharma(Dexcel Pharma); Zodiac; Analis; Novo-Nordisk(Novo Nordisk); Bristol Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Genentech(Roche HoldingGenentech); Pfizer/Wyeth(WyethPfizer); Merck(Merck & Company); Abbot; Amgen and Pfizer,"Mickael Hilisgmann has received research grant and/or consulting fees from Amgen, Pfizer, Novartis, Servier and SMB.

However, whilst they address efficiency and affordability, the issue of implementation and feasibility has been largely ignored. HTA commonly takes place within a deliberative framework that captures issues of implementation and feasibility in a qualitative manner. We argue that only through a formal quantitative assessment of resource constraints can these issues be fully addressed. This paper argues the need for resource modelling to be considered explicitly in HTA. First, economic evaluation and budget impact models are described along with their limitations in evaluating feasibility. Next, resource modelling is defined and its usefulness is described along with examples of resource modelling from the literature. Then, the important issues that need to be considered when undertaking resource modelling are described before setting out recommendations for the use of resource modelling in HTA.","[Thokala, Praveen; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Regent Court, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Jahn, Beate] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol UMIT, Dept Publ Hlth & Hlth Technol Assessment, Inst Publ Hlth Med Decis Making & Hlth Technol As, Hall In Tirol, Austria",University of Sheffield,"Thokala, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.thokala@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009; Jahn, Beate/0000-0002-6764-6362",,,,,53,13,15,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2015,33.0,3,,,,,193,203,,10.1007/s40273-014-0228-9,0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CC6NB,25411095.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350480700002,0

This study estimated the budget impact to National Organization for Health Care Services Provision (EOPYY) of changing reimbursement of psoriasis treatment with topical and systemic, non-biologic, agents (75%) to bring it on par with that of biologic agents (100%) in Greece.Methods: The Business Intelligence database of EOPYY was used to identify and provide analytics on patients with plaque psoriasis. Permission for use of anonymized data was obtained by the administration of EOPYY. EOPYY is responsible for funding healthcare and pharmaceutical care services for approximate to 95% of the permanent population in the country. Pre-defined ICD-10 codes were applied to identify patients with plaque psoriasis and at least one reimbursed prescription between 1 June 2014 and 31 May 2015. Age, gender, medications, and cost were recorded for these patients.Results: Of the 45,581 unique patients identified through completely anonymized data on the e-prescription system, 72% were on treatment with topicals only and accounted for 5% of EOPYY psoriasis expenditure. Another 9% of patients were on methotrexate or a per os (POS, orally administered) systemic agent and accounted for 2.35% of total expenditure. Approximately 12% of total patients were on treatment with a biologic-containing regimen and accounted for almost 90% of psoriasis expenditure. Patients on biologics were younger than patients on topical and systemic treatments. The burden to EOPYY of adjusting reimbursement levels for topical and systemic, non-biologic, treatments to 100% of their cost was estimated at Euro2.05 per patient per month for topical treatments (monotherapy) and an additional Euro9.5 per patient per month for treatment with methotrexate, POS systemic agents, and their combinations with topical agents. This additional cost is expected to be offset by averting 200 earlier than clinically necessary switches from topical and systemic, non-biologic, treatments to expensive biologics a year.Conclusion: In circumstances of severe funding constraints for social health insurance in Greece, bringing patient copayment levels for psoriasis treatment on par with each other may aid proper clinical management of the condition, whilst achieving adequate treatment outcomes at optimal cost.","[Souliotis, Kyriakos] Univ Peloponnese, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Conrith, Greece; [Kani, Chara; Litsa, Panagiota] Natl Org Provis Healthcare Serv, Med Div, Dept Planning & Monitoring Med Dispensing, Athens, Greece",,"Souliotis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Fac Social Sci, Athens, Greece.",soulioti@hol.gr,"SOULIOTIS, KYRIAKOS/AAM-3164-2021","SOULIOTIS, KYRIAKOS/0000-0003-1624-9444",,,,,25,1,1,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The DNL describes and predicts the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flow and congestion on a network that is consistent with established route and departure time choices of travelers. The LWR-based DNL model is first formulated as a system of partial differential algebraic equations. We then investigate the continuous dependence of merge and diverge junction models with respect to their initial/boundary conditions, which leads to the continuity of the path delay operator through the wave-front tracking methodology and the generalized tangent vector technique. As part of our analysis leading up to the main continuity result, we also provide an estimation of the minimum network supply without resort to any numerical computation. In particular, it is shown that gridlock can never occur in a finite time horizon in the DNL model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although there are various ways of constructing a day-to-day dynamical model, the model should explicitly reflect the microscopic day-to-day adjustment behaviour of individual users to clarify which behavioural factors are incorporated in the model. From this point of view, existing day-to-day dynamical models seems not to contain sufficiently explicit mechanisms for the information collection behaviour. Several existing models implicitly incorporate user behaviour under imperfect information, but not in a way that can be explicitly related to the microscopic information acquisition processes of individual users. The present study proposes a continuous and deterministic day-to-day dynamical model that explicitly incorporates microscopic user behaviour about the information collection and can be handled easily in a mathematical manner. A microscopic model describing individuals' day-to-day adjustment process is first constructed. Then, introducing the mean field approximation and assuming the large number of users, a macroscopic model that does not contain any disaggregated variable is derived as an ordinary differential equation. Convergence towards a user equilibrium solution is globally or locally guaranteed for utility functions associated with a potential function and those of monotonically decreasing regardless of the variety of information collection behaviour considered by the proposed model. On the other hand, results of numerical examples imply that the variety of information collection behaviour affects how a system behaves in a transient status of the dynamics, including how the system oscillates when it does not converge to an equilibrium point.

The network kinematic wave model is now widely accepted as such a model, given its realism in reproducing phenomena such as transient queues and spillback to upstream links. An attractive solution strategy for DSO based on such a model is to reformulate as a set of side constraints apply a standard solver, and to this end two methods have been previously proposed, one based on the discretisation scheme known as the Cell Transmission Model (CTM), and the other based on the Link Transmission Model (LTM) derived from variational theory. In the present paper we aim to combine the advantages of CTM (in tracking time-dependent congestion formation within a link) with those of LTM (avoiding cell discretisation, providing a more computationally attractive with much fewer constraints). The motivation for our work is the previously-reported possibility for DSO to have multiple solutions, which differ in where queues are formed and dissipated in the network. Our aim is to find DSO solutions that optimally distribute the congestion over links inside the network which essentially eliminate avoidable queue spillbacks. In order to do so, we require more information than the LTM can offer, but wish to avoid the computational burden of CTM for DSO. We thus adopt an extension of the LTM called the Two-regime Transmission Model (TTM), which is consistent with LTM at link entries and exits but which is additionally able to accurately track the spatial and temporal formation of the congestion boundary within a link (which we later show to be a critical element, relative to LTM). We set out the theoretical background necessary for the formulation of the network-level TTM as a set of linear side constraints. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the application of the method to determine DSO solutions avoiding spillbacks, reduce eliminate the congestion and to show the distinctive elements of adopting TTM over LTM. Furthermore, in comparison to a fine level CTM-based DSO method, our formulation is seen to significantly reduce the number of linear constraints while maintaining a reasonable accuracy.

Methods: Responses from patients who had been diagnosed with some form of pain (n=14,459) were drawn from the 2013 EU National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS; n=62,000). Respondents reported their subjective pain severity in the past week on a numerical rating scale (0-10) as well as the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), and healthcare resource utilization in the past 6 months (healthcare professional (HCP) visits, emergency room (ER) visits, and hospitalizations). Associations between pain severity and health outcomes were examined via a series of regression models controlling for a set of demographic and health-related covariates. Results: After controlling for demographics and comorbidities, pain severity in the past week was shown to be significantly negatively associated with Health Utilities (b = -0.022, p<0.001) and positively associated with overall WPAI scores (b=0.18, p<0.001) and healthcare resource use (Hospitalizations: b=0.13, p<0.001; ER Visits: b=0.14, p<0.001; HCP Visits: b=0.08, p<0.001). The nature of these relationships (linear, curvilinear, etc.) is also explored. Limitations: This study was a self-report cross-sectional study which may have biased the results and does not allow for causal inferences to be made. Finally, the regression models run were limited to available covariates and, hence, some potentially important covariates may not have been included in these models. Conclusions: The findings suggest that reducing pain severity could result in an increase in patients' quality-of-life and work productivity, and a decrease in healthcare resource use. The equations, linking pain and outcomes, were presented in an accessible format so they could be readily applied in healthcare decision-making.","[Witt, Edward A.] Kantar Hlth, Princeton, NJ USA; [Kenworthy, James; Dunlop, William C.

This leads to the question which structural path characteristics can be used to construct realistic route choice sets for use in traffic simulation models. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that, for utilitarian trips, the route between origin and destination consists of a small number of concatenated least cost paths. The hypothesis is verified by analyzing routes extracted from large sets of recorded GPS traces which constitute revealed preference information. Trips have been extracted from the traces and for each trip the path in the transportation network is determined by map matching. This is followed by a path decomposition phase for which the algorithm constitutes the first contribution of this paper. There are multiple ways to split a given path in a directed graph into a minimal number of subpaths of minimal cost By calculating two specific path splittings, it is possible to identify subsets of the vertices (splitVertexSuites) that can be used to generate every possible minimum path splitting by taking one vertex from each such subset As a second contribution, we show how the extracted information is used in microscopic travel simulation. The distribution for the size of the minimum decomposition, extracted from the GPS traces, can be used in constrained enumeration methods for route choice set generation. The sets of vertices that can act as boundary vertices separating consecutive route parts contain way points (landmarks) having a particular meaning to their user. The paper explains the theoretical aspects of route splitting as well as the process to extract splitVertexSuites from big data. It reports statistical distributions extracted from sets of GPS traces for both multimodal person movements and unimodal car trips. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the proposed model is similar to multi-commodity network-flow (MCNF) with side constraints, unlike the MCNF with time delay constraints or reliability constraints that is NP-hard, we show that the liner container assignment model is polynomially solvable due to its weekly schedule characteristics by developing two link-based linear programing formulations.

The holding company first establishes a hub-and-spoke network in order to locate p hubs and to assign the center nodes to the located hubs. Then, it allocates the transportation routes of the hub network to the carriers. In contrast, the carriers should select an appropriate vehicle type to serve the transportation requests in a green hub network. The carriers are also able to meet the transportation requests within a certain time window based on a soft time-window mechanism. Moreover, aiming to emphasize green transportation, a vehicle emission model is used to take into account CO2 emissions of the vehicles where the fuel consumption is a function of speed level. Aiming to identify a win-win deal between the holding company and the carriers, a dual lexicographic max-min (LMM) approach is used in order to optimize their profits in a fair way. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. The computational results show that not only the holding company and the carriers can better generate a fair profit contract among themselves using the LMM approach, but also both can obtain more profit in the worst case for their businesses rather than using the max-min approach. In addition, sensitivity analyses show that increasing the size of the soft time-window leads to a reduction in the delivery schedule violations, while results in raising the total profit. Moreover, the tax cost of fuel consumption as well as the number of potential vehicles has a substantial impact on both the fuel consumption and carrier's profit. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A mixed-integer linear program for the mICT is presented using two alternative objective functions: minimization of the total travel distance and minimization of the total operation time of the trucks. The presented model is tested on instances which vary in size. Computational experiments show that by means of the presented model small problem instances can be solved optimally.

This study proposes a clinical trial based pharmacoeconomic framework to assess the therapeutic and economic value of ruxolitinib in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis. Methods: Individual patient level 144 week follow-up data from the COMFORT-II trial was used to account for the crossover effect on overall survival. Lifetime treatment benefits and costs were estimated considering detailed patterns of both ruxolitinib dose adjustments and blood transfusion needs. Results: The authors estimate a 3.3 years increment in life expectancy (HR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.17-0.55; p-value <0.001) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro40,000 per life year gained with the use of ruxolitinib. Conclusion: This study also demonstrates how valuable information from clinical trials can be used to support informed decisions about the early incorporation of innovative drugs.","[Vandewalle, Bjorn; Andreozzi, Valeska; Almeida, Joao; Felix, Jorge] Exigo Consultores, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Félix, J (通讯作者)，Alameda Oceanos, 61,Piso 1,Escritorio 2, P-1990208 Lisbon, Portugal.",jorge.felix@exigoconsultores.com,,"Andreozzi, Valeska/0000-0001-6478-8456; Felix, Jorge/0000-0003-0544-0323",Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),This research project was funded by Novartis.,,35,1,1,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Using a hybrid competitive/cooperative game theoretic framework, we show that the stronger the inter-airline agreement on overlapping routes, the higher the producer surplus. On the other hand, consumer surplus and overall social welfare are maximized under limited codesharing agreements. Partial mergers appear preferable to no agreement in 'thin' markets, in which both demand and profit margins are relatively low. Inter-governmental agreements are also analyzed and we show that bilaterals create the least favorable market outcomes for consumers and producers. Finally, a realistic case study demonstrates that under asymmetric and uncertain demand, codesharing on parallel links may be preferable to competitive outcomes for multiple consumer types.

One of important applications of solar energy is to manufacture solar wood drying units. Iran has been located in an appropriate situation in the world with respect to receiving solar energy. The aim of the present paper is to propose a multicriteria methodological approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) useful for the Determination of Effective Criteria on Site Selection for Solar Wood Drying Units in Iran. The methodological approach is divided in 3 steps. In first step experts of kiln wood drying were interviewed for preliminary investigation. In the second step, hierarchy of criteria was designed and weighing values of them were calculated by Analytic Hierarchy Process. Finally, in the third step, model was used rating for prioritizing capable provinces. Results showed that Qom province, with average temperature, has the highest priority as a criterion and alternative. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We formulate the dual-toll problem as a bi-level program wherein the upper level aims at minimizing the risk, and the lower level explores the user equilibrium decision of the regular vehicles and hazmat carriers given the toll. When the upper level objective is to minimize the risk and all links are tollable, we decompose the formulation into first-stage and second-stage, and suggest a computational method to solve each stage. Our two-stage solution methodology guarantees nonnegative valid dual tolls regardless of the solution accuracy of the first-stage problem. We also consider a general dual-toll setting problem where the regulator rather wishes to minimize a combination of risk and the paid tolls and/or some links are untollable. To solve this truly bilevel problem, we provide heuristic algorithms that decompose the problem into subproblems each being solved by a line search. Case studies based on the Sioux Falls network illustrate the insights on the dual-toll policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, related studies have limitations either on the integration structure or the number of choice facets being captured. This paper proposes a formulation of dynamic activity-travel assignment (DATA) in the framework of multi-state supernetworks, in which any path through a personalized supernetwork represents a particular activity-travel pattern (ATP) at a high level of spatial and temporal detail. DATA is formulated as a discrete-time dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) problem, which is reformulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem. A generalized dynamic link disutility function is established with the accommodation of different characteristics of the links in the supernetworks. Flow constraints and non-uniqueness of equilibria are also investigated In the proposed formulation, the choices of departure time, route, mode, activity sequence, activity and parking location are all unified into one time-dependent ATP choice. As a result, the interdependences among all these choice facets can be readily captured. A solution algorithm based on the route-swapping mechanism is adopted to find the user equilibrium. A numerical example with simulated scenarios is provided to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The novelty of our approach is that the model is theoretically derived by applying a generalized extreme-value distribution to the random component of utility, while retaining its closed-form expression. In addition, the weibit model, in which the random utility is assumed to follow the Weibull distribution, is a special case of the proposed model. This is achieved by utilizing the q-generalization method developed in Tsallis statistics. Then, our generalized logit model is incorporated into a transportation network equilibrium model. The network equilibrium model with a generalized logit route choice is formulated as an optimization problem for uncongested networks. The objective function includes Tsallis entropy, a type of generalized entropy. The generalization of the Gumbel and Weibull distributions, logit and weibit models, and network equilibrium model are formulated within a unified framework with q-generalization or Tsallis statistics.

To correct this problem, a new dynamic dial-a-ride policy is introduced, one that features non-myopic pricing based on optimal tolling of queues to fit with the multi-server queueing approximation method proposed by Hyttia et al. (2012) for large-scale systems. By including social optimal pricing, the social welfare of the resulting system outperforms the marginal pricing assumed for previous approaches over a range of test instances. In the examples tested, improvements in social welfare of the non-myopic pricing over the myopic pricing were in the 20-31% range. For a given demand function, we can derive the optimal fleet size to maximize social welfare. Sensitivity tests to the optimal price confirm that it leads to an optimal social welfare while the marginal pricing policy does not. A comparison of single passenger taxis to shared-taxis shows that system cost may reduce at the expense of decreased social welfare, which agrees with the results of Jung et al. (2013).

Grounded on quantum optical flow theory, we propose a dynamic and stochastic driver perception model to investigate the relationship between the uncertainty of perceived relative speed and that of reaction time during car following. Specifically, the proposed model hypothesizes that driver perceived speed and reaction time are time-varying and uncertain, and correlate in a trade-off relationship mimicking the form of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. To test the assertion that a trade-off relationship of uncertainty in perceived relative speed and reaction time exists in car following, this study conducts qualitative analysis followed by a two-stage experiment rooted in quantum optical flow theory using data collected from a driver simulator. Analytical results further elucidate car-following phenomena under driver-perception uncertainty, potentially facilitating the development of new traffic flow theories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In real life operations, the RWAMRP solution is used in tactical planning whereas the TAP solution is implemented in operational planning. The main objective of these two problems is to minimize the total expected propagated delay (EPD) of the aircraft routes. To formulate the RWAMRP, we propose a novel weekly line-of-flights (LOF) network model that can handle complex and nonlinear cost functions of EPD. Because the number of LOFs grows exponentially with the number of flights to be scheduled, we propose a two-stage column generation approach to efficiently solve large-scale real-life RWAMRPs. Because the EPD of an LOF is highly nonlinear and can be very time-consuming to accurately compute, we propose three lower bounds on the EPD to solve the pricing subproblem of the column generation. Our approach is tested on eight real-life test instances. The computational results show that the proposed approach provides very tight LP relaxation (within 0.6% of optimal solutions) and solves the test case with more than 6000 flights per week in less than three hours. We also investigate the solutions obtained by our approach over 500 simulated realizations. The simulation results demonstrate that, in all eight test instances, our solutions result in less EPDs than those obtained from traditional methods. We then extend our model and solution approach to solve realistically simulated TAP instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem is formulated as an extension of the classic spatial price equilibrium problem and solved with the gradient projection algorithm. Results from the model support the use of interseasonal storage mechanisms and confirm that the use of price bands is less effective as it lowers total society surplus while providing inaccurate signaling and therefore dampening market perceptions of product scarcity or excess.

The introduction of triple therapy using SMV in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin (PR) significantly improves the cure rate. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SMV with PR (SMV/PR) compared to telaprevir with PR (TVR/PR), PR alone, or no treatment in treatment-naive patients in Japan. Methods: A Markov model was developed to reflect the natural disease progression of HCV and to estimate the average life years and lifetime healthcare costs per patient. Sustained virologic response rates were obtained from a network meta-analysis including randomized clinical trials conducted in Japan. Patient baseline characteristics, HCV progression rates, mortality, medical resource utilization, and unit costs were obtained from Japanese sources. Outcomes were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as well as incremental cost and life years. Various sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty around model outcomes. Results: SMV/PR was estimated to be a cost-effective treatment option as more life years were gained by 0.235 and 0.873 years at a reduced cost by (sic)263,037 and (sic)776,900 compared to TVR/PR and PR alone, respectively. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses, in particular in the comparison of SMV/PR with PR alone. The multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probability of SMV/PR being cost-effective was relatively constant at similar to 87% at any willingness to pay. Conclusions: SMV/PR is estimated to be the most cost-effective treatment strategy for treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 patients in Japan.","[Kuwabara, Hiroyo; Mahlich, Joerg] Janssen Pharmaceut KK, Tokyo, Japan; [Westerhout, Kirsten; Treur, Maarten] Pharmerit BV, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Cerri, Karin] Janssen Pharmaceut NV, Beerse, Belgium; [Cerri, Karin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Mahlich, Joerg] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Competit Econ DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Yatsuhashi, Hiroshi] Natl Hosp Org Nagasaki Med Ctr, Nagasaki, Japan",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Mahlich, J (通讯作者)，Janssen Pharmaceut KK, Chiyoda Ku, 5-2 Nishi Kanda 3-Chome, Tokyo, Japan.",jmahlich@its.jnj.com,,"Mahlich, Jorg/0000-0003-1110-2793",Janssen Pharmaceutica NV,Janssen Pharmaceutica NV(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),This study was funded by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.,,33,12,15,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: The Cardiff Diabetes Model was applied to evaluate cost-effectiveness, with treatment effects sourced from a network meta-analysis. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated with health-state utilities applied to T2DM-related complications, weight changes, hypoglycemia, and nausea. Costs (GBP ) included drug treatment, T2DM-related complications, severe hypoglycemia, nausea, and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. A 40-year time horizon was used. Results: In all base-case comparisons, EQW was associated with a QALY gain per patient; 0.046 vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg; 0.102 vs liraglutide 1.2 mg; 0.043 vs liraglutide 1.8 mg; and 0.074 vs lixisenatide 20 g. Cost per patient was lower for EQW than for liraglutide 1.8mg (-2,085); pound therefore, EQW dominated liraglutide 1.8 mg. The cost difference per patient between EQW and dulaglutide 1.5mg, EQW and liraglutide 1.2 mg, and EQW and lixisenatide 20 g was 27 pound, 103 pound, and 738 pound, respectively. Cost per QALY gained with EQW vs dulaglutide 1.5mg, EQW vs liraglutide 1.2mg, and EQW vs lixisenatide 20g was 596 pound, 1,004 pound, and 10,002 pound, respectively. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that EQW is cost-effective ranged from 76-99%. Conclusion: Results suggest that exenatide 2mg once-weekly is cost-effective over a lifetime horizon compared to dulaglutide 1.5mg QW, liraglutide 1.2mg QD, liraglutide 1.8mg QD, and lixisenatide 20g QD for the treatment of T2DM in adults not adequately controlled on metformin alone.","[Chuang, L.

Using ASPIRE data, the effect of treatment regimens as administered in the trial was assessed for progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Treatment effects were estimated with parametric regression models adjusting for baseline patient characteristics and applied over a lifetime horizon. US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (1984-2014) registry data were matched to ASPIRE patients to extrapolate OS beyond the trial. Estimated survival was adjusted to account for utilities across health states. The K-GEM considered the total direct costs (pharmacy/medical) of care for patients treated with KRd and Rd.Results: KRd was estimated to be more effective compared to Rd, providing 1.99 life year and 1.67 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains over the modeled horizon. KRd-treated patients incurred $179,393 in total additional costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $107,520 per QALY.Limitations: Extrapolated survival functions present the greatest uncertainty in the modeled results. Utilities were derived from a combination of sources and assumed to reflect how US patients value their health state.Conclusions: The K-GEM showed KRd is cost-effective, with an ICER of $107,520 per QALY gained against Rd for the treatment of patients with RMM (1-3 prior therapies) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000. Reimbursement of KRd for patients with RMM may represent an efficient allocation of the healthcare budget.","[Jakubowiak, Andrzej J.] Univ Chicago, Myeloma Program, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Campioni, Marco; Giannopoulou, Andromachi] Amgen Europe GmbH, Global Hlth Econ, Zug, Switzerland; [Benedict, Agnes; Houisse, Ivan; Tichy, Eszter] Evidera, Modeling & Simulat, Budapest, Hungary; [Aggarwal, Sanjay K.; Barber, Beth L.] Amgen Inc, Global Dev, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Panjabi, Sumeet] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, San Francisco, CA USA",University of Chicago; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Evidera; Amgen; Amgen,"Jakubowiak, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ajakubowiak@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,,,"Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA","Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA(Amgen)","This work was supported by Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA.",,57,36,36,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In particular, we consider two seaports with their respective captive markets and a common inland market for which the ports compete. The ports and the inland belong to three independent regional governments, each making investment decisions on accessibility for its own region. We find that there is a conflict of interest between the port governments and inland government in terms of their jointly making accessibility investment decisions, and that each region's preference over various coalitions is highly affected by ownership type of the competing ports. For public ports, the inland may compensate the port regions to achieve the grand coalition that maximizes total welfare but requires a sizable investment in the port regions. For private ports, however, the port regions benefit from coordinating with the inland and hence may be able to compensate the inland to form the grand coalition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their efficacy for these purposes is dependent on appropriate model selection. In particular, while it can be tempting to incorporate sophisticated and intricate representations of traveller learning in day-to-day models, it is important to ask whether the available data are able to support such a level of model complexity. To this end, our overall aim is to investigate the extent to which it is possible to learn about day-to-day traveller behaviour from observations on traffic counts collected over a sequence of days. The paper makes two specific contributions. The first is the development of a principled Bayesian methodology for comparing day-to-day models using link count data, and a description of how it may be implemented in practice using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The second contribution is a suite of simulation studies that examine whether these techniques can select the correct model within a set of alternatives with a variety of complexities of behavioural representation. We find that successful model choice based on link count data is often poSsible when travellers are relatively sensitive to differences in route utilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To efficiently solve the model, we formulate it as a network min-cost flow problem and propose various pruning techniques that can dramatically reduce the network size.

To do so, we estimate the marginal cost function under the assumption that firms compete on frequency and adjust frequency to maximize profits. Our methodology is applied to Santiago, Chile. In this case, demand is modeled with a simplified model of transit network assignment. The goal is to consider how frequency, capacity, and on-board passengers affect the bus line's demand. The marginal cost function is estimated by using the first-order conditions of the firm's profit maximization problem, using the results of the demand model as data. We conclude that the urban bus transit industry in Santiago exhibits increasing returns to scale for low levels of demand and that these returns are exhausted rapidly at a moderate demand level. Additionally, firms exhibit economies of network expansion, on average. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the peak hours, some queuing passengers cannot board a crowded bus/train, but when the same vehicle arrives at the next stop, some other passengers could still get on. This phenomenon reflects that passengers at different queuing locations have heterogeneous level of ambitions to board. A methodological framework is proposed for the quantitative investigation of WTB. First a general model is proposed, together with a new least square method (LSM) for the calibration. Then, a parametric model is developed, which is also calibrated by the LSM. To refine the calibration method and deal with the biasness of survey data, a weighted least square method is further developed.

Methods: A stochastic microsimulation cost-effectiveness model with a US private-payer perspective and 5-year time horizon was developed. Model flow based on guideline and real-world treatment paradigms incorporated gout flare, serum uric acid (sUA) testing, treatment titration, discontinuation, and adverse events, chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence. Outcomes were estimated for the general gout population and for gout patients with CKD stages 3/4. Modeled treatment interventions were daily oral febuxostat 40-80 mg and allopurinol 100-300 mg. Baseline patient characteristics were taken from epidemiologic studies, efficacy data from randomized controlled trials, adverse event rates from package inserts, and costs from the literature, government sources, and expert opinion. Eight clinically-relevant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated: per patient reaching target sUA, per flare avoided, per CKD incidence, progression, stages 3/4 progression, and stage 5 progression avoided, per incident T2DM avoided, and per death avoided. Results: Five-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the general gout population were $5377 per patient reaching target sUA, $1773 per flare avoided, $221,795 per incident CKD avoided, $29,063 per CKD progression avoided, $36,018 per progression to CKD 3/4 avoided, $71,426 per progression to CKD 5 avoided, $214,277 per incident T2DM avoided, and $217,971 per death avoided. In patients with CKD 3/4, febuxostat dominated allopurinol for all cost-effectiveness outcome measures. Conclusions: Febuxostat may be a cost-effective alternative to allopurinol, especially for patients with CKD stages 3 or 4.","[Smolen, Lee J.; Gahn, James C.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, 201 N Illinois St,Suite 1730, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Mitri, Ghaith] NaviHealth Inc, Brentwood, TN USA; [Shiozawa, Aki] Takeda Pharmaceut Int Inc, Deerfield, IL USA","Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

The sensory profile of wine is significantly affected by microbial activities, and indigenous microorganisms may significantly contribute to the expression of wine typicality. The microbial ecology of wines is complex and includes several species and strains of yeasts, bacteria and molds. Several works showed the positive effects of spontaneous fermentations on the quality of wine as a consequence of the growth of different species and/or strains together at high levels. Furthermore, a new style of natural winemaking is gaining importance, since the resulting wines are obtained thanks to the action of spontaneous autochthonous agents and the use of chemical addition is not allowed. In this contest, natural winemaking could provide enhanced opportunities for products with unique characters and popularly recognized as typical. The present work reports on microbial ecology and molecular profile characterizing natural large-scale vinifications, and an innovative procedure, named fortified pied de cuve, to accelerate the alcoholic fermentation performed spontaneously is also reported. Furthermore, this work reports on how the biotic factors, such as migratory birds, contribute in disseminating of wine-related yeasts over long distances, opening up new fields of research that will allow to unravel connection between wine and environmental factors.

However, the contribution of SREs to the overall economic impact of MM is unclear. The impact of SREs on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs for US patients with MM was analyzed in Truven Health Marketscan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases.Methods:Adults diagnosed with MM between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010 with 2 claims 30 days apart (first claim=index date) were included. SREs included: hypercalcemia, pathologic fracture, surgery for the prevention and treatment of pathologic fractures or spinal cord compression, and radiation for bone pain. Rates of HCRU (outpatient [OP], inpatient [IP], emergency room [ER], orthopedic consultation [OC], and ancillary) and healthcare costs were compared between MM patients with and without SREs. Inverse propensity weighting was applied to adjust for potential bias.Results:Of 1028 MM patients (mean age=67, standard deviation=13.2), 596 patients with 1 SRE and 432 without SREs were assessed. HCRU rates in IP, ER, and ancillary (p<0.01) and mean total costs of OP, IP, and ER were significantly higher (p<0.05) for patients with vs without SREs during follow-up. HCRU rates also increased with SRE frequency (p<0.05 in OP, IP, ER, OC, and ancillary), as did mean total healthcare costs, except for OC (p<0.001).Limitations:A broad assessment of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of MM was not an objective of the current study.

Facilities may have heterogeneous disruption probabilities. When a facility fails, its customers may be reassigned to other surviving ones to hedge against lost-sales costs. We first develop both an exact and an approximate expression for the nonlinear inventory cost, and then formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer programming model. The objective is to minimize the expected total cost across all possible facility failure scenarios. To solve this problem, we design two methods, an exact approach using special ordered sets of type two (SOS2) and a heuristic based on Lagrangian relaxation. We test the model and algorithms on data sets with up to 150 nodes. Computational results show that the proposed algorithms can solve the problem efficiently in reasonable time. Managerial insights on the optimal facility deployment, customer assignments and inventory control strategies are also drawn. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Inspired by recent work on distributionally robust optimization, specifically a Cross Moment (CMM) choice model, we develop a new SUE model that uses the mean and covariance information on path utilities but does not assume the particular form of the distribution. Robustness to distributional assumptions is obtained in this model by minimizing the worst-case expected cost over all distributions with fixed two moments. We show that under mild conditions, the CMM-SUE (Cross Moment-Stochastic User Equilibrium) exists and is unique. By combining a simple projected gradient ascent method to evaluate path choice probabilities with a gradient descent method to find flows, we show that the CMM-SUE is efficiently computable. CMM-SUE provides both modeling flexibility and computational advantages over approaches such as the well-known MNP-SUE (Multinomial Probit-Stochastic User Equilibrium) model that require distributional (normality) assumptions to model correlation effects from overlapping paths. In particular, it avoids the use of simulation methods employed in computations for the distribution-based MNP-SUE model. Preliminary computational results indicate that CMM-SUE provides a practical distributionally robust alternative to MNP-SUE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Both green-time response models are based on the responsive control policy P-0 introduced in Smith (1979a, b, c, 1987). It is shown that, for any steady feasible demand within a flow model, if the general day to day re-routeing model is combined with the general day to day green-time response model then under natural conditions any (flow, green-time) solution trajectory cannot leave the region of supply-feasible (flow, green-time) pairs and costs are bounded. It is also shown that if the more special re-routeing model is combined with the more special green-time response model then every (flow, green-time) solution trajectory converges to a non-empty set of Wardrop equilibria consistent with the P0 control policy. Throughput is maximised in two senses. Given any constant feasible demand; this demand is (i) met as any routeing/green-time trajectory evolves (following either the general or the more special model) and also (ii) met at a Wardrop equilibrium which is consistent with the P0 green-time response. (This is guaranteed to exist, under natural conditions.) The paper then considers control models with explicit queues, and provides a statement of simple pressure driven responsive control policies, where cycle times are all fixed. In these policies stage pressures are given functions of flows, queues and green-times. Finally the paper considers modified Varaiya (2013a, b) and Le et al. (2015) pressure-driven responsive controls on a very simple one junction network. It is shown that (with each of these two modified policies) there is a steady demand within the capacity of the network for which there is no Wardrop equilibrium consistent with the policy. With each of these two modified policies on this simple network, as natural routeing/green-time trajectories evolve queues and delays are unbounded. It is shown that, in contrast, responsive P0 on this simple network does maximise throughput at a quasi-dynamic user equilibrium consistent with P0; queues and delays remain bounded in natural dynamical evolutions in this case. It is to be expected that this P0 result may be extended to allow for certain time-varying demands on a much wider variety of networks, including dynamic networks; to show that this is indeed the case is a challenge for the future.

Both link flows and speeds are treated as independent variables in our bi-objective formulation. The resulting Pareto frontier is thus weakly dominant to that in previous literature. For any such favorable Pareto-efficient flow and speed pattern, we establish the existence of hybrid schemes of speed limits and non-negative/revenue-neutral tolls, whose set of user equilibrium (UE) solutions contains the Pareto-efficient one, and provide sufficient conditions under which the Pareto-efficient solution can be certainly obtained.

Such an objective function is, in general, defined and optimized in a centralized setting, as knowledge regarding the whole network is needed in order to correctly compute it. This is a strong theoretical framework but, in practice, reaching a level of centralization sufficient to achieve said optimality is very challenging. Furthermore, even if centralization was possible, it would exhibit several shortcomings, with concerns such as computational speed (centralized optimization of a huge control set with a highly nonlinear objective function), reliability and communication overhead arising. The main aim of this work is to develop a decomposed heuristic descent algorithm that, demanding the different control entities to share the same information set, attains network-wide optimality through separate control actions.

This solution should be robust enough so that it can be recovered promptly and at low cost in the second stage. In contrast to some related modeling approaches from the literature, this new recoverable robust model is more general in terms of the considered data uncertainty; it can address situations in which uncertainty may be present in any of the following four categories: provider-side uncertainty, receiver-side uncertainty, uncertainty in-between, and uncertainty with respect to the cost parameters. For this novel problem, a sophisticated branch-and-cut framework based on Benders decomposition is designed and complemented by several non-trivial enhancements, including scenario sorting, dual lifting, branching priorities, matheuristics and zero-half cuts. Two large sets of instances that incorporate spatial and demographic information of countries such as Germany and US (transportation) and Bangladesh and the Philippines (disaster management) are introduced.

Repositioning reshuffles in a bay (internal reshuffling) can improve the efficiency of quay cranes and help ports to reduce ship turn-around time. This paper studies the quay crane double-cycling problem with internal-reshuffling operations, and presents a fast solution algorithm. To reduce the number of operations necessary to turn around a bay of a vessel, the problem is first formulated as a new integer program. A polynomial-time heuristic is then developed. The analysis is made on the worst-case error bound of the proposed algorithm. Results are presented for a suite of combinations of problem instances with different bay sizes and workload scenarios. Comparisons are made between our algorithm and the start-of-the-art heuristic. The computational results demonstrate that our model can be solved more efficiently with CPLEX than the model proposed by Meisel and Wichmann (2010), and the proposed algorithm can well solve real-world problem instances within several seconds.

The Amihud liquidity ratio and bid ask spreads are utilized to assess the existence of liquidity risk in the freight derivatives market. Other macroeconomic variables are used to control for market risk. Results indicate that liquidity risk is priced and both liquidity measures have a significant role in determining freight derivatives returns. Consistent with expectations, both liquidity measures are found to have positive and significant effects on the returns of freight derivatives. The results have important implications for modeling freight derivatives, and consequently, for trading and risk management purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The intelligent design of stop locations is one way to improve the quality of PT and thereby improve its ridership. Stop placement is a relatively complex task as it involves a trade-off between two competing goals; accessibility and operation; however this trade-off can be made explicit using an appropriate mathematical model. Many such models have been developed in the literature, however none consider the effects of uneven topography. Topography is an important but often neglected factor in the design of public transportation systems, with the potential to have a significant impact on the accessibility, operation and planning of a transit service. In this work a mathematical modelling approach to bus stop placement is developed which includes considerations of uneven topography in three ways; (1) Its effect on walking speed; (2) Its impact on the attractiveness of an access path to a transit service; and (3) Its effect on acceleration rates at stops. Because of the complexity of the model developed, a heuristic evolutionary algorithm' is employed to approximate an optimal solution to the model. Finally, the model and solution method are applied to a case study in the Auckland CBD area in New Zealand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A systematic literature review and NMA of randomized controlled trials involving anti-virals added to PR were conducted. Electronic database searches and hand searches were conducted to identify relevant publications. Outcomes of interest included sustained virologic response (SVR), incidence of adverse events (AEs), and discontinuation due to AEs. Networks were based on treatment-, dose-, and duration-specific nodes. Sub-group analyses were conducted to investigate heterogeneity, based on Metavir scores, sub-genotypes 1a/1b, and prior response. Results: A total of 15 publications were considered for the base case of the meta-analysis. Simeprevir was associated with higher SVR rates than PR alone. Compared to telaprevir and boceprevir, SVR rates tended to be higher for simeprevir, with odds ratios ranging from 1.27 [0.81-2.00] to 2.61 [1.44-4.74] in treatment-naive and from 1.04 [0.78-1.38] to 1.74 [0.84-3.61] in treatment-experienced patients, respectively. In terms of safety, the risks of anemia and discontinuations due to AEs were lower for simeprevir compared to PR alone, telaprevir, and boceprevir. The risk of rash was lower for simeprevir compared to telaprevir, and similar compared to PR alone and boceprevir. Conclusion: This NMA in genotype 1 HCV patients suggests a similar or better efficacy and tolerability profile for simeprevir compared to telaprevir and boceprevir.","[Taieb, Vanessa; Ho, Sophia; Pettre, Segolene] Amaris, London, England; [Pacou, Maud] Amaris, Paris, France; [Van Sanden, Suzy; Pisini, Marta] Janssen EMEA, Beerse, Belgium; [Ustianowski, Andrew] North Manchester Gen Hosp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Mehnert, Angelika] Janssen Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson,"Taieb, V (通讯作者)，Fitzpatrick Bldg,188 York Way, London N7 9AS, England.",vanessa.taieb@amaris.com,"Taieb, Vanessa/AAW-7488-2020","Taieb, Vanessa/0000-0003-0655-8630; Ustianowski, Andrew/0000-0002-6134-7855","Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium","Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc)","This work was supported by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium.",,49,4,6,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this study is to examine healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and total healthcare costs (THC) for patients with ASCVD in a commercially insured population. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a large, US employer-based, claims database. Patients with an ASCVD diagnosis between October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009 who met eligibility requirements were included. All-cause and ASCVD-related HRU and THC for the first and second year of follow-up were examined for all patients and by the number of arterial beds affected. Adjusted THC were compared across groups with and without polyvascular disease. Results: The analysis included 152,290 patients with ASCVD. Use of CV-related medications, hospitalizations, and office visits were highest among patients with three arterial beds affected. Mean all-cause THC for patients with ASCVD were similar to$19,000 per patient in Year 1 or Year 2, with medical costs as the main driver. ASCVD-related THC were also similar for Year 1 ($8699) and Year 2 ($7925) across all patients. Adjusted all-cause and ASCVD-related THC for both years were greatest for patients with three affected arterial beds compared with one or two affected beds (p<0.001 for each comparison). Conclusions: This is the first study in a managed care setting to systematically estimate all-cause and ASCVD-related THC for an aggregated population of ASCVD patients at high risk for a CV event. The economic burden of ASCVD in working-age patients in the US is substantial. Significantly higher HRU and costs were found in patients with polyvascular disease compared with those with only one affected bed.","[Zhao, Z.; Zhu, Y.; Ye, W.; McCollam, P.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA; [Fang, Y.] PharmaNet i3, Indianapolis, IN USA",Eli Lilly,"Zhao, Z (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, 1400 West Raymond St,DC 5024, Indianapolis, IN 46221 USA.",zhaozhenxiang@lilly.com,,,,,,,0,8,8,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The approach utilizes a combination of a multi-objective optimization model to estimate locations and networks of distribution centers and an assignment model that recognizes distributed service level preferences. Our example application concerns the European continent and is transferable to other regions. The model calibration is able to explain the European port-hinterland distribution structures satisfactorily. We compute novel performance measures that take into account port-hinterland distribution structures. The measures include port-hinterland transport cost, port-hinterland transport.time, and distribution center-hinterland transport time. These measures can provide inputs for port connectivity studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we optimize the route planning of a drone mission that consists of departing from an airport, flying over a set of mission way points and coming back to the initial airport. We assume that during the mission a set of piloted aircraft flies in the same airspace and thus the cost of the drone route depends on the air traffic and on the avoidance maneuvers used to prevent possible conflicts. Two air traffic management techniques, i.e., routing and holding, are modeled in order to maintain a minimum separation between the drone and the piloted aircraft. The considered problem, called the Time Dependent Traveling Salesman Planning Problem in Controlled Airspace (TDTSPPCA), relates to the drone route planning phase and aims to minimize the total operational cost Two heuristic algorithms are proposed for the solution of the problem. A mathematical formulation based on a particular version of the Time Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem, which allows holdings at mission way points, and a Branch and Cut algorithm are proposed for solving the TDTSPPCA to. optimality. An additional formulation, based on a Travelling Salesman Problem variant that uses specific penalties to model the holding times, is proposed and a Cutting Plane algorithm is designed. Finally, computational experiments on real-world air traffic data from Milano Linate Terminal Maneuvering Area are reported to evaluate the performance of the proposed formulations and of the heuristic algorithms.

Patients with evidence of valvular heart disease, valve replacement procedures, or pregnancy during the index hospitalization were excluded. Patients treated with apixaban or warfarin during hospitalization were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for baseline imbalances between patients treated with apixaban or warfarin. Primary outcomes were hospital LOS (days), post-medication administration LOS, and index hospitalization costs, and were compared using paired t-tests in the matched sample.Results: Before PSM, 2894 apixaban and 124,174 warfarin patients were identified. Patients treated with warfarin were older and sicker compared to those treated with apixaban. After applying PSM, a total of 2886 patients were included in each cohort, and baseline characteristics were balanced. The mean (standard deviation [SD] and median) hospital LOS was significantly (p=0.002) shorter for patients treated with apixaban for 5.1 days (5.7 and 3) compared to warfarin for 5.5 days (4.8 and 4). The trend appeared consistent in the hospital LOS from point of apixaban or warfarin administration to discharge (4.5 vs 4.7 days, p=0.051). Patients administered apixaban incurred significantly lower hospitalization costs compared to those administered warfarin ($11,262 vs $12,883; p<0.001).Conclusions: Among NVAF patients, apixaban treatment was associated with significantly shorter hospital LOS and lower costs when compared to warfarin treatment.","[Xie, Lin; Keshishian, Allison; Baser, Onur] STATinMED Res, 211 North 4th Ave,Suite 2B, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Vo, Lien; Singh, Prianka; Bruno, Amanda; Kim, Jully] Bristol Myers Squibb, New York, NY USA; [Price, Kwanza; Mardekian, Jack; Tan, Wilson; Trocio, Jeffrey] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Baser, Onur] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer; Columbia University,"Xie, L (通讯作者)，STATinMED Res, 211 North 4th Ave,Suite 2B, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",lxie@statinmed.com,"Xie, Lin/AAX-2889-2020",,Pfizer Inc; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,Pfizer Inc(Pfizer); Bristol-Myers Squibb Company(Bristol-Myers Squibb),Study funding provided by Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.,,38,13,13,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

By matching the dates of patients' receipt of monthly Social Security (SS) payments and the dates of prescription orders for 559 Medicare beneficiaries who were primary SS claimants at high risk of hospitalization in an urban academic medical center, this study identified patients who ordered their outpatient prescription within 2 days of receipt of monthly SS payments in 2014. The predictive power of this information on CRN was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results: Among the 559 Medicare patients at high risk of hospitalization, 137 (25%) reported CRN. Among those with CRN, 96 (70%) had ordered prescriptions on receipt of SS payments one or more times in 2014. The area under the Receiver Operating Curve was 0.70 using the predictive model in multivariate logistic regression analysis.Conclusion: With a new approach to combining the survey data and EHR data, patients' behavior in delaying filling of prescription until funds from SS checks become available can be measured, providing some predictive value for cost-related medication non-adherence. The big-data approach is a valuable tool to identify patients at risk of CRN and can be further expanded to the general population and sub-populations, providing a meaningful risk-stratification for CRN and facilitating physician-patient communication to reduce CRN.","[Zhang, James X.; Meltzer, David O.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Hosp Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meltzer, David O.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meltzer, David O.] Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Zhang, JX (通讯作者)，Dept Med, Sect Hosp Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC 5000, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",xzhang1@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,"Zhang, James/HHS-8616-2022; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Zhang, James X./AFN-7901-2022","Zhang, James X./0000-0002-6251-0474",Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Foundation [73487]; Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research,Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Foundation; Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research,"This study is funded in part by a grant from Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Foundation 73487 (Meltzer), and a Pilot and Feasibility Grant from Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research (Zhang & Meltzer).",,24,8,10,1,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This problem is referred as the simultaneous Service type Assignment and container Routing Problem (SARP) in the sequel. A path-flow based mixed integer linear programming formulation is suggested for the SARP. A Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm is used to solve the SARP exactly. A Column Generation (CG) procedure, embedded within the BB framework, is devised to solve the linear programming relaxation of the SARP. The CG subproblems arises as Shortest Path Problems (SPP). Yet incorporating transit time requirements yields constrained SPP which is NP-hard and solved by a label correcting algorithm. Computational experiments are performed on randomly generated test instances mimicking real life. The BB algorithm yields promising solutions for the SARP. The SARP with and without transit time constraints is compared with each other. Our results suggest a potential to increase profit margins of liner shipping companies by considering transit time requirements of cargos. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Akyuz, M.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used MarketScan (R) Commercial and Medicare Supplemental data from January 1, 2009-December 31, 2013. The identified population included patients with T2DM and >= 1 additional oral anti-diabetic prescription (of the same regimen [FDC/LDC] as the index prescription) within 12 months following the fill date. Persistence (no >= 30-day gap) and adherence (medication possession ratio [MPR] >= 0.8) were assessed as primary end-points; secondary end-points included hypoglycemia, healthcare resource utilization, and costs. Results: Of 23,361 patients identified, 12,590 (53.9%) were on FDC therapy and 10,771 (46.1%) were on LDC therapy. FDC patients had a significantly lower rate of non-persistence (67.9% vs 73.4%, p < 0.0001) and a significantly higher rate of adherence to therapy (57.0% vs 50.7%, p < 0.0001) when compared to LDC patients. Average time to non-persistence was significantly longer among FDC vs LDC patients (207.1 vs 186.3 days, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, the odds of non-persistence were 21% lower with FDC vs LDC therapy (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.74-0.85, p < 0.0001), with a 28% higher odds of adherence (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.20-1.36, p < 0.0001). Differences in most secondary outcomes significantly favored FDC therapy, including total predicted monthly all-cause costs ($1008 vs $1053; p = 0.006) and T2DM-related costs ($142 vs $155; p < 0.001). Limitations: Cohort classification was based on prescription claims data. The lack of clinical data limits assessment of potential influencers of FDC vs LDC decisions, residual confounding was possible, and diabetes-related medical costs only captured claims with a primary diagnosis for diabetes. The results may not be generalizable to populations such as Medicaid. Conclusion: Management of T2DM using FDC therapies provides a compliance benefit relative to LDC therapies that may translate to reductions in healthcare utilization and costs.","[Lokhandwala, Tasneem] Xcenda, Tampa, FL USA; [Smith, Nancy] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA; [Sternhufvud, Catarina; Sorstadius, Elisabeth] AstraZeneca, Molndal, Sweden; [Lee, Won Chan] Xcenda, 999 Bayhill Dr,Suite 300, San Bruno, CA 94066 USA; [Mukherjee, Jayanti] Bristol Myers Squibb, Wallingford, CT USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Bristol-Myers Squibb; AstraZeneca; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Bristol-Myers Squibb","Lee, WC (通讯作者)，Xcenda, 999 Bayhill Dr,Suite 300, San Bruno, CA 94066 USA.",won.lee@xcenda.com,,"Lokhandwala, Tasneem/0000-0002-1983-9557",AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),This study was funded by AstraZeneca.,,21,35,38,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The uncertainty of service time is considered. The robust optimization approach yields routes that minimize total cost while being less sensitive to substantial deviations of service times. A robust optimization model is developed and solved by the branch-and-cut method. In computational experiments, the behavior of the robust solutions and their performance are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation.

However, in some processes, such as wine making a widespread use of starter cultures did not come up until the end of the 20th Century, when the cellar-friendly active dry wine yeast (ADWY) were available. However, this practice was challenged for the uniformity that brought a limited number of commercially available presentations and new tendencies in wine making have withdrawn the use of ADWY. The return to non-controlled wine fermentations may have considerable set backs especially in terms of economical losses, as these wines have much higher risks of presenting different levels of spoilage (presence of unwanted compounds that will be organoleptically detectable) that will not be acceptable for the consumer. The WILDWINE Project (EU contract 315065) proposed a system to overcome the criticism on the uniformity after use of ADWY by bringing wild microorganisms to the starter culture practice. The Project proposed mixed cultures as an alternative to single strain cultures that is the usual practice for starter cultures. This multi-strain and multi-species starter cultures aimed at reproducing the vineyard natural microbiota with the advantage of a selection of those strains and species that could add complexity to the final wines. The WILDWINE Project has focused the selection of this wild microorganism in 5 worldwide-recognised wine regions: Nemea and Crete (Greece), Piedmont (Italy), Bordeaux (France) and Priorat (Spain). The basic protocol was the same for all the regions: (i) to establish the natural biodiversity of the regions and determine the microbial fingerprint of the region, (ii) oenological screening of all the strains and species isolates to determine their quality for the wine making process and (iii) to use the microbial cocktails at pilot plants and in commercial cellars to determine the microbial footprint that the wild microorganisms leave on the final wines. In the Priorat region, a limited number of different strains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were detected after sampling cellars and vineyards in two different harvests (2012 and 2013). These low number of S. cerevisiae strains is in sharp contrast with the high biodiversity observed in the same area 18 years before when a selection of strains of this species was preformed to provide a commercial autochthonous strain for the Priorat region. Furthermore, the main species found in the vineyards were the yeast-like fungus Aerobasidium pullulans and Hanseniaspora uvarum. A. pullulans disappeared when grapes were turned into must and then H. uvarum and Candida zemplinina were the main species. Minority species found in musts and later in wines were Metschnokowia pulcherrima and Torulaspora delbrueckii. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Using consistent, robust methodology, this study estimated HRU associated with the treatment of metastatic melanoma in eight countries. Methods Using published literature and clinician input, treatment phases were identified: active systemic treatment (pre-progression); disease progression; best supportive care (BSC)/palliative care; and terminal care. HRU elements were identified for each phase and estimates of the magnitude and frequency of use in clinical practice were obtained through country-specific Delphi panels, comprising healthcare professionals with experience in oncology (n = 8). Results Medical oncologists are the key care providers for patients with metastatic melanoma, although in Germany dermato-oncologists also lead care. During the active systemic treatment phase, each patient was estimated to require 0.83-2 consultations with a medical oncologist/month across countries; the median number of such assessments in 3 months was highest in Canada (range = 3.5-5) and lowest in France, the Netherlands and Spain (1). Resource use during the disease progression phase was intensive and similar across countries: all patients were estimated to consult with medical oncologists and 10-40% with a radiation oncologist; up to 40% were estimated to require a brain MRI scan. During the BSC/palliative care phase, all patients were estimated to consult with medical oncologists, and most to consult with a primary care physician (40-100%). Limitations Panelists were from centers of excellence, thus results may not reflect care within smaller hospitals; data obtained from experts may be less variable than data from broader clinical practice. Treatments for metastatic melanoma are continually emerging, thus some elements of our work could be superseded. Conclusions HRU estimates were substantial and varied across countries for some resources. These data could be used with country-specific costs to elucidate costs for the management of metastatic melanoma.","[McKendrick, Jan; Gijsen, Merel; Quinn, Casey] PRMA Consulting, Fleet, England; [Barber, Beth; Zhao, Zhongyun] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Amgen,"McKendrick, J (通讯作者)，PRMA Consulting Ltd, Harvest Crescent, Linea House,Ancells Business Pk, Fleet GU51 2UZ, Hants, England.",jmckendrick@prmaconsulting.com,,,"Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA","Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA(Amgen)","This study was sponsored by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA.",,43,2,2,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aimed to provide estimates of health resource utilization (HRU) and cost associated with all SRE types in Europe. HRU data were reported previously; cost data are reported herein. Methods Eligible patients from 49 centers across Austria (n = 57), the Czech Republic (n = 59), Finland (n = 60), Greece (n = 59), Portugal (n = 59), and Sweden (n = 62) had bone metastases or lesions secondary to breast, lung, or prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, and >= 1 index SRE (a SRE preceded by a SRE-free period of >= 6.5 months). SRE-related costs were estimated from a payer perspective using health resource utilization data from patient charts (before and after the index SRE diagnosis). Country-specific unit costs were from 2010 and local currencies were converted to 2010 euros. Results The mean costs across countries were (sic) 7043, (sic)5242, (sic)11,101, and (sic)11,509 per radiation to bone, pathologic fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression event, respectively. Purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted mean cost ratios were similar in most countries, with the exception of radiation to bone. Limitations The overall burden of SREs may have been under-estimated owing to home visits and evaluations outside the hospital setting not being reported here. Conclusions All SREs were associated with substantial costs.

This paper proposes a conflict-based path-generation approach for evacuation planning. Its key idea is to decompose the evacuation planning problem into a master and a subproblem. The subproblem generates new evacuation paths for each evacuated area, while the master problem optimizes the flow of evacuees and produce an evacuation plan. Each new path is generated to remedy conflicts in the evacuation flows and adds new columns and a new row in the master problem. The algorithm is applied to a set of large-scale evacuation scenarios ranging from the Hawkesbury-Nepean flood plain (West Sydney, Australia) which require evacuating in the order of 70,000 persons, to the New Orleans metropolitan area and its 1,000,000 residents. Experiments illustrate the scalability of the approach which is able to produce evacuation for scenarios with more than 1200 nodes, while a direct Mixed Integer Programming formulation becomes intractable for instances with more than 5 nodes. With this approach, realistic evacuations scenarios can be solved near-optimally in reasonable time, supporting both evacuation planning in strategic, tactical, and operational environments.

Car-users may have to cruise for on-street parking before reaching their destinations. The accessibility and the cost of parking significantly influence people's travel behavior (such as mode choice, or parking facility choice between on-street and garage). The cruising flow causes delays eventually to everyone, even users with destinations outside limited parking areas. It is therefore important to understand the impact of parking limitation on mobility, and to identify efficient parking policies for travel cost reduction. Most existing studies on parking fall short in reproducing the dynamic spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion in general, lack the treatment of dynamics of the cruising-for-parking phenomenon, or require detailed input data that are typically costly and difficult to collect. In this paper, we propose an aggregated and dynamic approach for modeling multimodal traffic with the treatment on parking, and utilize the approach to design dynamic parking pricing strategies. The proposed approach is based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), which can capture congestion dynamics at network-level for single-mode and bi-modal (car and bus) systems. A parsimonious parking model is integrated into the MFD-based multimodal modeling framework, where the dynamics of vehicular and passenger flows are considered with a change in the aggregated behavior (e.g. mode choice and parking facility choice) caused by cruising and congestion. Pricing strategies are developed with the objective of reducing congestion, as well as lowering the total travel cost of all users. A case study is carried out for a bi-modal city network with a congested downtown region. An elegant feedback dynamic parking pricing strategy can effectively reduce travel delay of cruising and the generic congestion. Remarkably, such strategy, which is applicable in real-time management with limited available data, is fairly as efficient as a dynamic pricing scheme obtained from system optimum conditions and a global optimization with full information about the future states of the system. Stackelberg equilibrium is also investigated in a competitive behavior between different parking facility operators. Policy indications on on-street storage capacity management and pricing are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike previous studies this paper examines a time-of-day HOV lane. During the non-HOV periods the study lane reverts to a GP lane, thereby providing a control condition for the specific lane and location. This work uses the single vehicle passage (svp) method to group vehicle passages before measuring the traffic state and extends the svp to bin vehicles in the study lane based on the relative speed to the adjacent lane. The extended svp method allows the work to also study the impacts during the non-HOV periods when the study lane serves GP vehicles. This work finds that: (1) during the non-HOV periods the study lane exhibited behavior indistinguishable from the adjacent GP lane. (2) The sympathy of speeds persists throughout the day, even when the study lane serves GP vehicles. (3) The relative speed to the adjacent lane provided a better predictor of behavior than whether or not the HOV restriction is active. In short, the car following behavior that gives rise to the sympathy of speeds is unrelated to the HOV restriction per se, persisting under GP operations as well.. This dependency on the relative speed in the adjacent lane is an important finding given the fact that most existing car following models assume that the longitudinal acceleration of a following vehicle is strictly a function of the relationship to the leading vehicle in the same lane. Because drivers in general adopt a larger spacing when faced with a high differential in speed between lanes means that car following behavior also depends on the relative speed to the adjacent lane. This fact has likely gone unnoticed to date because generally the conditions that give rise to a differential in speeds between lanes are usually short lived, and thus, do not become apparent in conventional macroscopic data except under exceptional circumstances that include confounding factors like HOV operations.

The short-term interactions between these two systems can be highly significant and influential to their individual performance. The urban parking system, for example, can affect the searching-for-parking traffic, influencing not only overall travel speeds in the network (traffic performance), but also total driven distance (environmental conditions). In turn, the traffic performance can also affect the time drivers spend searching for parking, and ultimately, parking usage. In this study, we propose a methodology to model macroscopically such interactions and evaluate their effects on urban congestion. The model is built on a matrix describing how, over time, vehicles in an urban area transition from one parking-related state to another. With this model it is possible to estimate, based on the traffic and parking demand as well as the parking supply, the amount of vehicles searching for parking, the amount of vehicles driving on the network but not searching for parking, and the amount of vehicles parked at any given time. More importantly, it is also possible to estimate the total (or average) time spent and distance driven within each of these states. Based on that, the model can be used to design and evaluate different parking policies, to improve (or optimize) the performance of both systems. A simple numerical example is provided to show possible applications of this type. Parking policies such as increasing parking supply or shortening the maximum parking duration allowed (i.e., time controls) are tested, and their effects on traffic are estimated. The preliminary results show that time control policies can alleviate the parking-caused traffic issues without the need for providing additional parking facilities. Results also show that parking policies that intend to reduce traffic delay may, at the same time, increase the driven distance and cause negative externalities. Hence, caution must be exercised and multiple traffic metrics should be evaluated before selecting these policies. Overall, this paper shows how the system dynamics of urban traffic, based on its parking-related-states, can be used to efficiently evaluate the urban traffic and parking systems macroscopically. The proposed model can be used to estimate both, how parking availability can affect traffic performance (e.g., average time searching for parking, number of cars searching for parking); and how different traffic conditions (e.g., travel speed, density in the system) can affect drivers ability to find parking. Moreover, the proposed model can be used to study multiple strategies or scenarios for traffic operations and control, transportation planning, land use planning, or parking management and operations.

They are more flexible than round-trip carsharing, where the vehicle can only be returned to the station where it was picked up, and can be used for daily commuting trips as well. This flexibility, however, comes at a cost of vehicle stock imbalance within the network. Several solutions and strategies have been suggested to counter this problem, one of which is variable trip pricing. By charging high prices for the trips that increase imbalance and lowering prices for trips that help improve the balance, it has been hypothesized, but never demonstrated, that the clients' behavior could be used to balance the vehicle stocks and thus make carsharing systems more manageable and profitable. In this paper, we develop a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model, defined as the Trip Pricing Problem for One-Way Carsharing Systems (TPPOCS), which sets these prices in order to maximize profit. An iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic is proposed for solving it. The method is applied to the theoretical' case-study of a network of 75 stations distributed across the city of Lisbon (Portugal). Although the implemented metaheuristic is tuned for the Lisbon example, the generic nature of its operators makes the model applicable elsewhere. The results demonstrate that the trip pricing strategy can be used to increase profit through a more balanced system. If no price-based balancing strategies are applied, operating this service results in a daily deficit of (sic)1161. When the trip pricing policy is applied, profits of 2068 (sic)/day are possible. The optimal prices are on average 23% higher than the base price, and 18% less demand is served, but the enhanced performance leads to lower expenses with the fleet of vehicles and number of parking spaces.

We propose two inference methods based on the likelihood principle, assuming each link associates with a random travel time. The first method considers independent and Gaussian distributed link travel times, using the additive property that trip time has a closed-form distribution as the summation of link travel times. We particularly analyze the mean estimates when the variances of trip time estimates are known with a high degree of precision and examine the uniqueness of solutions. Two cases are discussed in detail: one with known paths of all trips and the other with unknown paths of some trips. We apply the Gaussian mixture model and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to deal with the latter. The second method splits trip time proportionally among links traversed to deal with more general link travel time distributions such as log-normal. This approach builds upon an expected log-likelihood function which naturally leads to an iterative procedure analogous to the EM algorithm for solutions. Simulation tests on a simple nine-link network and on the Sioux Falls network respectively indicate that the two methods both perform well. The second method (i.e., trip splitting approximation) generally runs faster but with larger errors of estimated standard deviations of link travel times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential benefits of BSS, mainly sustainability, health and equity, have encouraged their adoption through support and promotion by mayors in Europe and North America alike. In most cases municipal governments desire their BSS to be successful and, with few exceptions, state them as being so. New technological improvements have dramatically simplified the use and enforcement of bicycle return, resulting in the widespread adoption of BSS. Unfortunately little evaluation of the effectiveness of differently distributed and managed BSS has taken place. Comparing BSS systems quantitatively is challenging due to the limited data made available. The metrics of success presented by municipalities are often too general or incomparable to others making relative evaluations of BSS success arduous. This paper presents multiple methodologies allowing the estimation of the number of daily trips, the most significant measure of BSS usage, based on data that is commonly available, the number of bicycles available at a station over time. Results provide model coefficients as well as trip count estimates for select cities. Of four spatial and temporal aggregate models the day level aggregation is found to be most effective for estimation. In addition to trip estimation this work provides a rigorous formalization of station level data and the ability to distinguish spatio-temporal rebalancing quantities as well as new characteristics of BSS station use.

To increase practicality, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve real size problems. Results show that initial incremental investments in network improvement are more profound in reducing the death toll than higher budget increments. Moreover, higher relief inventories reduce the death toll when the network is reliable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent researches have shown that this problem can be simply applied on a graph with a minimal number of nodes and edges when the fundamental diagram is triangular (sufficient variational graph - SVG). Such a graph accounts for traffic signal settings on an urban arterial and leads to mean traffic states for the total arterial in free-flow or congested stationary conditions. The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) can then be directly estimated. In this paper, we extend this method to provide the complete distribution of deterministic travel times observed on an arterial. First, we will show how to obtain a tight estimation of the arterial capacity by properly identifying the most constraining part of the SVG. Then, we will show that a modified version of the SVG allows the exact calculation of the cumulative count curves at the entry and exit of an arterial. It is finally possible to derive the full travel time distributions for any dynamic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We make use of Benders Decomposition to project out the flow variables from the formulation.

This paper studies the location, service charge and capacity decision of an inland river port to maximize its revenue or profit. The cargo shippers are assumed to be uniformly distributed along the inland river and can be shipped to the junction port via pure road transportation service or transshipment service with the inland river port. The natural heterogeneity of the river' navigational condition is modeled by a location-dependent waterway transportation cost and the service congestion on the port is captured by the M/M/1 queueing model. We analytically investigate the properties of the optimal solutions for various decision problems associated with the inland river port. The effects of the natural heterogeneity and port service congestion of those optimal solutions are investigated. Those theoretical results are carefully examined in the case study of the Yangtze River. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-level iteration method is proposed for solving the hybrid problem, in which the approximate subgradient projection method is used for the outer level iteration phase, and the partial linearization method is used for the inner level iteration phase. We prove the convergence of the two-level iteration method, under the condition that the subproblem for the inner level iteration is only solved approximately, which makes the method efficient and practical. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of the two-level iteration method to the trial-and-error congestion pricing scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The Cardiff Model was used to simulate disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on patients. Systematic literature reviews and hospital surveys were conducted to obtain patients profiles, clinical data, and costs. Health insurance costs (2014(sic)) were estimated over a 40-year period. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: SAXA+MET had lower predicted incidences of cardiovascular and hypoglycemia events and a decreased total cost compared with GLI+MET ((sic)241,072,807 vs (sic)285,455,177). There were increased numbers of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 1.01/patient) and life-years (Lys; 0.03/patient) gained with SAXA+MET compared with GLI+MET, and the incremental cost of SAXA+MET vs GLI+MET (-(sic)44,382) resulted in -(sic)43,883/QALY and -(sic)1,710,926/LY gained with SAXA+MET. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the results were robust. Conclusion: In patients with T2DM in China, SAXA+MET was more cost-effective and was well tolerated with fewer adverse effects (AEs) compared with GLI+MET. As a second-line therapy for T2DM, SAXA may address some of the unmet medical needs attributable to AEs in the treatment of T2DM.","[Gu, Shuyan; Dong, Hengjin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Deng, Jing] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD USA; [Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Syst & Dev, New Orleans, LA USA; [Mu, Yiming] Chinese Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Chinese PLA Med Coll, Beijing 100853, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Tulane University; Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital,"Dong, HJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",donghj@zju.edu.cn,"shi, li/HSF-9608-2023",,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca.,,72,10,11,1,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We use a standard mathematical model (Albrecht et al., 2015b; Howlett, 2000; Howlett et al., 2009; Khmelnitsky, 2000; Liu and Golovitcher, 2003) to define the problem and show by explicit calculation of switching points that the formula also applies for all basic control subsequences within the optimal strategy on appropriately chosen fixed track segments. The rate of change was initially derived as a known strictly decreasing function of the optimal driving speed in a text edited by Isayev (1987, Section 14.2, pp 259-260) using an empirical resistance function. An elegant derivation by Liu and Golovitcher (2003, Section 3) with a general resistance function required an underlying assumption that the optimal strategy is unique and that the associated optimal driving speed is a strictly decreasing and continuous function of journey time. An earlier proof of uniqueness (Khmelnitsky, 2000) showed that the optimal driving speed decreases when journey time increases. A subsequent constructive proof (Albrecht et al., 2013a, 2015c) used a local energy minimization principle to find optimal switching points and show explicitly that the optimal driving speed is a strictly decreasing and continuous function of journey time. Our new derivation of the key formula also uses the local energy minimization principle and depends on the following observations. If no speed limits are imposed the optimal strategy consists of a finite sequence of phases with only five permissible control modes. By considering all basic control subsequences and subdividing the track into suitably chosen fixed segments we show that the key formula is valid on each individual segment. The formula is extended to the entire journey by summation. The veracity of the formula is demonstrated with an elementary but realistic example. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We explicitly model the road congestion by formulating each route as a queue where the travel time is an increasing function of the state. The booking process is also modeled in the rental station queue so that the efficiency loss caused by the reservation policy can be captured. The mixed queuing network falls into Baskett, Chandy, Muntz and Palacios (BCMP) networks with unique product-form equilibrium distribution. We derive the asymptotic behavior as the parking capacities and fleet size grows, and show that the performance of carsharing systems will be proportionally bounded by that of the bottleneck route. The exact mean value analysis (MVA) algorithm and the approximate Schweitzer-Bard mean value analysis (SB-MVA) algorithm are extended here to solve networks with different sizes. The numerical experiments reveal some interesting findings: (1) The higher customer service rate (the smaller pick-up time window) will generate the optimal design with lower parking capacities and lower fleet size; (2) Neglecting the efficiency loss due to reservation will lead to an overestimate of the profit and other system performances as well; and (3) Given different levels of congestion on the existing road network (the non-shared car traffic), the net revenue is maximized when the existing traffic congestion is moderate.

Clinical inputs came from the published literature (both randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) identified through a systematic literature review, and cost inputs came from national list prices and unpublished internal market data. Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) was conducted on the budget impact results to assess their robustness.Results: Optical diagnosis with NBI offered cost savings vs white light endoscopy (WLE) over 7 years due to reductions in histological exams, resections, and associated adverse events, while having minimal impact on health outcomes. Budget impact analysis demonstrated annual cost savings of 141 192 057 over 7 years, with histological exams being the biggest cost driver. DSA showed these results to be robust, but most sensitive to the cost of tariff with and without biopsy, and the cost of histological exam. Break-even analysis to explore how changing the unit cost and number of biopsies per patient would change the budget impact found NBI consistently offered net savings, even if the cost of biopsy was 0.Limitations: Although every effort was made to ensure robustness of results, as with any model, there were some limitations including a lack of published data for certain clinical inputs and potential variation between model inputs and real-life cost and market share values.Conclusions: Optical diagnosis with NBI was found to be equally effective compared with the standard of care (WLE), while potentially enabling cost savings from the NHS England perspective.","[Solon, Caroline] CBPartners, San Francisco, CA USA; [Klausnitzer, Romy; Ihara, Zenichi] OLYMPUS EUROPA SE & CO KG, Wendenstr 14-18, D-20097 Hamburg, Germany; [Blissett, Deirdre] CBPartners, London, England",Olympus Corporation,"Ihara, Z (通讯作者)，OLYMPUS EUROPA SE & CO KG, Wendenstr 14-18, D-20097 Hamburg, Germany.",zenichi.ihara@olympus-europa.com,,"Solon, Caroline/0000-0002-5293-9437; Klausnitzer, Romy/0000-0002-7584-8271; Ihara, Zenichi/0000-0003-0613-0263",OLYMPUS EUROPA SE CO.

However, the inherent network loading sub-problem in link-based DTD models induces high computational burden which precludes their broad practical applicability. To address this challenge, this study proposes three approximation models for the DTD traffic flow evolution process based on the sensitivity analysis of the network loading sub-problem in a link-based DTD model. In particular, a first-order approximation (FOA) model is formulated based on the derivative of link flow solutions with respect to perturbations on network characteristics. To improve the approximation accuracy of the FOA model, a second-order approximation (SOA) model and a variable reduced approximation (VRA) model are developed. The applicability conditions of the proposed approximation models are derived. A small numerical example demonstrates that the FOA model performs well when perturbations are small and the approximation accuracy reduces as the scale of perturbations increases. The SOA and VRA models can improve the approximation accuracy of the FOA model, at the cost of computing the second-order derivative and the reference link flow pattern, respectively.

Integer Programming problems are formed for the optimization problem in different scales, and the Lagrangian Relaxation is adapted to extend the problem further into larger scale. Network based partitioning of demands are also proposed and tested. Numerical results are provided, and a case study is presented. In the case study, the facility location problem takes into consideration of both disaster triggered and usual EMS demand that forms a worst case scenario.

This study investigates a morning commute problem with carpooling behavior under parking space constraint at destination. We consider such a scenario that as a competing mode of the transit line, the highway contains a carpool lane only used by carpoolers while all solo drivers are forced to use a general purpose (GP) lane. Unlike the standard bottleneck model, the rush-hour dynamic departure patterns with a binding parking supply vary with the relative proportion of the two lanes' capacities. The possible departure pattern domain with different parking supply and lane capacity allocation is explored in terms of the relative extra carpool cost and distinguished between the bi-mode and multi-mode equilibria. It is found that compared with solo drivers, carpoolers have shorter rush hour in order to smooth the extra carpool cost. With the decrease of parking spots, the number of solo drivers cuts down gradually, whilst the number of carpoolers climbs up firstly and then declines in the multi-mode system. Under mild assumptions, the best system performance can be realized with the joint consideration of total travel cost and vehicle emission cost through optimizing the lane capacity allocation and the parking supply.

Therefore, researchers have attempted to develop reasonable low-cost approaches to estimating the OD vector, such as OD estimation based on traffic sensor data. In this estimation approach, the location problem for the sensors is critical. One type of sensor that can be used for this purpose, on which this paper focuses, is vehicle identification sensors. The information collected by these sensors that can be employed for OD estimation is discussed in this paper. We use data gathered by vehicle identification sensors that include an ID for each vehicle and the time at which the sensor detected it. Based on these data, the subset of sensors that detected a given vehicle and the order in which they detected it are available. In this paper, four location models are proposed, all of which consider the order of the sensors. The first model always yields the minimum number of sensors to ensure the uniqueness of path flows. The second model yields the maximum number of uniquely observed paths given a budget constraint on the sensors. The third model always yields the minimum number of sensors to ensure the uniqueness of OD flows. Finally, the fourth model yields the maximum number of uniquely observed OD flows given a budget constraint on the sensors. For several numerical examples, these four models were solved using the GAMS software. These numerical examples include several medium-sized examples, including an example of a real-world large-scale transportation network in Mashhad. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The initial train timetable takes into account possible smaller disturbances, which can be compensated within the schedule. Bigger disruptions, such as accidents, rolling stock breakdown, prolonged passenger boarding, and changed speed limit cause delays that require train rescheduling. In this paper, we introduce a train rescheduling method based on reinforcement learning, and more specifically, Q-learning. We present here the Q-learning principles for train rescheduling, which consist of a learning agent and its actions, environment and its states, as well as rewards. The use of the proposed approach is first illustrated on a simple rescheduling problem comprising a single-lane track with three trains. The evaluation of the approach is performed on extensive set of experiments carried out on a real-world railway network in Slovenia. The empirical results show that Q-learning lead to rescheduling solutions that are at least equivalent and often superior to those of several basic rescheduling methods that do not rely on learning agents. The solutions are learned Within reasonable computational time, a crucial factor for real-time applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Common Agricultural Policy pays more and more attention to these territories, in particular to their development. In this work it is argued that a generic agricultural and/ or socioeconomic characterization might be not sufficient to understand these territories, to formulate appropriate policies and ultimately to evaluate the effectiveness of such policy measures. In our view, the agricultural character is closely related to the farmland natural attributes as well as to the specific farming activities while the rural character is more related to the functional relationships with the urban areas. Hence, a methodology is discussed to classify a geographical space based on a simple measure of urbanization and to provide a classification that considers multiple degrees of urbanization and/ or rurality. The method is applied to municipality data for the Lombardy region to distinguish network-based urban systems from mono-centric cities and to classify non-urban territories accordingly, separating rural from peri-urban areas. Statistical tests are conducted to study the extent to which the different typologies of territories identified differ with respect to a set of agricultural characteristics. Substantial differences in agriculture are highlighted between urban and rural areas as well as among non-urban areas, suggesting that more rigorous definitions of rural can best used to program policies for sustainable local development.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon beta-1a vs interferon beta-1a (44 mcg SC 3 times per week) and glatiramer acetate (20mg SC once-daily) in the treatment of RRMS from the perspective of a US payer over 10 years. Methods A Markov cohort economic model was developed for this analysis. The model predicts disability progression, occurrence of relapses and other adverse events and translates them into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. Natural history data were obtained from the placebo arm of the ADVANCE trial of peginterferon beta-1a, the London Ontario (Canada) database and a large population-based MS survey. Comparative efficacy of each DMT vs placebo was obtained from a network meta-analysis. Costs (in 2014 US dollars) were sourced from public databases and literature. Clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Results Over 10 years, peginterferon beta-1a was dominant (i.e., more effective and less costly), with cost-savings of $22,070 and additional 0.06 QALYs when compared with interferon beta-1a 44 mcg and with cost-savings of $19,163 and 0.07 QALYs gained when compared with glatiramer acetate 20mg. Results were most sensitive to variations in the treatment effect of each DMT, treatment acquisition costs of each DMT and the time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that peginterferon beta-1a remains dominant in >90% of 5,000 replications compared with either DMTs. Conclusion This analysis suggests that long-term treatment with peginterferon beta-1a improves clinical outcomes at reduced costs compared with interferon beta-1a 44 mcg and glatiramer acetate 20mg and should be a valuable addition to managed care formularies for treating patients with RRMS.","[Hernandez, Luis; Guo, Shien] Evidera, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Kinter, Elizabeth] Biogen, Landis & Gyr Str 3, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland; [Fay, Monica] Biogen, 133 Boston Post Rd, Weston, MA 02493 USA",Evidera; Biogen,"Hernandez, L (通讯作者)，Evidera, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",luis.hernandez@evidera.com,"Hernandez, Luis/AAH-1819-2021","Hernandez, Luis/0000-0002-9532-546X",Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),This study was funded by Biogen.,,62,16,17,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

For a given weekly multi-type shipment demand pattern in a particular season, the proposed problem aims to maximize the total seasonal shipping profit by determining the number of multi-type containers to be transported and assigned on each container route, the number of containerships deployed on each ship route, and the sailing speed of containerships on each shipping leg subject to both the volume and capacity constraints of each containership. By adopting the realistic bunker consumption rate of a containership as a function of its sailing speed and payload (displacement), we develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programing with a nonconvex objective function for the proposed liner container seasonal shipping revenue management problem. A tailored branch and bound (B&B) method is designed to obtain the global epsilon-optimal solution of the model. Numerical experiments are finally conducted to assess the efficiency of the solution algorithm and to show the applicability of the developed model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, these are a concern to health authorities especially given the low age of onset. Consequently, there is a need to treat BPD patients well and improve their quality-of-life. Pharmacotherapy includes mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics (AAPs). AAPs have different mechanisms of action and side-effects, so treatment needs to be tailored. Asenapine in clinical trials is as effective as olanzapine, with less metabolic side-effects.Methods:Chitnis and colleagues assessed the cost-effectiveness of asenapine among patients in healthcare databases.Results and Conclusion:They showed in routine care that asenapine also reduces hospital and emergency room admissions, making it cost neutral in BPD, which is of interest to health authorities and clinicians.","[Godman, Brian] Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Karolinska Inst, Dept Lab Med, Div Clin Pharmacol, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; University of Strathclyde,"Godman, B (通讯作者)，Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Karolinska Inst, Dept Lab Med, Div Clin Pharmacol, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.",brian.godman@ki.se,"Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019","Godman, Brian/0000-0001-6539-6972",,,,,20,2,2,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Other route-use patterns such as the passenger share and the mean and variance of route travel times were also estimated. The performance of the present approach was compared with the existing method, which depends on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The present approach showed better performance in reproducing the observed number of routes used, and also provided greater flexibility in recognizing route-use patterns through the marginal posterior distribution of other unknown parameters.

In this paper, we focus on a common destination ridesharing system which is of interest in large organizations such as companies and government offices. Particularly, such organizations are looking at using company owned vehicles to offer a ridesharing service by which employees carpool to work thus leading to several benefits that include decreasing pressure on on-campus parking spaces, lowering localized on-campus congestion, in addition to offering a greener transportation mode while lowering transportation costs for employees. Based on discussions with our industry partners, optimizing the distribution of limited number of company vehicles while insuring robustness against unlikely vehicle unavailability is of critical importance. Thus in this paper, we present a stochastic mixed integer programming model to optimize the allocation of shared vehicles to employees while taking into account the unforeseen event of vehicle unavailability which would require some participants to take own vehicles or rerouting of existing vehicles. Since solving the proposed model to optimality is computationally challenging for problems of large sizes, we also propose a heuristic that is capable of finding good quality solutions in limited computational time. The proposed model and heuristic are tested on several instances of varying sizes showing the computational performance. Finally, a test case based on the city of Rome, Italy is presented and insights related to vehicle distribution and travel time savings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Airlines assign different values to slots at peak and off-peak periods, and each carrier has its private (subjective) forecast of future demand. Conditional on the slots available to them, airlines compete in frequency, fare, and aircraft size over a congested airport network. The market outcome under such a scheme is benchmarked to those under an ex ante allocation and an ex post allocation by a social planner. Comparison results suggest that the auction-based scheme is inferior to the other two schemes when there is little fluctuation in demand, whereas the auction-based system is more effective when there is substantial demand uncertainty. Auctioning some grandfathered slots can improve social welfare but the marginal effect may diminish quickly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The advanced connected vehicle systems, enabling smart vehicles to possess/exchange real-time information and conduct portable computation, provide new opportunities to address this challenge. Motivated by this view, this study proposes a coordinated online in-vehicle routing mechanism with intentional information provision perturbation (CRM-IP), which seeks to shape individual vehicles online routing decisions so that user optimality and system optimality are balanced, by exploiting bounded rationality of the users. The proposed CRM-IP is modeled as a pure strategy atomic routing game, and implemented by a sequentially updating distributed algorithm. The mathematical analysis is conducted to quantify the absolute gain of system optimality corresponding to the loss of user optimality resulting from a given level of the information perturbation in the worst case so that the efficiency of the information perturbation can be evaluated. Furthermore, numerical experiments conducted based on City of Sioux Falls network investigate the average effects of the CRM-IP on system optimality and user optimality under various network traffic conditions, comparing to the CRM developed by Du et al. (in press). The results indicate that the improvement of system optimality and the reduction of individual vehicles' travel time from the CRM is more significant when the network traffic is under an mild congestion state, such as under the levels of service (LOS's) C, D, and E, rather than under extremely sparse or congested states, such as under LOS's A and B, or F. Moreover, higher level of information perturbation benefits system optimality more, but the marginal effect decreases after the perturbation reaching certain level, such as lambda = 0.1 in this case study. In addition, a portion of vehicles may sacrifice user optimality due to the information perturbation, but the extent of the sacrifice is not significant, even though it increases with the information perturbation level. Hence, a small information perturbation is recommended to achieve an efficient network traffic control through the CRM-IP. Overall, this study proposes the CRM-IP as an efficient routing mechanism, which has a great potential to guide the routing decisions of individual vehicles so that their collective behavior improve network performance in both system optimality and user optimality.

Methods: Adults newly initiating biologics for RA (etanercept, abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, or infliximab) between January 2009 and July 2011 were identified in the MarketScan Commercial Database. Eligible patients were continuously enrolled 6 months before (pre-index) and 24 months after (post-index) their first (index) biologic claim. Biologic effectiveness was assessed using six criteria during 2-year follow-up: treatment adherence >= 80%, no biologic dose escalation, no biologic switch, no new disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, no new/increased glucocorticoid dose, and limited intra-articular joint injections (<= 2). After a 90-day period of non-response for a treatment failure, effectiveness or failure of subsequent treatment was assessed again for the index biologic or new biologic (after switching). Post-index RA-related medical, pharmacy, and drug administration costs were attributed to the index biologic. Cost per patient-year in response was calculated as RA-related costs divided by duration of response. Results: Overall, 15.0% of patients (1229/8193) did not fail any criterion for 2 years and were effectively treated. Mean duration of response was highest for etanercept (538.3 days), followed by golimumab (537.0 days; p = 0.864), adalimumab (534.7 days; p = 0.301), certolizumab (524.0 days; p = 0.165), infliximab (480.0 days; p<0.001), and abatacept (482.3 days; p<0.001). Total disease-related cost per patient-year in response was lower for patients initiated on etanercept ($25,086) than for patients initiated on adalimumab ($25,960), certolizumab ($26,339), golimumab ($26,332), abatacept ($35,581), or infliximab ($36,107). Limitations: This study was limited to employer-paid commercial insurance. Database analyses cannot determine reasons for failing criteria. The algorithm was not designed and validated for 2 years of follow-up. Conclusions: An effectiveness algorithm estimated that initiating etanercept was the most effective treatment during 2 years of follow-up, with the lowest cost per patient-year in response.","[Bonafede, Machaon; Johnson, Barbara H.; Princic, Nicole] Truven Hlth Analyt, Cambridge, MA USA; [Shah, Neel; Harrison, David J.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Amgen,"Bonafede, M (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 77 Rowell Rd, Brentwood 03833, Essex, England.",machaon.bonafede@truvenhealth.com,,,Immunex Corporation; Amgen Inc.; Wyeth,Immunex Corporation; Amgen Inc.(Amgen); Wyeth(Wyeth),"This work was funded by Immunex Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen Inc., and by Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer Inc. in October 2009.",,0,15,16,0,5,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

If one vehicle reaches a desired vacant parking space before another vehicle, it will occupy the space and the other vehicle would have to search elsewhere. We first present a system of nonlinear equations to describe the equilibrium assignment of parking spaces to vehicles, and then discuss optimal pricing schemes that steer such parking competition to a system optimum assignment of parking spaces. These schemes are characterized by a union of polyhedrons. Given that the equilibrium state of parking competition is not unique, we further introduce a valid price vector to ensure that the parking competition outcome will always be system optimum. A sufficient condition is provided for the existence of such a valid price vector. Lastly, we seek for a robust price vector that yields the best worst-case outcome of the parking competition.

Further, this study provides comparison of the results to those obtained using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methodology. Methods: Members diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and with 24 months of continuous enrollment were included. Baseline patient demographic, clinical, consumer/behavioural, and cost characteristics were quantified. Quantile regression was used to model the relationship between the baseline characteristics and total healthcare costs during the follow-up 12 month period. Results: The sample included 83,705 patients (mean age = 70.6 years, 48% male) residing primarily in the southern US (78.1%); 81.2% of subjects were on oral-only anti-diabetic therapy. Co-morbid conditions included nephropathy (43.5%), peripheral artery disease (26.4%), and retinopathy (18.0%). Variables with the strongest relationship with costs during the follow-up period included outpatient visits, ER visits, inpatient visits, and Diabetes Complications Severity Index score during the baseline period. In the top cost quantiles, each additional glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) test was associated with cost savings ($1400 in the 98th percentile). Stage 4 and Stage 5 chronic kidney disease were associated with an incremental cost increase of $33,131 and $106,975 relative to Stage 1 or no CKD in the 98th percentile ($US). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that QR provides additional insight compared to traditional OLS regression modeling, and may be more useful for informing resource allocation to patients most likely to benefit from interventions. This study highlights that the impact of clinical and demographic characteristics on the economic burden of the disease vary across the continuum of healthcare costs. Understanding factors that drive costs on an individual patient level provide important insights that will help in ameliorating the clinical, humanistic, and economic burden of diabetes.","[Slabaugh, S.

This analysis examines two sources of this variation: specification of comorbidities in the estimated cost models and assumed prevalence rates used for generating aggregate costs. The study provides guidance in determining which comorbidities are important to include and how to handle uncertainty in optimal model specification and prevalence rate assumptions. Methods: Comorbidities are categorized into four types. Type I comorbidities are those that increase the risk of the disease of interest; Type II comorbidities have no causal link to the disease of interest but are, nonetheless, highly correlated with that disease; Type III comorbidities are illnesses that the disease of interest may cause, and Type IV are comorbidities that have no causal link to the disease of interest and are only weakly correlated with that disease. Two-part models are used to estimate the direct costs of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus using 2000-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. Results: COI estimates are sensitive to the specification of comorbidities. The odds of incurring any expenses varies by 71% for diabetes mellitus and by 27% for rheumatoid arthritis, while conditional expenditures (e.g., expenditures among subjects incurring at least some expenditures) vary by 62% and 45%, respectively. Uncertainty in prevalence rates cause costs to vary. A sensitivity analysis estimated the COI for diabetes ranges from $131.7-$172.0 billion, while rheumatoid arthritis varies from $12.8-$26.2 billion. Conclusions: The decision to include Type II and Type III comorbidities is crucial in COI studies. Alternative models should be included with and without the Type III comorbidities to gauge the range of cost effects of the disease. In generating costs, alternative values for prevalence rates should be used and a sensitivity analysis should be performed.","[Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chen, Jie] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Gunnarsson, Candace L.] CTI Clin Trials & Consulting S2 Stat Solut, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Naim, Ahmad] Incyte Corp, Wilmington, DC USA; [Lofland, Jennifer H.] Janssen Sci Affairs Inc, Horsham, PA USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Incyte; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Lofland, JH (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 850 Ridgeview Dr, Horsham, PA 19044 USA.",jlofland@its.jnj.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","This study was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,0,15,16,0,7,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Mirabegron, a 3-adrenoceptor agonist, is an oral treatment that does not contribute to ACB and has early evidence of improved persistence. The objective of the analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron for OAB vs six antimuscarinics in the US. Methods: A Markov state-transition model assessed US commercial health-plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives over a 3-year time horizon in an OAB patient population. Transition probabilities between five micturition and five incontinence severity states were derived from a network meta-analysis of 44 trials of oral OAB treatments. Therapy beginning with an oral OAB agent could discontinue or switch to another oral agent and could be followed by tibial nerve stimulation, sacral neuromodulation, or onabotulinumtoxinA. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Utilities were mapped from incontinence and micturition frequencies as well as demographics. Based on analysis of data from a large healthcare system, elevated ACB was associated with increased healthcare utilization and probability of cognitive impairment. Results: From both commercial and Medicare Advantage perspectives, mirabegron was the most clinically effective treatment, while oxybutynin was the least expensive. Tolterodine immediate release (IR) was also on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The analysis estimated costs per QALY of $59,690 and $66,347 for mirabegron from commercial health plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives, respectively, compared to tolterodine IR. Other antimuscarinics were dominated. Conclusions: This analysis estimated that mirabegron is a cost-effective treatment for OAB from US commercial health plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives, due to fewer projected adverse events and comorbidities, and data suggesting better persistence.","[Wielage, Ronald C.; Perk, Sinem; Klein, Timothy M.; Klein, Robert W.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, 201 N Illinois St,Suite 1730, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Campbell, Noll L.] Regenstrief Inst Inc, Ctr Aging Res, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Campbell, Noll L.] Purdue Univ, Coll Pharm, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Posta, Linda M.; Yuran, Thomas; Ng, Daniel B.] Astellas Pharma Global Dev, Amer, Med Affairs, Northbrook, IL USA",Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

The objective of this study is to examine change in GERD incidence, and to understand current patient demographics, medical costs, treatment status, and the suitability of current treatment based on analysis of an insurance claims database.Methods: An insurance claims database with data on approximate to 1.9 million company employees from January 2005 to May 2015 was used. Prevalence, demographics, and medical costs were analyzed by cross-sectional analysis, and incidence and treatment status were analyzed by longitudinal analysis among newly-diagnosed GERD patients.Results: GERD prevalence in 2014 was 3.3% among 20-59 year-olds, accounting for 40,134 people in the database, and GERD incidence increased from 0.63% in 2009 to 0.98% in 2014. In 2014, mean medical cost per patient per month for GERD patients aged 20-59 was JPY 31,900 (USD 266 as of January 2016), which was approximate to 2.4-times the mean national healthcare cost. The most frequently prescribed drugs for newly-diagnosed GERD patients were proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although PPIs were prescribed more often in patients with more doctor visit months, over 20% of patients that made frequent doctor visits (19 or more visits during a 24 calendar months period) were prescribed PPIs during only 1 calendar month or not at all.Limitations: The database included only reimbursable claims data and, therefore, did not cover over-the-counter drugs. The database also consisted of employee-based claims data, so included little data on people aged 60 years and older.Conclusions: Given the increasing incidence of GERD in Japan there is a need for up-to-date information on GERD incidence. This study suggests that some GERD patients may not be receiving appropriate treatment according to Japanese guidelines, which is needed to improve symptom control.","[Miwa, Hiroto] Hyogo Coll Med, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Internal Med, 1-1 Mukogawa, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan; [Takeshima, Tomomi; Iwasaki, Kosuke] Milliman Inc, Tokyo, Japan; [Hiroi, Shinzo] Takeda Pharceut Co Ltd, Global Med Affairs Japan, Tokyo, Japan; [Hiroi, Shinzo] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Pharmacoepidemiol, Kyoto, Japan",Hyogo College of Medicine; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Kyoto University,"Miwa, H (通讯作者)，Hyogo Coll Med, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Internal Med, 1-1 Mukogawa, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan.",miwahgi@hyo-med.ac.jp,"Takeshima, Tomomi/JYP-9409-2024",,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd),This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.,,30,7,7,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The flexibility is provided by allowing holding for the late incoming bus within a safety control margin (SCM). In this way, the stochastic travel time is addressed by the integration of real-time control and slacks at the planning phase. The schedule coordination problem then jointly optimises the planning headways and slack times in the timetable subject to SCM. Analytical formulations of cost functions are derived for three types of operating modes: uncoordinated operation, departure punctual control and departure delayed control. The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer programming model and solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Numerical results provide an insight into the interaction between SCM and slack times, and demonstrate that the proposed model leads to cost saving and higher efficiency when SCM is considered. Compared to the conventional operating modes, the proposed method also presents advantages in transfer reliability and robustness to delay and demand variation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, the government cannot motivate the private operator to improve them through a formal contract but through a self-enforcing contract that both parties are unwilling to deviate unilaterally. In this paper, we use noncontractible service quality to capture these performance elements. By employing a relational contract approach, we aim to investigate the optimal subsidy plan to provide incentives for quality improvement. We show that government subsidy is feasible in quality improvement when the discount factor is sufficiently high and marginal cost of public funds is sufficiently small. Under feasible government subsidy, we have demonstrated the optimal subsidy plans in different scenarios. Moreover, some comparative statics are presented. Based on the derived subsidy plans, we further investigate the optimal toll price. We find that the optimal toll price generates zero surplus for the private operator and positive surplus for consumers.

Although full automation is not yet a reality there has been significant research on the impacts of self-driving vehicles on traffic flows, mainly on interurban roads. However, little attention has been given to what could happen to urban mobility when all vehicles are automated. In this paper we propose a new method to study how replacing privately owned conventional vehicles with automated ones affects traffic delays and parking demand in a city. The model solves what we designate as the User Optimum Privately Owned Automated Vehicles Assignment Problem (UO-POAVAP), which dynamically assigns family trips in their automated vehicles in an urban road network from a user equilibrium perspective where, in equilibrium, households with similar trips should have similar transport costs. Automation allows a vehicle to travel without passengers to satisfy multiple household trips and, if needed, to park itself in any of the network nodes to benefit from lower parking charges. Nonetheless, the empty trips can also represent added congestion in the network. The model was applied to a case study based on the city of Delft, the Netherlands. Several experiments were done, comparing scenarios where parking policies and value of travel time (VTT) are changed. The model shows good equilibrium convergence with a small difference between the general costs of traveling for similar families. We were able to conclude that vehicle automation reduces generalized transport costs, satisfies more trips by car and is associated with increased traffic congestion because empty vehicles have to be relocated. It is possible for a city to charge for all street parking and create free central parking lots that will keep total transport costs the same, or reduce them. However, this will add to congestion as traffic competes to access those central nodes. In a scenario where a lower VTT is experienced by the travelers, because of the added comfort of vehicle automation, the car mode share increases. Nevertheless this may help to reduce traffic congestion because some vehicles will reroute to satisfy trips which previously were not cost efficient to be done by car. Placing the free parking in the outskirts is less attractive due to the extra kilometers but with a lower VTT the same private vehicle demand would be attended with the advantage of freeing space in the city center.

We find that while form of ownership may matter for cost efficiency, in general its effect is relatively small. Yet type of public sector ownership does have cost efficiency implications in certain environments. Further, when heterogeneity is not controlled, the results change substantially so that type of ownership matters much more which demonstrates the importance of controlling for cross section heterogeneity.

Traditional approaches for the Vehicle Scheduling Problem (VSP) are based on a set of predetermined trips in a given timetable. Each trip contains a departure point/time and an arrival point/time whilst the trip time (i.e. the time duration of a trip) is fixed. Based on fixed durations, the resulting schedule is hard to comply with in practice due to the variability of traffic and driving conditions. To enhance the robustness of the schedule to be compiled, the VSP based on stochastic trip times instead of fixed ones is studied. The trip times follow the probability distributions obtained from the data captured by Automatic Vehicle Locating (AVL) systems. A network flow model featuring the stochastic trips is devised to better represent this problem, meanwhile the compatibility of any pair of trips is redefined based on trip time distributions instead of fixed values as traditionally done. A novel probabilistic model of the VSP is proposed with the objectives of minimizing the total cost and maximizing the on-time performance. Experiments show that the probabilistic model may lead to more robust schedules without increasing fleet size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We compare two methods of incorporating ASCs: (1) a maximum likelihood estimator that computes ASCs post-hoc as calibration constants (MLE-C) and (2) a generalized method of moments estimator that uses instrumental variables (GMM-IV) to correct for price endogeneity. In a synthetic study we observe significant coefficient bias with MLE-C when the price-ASC correlation (endogeneity) is large. GMM-IV successfully mitigates this bias given valid instruments but exacerbates the bias given invalid instruments. Despite greater coefficient bias, MLE-C yields better forecasts than GMM-IV with valid instruments in most of the cases examined, including most cases where the price-ASC correlation present in the estimation data is absent in the prediction data. In a market study of U.S. midsize sedan sales from 2002 - 2006 the GMM-IV model predicts the 1-year-forward market better, but the MLE-C model predicts the 5-year-forward market better. Including an ASC in predictions by any of the methods proposed improves share forecasts, and assuming that the ASC of each new vehicle matches that of its closest competitor vehicle yields the best long term forecasts. We find evidence that the instruments most frequently used in the automotive demand literature may be invalid. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Haaf, C.

Methods: Patients (18-64 years) were selected from the Veterans Health Administration dataset (1 July 2007-31 May 2012). Patients with 2+ claims for PP or 2+ claims for the same OAT comprised the two study cohorts with the first prescription date designated as the index date. Participation in the VA healthcare system for 24 months pre- and 12 months post-index, schizophrenia diagnosis (International Classification of Disease 9th Revision Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 295.1x-6x, 295.8x-9x) and >= 1 claim for an antipsychotic medication during the baseline period were required. Propensity scores and Mahalanobis metric distances with calipers were used to create two matched cohorts. All-cause healthcare utilization and costs for the 12-month follow-up period were compared between matched cohorts. Results: The matching process produced two cohorts of 335 patients with similar baseline characteristics. During the 12-month follow-up period, patients in the PP cohort had lower mean inpatient costs (18,560 vs $31,505, Rho = 0.002), lower frequency of hospitalization (34% vs 53%, Rho<0.001) and fewer average inpatient days (13.24 vs 24.18, Rho = 0.002) vs matched OAT patients. While mean pharmacy costs were higher for the PP cohort ($10,063 vs $4167, Rho<0.001), mean total healthcare costs were not significantly different ($45,529 vs $52,569, Rho = 0.128). Conclusion: VA patients, diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with PP, had lower inpatient costs and admission rates compared to a matched cohort of OAT patients.

Such one-sided information propagation may potentially be altered in future connected vehicle environment. This brings new motivations of modeling vehicle dynamics under bi-directional information propagation. In this study, stemming from microscopic bi-directional car-following models, a continuum traffic flow model is put forward that incorporates the bi-directional information impact macroscopically but can still preserve the anisotropic characteristics of traffic flow and avoid non-physical phenomenon such as wrong-way travels. We then analyze the properties of the continuum model and respectively illustrate the condition that guarantees the anisotropy, eradicates the negative travel speed, preserves the traveling waves and keeps the linear stability. Through a series of numerical experiments, it is concluded that (1) under the bi-directional looking context only when the backward weight ratio belongs to an appropriate range then the anisotropic property can be maintained; (2) forward-propagating traffic density waves and standing waves emerge with the increasing consideration ratio for backward information; (3) the more aggressive driving behaviors for the forward direction can delay the backward-propagating and speed up the forward-propagating of traffic density waves; (4) positive holding effect and negative pushing effect of backward looking can also be observed under different backward weight ratios; and (5) traffic flow stability varies with different proportion of backward traffic information contribution and such stability impact is sensitive to the initial traffic density condition. This proposed continuum model may contribute to future development of traffic control and coordination in future connected vehicle environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This new type of mobility mode is still developing, and many challenges associated with its operation are not well addressed yet. One such major challenge of bike-sharing systems is the need to respond to fluctuating demands for bicycles and for vacant lockers at each station, which directly influences the service level provided to its users. This is done using dedicated repositioning vehicles (light trucks) that are routed through the stations, loading and unloading bicycles to/from them. Performing this operation during the night when the demand in the system is negligible is referred to as the static repositioning problem. In this paper, we propose a 3-step mathematical programming based heuristic for the static repositioning problem. In the first step, stations are clustered according to geographic as well as inventory (of bicycles) considerations. In the second step the repositioning vehicles are routed through the clusters while tentative inventory decisions are made for each individual station. Finally, the original repositioning problem is solved with the restriction that traversal of the repositioning vehicles is allowed only between stations that belong to consecutive clusters according to the routes determined in the previous step, or between stations of the same cluster. In the first step the clusters are formed using a specialized saving heuristic. The last two steps are formulated as Mixed Integer Linear Programs and solved by a commercial solver. The method was tested on instances of up to 200 stations and three repositioning vehicles, and was shown to outperform a previous method suggested in the literature for the same problem.

Methods: A cost-minimization model was developed assuming similar treatment efficacy between both regimens. The model estimated the costs associated with drug acquisition, treatment administration frequency (every 2 weeks for panitumumab, weekly for cetuximab), and incidence of infusion reactions. Average anti-EGFR doses were calculated from the ASPECCT clinical trial, and average doses of chemotherapy regimens were based on product labels. Using the medical component of the consumer price index, adverse event costs were inflated to 2014 US dollars, and all other costs were reported in 2014 US dollars. The time horizon for the model was based on average first-line progression-free survival of a WT RAS patient, estimated from parametric survival analyses of PRIME clinical trial data. Results: Relative to cetuximab+FOLFIRI in the first-line treatment of WT RAS mCRC, the cost- minimization model demonstrated lower projected drug acquisition, administration, and adverse event costs for patients who received panitumumab+FOLFOX. The overall cost per patient for first-line treatment was $179,219 for panitumumab+FOLFOX vs $202,344 for cetuximab+FOLFIRI, resulting in a per-patient saving of $23,125 (11.4%) in favor of panitumumab+FOLFOX. Conclusions: From a value perspective, the cost-minimization model supports panitumumab+FOLFOX instead of cetuximab+FOLFIRI as the preferred first-line treatment of WT RAS mCRC patients requiring systemic therapy.","[Graham, Christopher N.; Knox, Hediyyih N.] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Hechmati, Guy; Hjelmgren, Jonas] Amgen GmbH, Zug, Switzerland; [Fakih, Marwan G.] City Hope Comprehens Canc Ctr, Duarte, CA USA; [Maglinte, Gregory A.; Barber, Beth] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Schwartzberg, Lee S.] West Clin, Memphis, TN USA",Research Triangle Institute; City of Hope; Amgen,"Graham, CN (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Off Dr,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",cgraham@rti.org,,"Fakih, Marwan/0000-0002-6554-5488; Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),"This study was conducted by RTI Health Solutions under the direction of Amgen and was funded by Amgen.

The proposed approach makes use of the analytical solutions from the bottleneck analysis to create an equivalent assignment problem that admits closed-form commute cost functions. The equivalent problem is a static and asymmetric traffic assignment problem, which can be formulated as a variational inequality problem (VIP). This approach provides a new tool to analyze the properties of the bottleneck model with general heterogeneity, and to design efficient solution methods. In particular, the existence and uniqueness of the DUE solution can be established using the P-property of the jacobian matrix. Our numerical experiments show that a simple decomposition algorithm is able to quickly solve the equivalent VIP to high precision. The proposed VIP formation is also extended to address simultaneous departure time and route choice in a single O-D origin-destination network with multiple parallel routes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We review the state-of-the-art and establish the key principles of optimal train control for a general model with continuous control. The model with discrete control is not considered. We assume only that the tractive and braking control forces are bounded by non-increasing speed dependent magnitude constraints and that the rate of energy dissipation from frictional resistance is given by a non-negative strictly convex function of speed. Partial cost recovery from regenerative braking is allowed. The cost of the strategy is the mechanical energy required to drive the train. Minimising the mechanical energy is an effective way of reducing the fuel or electrical energy used by the traction system. The paper is presented in two parts. In Part 1 we discuss formulation of the model, determine the characteristic optimal control modes, study allowable control transitions, establish the existence of optimal switching points and consider optimal strategies with speed limits. We find algebraic formulae for the adjoint variables in terms of speed on track with piecewise-constant gradient and draw phase plots of the associated optimal evolutionary lines for the state and adjoint variables. In Part 2 we will establish important integral forms of the necessary conditions for optimal switching, find general bounds on the positions of the optimal switching points, justify the local energy minimization principle and show how these ideas are used to calculate optimal switching points. We will prove that an optimal strategy always exists and use a perturbation analysis to show the strategy is unique. Finally we will discuss computational techniques in realistic examples with steep gradients and describe typical optimal strategies for a complete journey. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is conducted in a hub-and-spoke network with a network carrier, an HSR operator, and a spoke airline, taking into account potential hub airport capacity constraint. We find that air-HSR competition in the connecting market may result in the network airline charging an excessively high price in the HSR-inaccessible market. This effect is present even when the HSR-inaccessible route is a duopoly-airline market. On the other hand, air-HSR cooperation increases fares in the connecting market, and an improvement in rail speed or air-HSR connecting time reduces airfare on the routes where HSR and the airline compete. When the airline cannot serve all the markets due to limited hub airport capacity, it would withdraw from the market in which it has less competitive advantage over HSR. Finally, air-HSR cooperation is more likely to be welfare improving when the hub airport is capacity constrained, and when either air transport or HSR exhibits, strong economies of traffic density.

This paper introduces the charging station location problem with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (CSLP-PHEV) as a generalization of the FRLP. We consider not only the electric vehicles but also the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles when locating the stations. Furthermore, we accommodate multiple types of these vehicles with different ranges. Our objective is to maximize the vehicle-miles-traveled using electricity and thereby minimize the total cost of transportation under the existing cost structure between electricity and gasoline. This is also indirectly equivalent to maximizing the environmental benefits. We present an arc-cover formulation and a Benders decomposition algorithm as exact solution methodologies to solve the CSLP-PHEV. The decomposition algorithm is accelerated using Pareto-optimal cut generation schemes. The structure of the formulation allows us to construct the subproblem solutions, dual solutions and nondominated Pareto-optimal cuts as closed form expressions without having to solve any linear programs. This increases the efficiency of the decomposition algorithm by orders of magnitude and the results of the computational studies show that the proposed algorithm both accelerates the solution process and effectively handles instances of realistic size for both CSLP-PHEV and FRLP.

The alternatives entail so-called skip-stop and express/local services. Continuous models found in the literature are expanded so that the alternatives could be compared under a wider array of options. Comparisons are separately drawn for systems that feature buses, BRT and metro-rail trains, both for cities that are wealthy and for those that are not. Idealizations in regard to travel demand and route symmetry are assumed in pursuit of insights Useful for high-level planning. Two rounds of parametric comparisons are conducted. In the first round, optimally designed all-stop systems are presumably converted to furnish instead the alternative strategies without altering the original stop locations. In the second round, alternative schemes are designed in fully-optimized fashion from scratch. In both rounds, alternative dispatching schemes often bring lower generalized costs than do their optimally-designed all-stop counterparts. Estimated savings can reach 10% even in the first round where the alternative schemes are hampered by sub-optimal stop locations. If designed from scratch, the savings can reach 30%. Skip-stop service is found most often to be the lowest-cost option of the three. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a latent class discrete choice model of an indirect informational conformity hypothesis. Class membership depends on the proportion of group members who adopt a behavior. Membership into the more informed class causes taste variation in those individuals thus making adoption more attractive. Equilibrium properties are derived for the informational conformity model showing the possibility of multiple equilibria but under different conditions than the direct-benefit formulations. Social influence elasticity is computed for both models types and non-linear elasticity behavior is represented. Additionally, a two-stage control function is developed to obtain consistent parameter estimates in the presence of an endogenous class membership model covariate that is correlated with choice utility unobservables. The modeling framework is applied in a case study on social influence for bicycle ownership in the United States. Results showed that more informed households had a greater chance of owning a bike due to taste variation. These households were less sensitive to smaller home footprints and limited incomes. The behavioral hypothesis of positive preference change due to information transfer was confirmed. Observed ownership share closely matched predicted local-level equilibrium in some metropolitan areas, but the model was unable to fully achieve the expected prediction rates within confidence intervals.

A two-level, simulation-based methodology is proposed, which finds the least cost hyperpaths at the upper level and performs the assignment of transit travelers on the hyperpaths at the lower level. The detailed simulation of travelers and vehicles at the lower level allows modelers to capture transit network complexities such as transfers/missed connections, receiving a seat/standing and boarding/being rejected to board. This 'hard' implementation of vehicle capacity constraints at the lower level is aggregated into 'soft constraints' at the upper level for the least cost hyperpath calculation. Using a gap-based assignment procedure, user equilibrium is reached on large-scale networks in a computationally efficient manner. The algorithm is tested on the large-scale Chicago Transit Authority network. The gap-based approach outperforms the commonly used method of successive averages approach in terms of rate of convergence and quality of results. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses with respect to network parameters illustrate the robustness of the proposed two-level solution procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

State-of-the-art stowage planning relies on a heuristic decomposition where containers are first distributed in clusters along the vessel. For each of those clusters a specific position for each container must be found. Compared to previous studies, we have introduced two new features: the explicit handling of rolled out containers and the inclusion of separations rules for dangerous cargo. We present a novel integer programming formulation and a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) to solve the problem. The approach is able to find high-quality solution within 1 s.

Methods: This study analyzed the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), including emergency department (ED) and outpatient department (OPD) components, and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). The annual rates of ED and OPD visits associated with hypoglycemia were reported. Subsequent medical services after disposition were studied. The unit cost of specific medical service was estimated from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). All annualized costs were adjusted to US 2009 dollars. We also estimated the rates of injury and ambulance use incurring within a visit for hypoglycemia. Results: The total direct medical cost of hypoglycemia was estimated as $3.49 billion in 2005 and decreased gradually to $1.84 billion in 2009. The declining trend was correlated with hospital admissions from ED, which decreased from 170 665 in 2005 to 71,751 in 2009. Consequently, the estimated annual expenditure of hospitalization for hypoglycemia from ED declined over time by more than half ($2.90 billion in 2005, $1.25 billion in 2009). Injury was reported among 9.5% of the ED visits for hypoglycemia. Ambulances were used among 58% of the ED visits for hypoglycemia. Conclusion: Hypoglycemia poses a significant burden on the healthcare system; however, annual direct medical cost of severe hypoglycemia in the US decreased over the 5 years studied, which is attributable to tremendous decrease in need of hospitalization following an ED visit.","[Zhao, Yingnan] Xavier Univ, Louisiana Coll Pharm, New Orleans, LA 70125 USA; [Shi, Qian; Wang, Yao; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Fonseca, Vivian; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, 1430 Tulane Ave, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Xavier University of Louisiana; Tulane University; Tulane University,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,"Zhang, Yonghui/AGY-9072-2022",,Bristol-Myers-Squibb investigator-initiated research program,Bristol-Myers-Squibb investigator-initiated research program,This study was supported by the Bristol-Myers-Squibb investigator-initiated research program.,,22,16,17,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A reference cohort treated first-line with certolizumab pegol according to current practice without systematic switching was considered as the comparator. A decision-tree model was constructed to estimate clinical outcome (health assessment questionnaire-disability index or HAQ-DI score), time spent in ACR50 response (ACR 50), and direct costs of treatment over a 2-year period. HAQ scores were derived from American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) responses. All TNF inhibitors were assumed to have equivalent efficacy and tolerability. Costs were estimated at 2013 French retail prices (date of the pay-for-performance agreement).Results: The mean duration of an ACR50 response was 1.23 years in the Treat-to-Target strategy certolizumab pegol cohort vs 0.98 years in the reference cohort, resulting in a mean gain in HAQ at 24 months of 0.117. The Treat-to-Target strategy with a mix of TNF inhibitors as second-line therapy was more expensive than the reference strategy in absolute terms, but this difference was entirely offset by the pay-for-performance agreement. The Treat-to-Target strategy was, thus, cost-neutral over a 2-year period after the payback of CZP cost for patients not achieving the target at 3 months.Conclusions: In the context of a pay-for-performance agreement, the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis using a Treat-to-Target strategy with certolizumab pegol in first line is dominant compared to standard use of this drug in the French setting in 2013.","[Fagnani, Francis] CEMKA EVAL, 43 Blvd Marechal Joffre, F-92340 Bourg La Reine, France; [Thao Pham] Univ Aix Marseille, Hop St Marguerite, AP HM, Serv Rhumatol, Marseille, France; [Claudepierre, Pascal] Hop Henri Mondor, AP HP, Serv Rhumatol, Creteil, France; [Claudepierre, Pascal] Univ Paris Est Creteil, LIC, EA4393, Creteil, France; [Berenbaum, Francis] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Rhumatol, Paris, France; [Berenbaum, Francis] Univ Paris 06, INSERM, Paris, France; [De Chalus, Thibault; Saadoun, Carine; Joubert, Jean-Michel] UCB Pharma, Colombes, France; [Fautrel, Bruno] Univ Paris 06, GH Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, GRC UPMC 08,Serv Rhumatol, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Hopital Universitaire Henri-Mondor - APHP; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Sorbonne Universite; UCB Pharma SA; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Sorbonne Universite,"Fagnani, F (通讯作者)，CEMKA EVAL, 43 Blvd Marechal Joffre, F-92340 Bourg La Reine, France.",francis.fagnani@cemka.fr,"Pham, Thao/GYA-5092-2022; Berenbaum, Francis/AAO-5690-2020","Berenbaum, Francis/0000-0001-8252-7815",UCB Pharma,UCB Pharma(UCB Pharma SA),This study was funded by UCB Pharma.,,63,8,8,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The aim of the problem is to determine the locations and capacities of hubs, which transportation modes to serve at hubs, allocation of non-hub nodes to hubs, and the number of vehicles of each type to operate on the hub network to route the demand between origin-destination pairs with minimum total cost. Total cost includes fixed costs of establishing hubs with different capacities, purchasing and operational costs of vehicles, transportation costs, and material handling costs. A mixed-integer programming model is developed and a variable neighborhood search algorithm is proposed for the solution of this problem. The heuristic algorithm is tested on instances from the Turkish network and CAB data set.

We use the notion of service reliability to confine the stochastic demand into a bounded uncertainty set that the rapid transit network is designed to cover. To evaluate the outcome of the service reliability chosen, flexible services are introduced to carry the demand overflow that exceeds the capacity of the rapid transit network such designed. A two-phase stochastic program is formulated, in which the transit line alignments and frequencies are determined in phase 1 for a specified level of service reliability; whereas in phase 2, flexible services are determined depending on the demand realization to capture the cost of demand overflow. Then the service reliability is optimized to minimize the combined rapid transit network cost obtained in phase 1, and the flexible services cost and passenger cost obtained in phase 2. The transit line alignments and passenger flows are studied under the principles of system optimal (SO) and user equilibrium (UE). We then develop a two-phase solution algorithm that combines the gradient method and neighborhood search and apply it to a series of networks. The results demonstrate the advantages of utilizing the two-phase formulation to determine the service reliability as compared with the traditional robust formulation that pre-specifies a robustness level.

Few economic studies have compared these products. Purpose: To determine the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole (ARI-LAI), paliperidone (PP-LAI), olanzapine (OLZ-LAI), and risperidone (RIS-LAI) in patients with chronic schizophrenia in Finland. Methods: A 1-year decision tree model was adapted with guidance from an expert panel. Patients started hospitalized in relapse; those who responded continued treatment, others were switched to secondary drugs, then clozapine in the event of 2nd line failure. Rates of adherence, stable disease, relapse, and hospitalization were taken from pivotal trials, and utilities from published research. Included were direct costs paid by the Finnish Ministry of Health, in 2015 euros. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), hospitalization rates, and rates of relapse not requiring hospitalization. Model robustness was assessed using a series of 1-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses. Results: Expected costs were lowest for PP-LAI at 41,148(sic), followed by 41,543(sic) for ARI-LAI, 42,067(sic) for RIS-LAI and 45,406(sic) for OLZ-LAI. Respective QALYs were 0.683, 0.671, 0.666, and 0.672. Re-hospitalization rates and non-admitted relapses were 23.6% and 3.9% for PP-LAI, 28.5% and 4.1% for ARI-LAI, 28.8% and 5.0% for RIS-LAI, 28.3% and 5.2% for OLZ-LAI. PP-LAI treatment was associated with the most days with stable disease (132.0), followed by OLZ-LAI (125.5), ARI-LAI (122.6), and RIS-LAI (114.4). Sensitive inputs between PP-LAI and ARI-LAI included rates of adherence, dropouts, and relapses plus drug prices; dropout and relapse rates for RIS-LAI; OLZ-LAI results were insensitive. In probability sensitivity analyses, PP-LAI dominated ARI-LAI in 75.8% of the 10,000 iterations, RIS-LAI in 83.1% and OLZ-LAI in 95.7%. Conclusions: PP-LAI dominated the other atypicals. It appears to be the preferred option for treating chronic relapsing schizophrenia.","[Einarson, Thomas R.; Bereza, Basil G.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Pudas, Hanna] Janssen Cilag, Espoo, Finland; [Goswami, Pushpendra; van Impe, Kristel] Janssen Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany",University of Toronto; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson,"Einarson, TR (通讯作者)，Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, 144 Coll St,Room 674, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada.",t.einarson@rogers.com,,,Janssen-Cilag,Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),"TRE and BGB received funding for this study from Janssen-Cilag.

The introduction of genes in another living organism or other species is a process unstable and insecure with side effects and consequences difficult to predict on the recipient genome and interaction with the surrounding environment. The main proponent are big business owners of patents in the field of GMOs and other stakeholders, including some GMO growers and scientists, as well as international trading partners. The potential economic interests in relation to GMOs in the field of plant breeding are considerable, the world annual turnover of the seed market has now exceeded 35 billion Euros. Today the world market is dominated by only a handful of large operators. The same multinational companies operating in the food, plant protection chemicals, energy and pharmaceutical industries. This concentration allows a small group of corporations to exercise considerable control over the entire production chain of food and related products, thus putting at risk the freedom of choice, the accessibility of prices, open innovation and diversity genetics. The development and dissemination of GMOs through these centuries-old-traditions have been called the Green Revolution. The greater use of chemicals in agriculture offers the possibility of a higher gain, but requires a greater dose of herbicides over time, which makes it necessary to look for a more aggressive chemical solution. However, on the basis of objective evidence one can conclude that genetic engineering is not fundamentally new to these historical applications. The advent of genetic engineering marks a definitive break between the biotechnology of old and the modern conception. Among the arguments used more frequently to support the use of GMOs, is the need to fight hunger, to ensure the supply of food to a growing world population and the fight against climate change. The majority of genetically modified varieties currently on the market are grown for forage and feed for livestock, for meat and milk consumed in the Western World, or to produce biofuel or plastics. The increase in non-food use of edible agricultural products has pushed-up the prices of raw materials and foodstuffs on the world market, which has done nothing but exacerbate food insecurity and poverty in the world. The problems of the global food supply difficulties arise not so much from production to distribution since global production is equivalent to over 150% of global consumption. Consequently this requires a political and economic solution rather than agricultural innovation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

As part of this purchasing form, it appeared interesting to analyze the reasons that led a group of families in Potenza to join for the procurement of fruit and vegetables from the Metaponto and Senise areas. The analysis performed shows that mainly economic reasons lead families of different social classes to arrange purchases of fruit and vegetables in a short supply chain. The results show that there is an increasing interest in products that are organic or produced with environmentally-friendly methods. In essence, there is not only the economic aspect that motivates these ethical purchasing groups but also the sensitivity to issues concerning the safeguarding of delicate ecological equilibriums threatened by incorrect agricultural practices and industrial development. The evolution of the group examined, known as Ecological Purchasing Group (GAE), shows the gradual expansion of demand for organic products that now also concern herbs. The consensus around this organization form of demand appear is growing and increasingly involving young and highly educated consumers. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to explore the agricultural context of Rome, focusing on its relationships with development in the metropolitan area, within the framework of sustainable food planning. Starting from the relationship between food and city, we have mapped the foodscape, identifying a number of representative conditions - typologies - in the metropolitan area of Rome. Through a of criteria - relationships with the urban fabric, production patterns, flows, services, infrastructures, environmental characters, social behaviour linked with the production - the study tries to summarise Roman agriculture. We focus on a set of recurring elements, involving both criticalities and opportunities, that bring together city and food production. Rome has what we could call a compact structure compared to the dispersed urban model and this has encouraged the development of local agricultural systems, where both flows and landscapes involve the city. While production is organised into wedge-shaped areas, the places where exchanges occur are mainly within the municipal area of Rome, with the exception of farms involved in direct sales. Despite a strong urbanization pressure caused a reduction of 42% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) between 1990 and 2000, this trend was reverted back between 2000 and 2010, with an increase of the UAA of 14%. The analysis of land use (CLC, 2006) reveals a system of wedge-shaped agricultural areas, where short supply chain models can be used efficiently to manage and promote the use of land and landscape. In synthesis, in terms of their production systems, there is a high number of short supply chain farms in Rome (over 40%), mostly with mixed production systems linked to multifunctional farming. The role played by the local food network in Rome is remarkable, particularly in case of farmers' market, SPG' and those linked to box schemes experiences have seen significant success. The increasing importance of Alternative and Local Food Networks is showed in the data: the 60% of Rome municipalities farms sell directly (Istat, 2010) it was registered an increase of + 57% Farmers' market at municipality level and of + 64% in Rome's province (2010/13) (Marino et al., 2013). The local food network behind agriculture in the city, within a number of integrated social agrarian cooperative, who represented an alternative food production system and landmark for many initiatives carried out by the civil society, associations, cooperatives, volunteer and school sectors, community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. This account of short supply chains in Rome is inevitably the account of an urban phenomenon. It is indeed the city that determines its special characteristics for both physical and relational aspects. The mapped farms are mostly located near the main routes that radiate from the city to the countryside, underlining the centrality of the flow of exchanges that take place with the city. The processes of transformation affecting the primary sector in urban and suburban environments reflect an agriculture that forms (and produces) new landscape and functions, typically reconnected to the historical value of agriculture in and around the Mediterranean cities. Food, because of its cultural and historical place in Mediterranean tradition, has a significant role in configuring the areas where exchanges takes place, which are, therefore, specific places for meeting and forming relationships within the public spaces of a city. The system identified by the paper configures the set of all the different forms of agriculture and food in Rome as a device of resilience for the city, made up of places where flows, relationships and processes become increasingly more sustainable, and where both physical and intangible spaces act as an infrastructure in their exchange with the city.

The Seoul metropolitan area is equipped with a system wherein a passenger's entire trajectory can be tracked. Despite this great advantage, the use of smart-card data has a critical limitation wherein the purpose behind a trip is unknown. The present study proposed a rigorous methodology to impute the sequence of activities for each trip chain using a continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM), which belongs to the category of unsupervised machine-learning technologies. Coupled with the spatial and temporal information on trip chains from smart-card data, land-use characteristics were used to train a CHMM. Unlike supervised models that have been mobilized to impute the trip purpose to GPS data, A CHMM does not require an extra survey, such as the prompted-recall survey, in order to obtain labeled data for training. The estimated result of the proposed model yielded plausible activity patterns that are intuitively accountable and consistent with observed activity patterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the relationship between renal angiomyolipomata and CKD in TSC, including the impact on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs.Methods:This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study based on medical record data spanning January 1990-April 2012 for 369 TSC patients treated at a specialty center in the Netherlands. Cohorts were established based on CKD stage and angiomyolipoma size. Rates of HCRU (physician visits, monitoring, and interventions) were compared across cohorts using rate ratios. Healthcare costs were compared across cohorts using cost differences. Regression models were used to identify predictive factors for HCRU and healthcare costs.Results:Sixteen per cent of patients reached CKD stage 3 or higher during follow-up. Patients at more advanced stages of CKD more frequently had either large or multiple small angiomyolipomata and higher HCRU rates and healthcare costs. In the multivariate analyses, male gender, CKD stage >1, angiomyolipoma size 3.5cm, embolization, and the presence of moderate or severe lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) were associated with greater HCRU (p0.002 for all comparisons). Definite (vs suspected) TSC diagnosis, CKD stage 5 (vs CKD stage 1), angiomyolipoma size 3.5cm, and moderate or severe LAM were associated with higher costs (p=0.050 for TSC diagnosis, p0.002 for other comparisons). Costs in CKD stage 5 were driven primarily by dialysis.Conclusions:A substantial proportion of patients with TSC developed moderate-to-severe CKD, which was associated with renal angiomyolipomata and increased HCRU and costs.","[Vekeman, Francis] Grp Anal Ltee, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Magestro, Matthew] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Karner, Paul; Duh, Mei Sheng; Nichols, Timothy] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [van Doorn-Khosrovani, Sahar Barjesteh van Waalwijk] Novartis Pharmaceut, Arnhem, Netherlands; [Zonnenberg, Bernard A.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Internal Med, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands",Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center,"Zonnenberg, BA (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Internal Med, Heidelberglaan 100, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.zonnenberg@umcutrecht.nl,"Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani, Sahar/ITV-7062-2023","Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani, Sahar/0000-0003-1239-9867",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis); Novartis,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis); Novartis(Novartis),This study was supported by funding from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis).

Treatment groups were propensity matched for baseline and index hospitalization characteristics. HCRU and costs were assessed through 90-days post-discharge. Costs were determined based on hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios and adjusted to 2013 US dollars.Results:Before matching, ticagrelor patients were older, more-often female, and had increased cardiovascular (CV) and bleeding risks compared with prasugrel patients. Propensity-matched length of index hospital stay (4.7 vs 4.9 days, p=0.23) and risk for all-cause [30-day: relative risk (RR)=0.86; 95% CI=0.73-1.0; 90-day: RR=0.90; 95% CI=0.80-1.0, and CV-related (30-day: RR=0.77; 95% CI=0.59-1.0; 90-day: RR=0.89; 95% CI=0.73-1.1) re-hospitalizations did not significantly differ between prasugrel and ticagrelor, respectively. Compared to ticagrelor, the propensity-matched risk of re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction (MI) (30-day: RR=0.39; 95% CI=0.21-0.75; 90-day: RR=0.53; 95% CI=0.34-0.81) and an outpatient medical encounter for dyspnea (30-day: RR=0.49; 95% CI=0.33-0.74; 90-day: RR=0.60; 95% CI=0.46-0.80) were significantly lower for prasugrel patients, with no significant differences in bleeding encounters between groups (30-day: RR=0.87; 95% CI=0.54-1.40; 90-day: RR=1.0; 95% CI=0.71-1.50). Matched total healthcare costs were not significantly different between groups during the index hospitalization ($36,011 vs $37,247, p=0.21), 30-days post-discharge ($2007 vs $2522, p=0.48), 90-days post-discharge ($4564 vs $5242, p=0.49), and aggregate of the index hospitalization through 90-day follow-up ($40,576 vs $42,494, p=0.09) timeframes.Conclusions:Re-hospitalization for MI and outpatient encounters for dyspnea were lower in prasugrel treated than in ticagrelor treated ACS-PCI patients up to 90-days post-index hospitalization discharge, with no difference in bleeding encounters or healthcare costs between the two populations. This data supports the utility of prasugrel in routine clinical practice. These findings should be considered within limitations of observational research.","[Molife, Cliff; Effron, Mark B.; Zhu, Yajun; Larmore, Cynthia; McCollam, Patrick] Eli Lilly & Co Inc, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Frech-Tamas, Feride; Marrett, Elizabeth] Daiichi Sankyo, Parsipanny, NJ USA; [DeKoven, Mitch; Karkare, Swapna; Lu, Jingsong] IMS Hlth, Fairfax, VA USA; [Vetrovec, George W.] VCU Pauley Heart Ctr, Richmond, VA USA",Eli Lilly; Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Molife, C (通讯作者)，Lilly Corp Ctr, Drop Code 5022, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",molife_cliff@lilly.com,"Effron, Mark B./P-9300-2015","Effron, Mark B./0000-0003-4050-5030","Daiichi Sankyo Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA","Daiichi Sankyo Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited); Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA(Eli Lilly)","This study was funded by Daiichi Sankyo Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA and Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.",,28,6,8,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Women with lupus are at increased risk of pregnancy complications that are exacerbated by active disease. Despite this, their use of medications and hospital resources has not been extensively studied.Methods:Retrospective analyses of the Truven Health MarketScan database (2006-2012) aimed to quantify drug and resource utilization in pregnant women with lupus, as well as the incidence of pregnancy complications in these patients. Records of women aged 12-54 were reviewed and both lupus patients and pregnancies identified. Pregnant women with lupus were matched 1:5 with either pregnant women without lupus, or non-pregnant women with lupus.Results:Pregnancies with lupus were associated with increased complications when compared to pregnancies without lupus. During pregnancy, the use of immunosuppressants decreased in pregnant women with lupus, as did rheumatologist visits, while the number of women not treated with any immunosuppressant increased. Pregnant women with lupus showed higher overall treatment costs than controls. However, compared to non-pregnant women with lupus, medication costs actually dropped, possibly due to the withdrawal of medications from these patients or women becoming pregnant while disease activity was low.Conclusions:The large database analyses reported here revealed that pregnancies in women with lupus were associated with a higher risk of complications, higher healthcare costs, and fewer prescribed medications, including immunosuppressants, than the control groups. The increased risk of complications and decreased immunosuppressant use suggest that patients require additional guidance from physicians to give them the best chance of experiencing a safe pregnancy. Indeed, despite the recognized role active lupus plays in increasing pregnancy complications, women with lupus had fewer rheumatology visits during pregnancy, although their visits to their general practitioner/primary healthcare provider increased, highlighting the need for team-based co-ordination care between OBGYN physicians and rheumatologists.","[Petri, M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Daly, R.

The railcars coming with inbound trains through the yard need to be humped into different classification tracks according to the destination, and then assembled to generate the desired outbound trains. During this complex procedure, the processing time of railcars and various resource constraints at different railroad yard facilities could significantly affect the overall performance of yard operations, individually and in combination. It is theoretically challenging to represent a large number of practical operation rules through tractable mathematical programming models. This paper first presents a time-expanded multi-layer network flow model to describe the connection between different layers of yard operations. A mixed integer programming model is developed to optimize the overall performance by jointly considering tightly interconnected facilities. We adopt a cumulative flow count representation to model the spatial capacity constraints in terms of the number of railcars in classification yards. A novel lot-sizing modeling framework and related valid inequality formulations are introduced to model the assembling jobs for outbound trains. We also develop an aggregated flow assignment model and earliest due date-based heuristic rules to determine the humping jobs sequence for reducing the search space. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine the solution quality and computational efficiency under different types of formulation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Disruptions of distributed facilities often exhibit complex spatial correlations, and thus it is difficult to describe them with succinct mathematical models. This paper proposes a new methodological framework for analyzing and modeling facility disruptions with general correlations. This framework first proposes pairwise transformations that unify three probabilistic representations (i.e., based on conditional, marginal, and scenario probabilities) of generally correlated disruption profile among multiple distributed facilities. Then facilities with any of these disruption profile representations can be augmented into an equivalent network structure consisting of additional supporting stations that experience only independent failures. This decomposition scheme largely reduces the complexity associated with system evaluation and optimization. We prove analytical properties of the transformations and the decomposition scheme, and illustrate the proposed methodological framework using a set of numerical case studies and sensitivity analyses. Managerial insights are also drawn. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Two important problems are investigated: which transit technology should be selected and when should it be introduced. A real option model is proposed to incorporate explicitly the effects of transit technology investment on urban spatial structure in terms of households' residential location choices and housing market. The trigger population thresholds for investing in a transit technology project and for shifting from a transit technology to another are explored analytically. Comparative static analyses of the urban system and transit technology investment are also carried out. It was found that (i) transit technology investment can induce urban sprawl; (ii) ignoring the effects of transit technology investment on urban spatial equilibrium can lead to a late investment; and (iii) there is a significant difference in the trigger population thresholds for transit technology shift estimated by the net present value approach and the real option approach.

The present paper extends the small but growing body of work studying the impact of several agents independently regulating tolls on different parts of a network. Specifically we consider the problem of a network consisting of two 'cities', each city independently regulated by a city 'authority' able to set a single cordon toll for entry to the city. It is supposed that each authority aims to maximise the social welfare of its own residents, anticipating the impact of its toll on travellers' route and demand decisions, while reacting to the toll level levied by the other authority. In addition, we model the possibility of the cities entering into a 'tax-exporting agreement', in which city A agrees to share with city B the toll revenues it collects from city B residents using city A's network. It is assumed that the sensitivity of travellers, in terms of their route and demand responses, is captured by an elastic demand, Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) model. Conditions for a Nash Equilibrium (NE) between cities are set out as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC). It is shown that weaker, 'local' solutions to the EPEC (which we term LNE for local NE) satisfy a single variational inequality, using the smooth implicit function of the SUE map. Standard variational algorithms may then be used to identify such LNE solutions, allowing NE solutions to be identified from this candidate set; we test the use of a Sequential Linear Complementarity Problem algorithm. Numerical results are reported in which we see that the sensitivity of travellers may affect many factors, including: the number of LNE solutions, the initial conditions for which algorithms might determine such solutions, the gap between LNE and a global regulator solution, and the incentive for cities to cooperate in terms of tax-exporting.

This study aims to provide an update on the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole in the current US healthcare setting to reflect bioequivalent tablet formulations of posaconazole and fluconazole, as well as changes in healthcare and drug costs. Methods: An existing model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole vs FLU/ITRA in the prevention of IFD among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Drug efficacy, mortality related to IFD, and death from other causes were estimated for tablet formulations using data from a randomized clinical trial of oral suspensions based on bioequivalence. IFD treatment costs were updated using the average inflation rate over 8 years (2006-2014) and drug costs were based on 2014 Analysource data. Results: Trial data show a lower IFD probability over 100 days of follow-up with posaconazole compared to standard azole therapy (0.05 vs 0.11). The treatment duration on posaconazole is 29 days compared to 24 days for FLU and 29 days for ITRA. The average cost of prophylaxis is higher in the posaconazole group compared to FLU/ITRA ($4673 vs $353); however, the costs associated with treating the IFD are lower in the posaconazole group compared to FLU/ITRA ($2205 vs $5303). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of IFD avoided for posaconazole is $18,898 vs FLU/ITRA. Conclusions: In the current healthcare cost environment where both drug costs and overall IFD treatment costs have increased since 2007, posaconazole tablets are a cost-effective alternative to fluconazole or itraconazole in the prevention of IFD among neutropenic patients with AML and MDS in the US.","[Sung, Anita H.; Marcella, Stephen W.; Xie, Yang] Merck & Co Inc, Lebanon, NJ 08833 USA",Merck & Company,"Sung, AH (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, 600 Corp Dr, Lebanon, NJ 08833 USA.",anita.sung@merck.com,"Sung, Anita/ABC-9885-2021",,Merck,Merck(Merck & Company),This study was funded by Merck.,,0,13,14,0,3,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: DFU patients were selected from Medicare de-identified administrative claims using ICD-9-CM codes. The analysis followed an 'intent-to-treat' design, with cohorts assigned based on use of (1) BLCC, (2) HFDS, or (3) CC (i.e., >= 1 claim for a DFU-related treatment procedure or podiatrist visit and no evidence of skin substitute use) for treatment of DFU in 2006-2012. Propensity score models were used to separately match BLCC and HFDS patients to CC patients with similar baseline demographics, wound severity, and physician experience measures. Medical resource use, lower-limb amputation rates, and total healthcare costs (2012 USD; from payer perspective) during the 18 months following treatment initiation were compared among the resulting matched samples. Results: Data for 502 matched BLCC-CC patient pairs and 222 matched HFDS-CC patient pairs were analyzed. Increased costs associated with outpatient service utilization relative to matched CC patients were offset by lower amputation rates (- 27.6% BLCC, -22.2% HFDS), fewer days hospitalized (-33.3% BLCC, -42.4% HFDS), and fewer emergency department visits (-32.3% BLCC, -25.7% HFDS) among BLCC/HFDS patients. Consequently, BLCC and HFDS patients had per-patient average healthcare costs during the 18-month follow-up period that were lower than their respective matched CC counterparts (-$5253 BLCC, -$6991 HFDS). Limitations: Findings relied on accuracy of diagnosis and procedure codes contained in the claims data, and did not account for outcomes and costs beyond 18 months after treatment initiation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that use of BLCC and HFDS for treatment of DFU may lower overall medical costs through reduced utilization of costly healthcare services.","[Rice, J.

Typically, several users with different pickup and dropoff locations are transported on a vehicle simultaneously. The focus in dial-a-ride problems (DARPs) is mainly on minimizing routing cost. Service quality has been taken into account in the models by imposing time windows and limiting the maximum ride time of each user. We extend the classical DARP by an additional feature of service quality referred to as driver consistency. Customers of dial-a-ride services are often sensitive to changes in their daily routine. This aspect includes the person who is providing the transportation service, i.e., the driver of the vehicle. Our problem, called the driver consistent dial-a-ride problem (DC-DARP), considers driver consistency by bounding the maximum number of different drivers that transport a user over a multi-period planning horizon. We propose different formulations of the problem and examine their efficiency when applied in a Branch-and-Cut fashion. Additionally, we develop a large neighborhood search algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time. Over 1000 instances are generated with close reference to real world scenarios. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the quality of the solution approaches and to provide insights into the new problem. Results reveal that the cost of offering driver consistency varies greatly in magnitude. Depending on the instance, the cost of assigning one driver to each user can be up to 27.98% higher compared to a low-cost solution. However, routing cost increases by not more than 5.80% if users are transported by at least two drivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we develop a generalized closed-form discrete choice model which include both logit and weibit models as special cases, by introducing the q-product random utility, in which the relationship between the systematic component and the random component can be either additive, multiplicative, or in-between, depending on the value of the parameter q. We show that, when imposing the Gumbel distribution on its error component (instead of assuming the additive case as the logit model), the parameter q depicts decision maker's risk attitude in the sense of the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion, which would be a behavioral foundation of the model. We also show that the model can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate statistical dependence across alternatives. The performance of the proposed model is examined by using two case studies; one on travel-route choices and the other on transport-mode choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The crowd sourcing data, reflecting real-time context of road segments in transportation systems, enable vehicles to be routed adaptively in uncertain and dynamic traffic environments. We consider the problem of adaptively routing a fleet of cooperative vehicles within a road network. To tackle this problem, we first propose a Crowdsourcing Dynamic Congestion Model. The model is based on topic-aware Gaussian Process considering the crowdsourced data collected from social platforms and probing vehicle traces that can effectively characterize both the dynamics and the uncertainty of road conditions. Our model is efficient and thus facilitates real-time adaptive routing in the face of uncertainty. Using this congestion model, we develop efficient algorithms for non-myopic adaptive routing to minimize the collective travel time of all vehicles in the entire transportation system. A key property of our approach is the ability to efficiently reason about the long-term value of exploration, which enables collectively balancing the exploration/exploitation trade-off for entire fleets of vehicles. Our approach is validated by real-life traffic and geo-tagged social network data from two large cities. Our congestion model is shown to be effective in modeling dynamic congestion conditions. Our routing algorithms also generate significantly faster routes compared to standard baselines, and approximate optimal performance compared to an omniscient routing algorithm. We also present the results from a preliminary field study, which showcases the efficacy of our approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Trucks differ from cars in value of time (VOT), congestion externality, pavement damage, and link travel time function. We find that the firm takes either a car-strategy or a truck-strategy for profit maximization. For a traffic mix with relatively large car volume and small truck volume, the car-strategy results in no trucks using the toll road, while the truck-strategy results in all trucks using the toll road. We derive the equilibrium flow pattern under any combination of car-toll and truck-toll, based on which we identify a profit-maximizing frontier and a strategy-switching frontier in the car-toll and truck-toll two-dimensional space. By geometrically comparing the two frontiers, we establish general conditions under which each strategy will be taken, which suggest that the truck-to-car VOT ratio, the total traffic demand, and the difference in travel distance between the two roads are critical in shaping the firm's strategy.

This study was born from the discovery that an ICLV model can in many cases be reduced to a choice model without latent variables that fits the choice data at least as well as the original ICLV model from which it was obtained. The failure of past studies to recognize this fact raised concerns about other benefits that have been claimed with regards to the framework. With the objective of addressing these concerns, this study undertakes a systematic comparison between the ICLV model and an appropriately specified reduced form choice model. We derive analytical proofs regarding the benefits of the framework and use synthetic datasets to corroborate any conclusions drawn from the analytical proofs. We find that the ICLV model can under certain conditions lead to an improvement in the analyst's ability to predict outcomes to the choice data, allow for the identification of structural relationships between observable and latent variables, correct for bias arising from omitted variables and measurement error, reduce the variance of parameter estimates, and abet practice and policy, all in ways that would not be possible using the reduced form choice model. We synthesize these findings into a general process of evaluation that can be used to assess what gains, if any, might be had from developing an ICLV model in a particular empirical context (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To establish this DCPM, this study develops a stochastic Poisson game to model the competitions among parking vehicles en route at multiple parking facilities. The equilibrium condition for the proposed stochastic Poisson game is formulated through involving travelers' parking choice behavior described by multinomial logit model. Furthermore, we prove that the stochastic Poisson game is a potential game with a unique equilibrium. A simultaneously updating distributed algorithm is developed to search the equilibrium solution of the DCPM. Its convergence is proved by both mathematical analysis and numerical experiments. The numerical experiments are conducted to test the efficiency of the DCPM, based on a real-world CBD covering Guicheng Community, Nanhai District at Foshan in China. The performance of the DCPM is compared to three greedy strategies following the nearest first, cheapest first, and least cruise first policies, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the DCPM significantly reduces cruise vehicles and average cruise distance per vehicle from all other three greedy strategies; the least cruise first strategy, which takes advantage of the real-time open spots information at parking facilities, performs better than the nearest first and the cheapest first strategies without the access to real-time information. The DCPM can further improve the benefit of the real-time information. Additionally, in terms of walking distance and parking cost, the DCPM provide a trade-off solution between the nearest first and the cheapest first strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting distribution planning problems present new computational challenges. We address a problem, called Electric Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows. We propose a mixed integer linear formulation that can solve 20-customer instances in short computing times and a Three-Phase Heuristic algorithm based on General Variable Neighborhood Search and Dynamic Programming. Computational results show that the heuristic algorithm can find the optimal solution in most small-size instances within a tenth of a second and achieves goods solutions in instances with up to 200 customers.

By viewing a BOT contract as a combination of road capacity, toll and government guarantee, this paper investigates optimal concession contract design under both symmetric and asymmetric information about the marginal maintenance cost of private investors. Under asymmetric information, the government guarantee serves as an instrument to induce a private investor to reveal his true cost information. Compared with the situation under symmetric information, the government will suffer a loss of social welfare; the private investor will charge a higher toll that increases in his reported marginal maintenance cost, and specify a lower capacity that decreases with the reported cost. The results also show that the private investor obtains extra information rent beyond the reservation level of return and the rent decreases with his reported cost. However, the resulting volume-capacity ratios of the BOT road under both information structures are the same. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional survey study was conducted among 48 physicians in surgical specialties in the Netherlands between May 2014 and July 2014. The survey questionnaire was designed to gather information regarding the intensity of feelings, on a 7-point Likert scale, toward statements that address the P4P system. Confidence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap technique with 1000 iterations. Results: Physicians see a positive value in P4P for their organizations rather than for personal attainment (mean=5.00; 95% CI=4.62-5.39), even though they feared that P4P might put financial pressure on them (mean=5.03; 95% CI=4.50-5.54). They strongly share the view that other colleagues will resist adopting P4P as a business model (mean=5.74; 95% CI=5.43-6.04). Respondents stated that they would not leave their current jobs if P4P were to be incorporated in their organization. Conclusions: Physicians see value in P4P for their organizations, and consider that P4P could provide an incentive for improving medical outcomes. There seems to be potential for the P4P system in the Netherlands as participants expressed positive support for its values. There is an intersection of interests between the value of P4P and the physicians' aim of achieving quality outcomes; however, further studies would be needed to investigate perceptions about specific design features in a larger sample. In addition, prior to implementing P4P, broad education about the system should be provided in order to counteract pre-conceptions and prevent resistance.","[Alqasim, Khalid M.; Evers, Silvia M.; Hiligsmann, Mickael] Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Ali, Eman N.] Texas Med Ctr, Mem Hermann Hosp, Houston, TX USA",Maastricht University; Baylor College of Medicine; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston,"Alqasim, KM (通讯作者)，Niederkasseler Lohweg 225, D-40547 Dusseldorf, Germany.",k.alqasim@alumni.maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Evers, Silvia/ABG-2128-2020","Evers, Silvia/0000-0003-1026-570X",,,,,24,3,3,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, there is currently little understanding of how the magnitude of this inefficiency, which can be measured by the Price of Anarchy (PoA), varies across different structures of demand and supply. Such understanding would be useful for both transport policy and network design, as it could help to identify circumstances in which policy interventions that are designed to induce more efficient use of a traffic network, are worth their costs of implementation. This paper identifies four mechanisms that govern how the PoA varies with travel demand in traffic networks with separable and strictly increasing cost functions. For each OD movement, these are expansions and contractions in the sets of routes that are of minimum cost under UE and minimum marginal total cost under SO. The effects of these mechanisms on the PoA are established via a combination of theoretical proofs and conjectures supported by numerical evidence. In addition, for the special case of traffic networks with BPR-like cost functions having common power, it is proven that there is a systematic relationship between link flows under UE and SO, and hence between the levels of demand at which expansions and contractions occur. For this case, numerical evidence also suggests that the PoA has power law decay for large demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the analysis was to compare provincial hospital costs when using panitumumab vs cetuximab with or without irinotecan in this patient population using a Net Impact Analysis (NIA) approach. Methods: The NIA determined the total per patient cost of the reimbursed regimens of panitumumab vs cetuximab in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. Utilization of healthcare resources related to EGFR inhibitor infusions, follow-up monitoring, and treatment of adverse events (AEs) were also included. Healthcare resource use including drugs, medical supplies, laboratory testing, oncology infusion time, and healthcare professionals' time was obtained through expert consultation and the use was then multiplied by the province-specific cost of each resource. Numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Based on the dosing regimens in place in each province, the total annual per patient cost of panitumumab ranged from $22,203-$32,600, while the total annual per patient cost of cetuximab treatment varied from $30,321-$40,908. Treatment with panitumumab resulted in lower costs in all cost categories including drug acquisition, infusion preparation/administration, patient monitoring, and AE management. Per patient savings with panitumumab ranged from a low of $3815 in British Columbia to a high of $10,603 in Ontario. In sensitivity analyses, panitumumab remained cost saving in all scenarios where the savings ranged from $150-$16,006 per patient. Conclusions: Treating chemorefractory mCRC patients with panitumumab rather than cetuximab reduced healthcare resource costs. Provincial healthcare savings achieved with the use of panitumumab could potentially be re-allocated to other cancer treatments, although further study would be needed to validate this assumption.","[Pettigrew, M.] Symbiose Partenariat Strateg Inc, 3915 Rue St Urbain, Montreal, PQ H2W 1T9, Canada; [Kavan, P.] McGill Univ, Jewish Gen Hosp, Oncol, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada; [Surprenant, L.] St Marys Hosp, Oncol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lim, H.

The topic of this article is the food waste, an important issue which has been developed increasingly over the past few years in the context of the actions identified at international level to contrast the global food crisis, which in its various aspects involves not only food law-in terms of both food security and food safety-but environmental law as well. In this light, the analysis can be seen as included among the issues related to the sustainability of well-being with the aim of ascertaining the causes that underlie food losses and food waste, also in view of the legal obstacles, and of identifying the latest prospects indicated by national and European lawmakers to mitigate or limit such waste. In the context of the analysis on the sustainability of well-being, the issue of food waste represents also under a legal point of view a complex aspect, the result of modern society and the well-being that characterises it, which involves multiple interests and is part of food security. The issue evokes the fact that food insecurity continues to exist and indeed has worsened in many parts of the world and raises questions on the impact of food waste on global food security. Thus, the issue is linked to several quite significant aspects related to environmental and food issues such as the control of natural resources, the loss of biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion, the reduction of scarce resources such as agricultural soil and water, and the loss of natural habitats.

These data can be collected and stored in a wide variety of ways including electronic medical records collected at the patient bedside, or through medical records that are coded and passed to insurance companies for reimbursement. When these data are processed it is possible to validate claims as a part of the regulatory review process regarding the anticipated performance of medications and devices. In order to analyze properly claims by manufacturers and others, there is a need to express claims in terms that are testable in a timeframe that is useful and meaningful to formulary committees. Claims for the comparative benefits and costs, including budget impact, of products and devices need to be expressed in measurable terms, ideally in the context of submission or validation protocols. Claims should be either consistent with accessible Big Data or able to support observational studies where Big Data identifies target populations. Protocols should identify, in disaggregated terms, key variables that would lead to direct or proxy validation. Once these variables are identified, Big Data can be used to query massive quantities of data in the validation process. Research can be passive or active in nature. Passive, where the data are collected retrospectively; active where the researcher is prospectively looking for indicators of co-morbid conditions, side-effects or adverse events, testing these indicators to determine if claims are within desired ranges set forth by the manufacturer. Additionally, Big Data can be used to assess the effectiveness of therapy through health insurance records. This, for example, could indicate that disease or co-morbid conditions cease to be treated. Understanding the basic strengths and weaknesses of Big Data in the claim validation process provides a glimpse of the value that this research can provide to industry.

Transit routes are assumed to lie atop a city's street network. Model 1 assumes that the city streets are laid out in ring-radial fashion. Model 2 assumes that the city streets form a grid. Both models can furnish hybrid designs, which exhibit intersecting routes in a city's central (downtown) district and only radial branching routes in the periphery. Model 1 allows the service frequency and the route spacing at a location to vany arbitrarily with the location's distance from the center. Model 2 also allows such variation but in the periphery only. The paper shows how to solve these CA optimization problems numerically, and how the numerical results can be used to design actual systems. A wide range of scenarios is analyzed in this way. It is found among other things that in all cases and for both models: (i) the optimal headways and spacings in the periphery increase with the distance from the center; and (ii) at the boundary between the central district and the periphery both, the optimal service frequency and line spacing for radial lines decrease abruptly in the outbound direction. On the other hand Model 1 is distinguished from Model 2 in that the former produces in all cases: (i) a much smaller central district, and (ii) a high frequency circular line on the outer edge of that central district. Parametric tests with all the scenarios further show that Model 1 is consistently more favorable to transit than Model 2. Cost differences between the two designs are typically between 9% and 13%, but can top 21.5%. This is attributed to the manner in which ring-radial networks naturally concentrate passenger's shortest paths, and to the economies of demand concentration that transit exhibits. Thus, it appears that ring-radial street networks are better for transit than grids. To illustrate the robustness of the CA design procedure to irregularities in real street networks, the results for all the test problems were then used to design and evaluate transit systems on networks of the wrong type - grid networks were outfilled with transit systems designed with Model 1 and ring-radial networks designed with Model 2. Cost increased on average by only 2.7%. The magnitude of these deviations suggests that the proposed CA procedures can be used to design transit systems over real street networks when they are not too different from the ideal and that the resulting costs should usually be very close to those predicted.

Estimation of this matrix involves at least three sub-problems: (i) determining a suitable set of traffic analysis zones, (ii) the formulation of an optimisation problem to determine the OD matrix, and (iii) a means of evaluating a candidate estimate of the OD matrix. This paper describes a means of addressing each of these concerns. We propose to automatically uncover a suitable set of traffic analysis zones based on observed link flows. We then employ regularisation to encourage the estimation of a sparse OD matrix. We finally propose to evaluate a candidate OD matrix based on its predictive power on held out link flows. Analysis of our approach on a real-world transport network reveals that it discovers automated zones that accurately capture regions of interest in the network, and a corresponding OD matrix that accurately predicts observed link flows.

In this particular application, we investigate the governing principles at work in how airlines will time their requests for en route resources under capacity shortfalls and uncertain conditions, when flights are not able to take their preferred route at their preferred departure time slot due to the shortfalls. We examine a sequential First Submitted First Assigned (FSFA) capacity allocation process within an en route air traffic flow management (ATFM) program such as the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP), which is a Federal Aviation Administration initiative that aims to manage en route capacity constraints brought on by inclement weather and capacity/demand imbalances. In the FSFA process, flights are assigned the best available routes and slots available at the time flight operators submit their preference requests during the planning period, in a sequential manner. Because flight operators compete with one another for resources, in such an allocation process they would be expected to make their requests as early as possible. However, because weather and traffic conditions - and therefore, the values of resources - can change significantly, flight operators may prefer to request resources later in the process rather than earlier. We use a game theoretic setup to understand how flight operators might tradeoff these conflicts and choose an optimal time to submit their preferences for their flights, as submission times are competitive responses by flight operators looking to maximize their benefits. We first develop a loss function that captures the expected utility of submitting preferences under uncertainty about operating conditions. Then, a conceptual model of the FSFA process is constructed using a simultaneous incomplete information game, where flight operators compete for the prizes of having submitted their inputs before others. A numerical study is performed in which it is demonstrated that preference submission times are heavily influenced by the general uncertainty surrounding weather and operational conditions of the ATFM program, and each flight operator's internal ability to handle this uncertainty. A key finding is that, in many of the scenarios presented, an optimal strategy for a flight operator is to submit their preferences at the very beginning of the planning period. If air traffic managers could expect to receive more submissions at the beginning of the planning period, they could more easily coordinate the ATFM program with other ATFM programs taking place or scheduled to take place, and they would have more opportunity to call another FSFA allocation route before the ATFM program begins, should conditions change enough to warrant this. Outputs of the model may provide some general insights to flight operators in planning submission strategies within competitive allocation processes such as FSFA. Also, this work may have a broader application to other sequential resource allocation strategies within congestible and controlled transportation systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Using model inputs derived from published literature, linaclotide Phase III trial data and a physician survey, a decision-tree model was constructed. Response to therapy was defined as (1) a >= 14-point increase from baseline in IBS-Quality-of-Life (IBS-QoL) questionnaire overall score at week 12 or (2) one of the top two responses (moderately/significantly relieved) on a 7-point IBS symptom relief question in >= 2 of 3 months. Patients who do not respond to therapy are assumed to fail therapy and accrue costs associated with a treatment failure. Model time horizon is aligned with clinical trial duration of 12 weeks. Model outputs include number of responders, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs (including direct and indirect). Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Treatment for IBS-C with linaclotide produced more responders than lubiprostone for both response definitions (19.3% vs 13.0% and 61.8% vs 57.2% for IBS-QoL and symptom relief, respectively), lower per-patient costs ($803 vs $911 and $977 vs $1056), and higher QALYs (0.1921 vs 0.1917 and 0.1909 vs 0.1894) over the 12-week time horizon. Results were similar for most one-way sensitivity analyses. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the majority of simulations resulted in linaclotide having higher treatment response rates and lower per-patient costs. Limitations: There are no available head-to-head trials that compare linaclotide with lubiprostone; therefore, placebo-adjusted estimates of relative efficacy were derived for model inputs. The time horizon for this model is relatively short, as it was limited to the duration of available clinical trial data. Conclusions: Linaclotide was found to be a less costly option vs lubiprostone for the treatment of adult patients with IBS-C.","[Huang, Huan; Friedman, Mark; Munsell, Michael; Menzin, Joseph] Boston Hlth Econ Inc, Waltham, MA USA; [Taylor, Douglas C.

Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per relapse avoided of natalizumab and fingolimod from the perspective of the Swedish healthcare system. Modeled 2-year costs in Swedish kronor of treating RRMS patients included drug acquisition costs, administration and monitoring costs, and costs of treating MS relapses. Effectiveness was measured in terms of MS relapses avoided using data from the AFFIRM and FREEDOMS trials for all patients with RRMS and from post-hoc sub-group analyses for patients with rapidly evolving severe disease. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty. Results: The analysis showed that, in all patients with MS, treatment with fingolimod costs less (440,463 Kr vs 444,324 Kr), but treatment with natalizumab results in more relapses avoided (0.74 vs 0.59), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 25,448 Kr per relapse avoided. In patients with rapidly evolving severe disease, natalizumab dominated fingolimod. Results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrate the robustness of the model results. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 500,000 Kr per relapse avoided, natalizumab is cost-effective in >80% of simulations in both patient populations. Limitations: Limitations include absence of data from direct head-to-head studies comparing natalizumab and fingolimod, use of relapse rate reduction rather than sustained disability progression as the primary model outcome, assumption of 100% adherence to MS treatment, and exclusion of adverse event costs in the model. Conclusions: Natalizumab remains a cost-effective treatment option for patients with MS in Sweden. In the RRMS patient population, the incremental cost per relapse avoided is well below a 500,000 Kr WTP threshold per relapse avoided. In the rapidly evolving severe disease patient population, natalizumab dominates fingolimod.","[O'Day, Ken; Meyer, Kellie] Xcenda, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Palm Harbor, FL USA; [Stafkey-Mailey, Dana] RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Econ, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Watson, Crystal] Biogen Idec Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Global Market Access, Cambridge, MA USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Research Triangle Institute; Biogen","Meyer, K (通讯作者)，4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Ste 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",kellie.meyer@xcenda.com,,,,,,,0,14,16,0,2,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Identifying critical rail infrastructures can help stakeholders prioritize protection initiatives or add necessary redundancy to maximize rail network resiliency. The criticality of an infrastructure element, link or yard, is based on the increased cost (delay) incurred when that element is disrupted. An event of disruption can cause heavy congestion so that the capacity at links and yards should be considered when freight is re-routed. This paper proposes an optimization model for making-up and routing of trains in a disruptive situation to minimize the system-wide total cost, including classification time at yards and travel time along links. Train design optimization seeks to determine the optimal number of trains, their routes, and associated blocks, subject to various capacity and operational constraints at rail links and yards. An iterative heuristic algorithm is proposed to attack the computational burden for real-world networks. The solution algorithm considers the impact of volume on travel time in a congested or near-congested network. The proposed heuristics provide quality solutions with high speed, demonstrated by numerical experiments for small instances. A case study is conducted for the network of a major U.S. Class-I railroad based on publicly available data. The paper provides maps showing the criticality of infrastructure in the study area from the viewpoint of strategic planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: This pharmacoeconomic study was developed from the perspective of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System. The new strategy proposes using an amino acid formula in the diagnostic elimination diet of infants (24 months) with suspected CMA. The rationale is that infants who do not respond to the amino acid formula do not suffer from CMA. Patients with a positive oral challenge test receive a therapeutic elimination diet based on Brazilian Food Allergy Guidelines. This approach was compared to the current recommendations of the Brazilian Food Allergy Guidelines. A decision model was constructed using TreeAge Pro 2012 software. Model inputs were based on a literature review and the opinions of a panel of experts. A univariate sensitivity analysis of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was performed. Results: The mean cost per patient of the new amino acid formula strategy was R$3,341.57, while the cost of the current Brazilian guidelines strategy was R$3,641.08. The mean number of symptom-free days per patient, which was used as an indicator of effectiveness, was 900.6 and 875.7 days, respectively. The new strategy is, therefore, dominant. In the sensitivity analysis, the dominance was maintained with parameter variation.Limitations: In the absence of information in the literature, some premises were defined by a panel of specialists. Conclusions: The new strategy, which uses an amino acid formula in the elimination diagnostic diet followed by an oral food challenge, is a dominant pharmacoeconomic approach that has a lower cost and results in an increased number of symptom-free days.","[de Morais, Mauro Batista] Escola Paulista Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Spolidoro, Jose Vicente] Pontif Univ Rio Grande do Sul PUCRS, Sch Med, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Spolidoro, Jose Vicente] Hosp Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Vieira, Mario Cesar] Pontif Univ Parana PUCPR, Sch Med, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Vieira, Mario Cesar] Hosp Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Cardoso, Ary Lopes; Moschione Castro, Ana Paula] Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin, Inst Crianca, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Clark, Otavio; Nishikawa, Alvaro] Evidencias, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Hospital Pequeno Principe; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"de Morais, MB (通讯作者)，Rua Otonis,880 Ap 63, BR-04025002 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",maurobmorais@gmail.com,"Clark, Otavio/HTR-4776-2023; SPOLIDORO, JOSE V/H-5402-2012; Garcia-Fraile, Paula/N-8193-2014; MORAIS, MAURO B/I-7995-2014","Clark, Otavio/0000-0003-1607-2589;",,,,,41,10,12,2,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Due to the nonadditivity of its objective function, Bellman's principle of optimality does not hold. This paper proposes a parametric search method to solve the BC-SP problem, which only needs to solve a series of shortest path problems, i.e., the parameterized subproblems (PSPs). Several techniques are developed to reduce both the number of PSPs and the computation time for these PSP5. Specifically, we first identify two properties of the BC-SP problem to guide the parametric search using the gradient and concavity of its objective function. Based on the properties, a monotonic descent search (MDS) and an intersection point search (IPS) are proposed. Second, we design a speedup label correcting (LC) algorithm, which uses optimal solutions of previously solved PSP5 to reduce the number of labeling operations for subsequent PSPs. The MDS, IPS and speedup LC techniques are embedded into a branch-and-bound based interval search to guarantee optimality. The performance of the proposed method is tested on the mean-standard deviation shortest path problem and the route choice problem with a quadratic disutility function. Experiments on both real transportation networks and grid networks show that the proposed method reduces the computation time of existing algorithms by one to two orders of magnitude.

The model incorporated an acute phase (0-90 days) and a rest of life phase (90+ days). Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale score. During the rest of life phase, patients remained in the same health state until a recurrent stroke or death. Clinical effectiveness and safety data were taken from the SWIFT PRIME study. Resource use and health state utilities were informed by published data.Results: Combined stent-retriever thrombectomy and IV t-PA led to improved quality-of-life and increased life expectancy compared to IV t-PA alone. The higher treatment costs associated with the use of stent-retriever thrombectomy were offset by long-term cost savings due to improved patient health status, leading to overall cost savings of 33 190 per patient and a net benefit of 79 402. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were robust to a wide range of parameter inputs.Limitations: The acute and long-term costs resource use data were taken from a study based on a patient population that was older and may have had additional comorbidities than the SWIFT PRIME population, resulting in costs that may not be representative of the cohort within this model. In addition, the estimates may not reflect stroke care today as no current evidence is available; however, the cost estimates were deemed reasonable by clinical opinion.Conclusions: Combined stent-retriever neurothrombectomy and IV t-PA is a cost-effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke compared with IV t-PA alone.","[Lobotesis, Kyriakos] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, London, England; [Veltkamp, Roland] Imperial Coll, Div Brain Sci, London, England; [Carpenter, Isobel H.; Claxton, Lindsay M.; Hodgson, Robert] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Saver, Jeffrey L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Saver, Jeffrey L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Comprehens Stroke Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of York - UK; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA,"Lobotesis, K (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hosp, Dept Imaging, Fulham Palace Rd, London W6 8RF, England.",kyriakos.lobotesis@imperial.nhs.uk,,"Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",,,,,35,50,51,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Public transport congestion leads to crowding discomfort, denied boardings and lower service reliability. However, transit assignment models and appraisal methodologies usually do not account for the dynamics of public transport congestion and crowding and thus potentially underestimate the related benefits. This study develops a method to capture the benefits of increased capacity by using a dynamic and stochastic transit assignment model. Using an agent-based public transport simulation model, we dynamically model the evolution of network reliability and on-board crowding. The model is embedded in a comprehensive framework for project appraisal. A case study of a metro extension that partially replaces an overloaded bus network in Stockholm demonstrates that congestion effects may account for a substantial share of the expected benefits. A cost-benefit analysis based on a conventional static model will miss more than a third of the benefits. This suggests that failure to represent dynamic congestion effects may substantially underestimate the benefits of projects, especially if they are primarily intended to increase capacity rather than to reduce travel times.

This study aimed to identify characteristics that predict clinical and economic outcomes associated with liraglutide therapy in clinical practice in the US. Methods: Using the Truven Health MarketScan Laboratory Database, glycemic control (A1C <7%) and diabetes-related costs were evaluated in T2D patients initiating liraglutide between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2012. Patients were required to have >= 1 post-index claim for liraglutide and A1C values at baseline and 6 months follow-up. All valid values of baseline A1C were included. Patients previously treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist(s) or insulin, or with evidence of type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, or gestational diabetes during the study period were excluded. Multivariable regression models were used to identify predictors of glycemic control and diabetes-related costs. Results: Of 417 patients newly treated with liraglutide, 54.0% achieved glycemic control (A1C <7%) during follow-up. Factors associated with increased odds of glycemic control during follow-up were: being female, POS/EPO health plan type, baseline A1C, early liraglutide initiation (0-1 prior oral anti diabetics [OADs] vs >= 2), adherence to liraglutide (defined as the proportion of days covered [PDC]), and diabetic retinopathy. Being female, earlier liraglutide initiation (0-1 prior OADs), and higher patient share of liraglutide costs were associated with significantly lower diabetes-related costs during follow-up. Factors associated with significantly higher post-index diabetes-related costs were: higher baseline A1C, baseline use of sulfonylureas, and diabetic retinopathy. Conclusions: Within this commercially-insured population of T2D patients treated with liraglutide, gender, baseline A1C, early liraglutide initiation (0-1 prior OADs), diabetic retinopathy, better adherence, and patient share of liraglutide costs were associated with increased odds of achieving glycemic control and the odds of having higher or lower diabetes-related costs.","[Durden, Emily; Lenhart, Greg; Lopez-Gonzalez, Lorena] Truven Hlth Analyt, 7700 Old Georgetown Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Hammer, Mette; Langer, Jakob] Novo Nordisk AS, Bagsvaerd, Denmark",Novo Nordisk,"Durden, E (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 7700 Old Georgetown Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",emily.durden@truvenhealth.com,,"Lopez-Gonzalez, Lorena/0000-0002-2589-9935",Novo Nordisk Inc.,Novo Nordisk Inc.(Novo Nordisk),"This study was funded by Novo Nordisk Inc. and conducted by Truven Health Analytics, Bethesda, MD, USA.",,26,10,10,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this work it will be presented an application of a solar cooling plant with absorption cooling machine for thermal control of a greenhouse and an advanced simulation model able to evaluate optimal plant configurations and controls. Solar cooling systems can be applied for greenhouse climate control in regions with high values of solar irradiation as alternative to traditional evaporative systems, allowing the reduction of primary energy consumption by exploiting the contemporaneity between the cooling requirements and the solar energy availability. The plant consists of a single effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller fed by evacuated-tube solar collectors; the model was developed in Matlab-Simulink and is able to simulate dynamically, with time steps up to 15 minutes, the greenhouse cooling demand and the production of the solar field. Present study proposes a plant configuration with a distribution system in which the cooling power is not provided for the entire volume of the greenhouse, but only for the air volume surrounding the crop with a considerable saving of reduction of energy demand and an extremely efficient use of solar energy. The simulation study is based on the experimental data collected at the experimental center of the University of Bari, Southern Italy. The aim of the work is to demonstrate that solar cooling system could provide significant energy-saving opportunities for cooling greenhouses allowing the reduction of primary energy consumption by exploiting the contemporaneity between the cooling requirements and the solar energy availability.

The focus on the quality of feeding, however, is susceptible to a double approach: individual and collective. The individual approach, confining attention to the quality of feeding to the type of lifestyle that everyone follows, delimits the relative costs and responsibilities to a personal scope. The collective approach would instead returns the quality in the context of the externalities of a socio-economic and environmental process to be managed with appropriate forms of governance, able to extend the responsibility over the person and redetermine the development and the distribution of the costs of quality of feeding. In this second case, a healthy lifestyle becomes the result of a process of promotion and guidance aimed to nest sustainable behaviours and to activate virtuous circles on the base of which lifestyles then, in turn, may become the key to the sustainability of wellbeing in certain territories. In view of this, the present paper aims to highlight the key role of quality of feeding as a determinant of the sustainability of the well-being and solicit the attention of policy makers on the need to implement appropriate governance strategies able to retract obvious market distortions through the support and promotion of healthy and natural lifestyles.

The agriculture is responsible for a massive use of plastic materials, in addition to energy and water inputs, chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Besides the pollution generated during the manufacture, at the end of their lifetime plastic materials used for crop covering, soil mulching, packaging, containers, pots, irrigation and drainage pipes, may became a pollution source when improperly disposed, leaved on the ground or burned. Instead the agricultural plastic waste (APW), if correctly collected, can be used as a new secondary raw material or as an energy source. An adequate APW management can prevent economical losses and environmental damages. The territory of the Barletta, Andria, Trani Province (BAT), in the Apulia Region, South Italy, is an agricultural area characterized by vineyards, olive groves, orchards and vegetables; it represents an area of intense production of plastic wastes and with a widespread problem linked to the application of unacceptable disposal practices. The goal of this study is to define and quantify the different types of plastic waste produced by the agricultural practice in a restricted area of the municipal area of Trani and Barletta, to localize the points where the most remarkable quantities of them are generated, and to provide the local Authorities and the decision makers of a useful tool for implementing an efficient and effective waste management. A dedicated geo-referenced database was designed using land use maps in a GIS environment and applying a methodology that can be functional for any kind of agricultural plastic waste. The resulting database gives updated and complete information on the plastic waste generation, over the land, related to the cultivation kind. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Methods For the years 2007 and 2012, Truven Health Marketscan Research Databases were used to identify adults with newly-diagnosed T2DM and continuous 12-month enrollment with prescription benefits. Variables examined included patient demographics, comorbidities, inpatient utilization patterns, healthcare costs (inpatient and outpatient), drug costs, and diabetes drug claim patterns. Results Despite an increase in the overall database population between 2007-2012, the incidence of newly-diagnosed T2DM decreased from 1.1% (2007) to 0.65% (2012). Hyperlipidemia and hypertension were the most common comorbidities and increased in prevalence from 2007 to 2012. In 2007, 48.3% of newly-diagnosed T2DM patients had no claims for diabetes medications, compared with 36.2% of patients in 2012. The use of a single oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) was the most common diabetes medication-related claim (46.2% of patients in 2007; 56.7% of patients in 2012). Among OAD monotherapy users, metformin was the most commonly used and increased from 2007 (74.7% of OAD monotherapy users) to 2012 (90.8%). Decreases were observed for sulfonylureas (14.1% to 6.2%) and thiazolidinediones (7.3% to 0.6%). Insulin, predominantly basal insulin, was used by 3.9% of patients in 2007 and 5.3% of patients in 2012. Mean total annual healthcare costs increased from $13,744 in 2007 to $ 15,175 in 2012, driven largely by outpatient services, although costs in all individual categories of healthcare services (inpatient and outpatient) increased. Conversely, total drug costs per patient were lower in 2012 compared with 2007. Conclusions Despite a drop in the rate of newly- diagnosed T2DM from 2007 to 2012 in the US, increased total medical costs and comorbidities per individual patient suggest that the clinical and economic trends for T2DM are not declining.","[Weng, W.; Kimball, E.

The TNDFSP is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem, with a large search space and multiple constraints, leading to numerous infeasible solutions. We propose an Alternating Objective Genetic Algorithm (AOGA) to efficiently solve it, in which the objective to be searched is cyclically alternated along the generations. The two objectives are to minimize both passengers' and operators' costs. Transit users' costs are related to the total number of transfers, waiting and in-vehicle travel times, while operator's costs are related to the total required fleet to operate the set of routes. Our proposed GA also employs local search procedures to properly deal with infeasibility of newly generated individuals, as well as of those mutated. Extensive computational experiments results are reported using both Mandl's original benchmark set and instances with different demands and travel times as well, in order to determine Pareto Frontiers of optimal solutions, given that users' and operators' costs are conflicting objectives. The results evidence that the AOGA is very efficient, leading to improved solutions when compared to previously published results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The semi-analytical method transforms the step-tolled user equilibrium problem into a static traffic assignment problem with side constraints, which is formulated and solved as a variational inequality problem (VIP). Existence and uniqueness results are obtained by examining the properties of the VIP. The exact method, on the other hand, locates the equilibrium solution by enumerating all possible combinations of user departure orders. To improve the computational efficiency of the exact method, a simple heuristic is developed to reduce the number of solutions to be enumerated. Examples of up to 1000 classes are tested. The results confirm that ignoring user heterogeneity may lead to sub-optimal design of step tolls. In all experiments, the semi-analytical method is found to be more efficient than the heuristic version of the exact method by an order of magnitude, albeit they consistently produce nearly identical equilibrium solutions.

We consider a realistic trial-and-error strategy for a customer to visit facilities without knowing their states until arriving at this facility; i.e., a customer keeps trying a number of pre-assigned facilities until she acquires the service or is forced to give up trying. The research problem is to determine the best facility location that minimizes the total system cost, including initial facility investment and expected long-term operational cost from transportation and loss of service, when facilities are subject to probabilistic disruptions and customers use the trial-and-error strategy. This problem is formulated into a compact integer program (IP), and we develop a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm to solve it. A set of case studies are conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm, and illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. The results reveal a number of interesting insights into the system design, including the significance of multi-level customer-facility assignments and the existence of a robust system design against variation of the loss-of-service penalty.

Two heuristics are described, one for congested (binding capacity) and other for uncongested cases. An experiment on a bidirectional corridor shows that the heuristics can find savings in social costs of 6.6% and 10.3% when compared to an express-service-only solution. We also show that, in some cases, the zonal service design problem can be solved analytically, outperforming the heuristics. This suggests the two approaches could be employed in tandem.

The theory and method of cointegration with error correction mechanism is employed in the general design of the new statistical model TS-TVEC. An inherent connection between mathematical form of error correction model and traffic flow theory is revealed through the transformation of the well-known Fundamental Traffic Diagrams. A threshold regime switching framework is implemented to overcome any unknown structural changes in traffic time series. Spatial cross correlated information is incorporated with a piecewise linear vector error correction model. A Neural Network model is also constructed in parallel to comparatively test the effectiveness and robustness of the new statistical model. Our empirical study shows that the TS-TVEC model is an effective tool that is capable of modeling the complexity of stochastic traffic flow processes and potentially applicable to real time traffic state prediction.

The choice probability can be either destination specific or origin-destination specific, resulting into two formulations. To capture the effect of physical queues in these FP formulations, the link transmission model is modified for the network loading and travel time determination. The self-regulated averaging method (SRAM) was adopted to solve the FP formulations. Numerical examples were developed to illustrate the properties of the problem and the effectiveness of the solution method. The proposed models were further used to evaluate the effect of information quality and road network improvement on the network performance in terms of total system travel time (TSTT) and the cost of total vehicle emissions (CTVE). Numerical results show that providing better information quality, enhancing link outflow capacity, or constructing a new road can lead to poor network performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their impact on healthcare resource utilization is not well understood. This study explored the impact of biologic use on IBD-related hospital admissions and emergency room visits and healthcare expenditures. Methods: This study used a retrospective cohort design to analyze data from the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases (Truven Health Analytics Inc.) for the years 2006-2010. Patients were identified using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for IBD and age 18 or older at time of initial diagnosis. Linear models were used to predict the probability of an IBD-related hospitalization or ER visit and healthcare expenditures with binary variables indicating use of biologics in the current year and in the previous 2 years, as well as patient- and area-level control variables. Results: Patients using biologics in the current year were 14.1-17.6% more likely to be hospitalized for IBD. However, biologic use in the previous year was associated with a 3.8-5.6% reduction in hospitalizations, and biologic use 2 years prior was associated with a 1-2.8% reduction in hospitalizations in the current year. Similar results are found for ER visits. All indicators for biologic use were associated with increased expenditures. Conclusions: There was a negative association between lagged use of biologics and the proportion of patients with IBD-related hospitalizations and ER visits. This finding may suggest that increased use of biologics over time is associated with a decrease in IBD-related healthcare utilization.","[David, Guy] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gunnarsson, Candace] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting S2 Stat Solut, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Lofland, Jennifer H.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Horsham, PA 19044 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Lofland, JH (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 850 Ridgeview Dr, Horsham, PA 19044 USA.",jlofland@its.jnj.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","This study was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,0,5,5,0,4,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Research design and methods: Multi-center, open-label, mirror-image, naturalistic study in a community setting in North America. Patients who required a change in treatment and/or would benefit from long-acting injectable anti-psychotic therapy were treated prospectively for 6 months with AOM 400. Retrospective data on hospitalization rates were obtained. Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT01432444. Main outcome measures: The proportion of patients with >= 1 psychiatric inpatient hospitalization with oral anti-psychotic therapy examined retrospectively (months -4 to -1 before oral conversion) and after switching to AOM 400 (months 4-6 after initiating AOM 400). Results: Psychiatric hospitalization rates were significantly lower when patients were treated with AOM 400 compared with oral anti-psychotic therapy both in the 3-month primary efficacy sample (2.7% [n = 9/ 336] vs 27.1% [n = 91/336], respectively; p50.0001) and in the total sample (6-month prospective rate: 8.8% [n = 38/433] vs 6-month retrospective rate: 38.1% [n = 165/433]; p50.0001). Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during cross-titration were lower in patients cross-titrated on oral aripiprazole for >1 and <4 weeks (2.9% [n = 7/239]) compared with patients cross-titrated for = 1 week (10.4% [n = 5/48]). The most common treatment-emergent AEs during the prospective treatment phase were insomnia (6.7% [n = 29/431]) and akathisia (6.5% [n = 28/431]). Patient-rated injection-site pain decreased from the first injection to the last visit. Conclusions: In a community setting, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated significantly lower psychiatric hospitalization rates after switching from their prior oral anti-psychotic therapy to AOM 400.

Methods: This analysis takes into account updated vaccine prices, reference costs, influenza strain circulation, and burden of illness data. A lifetime, multi-cohort, static Markov model was constructed with seven age groups. The model was run in 1-year cycles for a lifetime, i.e., until the youngest patients at entry reached the age of 100 years. The base-case analysis was from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, with a secondary analysis from the societal perspective. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Herd effects were not included. Inputs were derived from systematic reviews, peer-reviewed articles, and government publications and databases. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: In the base-case, QIV would be expected to avoid 1,413,392 influenza cases, 41,780 hospitalizations, and 19,906 deaths over the lifetime horizon, compared with TIV. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 14,645 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. From the societal perspective, the estimated ICER was 13,497 pound/QALY. A strategy of vaccinating only people aged >= 65 years had an estimated ICER of 11,998 pound/QALY. Sensitivity analysis indicated that only two parameters, seasonal variation in influenza B matching and influenza A circulation, had a substantial effect on the ICER. QIV would be likely to be cost-effective compared with TIV in 68% of simulations with a willingness-to-pay threshold of <20,000 pound/QALY and 87% with a willingness-to-pay threshold of <30,000 pound/QALY. Conclusions: In this updated analysis, QIV was estimated to be cost-effective compared with TIV in the UK.","[Meier, G.; Gregg, M.] GSK Vaccines, Hlth Econ, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium; [Nautrup, B.

Research design and methods: PRIDE was a 15 month, prospective, randomized, open-label study in which once monthly paliperidone palmitate significantly delayed the time to first treatment failure (healthcare or criminal justice system [HC/CJS] events) versus oral antipsychotics in recently incarcerated adults with schizophrenia. The present analysis used a state government perspective and HC/CJS event data that were collected on a resource use questionnaire (RUQ) every 3 months. Main outcome measures: Since cost information was not collected in the trial, cost estimates from published literature and an analysis of multistate Medicaid data for CJS and HC events, respectively, were applied to RUQ event data. Effectiveness and costs were adjusted to 456 days (trial duration). Incremental cost effectiveness was calculated as the adjusted cost difference divided by the adjusted effectiveness difference. Results: Adjusted costs (in US dollars) in the paliperidone palmitate group (n = 198) and the oral antipsychotic group (n = 193), respectively, were: non-drug costs $22,331 and $25,027; drug costs $18,592 and $7833; and total costs $40,923 and $32,860. Adjusted effectiveness differences and corresponding incremental cost effectiveness per event avoided (in parentheses) for paliperidone palmitate versus oral antipsychotics were as follows: 0.33 fewer CJS events ($24,409), 0.13 fewer psychiatric hospitalizations ($60,484), 0.46 fewer psychiatric hospitalizations or CJS events combined ($17,391), and 0.30 fewer incarcerations ($26,754). Conclusions: Costs for HC/CJS events avoided offset 25% of the greater drug cost for the paliperidone palmitate versus oral antipsychotic treatment group in this vulnerable population. Use of a recall-dependent RUQ for event rates and cost estimates instead of actual costs are potential limitations and may make the results conservative from a state government perspective. Indirect costs are likely to be substantial for this population, but were not considered in the analysis.","[Muser, Erik; Benson, Carmela J.; Starr, H.

In Part 1 of this paper we reviewed the state-of-the-art and established the key principles of optimal train control for a general model with continuous control. We assumed only that the tractive and braking control forces were bounded by non-increasing speed-dependent magnitude constraints and that the rate of energy dissipation from frictional resistance was given by a non-negative strictly convex function of speed. Partial cost recovery from regenerative braking was allowed. Our aim was to minimize the mechanical energy required to drive the train. We examined the characteristic optimal control modes, studied allowable control transitions and established the existence of optimal switching points. We found algebraic formulae for the adjoint variables in terms of speed on track with piecewise-constant gradient and drew phase plots of the associated optimal evolutionary lines for the state and adjoint variables. In Part 2 we will establish integral forms of the necessary conditions for optimal switching, find general bounds on the positions of the optimal switching points, justify an extended local energy minimization principle and show how these ideas can be used to calculate the optimal strategy. We prove that an optimal strategy always exists and use a perturbation analysis to show that the optimal strategy is unique. Finally we discuss computation of optimal switching points in two realistic examples with steep grades and describe the optimal control strategies and corresponding speed profiles for a complete journey with several different allowed journey times. In practice the strategies described here have been shown to reduce the costs of energy used by as much as 20%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model generalizes other existing recursive models in the literature, i.e., (Fosgerau et al., 2013b; Mai et al., 2015c), while being more flexible since it allows the choice at each stage to be any member of the network multivariate extreme value (network MEV) model (Daly and Bierlaire, 2006). The estimation of the generalized model requires defining a contraction mapping and performing contraction iterations to solve the Bellman's equation. Given the fact that the contraction mapping is defined based on the choice probability generating functions (CPGF) (Fosgerau et al., 2013b) generated by the network MEV models, and these CPGFs are complicated, the generalized model becomes difficult to estimate. We deal with this challenge by proposing a novel method where the network of correlation structures and the structure parameters given by the network MEV models are integrated into the transport network. The approach allows to simplify the contraction mapping and to make the estimation practical on real data. We apply the new method on real data by proposing a recursive cross-nested logit (RCNL) model, a member of the generalized model, where the choice model at each stage is a cross-nested logit. We report estimation results and a prediction study based on a real network. The results show that the RCNL model performs significantly better than the other recursive models in fit and prediction.

For these RUM models the utility errors are the sum of two independent random variables, where one of them follows a Gumbel distribution. For this class of RUM models an integral representation of the choice probability generating function has been derived which is substantially different from the usual integral representation arising from the RUM theory. Four types of models belonging to the class are presented. Thanks to the new integral representation, a closed form expression for the choice probability generating function for these four models may be easily obtained. The resulting choice probabilities are fairly manageable and this fact makes the proposed models an interesting alternative to the logit model. The proposed models have been applied to two samples of interurban trips in Japan and some of them yield a better fit than the logit model. Finally, the concavity of the log-likelihood of the proposed models with respect to the utility coefficients is also analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[del Castillo, J.

The mall implicitly engages in mixed bundling; it sells goods bundled with parking to shoppers who come by car, and only goods to shoppers who come by public transportation. There are external costs of discomfort in public transportation due to crowdedness. Thus, shoppers using public transportation deter each other. The mall internalizes these external costs, much like a policy maker. To do so, it raises the sales price of the good and sets a parking fee less than parking's marginal cost. Hence, parking is always a loss leader. Surprisingly, this pricing scheme is not necessarily distortionary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthcare costs were determined for patients with at least one inpatient or three outpatient claims with a diagnosis of SMA before 18 years of age and who had 6 months of data after first SMA diagnosis or expired within 6 months of initial diagnosis. A comparator cohort was selected using a 3:1 match based on age and gender.Results: A total of 239 individuals with SMA diagnosis met the inclusion criteria along with 717 matched comparator patients. More patients with SMA had hospitalizations (69.5%) compared to the comparator cohort (17.2%, p<0.001). Median total expenditures across all years of data for patients with SMA were $83 652 (25-75th percentile = $29 620-228 754) vs the comparator group of $4329 (25-75(th) percentile = $1229-10 062 (p<0.001)) over an average (SD) of 6.93.6 years. The annualized mean costs of total healthcare expenditures were significantly higher for the SMA cases than the comparison cohort, $47 86288 607 compared to $1861 +/- 6374, respectively (p<0.001). The sub-group of patients with early diagnosis (n=45) had 4.3 +/- 2.9 years of observation with a median cost of $167 921 ($53 349-678 412). Mean age (SD) at first observed SMA diagnosis was 7.5 +/- 6.4 years. Mean (SD) duration of follow-up after initial SMA diagnosis was 4.8 +/- 3.3 years, with a median post-diagnosis cost of $60 213 ($18 229-192 559). The major costs for all patients were outpatient visits [median = $53 152 ($23 902-136 150)], followed by inpatient costs [median = $11 258 ($0-51 987)] and total prescription costs [median = $3167 ($943-13 283)].Limitations: The analysis is limited to the data available and may under-estimate the total cost of SMA.Conclusions: Individuals with SMA have a high degree of morbidity, particularly those diagnosed during infancy.

Numerous systematic reviews have reported superior operating times, blood loss, post-operative pain, length of stay, and overall safety outcomes. What has not been extensively evaluated in a robust manner is their economic impact. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hospital costs associated with open thyroidectomy using Harmonic devices compared with conventional techniques for hemostasis. Methods: A systematic review of Medline, Scopus, and CENTRAL was performed from January 1, 2000 to May 23, 2014 without language restrictions for randomized clinical trials comparing Harmonic surgical devices to conventional methods in thyroidectomy. The main outcome measure was total reported costs. Costs were pooled using the ratio of means and a random effects model. Sensitivity analyses assessed whether differences in patient and trial characteristics, healthcare setting, or choice of statistical model affected outcomes. Results: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 476 participants had procedures performed with Harmonic devices and 478 with conventional monopolar electrosurgery and clamp, cut and tie techniques. Compared with conventional techniques, Harmonic devices reduced total reported costs by 10% (p=0.007), resulting in a $229US dollars (USD) absolute reduction from mean baseline costs. Results remained relatively robust to additional sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that the Harmonic family of surgical devices is associated with a reduction in total reported costs in thyroidectomy compared with conventional techniques. A large portion of the overall savings derives from a reduction in operative costs.","[Cheng, Hang; Clymer, Jeffrey W.; Amaral, Joseph F.] Ethicon Inc, 4545 Creek Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45242 USA; [Soleas, Ireena M.; Ferko, Nicole C.; Cameron, Chris G.] Cornerstone Res Grp, Burlington, ON, Canada",Cornerstone Research Group,"Clymer, JW (通讯作者)，Ethicon Inc, 4545 Creek Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45242 USA.",jclymer@its.jnj.com,"Clymer, Jeffrey/AAO-5504-2021",,"Ethicon, Inc","Ethicon, Inc","This work was supported by Ethicon, Inc., manufacturer of the Harmonic Focus and Focus+, who provided funding to conduct the analysis and prepare the manuscript.",,30,13,13,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, due to the high vehicle mobility, the unreliable vehicular communications such as packet loss and transmission delay can impair the performance of the cooperative driving system (CDS). In addition, the downstream traffic information collected by roadside sensors in the V2I communication may introduce measurement errors, which also affect the performance of the CDS. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between traffic flow modelling and communication approaches in order to build up better cooperative traffic systems. To this end, we aim to develop an enhanced cooperative microscopic (car-following) traffic model considering V2V and V2I communication (or V2X for short), and investigate how vehicular communications affect the vehicle cooperative driving, especially in traffic disturbance scenarios. For these purposes, we design a novel consensus-based vehicle control algorithm for the CDS, in which not only the local traffic flow stability is guaranteed, but also the shock waves are supposed to be smoothed. The IEEE 802.11p, the defacto vehicular networking standard, is selected as the communication protocols, and the roadside sensors are deployed to collect the average speed in the targeted area as the downstream traffic reference. Specifically, the imperfections of vehicular communication as well as the measured information noise are taken into account Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme. This paper attempts to theoretically investigate the relationship between vehicular communications and cooperative driving, which is needed for the future deployment of both connected vehicles and infrastructure (i.e. V2X).

In order to do so, we introduce the Passenger Centric Train Timetabling Problem. The originality of our approach is that we account for the passenger satisfaction in the design of the timetable. We consider both types of timetable(s): cyclic and non-cyclic. The problem is modeled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem with an objective of maximizing the train operating company's profit while maintaining epsilon level of passenger satisfaction. The model does not take into account conflicts between trains and does not adjust dwell times at stopping stations among the lines. By solving the model for various values of epsilon, the approximated Pareto frontier is constructed. The analysis, based on an experiment using realistic data, shows that an improvement of passenger satisfaction while maintaining a low profit loss for the railway company can be achieved. A sensitivity analysis on passenger congestion illustrates a quantitative evidence that the non-cyclic timetables can account better for high density demand in comparison to cyclic timetables.

This paper proposes a hierarchical framework for timetable design which combines a microscopic and a macroscopic model of the network. The framework performs an iterative adjustment of train running and minimum headway times until a feasible and stable timetable has been generated at the microscopic level. The macroscopic model optimizes a trade-off between minimal travel times and maximal robustness using an Integer Linear Programming formulation which includes a measure for delay recovery computed by an integrated delay propagation model in a Monte Carlo setting. The application to an area of the Dutch railway network shows the ability of the approach to automatically compute a feasible, stable and robust timetable. Practitioners can use this approach both for effective timetabling and post-evaluation of existing timetables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Besinovic, Nikola; Goverde, Rob M.

Economic models are often used, but seldom reviewed. Purpose: To summarize economic models used in economic analyses of drugs treating moderate-to-severe/very severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: This study searched Medline and Embase from inception to the end of February 2015 for cost-effectiveness/utility analyses that examined at least one drug against placebo, another drug, or other standard therapy in asthma or COPD. Two reviewers independently searched and extracted data with differences adjudicated via consensus discussion. Data extracted included model used and its qualities, validation methods, treatments compared, disease severity, analytic perspective, time horizon, data collection (pro- or retrospective), input rates and sources, costs and sources, planned sensitivity analyses, criteria for cost-effectiveness, reported outcomes, and sponsor. Results: This study analyzed 53 articles; 14 (25%) on asthma and 39 (75%) COPD. Markov models were commonly used for both asthma and COPD-related economic evaluations. Relatively few studies validated their model. For asthma-related studies, 10 examined inhaled corticosteroids and nine studied omalizumab. Placebo or standard therapy was the comparison in 11 studies and active drugs in the remainder. Conclusions: Few studies include validation of their models. Furthermore, controversy concerning some results was uncovered in this study, which needs to be avoided in the future.","[Einarson, Thomas R.; Bereza, Basil G.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Nielsen, T.

Methods: Clinical input data for the modeling analysis were taken from two randomized, controlled trials (LIRA-DPP4 and LEAD-2). Long-term (patient lifetime) projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2013 Euros; (sic)) were made using a validated computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes. Costs were taken from published France-specific sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an increase in mean direct healthcare costs of (sic)2558 per patient compared with sitagliptin. In the comparison with glimepiride, liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.23 QALYs and an increase in direct costs of (sic)4695. Based on these estimates, liraglutide was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)10,275 per QALY gained vs sitagliptin and (sic)20,709 per QALY gained vs glimepiride in France. Conclusion: Calculated ICERs for both comparisons fell below the commonly quoted willingness-to-pay threshold of (sic)30,000 per QALY gained. Therefore, liraglutide is likely to be cost-effective vs sitagliptin and glimepiride from a healthcare payer perspective in France.","[Roussel, Ronan] Dept Hosp Univ FIRE, Bichat Hosp, AP HP, Dept Diabetol Endocrinol Nutr, Paris, France; [Roussel, Ronan] Ctr Rech Cordeliers, INSERM, UMRS 1138, Paris, France; [Roussel, Ronan] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UFR Med, Paris, France; [Martinez, Luc] Univ Paris 06, Dept Gen Practice, Paris, France; [Vandebrouck, Tom] Sa Novo Nordisk Pharma Nv, Brussels, Belgium; [Douik, Habiba; Emiel, Patrick; Guery, Matthieu] Novo Nordisk Pharmaceut SAS, Paris, France; [Hunt, Barnaby; Valentine, William J.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Bichat-Claude Bernard - APHP; Universite Paris Cite; Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite; Sorbonne Universite; Novo Nordisk; Novo Nordisk,"Vandebrouck, T (通讯作者)，Bld Int 55, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",tva@novonordisk.com,"MARTINEZ, LUC/KCL-3018-2024",,Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),The study was supported by funding from Novo Nordisk.,,42,16,16,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In fact, a more sustainable agriculture makes food security possible, particularly in developing countries. This study follows the following structure. The first paragraph investigates the issues and the opportunities connected to today's global agriculture sector, including forestry and fisheries. In this context we will see the potential underlying sustainable agriculture in creating green jobs, and special emphasis will be devoted to the analysis of green farming practices. This includes the rehabilitation of degraded crop and the role played by pasture land in improving agro-ecological farming practices. In the second paragraph, special emphasis will be devoted to the analysis of green farming practices. This means: a) the introduction of technologies that mechanize farming operations so that agricultural productivity will significantly increase; b) improvements of transport infrastructures and facilities in reducing post harvest losses; c) the certification and branding for a sustainable production. The third paragraph focuses on the policy measures that are needed to put in place a sustainable agriculture. In fact, for this to happen it is necessary that governments, particularly in developing countries, pay attention to programs for environmental conservation and rehabilitation and to the creation of green jobs. The policy options analyzed for intervention in this sector include both financial and regulatory measures, such as subsidies, taxes, public R&D, international assistance and regulated standards, as well as marketing processes (e.g., eco-labeling and certification programs).

In this context, the viticulture of the Etna is a model, which has become a strategic component of rural sustainable development and improvement of local tourism. In this study we implemented the Strategic Orientation Round (SOR) integrated in the SWOT analysis, a qualitative approach aimed to create awareness and promote action as prioritized by the stakeholders. We argue that the key requirement of the Etna Wine Route effective management for wine tourism development is the stakeholder involvement in generating ideas and developing products and services. In the case of EWR the major problems among the actors concern the distribution of commitments and the ability to focus on marketing strategies.

Zostavax vaccine has recently become available to prevent HZ and PHN. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against HZ in Spain considering a vaccination of the population aged 50 years and older and comparing this to the current situation where no vaccination is being administered. Methods An existing, validated, and published economic model was adapted to Spain using relevant local input parameters and costs from 2013. Results Vaccinating 30% of the Spanish population aged 50 years and older resulted in (sic)16,577/QALY gained, (sic)2025/HZ case avoided, and (sic)5594/PHN case avoided under the third-party payer perspective. From a societal perspective, the ICERs increased by 6%, due to the higher price of the vaccine. The number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case was 20 for HZ, and 63 for PHN3. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model was most sensitive to the HZ and PHN epidemiological data, the health state utilities values, and vaccine price used. Conclusion Considering an acceptable range of cost-effectiveness of (sic)30,000-(sic)50,000 per QALY gained, vaccination of the 50 | population in Spain against HZ with a new vaccine, Zostavax, is cost-effective and makes good use of the valuable healthcare budget.","[Luis Lopez-Belmonte, Juan] Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Ave Partenon 4-6, Madrid 28042, Spain; [Cisterna, Ramon] UPV EHU Bilbao, Clin Microbiol & Infect Control OSI Bilbao Basurt, Bilbao, Spain; [Gil de Miguel, Angel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Hlth Sci & Publ Healthcare Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Guilmet, Caroline; Bianic, Florence] Mapi Grp, Nanterre, France; [Uhart, Mathieu] Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, France",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France,"Lopez-Belmonte, JL (通讯作者)，Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Ave Partenon 4-6, Madrid 28042, Spain.",jllopezbelmonte@spmsd.com,,,Sanofi Pasteur MSD,Sanofi Pasteur MSD,This manuscript received funding from Sanofi Pasteur MSD.,,69,13,13,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Mental health recovery was assessed from both a provider's (Recovery Markers Inventory [RMI]) and patient's (Consumer Recovery Measure [CRM]) perspective. A three-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) was utilized to determine changes in CRM and RMI scores by including independent variables in the models: intercept, months from treatment (slope), treatment time period (pretreatment and treatment), age, gender, primary diagnosis, substance abuse diagnosis, concurrent medications, and adherence to paliperidone palmitate LAI.Results:A total of 219 patients were identified and included in the study. Results of the final three-level HLMs indicated an overall increase in CRM scores (p<0.05), an overall increase (p<0.01), and an increased rate of change (p<0.05) in RMI scores during the paliperidone palmitate LAI treatment period vs the pre-treatment period.Limitations:This study contained a retrospective, non-comparative design, and did not adjust for multiplicityConclusions:The current study demonstrates that changes in recovery-oriented mental health outcomes can be detected following the administration of a specific antipsychotic treatment in persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. Furthermore, patients receiving paliperidone palmitate LAI can effectively improve recovery-oriented outcomes, thereby supporting the drug's use as schizophrenia treatment from a recovery-oriented perspective.","[Williams, Wesley; McKinney, Christopher] Mental Hlth Ctr Denver, 4141 E Dickenson Pl, Denver, CO 80222 USA; [Martinez, Larry; Benson, Carmela] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Titusville, NJ USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Williams, W (通讯作者)，Mental Hlth Ctr Denver, 4141 E Dickenson Pl, Denver, CO 80222 USA.",wesley.williams@mhcd.org,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","This work was supported by funding from Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,31,3,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The date of the earliest claim for asenapine during this period was deemed the index date', and patients without continuous enrollment for the 6-month periods before and after this date were excluded (pre-index' and post-index', respectively). Healthcare claims with a BPD diagnosis, plus psychiatric medications and the costs thereof (2012 dollars) were deemed BPD-related'. Differences in BPD-related utilization and cost of healthcare services were compared between the pre- and post-index periods.Results:A total of 1403 patients met all selection criteria; the mean age was 42.8 years and 70.6% were women. Relative to pre-index, significant decreases were noted in post-index use of BPD-related healthcare services, most notably admissions (from 24.0% to 12.3% during the post-index period) and emergency department visits (from 4.6% to 2.6%) (both p<0.05). While pharmacy costs increased, mean total post-index BPD-related healthcare costs were $979 lower than pre-index ($5002 vs $5981; p<0.05), primarily due to the decrease in BPD-related admissions.Conclusions:Relative to the 6-month period beforehand, levels of utilization of BPD-related healthcare services and costs decreased during the 6-month period immediately following initiation of asenapine therapy.","[Chitnis, Abhishek; Wang, Rosa; Tawah, Alie; Boulanger, Luke] Evidera, Lexington, MA USA; [Sun, Shawn X.; Dixit, Shailja] Forest Res Inst, Jersey City, NJ USA",Evidera; Forest Research Institute Inc.,"Chitnis, A (通讯作者)，430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",abhishek.chitnis@evidera.com,,,Forest Research Institute,Forest Research Institute,"This research was sponsored by Forest Research Institute, an affiliate of Actavis, Inc.

The path flows are assumed to follow an 'excess travel cost dynamics' and evolve from disequilibrium states to the equilibrium day by day. This implies that the observed link flow pattern during the trial-and-error procedure is in disequilibrium. By making certain assumptions on the flow evolution dynamics, we prove that the trial-and-error procedure is capable of learning the system optimum link tolls without requiring explicit knowledge of the demand functions and flow evolution mechanism. A methodology is developed for updating the toll charges and choosing the inter-trial periods to ensure convergence of the iterative approach towards the system optimum. Numerical examples are given in support of the theoretical findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting from the observation that standard deviation and mean of distance-normalized travel time in a network are highly positively correlated and their relationship is well characterized by a linear function, this study assumes multiplicative error structures to describe data with such characteristics and derives a compound distribution to model travel delay per unit distance as a surrogate for travel time. The proposed Gamma-Gamma model arises when (within-day) vehicle-to-vehicle travel delay per unit distance is distributed according to a Gamma distribution, with mean that itself fluctuates from day to day following another Gamma distribution. The study calibrates the model parameters and validates the underlying assumptions using both simulated and actual vehicle trajectory data. The Gamma-Gamma distribution shows good fits to travel delay observations when compared to the (simple) Gamma and Lognormal distributions. The main advantage of the Gamma-Gamma model is its ability to recognize different variability dimensions reflected in travel time data and clear physical meanings of its parameters in connection with vehicle-to-vehicle and day-to-day variability. Based on the linearity assumption for the relationship between mean and standard deviation, two shape parameters of the Gamma-Gamma model are linked to the coefficient of variation of travel delay in vehicle-to-vehicle and day-to-day distributions, respectively, and can be directly estimated from the slope of the associated mean-standard deviation plots. An extension of the basic model form was also introduced to address potential deviations from this linearity assumption. The extended Gamma-Gamma model can account for time-of-day variations in mean-standard deviation relationships such as hysteresis patterns observed in mean and day-to-day variation in travel time and incorporate such dynamics in travel time distribution modeling. In summary, the model provides a systematic way of quantifying, comparing, and assessing different types of variability, which is important in understanding travel time characteristics and evaluating various transportation measures that affect reliability.

The multivariate skew-normal (MSN) distribution that we use is tractable, parsimonious in parameters that regulate the distribution and its skewness, and includes the normal distribution as a special interior point case (this allows for testing with the traditional ICLV model). Our procedure to accommodate non-normality in the psychological constructs exploits the latent factor structure of the ICLV model, and is a flexible, yet very efficient approach (through dimension-reduction) to accommodate a multivariate non-normal structure across all indicator and outcome variables in a multivariate system through the specification of a much lower-dimensional multivariate skew-normal distribution for the structural errors. Taste variations (i.e., heterogeneity in sensitivity to response variables) can also be introduced efficiently and in a non-normal fashion through interactions of explanatory variables with the latent variables. The resulting model we develop is suitable for estimation using Bhat's (2011) maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) inference approach. The proposed model is applied to model bicyclists' route choice behavior using a web-based survey of Texas bicyclists. The results reveal evidence for non-normality in the latent constructs. From a substantive point of view, the results suggest that the most unattractive features of a bicycle route are long travel times (for commuters), heavy motorized traffic volume, absence of a continuous bicycle facility, and high parking occupancy rates and long lengths of parking zones along the route.

Specifically, congestion taxes are calculated using marginal congestion pricing based on the flow of the vehicles on each road prior to the beginning of the taxing window (and, hence, there is a time-varying delay in setting the congestion taxes). We motivate the piecewise-constant taxing policy by that users or drivers may dislike fast-changing prices and that they also prefer prior knowledge of the prices. We prove for this model that the multiplicative update rule and the discretized replicator dynamics converge to a socially optimal flow when using vanishing step sizes. Considering that the algorithm cannot adapt itself to a changing environment when using vanishing step sizes, we propose adopting constant step sizes in this case. Then, however, we can only prove the convergence of the dynamics to a neighborhood of the socially optimal flow (with the size of the neighbourhood being of the order of the selected step size). The results are illustrated on a nonlinear version of Pigou's famous routing game. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, an uncontrolled utilization of en-route diversions may increase demands on drivers and cause distraction. This is likely to result in more accidents or reduced productivity which generates additional costs. Since the benefits to the solution quality make a prohibition of en-route diversions unattractive, we propose a general penalty cost based approach for controlling diversions. In contrast to known approaches that allow all diversions, the proposed approach also considers negative application-dependent consequences of diversions on drivers. The approach limits diversions to those which improve the solution quality above a customizable and application-dependent threshold that estimates their negative consequences. We evaluate the proposed general approach by applying it on an exemplary basis to recent deterministic and pro-active real-time routing approaches. Computational experiments show the impact of different penalty cost values on the resulting number of diversions as well as on the attained solution quality. Based on these results, we derive reasonable application-dependent penalty cost values for considering both the contradicting aims of quick request delivery and reducing diversions to a desired extent.

The manufacturers compete with one another in terms of price and quality of the product manufactured, whereas the freight service providers compete on price and quality of the transportation service they provide for multiple modes. Both manufacturers and freight service providers maximize their utilities (profits) while considering the consequences of the competitors' prices and quality levels. Bounds on prices and quality levels are included that have relevant policy-related implications. The governing equilibrium conditions of the static model are formulated as a variational inequality problem. The underlying dynamics are then described, with the stationary point corresponding to the variational inequality solution. An algorithm which provides a discrete-time adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the quality levels and prices over time is proposed, and convergence results given. Numerical examples illustrate how such a supply chain network framework, which is relevant to products ranging from high value to low value ones, can be applied in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By optimally providing housing supply in a region, developers attempt to maximize their profits; on the other hand, if residents were given a chance to decide on housing supply, what patterns of housing supply they would prefer in order to maximize their consumer surpluses. This paper studies the interplay between these two perspectives. A nested multinomial-logit choice structure that encapsulates the bid-rent process is used to capture residents' location and travel choices simultaneously, and the resultant rents at different locations. To investigate the optimal housing supply for these two stakeholders, we conduct sensitivity analyzes to explore the impact of different housing supply patterns on total rental profit and total consumer surplus. Specifically, analytical results are derived for a simple linear network with two residential locations and one destination under homogeneous and heterogeneous value(s) of time. The results of the sensitivity analyzes indicate that segregation of housing supplies at different locations for different income classes is, surprisingly, a preferred outcome by residents under consumer surplus maximization, whereas creating housing supply shortages at convenient locations is a natural outcome under housing profit maximization. These results provide insights on revealing the differences and tradeoffs in performance between these two different perspectives, and on where land use regulations may be needed to balance these two objectives.

Recent studies demonstrate that link density heterogeneity plays a significant role in the shape and scatter level of MFD and can cause hysteresis loops that influence the network performance. Evidently, a more homogeneous network in terms of link density can result in higher network outflow, which implies a network performance improvement. In this article, we introduce two aggregated models, region- and subregion-based MFDs, to study the dynamics of heterogeneity and how they can affect the accuracy scatter and hysteresis of a multi-subregion MFD model. We also introduce a hierarchical perimeter flow control problem by integrating the MFD heterogeneous modeling. The perimeter flow controllers operate on the border between urban regions, and manipulate the percentages of flows that transfer between the regions such that the network delay is minimized and the distribution of congestion is more homogeneous. The first level of the hierarchical control problem can be solved by a model predictive control approach, where the prediction model is the aggregated parsimonious region-based MFD and the plant (reality) is formulated by the subregion-based MFDs, which is a more detailed model. At the lower level, a feedback controller of the hierarchical structure, tries to maximize the outflow of critical regions, by increasing their homogeneity. With inputs that can be observed with existing monitoring techniques and without the need for detailed traffic state information, the proposed framework succeeds to increase network flows and decrease the hysteresis loop of the MED. Comparison with existing perimeter controllers without considering the more advanced heterogeneity modeling of MFD highlights the importance of such approach for traffic modeling and control.

They are widely used in transportation in order to support the decision making of companies and governmental authorities. A large number of attributes might increase the complexity of the choice task in a choice experiment, and have a detrimental effect on the quality of the results obtained. In order to reduce the cognitive effort required by the experiment, researchers may resort to experimental designs where the levels of some attributes are held constant within a choice situation. These designs are called partial profile designs. In this paper, we propose an integrated algorithm for the generation of D-optimal designs for stated choice experiments with partial profiles. This algorithm optimizes the set of constant attributes and the levels of the varying attributes simultaneously. An extensive computational experiment shows that the designs produced by the integrated algorithm outperform those obtained by existing algorithms, and match the optimal designs that have been analytically derived for a number of benchmark instances. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the algorithm under varying experimental conditions and study the structure of the designs generated. We also revisit two stated choice experiments in transportation, and describe how the integrated algorithm could help to improve their designs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

From a methodological perspective, we propose a new econometric approach for the estimation of joint mixed models that include a multiple discrete choice outcome and a nominal discrete outcome, in addition to the count, binary/ordinal outcomes, and continuous outcomes considered in traditional structural equation models. These outcomes are modeled together by specifying latent underlying unobserved individual lifestyle, personality, and attitudinal factors that impact the many outcomes, and generate the jointness among the outcomes. From an empirical perspective, we analyze residential location choice, household vehicle ownership choice, as well as time-use choices, and investigate the extent of association versus causality in the effects of residential density on activity participation and mobility choices. The sample for the empirical application is drawn from a travel survey conducted in the Puget Sound Region in 2014. The results show that residential density effects on activity participation and motorized auto ownership are both associative as well as causal, emphasizing that accounting for residential self-selection effects are not simply esoteric econometric pursuits, but can have important implications for land-use policy measures that focus on neo-urbanist design.

The extent of unobserved heterogeneity associated with a road feature is to be estimated prior to selecting the relevant safety treatment. Moreover, crash count data is often over-dispersed and spatially correlated. This paper proposes a spatial negative binomial specification with random parameters for modeling crash counts of contiguous road segments. The unobserved heterogeneity is incorporated using a finite multi-variate normal mixture prior on the random parameters; this allows for non normality, skewness in the distribution of the random parameters, facilitates correlation across the random parameters, and relaxes any distributional assumptions. The model extracts the inherent groups of road segments with crash counts that are equally sensitive to the road attributes on an average; the heterogeneity within these groups is also allowed in the proposed framework. The specification simultaneously accounts for potential spatial correlation of the crash counts from neighboring road segments. A Gibbs sampling framework is proposed that leverages recent theoretical developments on data-augmentation algorithms, and elegantly sidesteps many of the computational difficulties usually associated with Bayesian inference of count models. Empirical results suggests the presence of two latent groups and spatial correlation within the study road network. Road features with significantly different effect on crash counts across two latent groups of road segments were identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This study used IMS Health National Sales Perspectives (TM) US data to calculate MEPs for the 288 NMEs experiencing initial generic entry between January 1995 and December 2014, the number of generic competitors for 12 months afterward (by level of annual sales prior to generic entry), and generic penetration rates. The likelihood, timing and number of Paragraph IV challengers were calculated using data from Abbreviated New Drug Approval (ANDA) letters, the FDA website, public information searches, and ParagraphFour.com. Results: For drugs experiencing initial generic entry in 2013-2014, the MEP was 12.5 years for drugs with sales greater than $250 million (in 2008 dollars) in the year prior to generic entry ($250 million+NMEs), 13.6 years overall. After generic entry, brands rapidly lost sales, with their average unit share being 7% at 1 year for $250 million+NMEs, 12% overall. Ninety-four percent of $250 million+NMEs experiencing initial generic entry in 2013-2014 had faced at least one Paragraph IV challenge, an average of 5.2 years after brand launch (76% and 5.9 years for all NMEs). NMEs faced an average of 5.1 and 6.2 Paragraph IV challenges per NME, for all and $250 million+NMEs, respectively. Limitations: Analyses, including Paragraph IV calculations, were restricted to NMEs where generic entry had occurred. Conclusion: The average 2013-2014 MEP of 12.5 years for $250 million+NMEs, 13.6 overall remains consistent with prior research. MEPs are lower, and Paragraph IV challenges are more frequent and occur earlier for $250 million+drugs.

Methods: Median treatment duration and median OS data from published Phase 3 clinical trials and prescribing information were used to calculate costs per median OS month based on wholesale acquisition costs (WACs) for patients with mCRPC treated with AA+P or enzalutamide. Sensitivity analyses were performed to understand how variations in treatment duration and treatment-related monitoring recommendations influenced cost per median OS month. Cost-effectiveness estimates of other Phase 3 trial outcomes were also explored: cost per month of chemotherapy avoided and per median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) month. Results: The results demonstrated that AA+P has a lower cost per median OS month than enzalutamide ($3231 vs 4512; 28% reduction), based on the following assumptions: median treatment duration of 14 months for AA+P and 18 months for enzalutamide, median OS of 34.7 months for AA+P and 35.3 months for enzalutamide, and WAC per 30-day supply of $8007.17 for AA+P vs $8847.98 for enzalutamide. Sensitivity analyses showed that accounting for recommended treatment-related monitoring costs or assuming identical treatment durations for AA+P and enzalutamide (18 months) resulted in costs per median OS month 8-27% lower for AA+P than for enzalutamide. Costs per month of chemotherapy avoided were $4448 for AA+P and $5688 for enzalutamide, while costs per month to achieve median rPFS were $6794 for AA+P and $7963 for enzalutamide. Conclusions: This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that costs per median OS month, along with costs of other Phase 3 trial outcomes, were lower for AA+P than for enzalutamide. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. These results have important implications for population health decision-makers evaluating the relative value of therapies for mCRPC patients.","[Pilon, Dominic; Lefebvre, Patrick] Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 De La Gauchetiere West,Bur 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada; [Queener, Marykay; Ellis, Lorie A.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Horsham, PA USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Lefebvre, P (通讯作者)，Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 De La Gauchetiere West,Bur 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",patrick.lefebvre@analysisgroup.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, in Horsham, PA","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, in Horsham, PA","The research was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, in Horsham, PA.",,26,22,23,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We first analyze the linear model and find that the suppliers are selected according to the descending order of their contributed marginal expected profit, and increasing the manufacturer's risk-averseness leads to a more even allocation of demand across the suppliers. Then, we study the general newsvendor model. By approximating the leftover inventory with a normal distribution, we establish the general properties of the active supplier set and show that the supplier selection rule is similar to that under the risk-neutral setting when the demand uncertainty is large. Moreover, we conjecture that the selection rule also applies when the demand uncertainty is low, which we verify with an extensive numerical study. Our paper makes two contributions: First, we establish the properties of the optimal diversification strategy and develop corresponding insights into the trade off between cost and reliability under the mean-variance framework. Second, we perform comparative statics on the optimal solution, with a particular emphasis on investigating how changes in the supplier's cost or reliability affect the risk-averse manufacturer's ordering decisions and customer service level.

It is widely recognized that the government could help break these barriers through incentive policies, such as offering rebates to PEV buyers or funding charging stations. The objective of this paper is to propose a modeling framework that can optimize the design of such incentive policies. The proposed model characterizes the impact of the incentives on the dynamic evolution of PEV market penetration over a discrete set of time intervals, by integrating a simplified consumer vehicle choice model and a macroscopic travel and charging model. The optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear and non-convex mathematical program and solved by a specialized steepest descent direction algorithm. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, the KKT conditions of the proposed model are necessary for local optimum. Results of numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain satisfactory local optimal policies quickly. These optimal policies consistently outperform the alternative policies that mimic the state-of-the-practice by a large margin, in terms of both the total savings in social costs and the market share of PEVs. Importantly, the optimal policy always sets the investment priority on building charging stations. In contrast, providing purchase rebates, which is widely used in current practice, is found to be less effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

New interventions are often fraught with resistance from individual cost centers. A value realization tool (VRT) is essential for separate cost centers to communicate and comprehend the overall financial and clinical implications of post-surgical pain management medication interventions (PSMI). The goal was to describe development of a VRT.Methods:An evaluation of common in-patient PSMI approaches, impacts, and costs was performed. A multidisciplinary task force guided development of the VRT to ensure appropriate representation and relevance to clinical practice. The main outcome was an Excel-based tool that communicates the overall cost/benefit of PSMI for the post-operative patient encounter.Results:The VRT aggregated input data on costs, clinical impact, and nursing burden of PSMI assessment and monitoring into two high-level outcome reports: Overall Cost Impact and Nurse & Patient Impact. Costs included PSMI specific medication, equipment, professional placement, labor, overall/opioid-related adverse events, re-admissions, and length of stay. Nursing impact included level of practice interference, job satisfaction, and patient care metrics. Patient impact included pain scores, opioid use, PACU time, and satisfaction. Reference data was provided for individual institutions that may not collect all variables included in the VRT.Conclusions:The VRT is a valuable way for administrators to assess PSMI cost/benefits and for individual cost centers to see the overall value of individual interventions. The user-friendly, decision-support tool allows the end-user to use built-in referenced or personalized outcome data, increasing relevance to their institutions. This broad picture could facilitate communication across cost centers and evidence-based decisions for appropriate use and impacts of PSMI.","[Keller, Deborah S.] Colorectal Surg Associates LLP LTD, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Smalarz, Amy] Strateg Market Insight, Acton, MA USA; [Haas, Eric M.] Colorectal Surg Associates LLP LTD, Houston Methodist Hosp, Div Colon & Rectal Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Haas, Eric M.] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Minimally Invas Colon & Rectal Surg, Houston, TX USA",The Methodist Hospital System; The Methodist Hospital - Houston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston,"Haas, EM (通讯作者)，Colorectal Surg Associates LLP LTD, 6560 Fannin,Suite 1404, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ehaasmd@houstoncolon.com,"Keller, Deborah Susan/B-2043-2014","Keller, Deborah Susan/0000-0002-8645-6206","Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This work was completed with educational grant support from Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,58,4,4,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The case studies refer to aspects of the common good in communal Italy, to the origins of economic thought and the charitable revolution tied to late medieval charities.

From the political Aristotelian tradition to the recent reflection about the concept of postmodern society through the theory of maximizing the personal interest belonging to Utilitarianism-the moral questions and its dilemma, either accepted or rejected as non sense, have always indicated the directions to the human acts. This paper is focused on consumption field seen as the favourite place where emerge all the contradictions of ethical human behaviour (in terms of choice, moral obligations, individual interests etc). Firstly, the foundations of consumer's ethical responsibility is explored by addressing the changes from Modernity to Postmodernity and their alternative models of consumption. It is argued that, paradoxically, the traces of liquid society with the fall of social structure, represent the beginning for developing a new kind of consumer defined as citizen who is able to embrace a sustainable and moral concept of consumption focused on collective well-being. Secondly, after having defined the main features of ethical consumer, the paper addresses the role of ethics as the element which makes possible the communication between the two spheres of production and consumption. In this regard, following the dialectic between rights and duties articulated by Schrader, the responsibility of consumer is showed to be at the foundation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant DMF) is an orally administered disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) that is currently on the market in the US, Australia, Canada, and Europe. A budget impact model (BIM) was developed to assess the financial consequences of introducing DMF for treatment of RRMS in Canada.Methods:A BIM calculated the financial consequences of introducing DMF in Canada over 3 years based on RRMS prevalence, treatment market share, and clinical effects. RRMS prevalence in Canada was derived from published literature and natural relapse rates, and disease state distribution from clinical trial data. It was conservatively assumed that 100% of RRMS patients were treated with a DMT. DMF was assumed to absorb market share proportionally from the following current treatments: interferon beta-1a-IM, interferon beta-1a-SC, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate. Treatment efficacy, in terms of relapse rate reductions and treatment discontinuation rates, was determined from mixed treatment comparison. Treatment costs (including costs of acquisition, monitoring, and administration) and cost of relapse were considered. Deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the most sensitive input parameters.Results:Over 3 years, the introduction of DMF resulted in an average annual increase of CAD417 per treated patient per year, with reductions in costs associated with relapses (CAD192/patient/year) partially offsetting increased drug acquisition costs (CAD602/patient/year). On a population level, the average annual cost increase was CAD24,654,237, a CAD 0.68 increase per population covered by the Canadian healthcare system. The main drivers of budget impact were drop-out rates, proportion of RRMS patients treated, and market share assumptions.Conclusions:The acquisition costs of DMF for treatment of RRMS are predicted to be partially offset by reduced costs of relapses in the Canadian healthcare system.","[Dorman, Emily; Kansal, Anuraag R.] Evidera, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Sarda, Sujata] Biogen Idec Inc, Cambridge, MA USA",Evidera; Biogen,"Kansal, AR (通讯作者)，Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",anuraag.kansal@evidera.com,,"Kansal, Anuraag/0000-0001-5609-1464",Biogen Idec,Biogen Idec(Biogen),Funding for this study was provided by Biogen Idec.,,24,3,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Under such conditions, the traffic evolution is typically modeled as a dynamical system that captures the aggregated effect of paths-shifts by drivers over time. This paper proposes a day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model that bridges two important gaps in the literature. First, existing DTD models generally consider current path flows and costs, but do not factor the sensitivity of path costs to flow. The proposed DTD model simultaneously captures all three factors in modeling the flow shift by drivers. As a driver can potentially perceive the sensitivity of path costs with the congestion level based on past experience, incorporating this factor can enhance real-world consistency. In addition, it smoothens the time trajectory of path flows, a desirable property for practice where the iterative solution procedure is typically terminated at an arbitrary point due to computational time constraints. Second, the study provides a criterion to classify paths for an origin-destination pair into two subsets under traffic disequilibrium: expensive paths and attractive paths. This facilitates flow shifts from the set of expensive paths to the set of attractive paths, enabling a higher degree of freedom in modeling flow shift compared to that of shifting flows only to the shortest path, which is behaviorally restrictive. In addition, consistent with the real-world driver behavior, it also helps to preclude flow shifts among expensive paths. Improved behavioral consistency can lead to more meaningful path/link time-dependent flow profiles for developing effective dynamic traffic management strategies for practice. The proposed DTD model is formulated as the dynamical system by drawing insights from micro-economic theory. The stability of the model and existence of its stationary point are theoretically proven. Results from computational experiments validate its modeling properties and illustrate its benefits relative to existing DTD dynamical models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, we find that the mere presence of an LCC at an airport can attract passengers, even to competing carriers.

We first design an improved switchable policy which is rooted in the approaches by Mu and Dessouky (2013), with the analysis of possible delays caused by different path choices. Then, three novel integrated train routing and timetabling approaches are proposed on the basis of a discrete event model and different dispatching rules, including no switchable policy (No-SP), Mu and Dessouky (2013)'s switchable policy (Original-SP) and improved switchable policy (Improved-SP). To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approaches, the heterogeneous trains on Beijing-Shanghai high speed railway are scheduled by aforementioned approaches. The case studies indicate that in comparison to No-SP and Original-SP approaches, respectively, the Improved-SP approach can reduce the total delay of trains up to 44.44% and 73.53% within a short computational time. Moreover, all of the performance criteria of the Improved-SP approach are usually better than those of other two approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimal solutions can be obtained in small sizes, however, large-sized problems are hard to solve optimally in a reasonable time. Therefore, a heuristic method, i.e. genetic algorithm is designed to solve the problem in large sizes.

Simultaneous departures of evacuees can lead to overloading of road networks causing congestion. We are especially interested in cases when evacuees subject to little or no risk of exposure evacuate along with evacuees subject to higher risk of threat (also known as shadow evacuation). One of the reasons for correlated evacuee departures is higher perceived risk of threat spread through social contacts. In this work, we study an evacuation scenario consisting of a high risk region and a surrounding low risk area. We propose a probabilistic evacuee departure time model incorporating both evacuee individual characteristics and the underlying evacuee social network. We find that the performance of an evacuation process can be improved by forcing a small subset of evacuees (inhibitors) in the low risk area to delay their departure. The performance of an evacuation is measured by both average travel time of the population and total evacuation time of the high risk evacuees. We derive closed form expressions for average travel time for ER random network. A detailed experimental analysis of various inhibitor selection strategies and their effectiveness on different social network topologies and risk distribution is performed. Results indicate that significant improvement in evacuation performance can be achieved in scenarios where evacuee social networks have short average path lengths and topologically influential evacuees do not belong to the high risk regions. Additionally, communities with stronger ties improve evacuation performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Madireddy, Manini; Kumara, Soundar; Medeiros, D.

With disaggregated freight behaviour data being scarce, transport modellers have identified vehicle tracking and fleet management companies as ideal third party sources for GPS travel data. GPS data does not provide us with behavioural information, but allows us to infer and extract behavioural knowledge using a variety of processing techniques. Many researchers remain sceptical as specific human intervention, referred to as 'expert knowledge', is often required during the processing phase: each GPS data set has unique characteristics and requires unique processing techniques and validation to extract the necessary behavioural information. Although much of the GPS data processing is automated through algorithms, human scrutiny is required to decide what algorithmic parameters as considered 'best', or at least 'good'. In this paper we investigate the repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) of a method that entails variable human intervention in processing GPS data. More specifically, the judgement made by an observer with domain expertise on what clustering parameters applied to GPS data best identify the facilities where commercial vehicles perform their activities. By studying repeatability we want to answer the question if the same expert analyses the GPS data more than once, how similar are the outcomes?', and with reproducibility we want to answer the question 'if different experts analyse the same GPS data, how similar are their outcomes?' We follow two approaches to quantify the R&R and conclude in both cases that the measurement system is accurate. The use of GPS data and the associated expert judgements can hence be applied with confidence in freight transport models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to determine the clinical outcome, costs, and cost-effectiveness of switching from treatment with BHI, IGlar, or NPH to BIAsp 30 over a 30-year time horizon. A 1-year analysis was also performed based on quality-of-life data and treatment costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as a fraction of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and cost-effectiveness was defined as ICER <3-times GDP per capita. Results: Switching treatment from BHI, IGlar, or NPH to BIAsp 30 was associated with an increase in life expectancy of >0.7 years, reduction in all diabetes-related complications, and was considered as cost-effective or highly cost-effective in India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia (BHI to BIAsp 30, 0.26 in India, 1.25 in Indonesia, 0.01 in Saudi Arabia; IGlar to BIAsp 30, -0.68 in India, -0.21 in Saudi Arabia; NPH to BIAsp 30, 0.15 in India, -0.07 in Saudi Arabia; GDP per head per annum/quality-adjusted life-year).

The objective of this study is to assess healthcare resource utilization among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as compared to members without this condition. Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were identified from a national administrative claims database (2006-2011) as having >= 2 claims with idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis, or >= 1 claim with idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis and >= 1 claim with post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (earliest claim with idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis denoted the index date), a procedure of lung biopsy or high-resolution computed tomography within +/- 90 days of the index date, 12-month pre-index continuous enrollment, plus >= 2 confirmatory idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis diagnoses after the procedure. For each idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patient, three members without the condition were matched by age/gender/region/payer type. Demographic/clinical characteristics were measured during the 1-year pre-index period. Healthcare resource utilization was assessed by quarter during 1-year pre- and post-index periods. Generalized estimating equation models controlling for patient characteristics were constructed to estimate adjusted post-index healthcare resource utilization. Results: In total, 1735 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 5205 without (mean age = 71.5 years; 46.1% female) were included. Adjusted results revealed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients were more likely to use healthcare resources than members without the condition 1-year post-index (number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and outpatients visits: 0.63 vs 0.31, 0.62 vs 0.48, and 5.7 vs 3.1 per person-year, respectively).

The intersections are regulated by fixed-time (FT) controls, all with the same cycle length or period, T. The network is modeled as a queuing network. Vehicles arrive from outside the network at entry links in a deterministic periodic stream, also with period T. They take a fixed time to travel along each link, and at the end of the link they join a queue. There is a separate queue at each link for each movement or phase. Vehicles make turns at intersections in fixed proportions, and eventually leave the network, that is, a fraction r(i,j) of vehicles that leave queue i go to queue j and the fraction [1 - Sigma(j)r(i,j)] leave the network. The storage capacity of the queues is infinite, so there is no spill back. The main contribution of the paper is to show that if the signal controls accommodate the demands then, starting in any initial condition, the network state converges to a unique periodic orbit. Thus, the effect of initial conditions disappears. More precisely, the state of the network at time t is the vector x(t) of all queue lengths, together with the position of vehicles traveling along the links. Suppose that the network is stable, that is, x(t) is bounded. Then (1) there exists a unique periodic trajectory x*, with period T; (2) every trajectory converges to this periodic trajectory; (3) if vehicles do not follow loops, the convergence occurs in finite time. The periodic trajectory determines the performance of the entire network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conclusions: Based on DRG and hospitalization costing estimates, MTP might be cost-effective in selected HF patients with MR suitable for such a specific treatment, granted that those patients have a clinical profile predicting high likelihood of post-procedural clinical stability in sufficiently long follow-up.","[Palmieri, Vittorio; Di Lorenzo, Emilio; Sauro, Rosario; Rosato, Giuseppe] AORN SG Moscati Hosp, Heart & Vessels Dept, Cardiol Unit, Avellino, Italy; [Baldi, Cesare; Citro, Rodolfo; Bellino, Elisabetta] AOU San Giovanni Dio & Ruggi DAragona, UOC Cardiol Interventisti Emodinam, Salerno, Italy; [Di Blasi, Paola E.] Univ Salerno, Sch Pharmacol, I-84100 Salerno, Italy; [Preziuso, Feliciano] Poliedra Ingn Clin Srl, Grp STI, Pinerolo, Torino, Italy; [Ranaudo, Carlo] Univ Naples Federico II, Sch Pharmacol, Naples, Italy",San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital; University of Salerno; University of Naples Federico II,"Palmieri, V (通讯作者)，Via Napoli 816, I-81027 San Felice A Cancello, CE, Italy.",vpalmieri68@gmail.com,"Citro, Rodolfo/Q-5242-2016","Citro, Rodolfo/0000-0002-7796-6298",,,,,0,6,6,2,13,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Starting out from microscopic first principles, a bidirectional fundamental diagram (FD) is derived that defines direction-specific flow rates as functions of direction-specific densities. The FD yields non-negative and bounded flows and guarantees that the instantaneous density changes that would result from these flows stay bounded between zero and jam density. In its minimal configuration, it uses just as many parameters as a unidirectional triangular FD: maximum walking speed, jam density, a collision avoidance parameter (from which the backward wave speed can be derived). A one-on-one mapping between the parameters guiding uni- and bidirectional pedestrian flows is proposed and both conceptually and empirically justified. Generalizations of the FD that maintain its desirable properties turn out to be straightforward by making its parameters density-dependent. The FD performs very well in comparisons against simulated and real data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify and review studies that reported data on the economic burden of hypoglycemia and the related medical resource consumption or productivity loss related to hypoglycemia in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 DM. Relevant information was collated in an economic model to assess the direct and indirect costs following severe and non-severe hypoglycemic events in Type 1 and Type 2 DM. Results: Detailed evidence of the medical cost burden of hypoglycemic events was identified from 14 studies. For both Type 1 and Type 2 DM, episodes requiring assistance from a healthcare practitioner were identified as particularly costly and amounted to $1161 per episode (direct costs) compared with episode costs of $66 and $11 for events requiring third-party (non-medical) assistance and events managed by self-treatment, respectively. Indirect costs associated with severe hypoglycemia requiring non-medical assistance, severe hypoglycemia requiring medical assistance, and non-severe hypoglycemia were predicted to be $242, $160, and $11 for patients with Type 1 diabetes and $579, $176, and $11 for patients with Type 2 diabetes, respectively. Conclusion: Both severe and non-severe hypoglycemia incur substantial healthcare costs. Failure to account for these costs may under-estimate the value of management strategies that minimize hypoglycemia risk.","[Foos, Volker; Palmer, James L.] IMS Hlth, HEOR, Basel, Switzerland; [Varol, Nebibe] Eli Lilly & Co, Surrey, England; [Curtis, Bradley H.; Boye, Kristina S.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Grant, David] IMS Hlth, HEOR, London, England; [McEwan, Phil] Swansea Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly; Swansea University,"Foos, V (通讯作者)，Roonstr 45, D-52351 Duren, Germany.",vfoos@ch.imshealth.com,"Costa Font, Joan/C-9609-2013; Grant, David/HGU-0154-2022",,"Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; IMS Health","Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; IMS Health","This work was a joint project funded by the Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, USA and IMS Health.",,0,84,89,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Lurasidone and quetiapine extended-release (XR) are atypical antipsychotic agents indicated for monotherapy treatment of bipolar depression. Lurasidone is also indicated as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lurasidone and quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar depression. Methods: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare lurasidone to quetiapine XR. The model was based on a US third-party payer perspective over a 3-month time horizon. The effectiveness measure in the model was the percentage of patients achieving remission (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score <= 12 by weeks 6-8). The comparison of remission rates was made through an adjusted indirect treatment comparison of lurasidone and quetiapine XR pivotal trials using placebo as the common comparator. Resource utilization for remission vs no remission was estimated from published expert panel data, and resource costs were obtained from a retrospective database study of bipolar I depression patients. Drug costs were estimated using the mean dose from clinical trials and wholesale acquisition costs. Results: Over the 3-month model time period, lurasidone and quetiapine XR patients, respectively, had similar mean numbers of emergency department visits (0.48 vs 0.50), inpatient days (2.1 vs 2.2), and office visits (9.3 vs 9.6). More lurasidone than quetiapine XR patients achieved remission (52.0% vs 43.2%) with slightly higher total costs ($4982 vs $4676), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3474 per remission. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed lurasidone had an 86% probability of being cost-effective compared to quetiapine XR at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $10,000 per remission. Conclusions: Lurasidone may be a cost-effective option when compared to quetiapine XR for the treatment of adults with bipolar depression.","[Rajagopalan, Krithika; Loebel, Antony] Sunovion Pharmaceut Inc, Marlborough, MA USA; [Meyer, Kellie; O'Day, Ken; Denno, Melissa] Xcenda LLC, Palm Harbor, FL USA","Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Company; Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Rajagopalan, K (通讯作者)，Sunovion Pharmaceut Inc, Marlborough, MA USA.",Krithika.Rajagopalan@sunovion.com,,"Rajagopalan, Krithika/0000-0002-4878-0822",Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.,Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.,This manuscript was sponsored by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.,,33,4,4,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) that compared OBV/PTV/r against DCV/ASV and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) in Y93H mutation-negative, GT1b patients with and without cirrhosis were also included. Methods: A health state transition model was developed to capture the natural history of HCV. A CEA over a lifetime horizon was performed from the perspective of the public healthcare payer in Japan. Costs, health utilities, and rates of disease progression were derived from published studies. Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of OBV/PTV/r and DCV/ASV were extracted from Japanese clinical trials. Analyses were performed for treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Alternative scenarios and input parameter uncertainty on the results were tested. Results: OBV/PTV/r exhibited superior clinical outcomes vs comparators. For OBV/PTV/r, DCV/ASV, and no treatment, the lifetime risk of decompensated cirrhosis in treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis was 0.4%, 1.4%, and 9.2%, and hepatocellular carcinoma was 6.5%, 11.4%, and 49.9%, respectively. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were higher in treatment-naive and -experienced patients without cirrhosis treated with OBV/PTV/r (16.41 and 16.22) vs DCV/ASV (15.83 and 15.66) or no treatment (11.34 and 11.23). In treatment-naive and -experienced patients without cirrhosis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of OBV/PTV/r vs DCV/ASV were JPY 1,684,751/QALY and JPY 1,836,596/QALY, respectively; OBV/PTV/r was dominant compared with no treatment. In scenario analysis, including GT1b patients with and without cirrhosis who were Y93H mutation-negative, the ICER of OBV/PTV/r vs DCV/ASV was below the Japanese willingness-to-pay threshold of JPY 5 million/QALY, while the ICER of SOF/LDV vs OBV/PTV/r was above this threshold; thus, OBV/PTV/r was cost-effective. Conclusion: OBV/PTV/r appears to be a cost-effective treatment for chronic HCV GT1b infection against DCV/ASV. OBV/PTV/r dominates no treatment in patients without cirrhosis.","[Virabhak, Suchin; Johnson, Scott; Mitchell, Dominic] Medicus Econ LLC, Milton, MA USA; [Yasui, Kikuo; Yamazaki, Kiyotaka] AbbVie GK, Minato Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Yuen, Cammy] Abbvie Pte Ltd, Singapore, Singapore; [Samp, Jennifer C.] AbbVie Inc, Mettawa, IL USA; [Igarashi, Ataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Tokyo, Japan",AbbVie; AbbVie; AbbVie; University of Tokyo,"Virabhak, S (通讯作者)，1 Tai Hwan Lane, Singapore 555319, Singapore.",suchin.virabhak@medicuseconomics.com,,"Mitchell, Dominic/0000-0002-4902-4383; igarashi, ataru/0000-0001-6307-6916",AbbVie Global,AbbVie Global(AbbVie),"Funding was provided by AbbVie Global to Medicus Economics to develop the cost-effectiveness model, and to DNT Research and Consulting to provide technical writing assistance.",,53,15,17,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The CYP2C19 polymorphism distribution in the Chinese population, the respective cure rates in the CYP2C19 genotype sub-groups, the impact of Duodenal Ulcer (DU) on utility value and drug-related side-effect data were obtained from the literature. The total costs of medications were calculated to estimate the treatment costs based on current drug retail prices in China. Expert surveys were conducted when published data were not available. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to gauge the robustness of the results.Results: Ilaprazole, when compared with omeprazole, achieved a better overall clinical efficacy. For the overall population, ilaprazole achieved an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of yen132 056 per QALY gained. This is less than the WHO recommended threshold of 3-times the average GDP per capita in China (2014). Furthermore, sub-group analysis showed that ilaprazole is cost-effective in every province in CYP2C19 hetEM patients and in the most developed provinces in CYP2C19 homEM patients. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that the results are robust with 97% probability that ilaprozole is considered cost-effective when a threshold of 3-times China's average GDP per capita is considered.Limitation: This study didn't have the data of ilaprazole combined with Hp eradication therapy. Caution should be taken when extrapolating these findings to DU patients with an Hp eradication therapy.Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness analysis results demonstrated that ilaprazole would be considered a cost-effective therapy, compared with omeprazole, in Chinese DU patients based on the efficacy projections in various CYP2C19 polymorphism types.","[Xuan, J.

Two case studies are conducted. The first case illustrates the control and scheduling problem of two trains in a small artificial network with three nodes, where one train follows and overtakes the other. The second case optimises the control and timetable of a single train in a subway line.

This is sometimes referred to as process utility and can be estimated in terms of willingness-to-pay (WTP) or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Previous research has produced multiple studies on QALY gains and WTP estimates of insulin-related attributes. There are, however, significant variations between studies, and it is not clear to what extent the value is a reflection of the true preferences or a consequence of the methodological approach. The aim of this study is to estimate the preferences for treatment attributes associated with basal insulin (administration frequency, administration flexibility, and treatment-induced weight gain) using both QALYselicited using time trade-off (TTO) and WTPamong a sample of the Swedish general population and among a sample of the Swedish diabetes population.Methods: Data was collected using web-based surveys which were distributed to members of internet panels. The WTP survey presented five hypothetical scenarios with an offer to pay the incremental cost to receive basal insulin with improved attributes. The TTO survey presented six hypothetical scenarios where the respondent could choose between living for the rest of his/her life with diabetes and receiving treatment with a basal insulin with certain attributes or live for a shorter time with full health. The scenarios were combined with either a basal or a basal-bolus treatment regimen. Results from the TTO analysis were translated into monetary estimates using a threshold value of SEK500,000 per QALY.Results: In total, 2012 responses were included. The ratings of the attributes were almost identical, irrespective of method for the general population, while it differed to some extent for the diabetes population. The methods produced the same value for flexibility, but the estimates generated with the TTO approach were higher for one less injection and avoided weight gain. The general population assigned a higher utility gain to convenience attributes, while the diabetes population assigned a higher utility gain to avoiding weight gain.Limitations: About a quarter of the respondents did not accept the scenario in the WTP survey, i.e. protesters.Conclusions: The ranking of the attributes was generally independent of evaluation method, but the TTO method resulted in similar or higher values compared to the WTP method.","[Olofsson, Sara; Norrlid, Hanna; Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ IHE, Lund, Sweden; [Olofsson, Sara] Lund Univ, Hlth Econ Unit, Dept Clin Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Ulf] Lund Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sch Econ & Management, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Olofsson, S (通讯作者)，IHE Inst Halso & Sjukvardsekonomi, Box 2127, S-22002 Lund, Sweden.",so@ihe.se,,,Sanofi AB,Sanofi AB,"This study was supported by Sanofi AB.

This model determines the optimal EV sharing station locations and the corresponding EV fleet sizes to minimize the comprehensive system cost, including station construction investment, vehicle charging, transportation and vehicle balancing, under stochastic and dynamic trip demands. This is a very complex problem due to the NP-hard nature of location design, the large number of individual users, and the stochasticity and dynamics of generated trips. Further, the considerable charging time required by EVs distinguishes this problem from traditional car sharing problems where a vehicle is immediately available for pickup after being dropped at a station. We find that the CA approach can overcome these modeling challenges by decomposing the studied area into a number of small neighborhoods that each can be approximated by an Infinite Homogeneous Plane (IHP). We find that the system cost of an IHP is a unimodal function of the station service area size and can be efficiently solved in a sub-linear time by the bisection algorithm. Then integrating the solutions of all IHPs yields an approximate solution to the original heterogeneous area. With numerical experiments, we show that the CA solution is able to estimate the total system cost of the discrete counterpart solution efficiently with good accuracy, even for large-scale heterogeneous problems. This implies that the proposed CA approach is capable of providing a near-optimum solution to the comprehensive design of a practical large-scale EV sharing system. With this model, we also conduct sensitivity analysis to reveal insights into how cost components and system design vary with key parameter values. As far as the author's knowledge, this study is the first work that addresses design of an EV sharing system considering both longer-term location and fleet size planning and daily vehicle operations. The proposed CA model also extends the CA methodology literature from traditional location problems with stationary demand, single-facility based service to EV sharing problems considering dynamic demands, OD trips, and nonlinear vehicle charging times.

The proposed methodology perturbs the parameter space and undertakes path wise analysis of the resulting time series. Most importantly the approach is valid even under non-equilibrium conditions and is based on procuring path-space (time-series) information. More generally we propose a mathematical methodology which quantifies traffic information loss. In particular the method undertakes sensitivity analysis on available traffic data and optimizes the traffic flow model based on two information theoretic tools which we develop. One of them, the relative entropy rate, can adjust and optimize model parameter values in order to reduce the information loss. More precisely, we use the relative entropy rate as an information metric between time-series data and parameterized stochastic dynamics describing a microscopic traffic model. On the other hand, the path-space Fisher Information Matrix, (pFIM) reduces model complexity and can even be used to control fidelity. This is achieved by eliminating unimportant model parameters or their combinations. This results in easier regression of parametric models with a smaller number of parameters. The method reconstructs the Markov Chain and emulates the traffic dynamics through Monte Carlo simulations. We use the microscopic interaction model from Sopasakis and Katsoulakis (2006) as a representative traffic flow model to illustrate this parameterization methodology. During the comparisons we use both synthetic and real, rush-hour, traffic data from highway US-101 in Los Angeles, California. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was performed to determine the association between hospital-associated bleeding in patients admitted for AF on outcomes of length of stay (LOS) and total hospitalization cost.Methods and results:The Premier research database was queried to identify adult inpatients discharged between 2008-2011 having a primary diagnosis code for AF where a bleeding diagnosis code was not present on admission. Regression was used to adjust for baseline differences in patients to estimate outcomes comparing patients with and without a hospital-associated bleed. There were 143,287 patients that met the study criteria. There were 2991 (2.1%) patients identified with a hospital associated bleed. After adjustment for covariates, the mean estimated LOS was significantly greater in the bleed group, at 6.0 days (95% CI=5.8-6.1) vs the no bleed group at 3.3 days (95% CI=3.3-3.3) (p<0.0001). Similarly, the adjusted mean estimated total hospitalization cost was also significantly greater in the bleed group, $12,069 (95% CI=$11,779-$12,366) vs $6561 (95% CI=$6538-$6583) in the no bleed group (p<0.0001).Conclusions:After adjustments for baseline differences the data show that the 2.1% (n=2991) of patients with hospital associated bleeding accounted for an estimated additional 8106 hospitalization days and $16.4 million dollars in cost over the study period compared to non-bleeders.","[Amin, Alpesh N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92868 USA; [Robinson, Scott B.; Bowdy, Bruce D.; Johnson, Bernadette H.] Premier Res Serv, Charlotte, NC USA; [Jing, Yonghua] Abbvie, Chicago, IL USA; [Wiederkehr, Daniel P.] Pfizer, New York, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; AbbVie; Pfizer,"Amin, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, UCIMC, 101 City Dr South,Bldg 58,Room 110,ZC-4076H, Irvine, CA 92868 USA.",anamin@uci.edu,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Pfizer(Pfizer),This study was sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.,,25,4,4,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Thus, social environmental issues have become an essential part of the agricultural policy's objectives. In this context, we can observe a growing interest by the consumers towards the short food supply chain, which allows the recovery of the direct relationship and the consolidation of relations between producers and consumers. The short food supply chain creates the awareness among producers and consumers having common goals and drives them to find new forms of meeting, exchange and collaboration with the direct sale. Thus, the aim is to create some organizational models for the development of new forms of marketing of short chain, by responding to the purpose of ensuring a competitive development of the fruit and vegetable chain and of the reference area.

Clinical guidelines generally recommend at least 3 months of anticoagulation, but, in clinical practice, concerns over bleeding risk often limit extended treatment. Apixaban was studied for extended VTE treatment in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial, demonstrating superiority to placebo in VTE reduction without increasing risk of major bleeding. This study assessed the long-term clinical and economic benefits of extending treatment with apixaban when clinical equipoise exists compared to standard of care with enoxaparin/warfarin and other novel oral anti-coagulants (NOACs) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE in Canada. Methods A Markov model was developed to follow patients with VTE over their lifetimes. Efficacy and safety for apixaban and enoxaparin/warfarin were based on AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT, while relative efficacy to other NOACs was synthesized by network meta-analysis (NMA). Dosages for NOACs and enoxaparin/warfarin were based on their respective trials and were given up to 18 months and up to 6 months, followed by no treatment, respectively. Patient quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were based on published studies, and costs for resource utilization were from a Ministry of Health perspective, expressed as 2014 CAD ($). Results Extended treatment with apixaban compared to enoxaparin/warfarin resulted in fewer recurrent VTEs, VTE-related deaths, and bleeding events, but at slightly increased cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 4828 per QALY gained. Compared to other NOACs, apixaban had the fewest bleeding events, similar recurrent VTE events, and the lowest overall cost, which was driven by the strong bleeding profile. In scenario analyses of acute and lifetime treatments, apixaban was cost-effective against all strategies. Conclusions Extended treatment with apixaban can offer substantial clinical benefits and is a cost-effective alternative to enoxaparin/warfarin and other NOACs.","[Quon, Peter] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Le, Hoa H.] Evidera, Lexington, MA USA; [Raymond, Vincent] Pfizer Canada, Kirkland, PQ, Canada; [Mtibaa, Mondher; Moshyk, Andriy] Bristol Myers Squibb Canada, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Evidera; Evidera; Pfizer; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Quon, P (通讯作者)，7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",peter.quon@evidera.com,,,"Pfizer Canada, Inc.; Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada","Pfizer Canada, Inc.; Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada(Bristol-Myers Squibb)","Funding for this project was provided by Pfizer Canada, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada.",,56,10,10,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Clopidogrel patients were propensity-score matched 1:1 to prasugrel-treated patients. Lin's frequentist cost history method for censored data and Bayesian zero-inflated gamma regression models were used to analyze healthcare costs.Results:The clopidogrel/prasugrel matched-cohort included 10,963 well-matched pairs of patients. Lin's frequentist analysis showed that outpatient visit costs were significantly lower for clopidogrel than prasugrel after 30 days of follow-up. At 30 days, Bayesian data analysis showed strong evidence that clopidogrel was superior to prasugrel for all-cause and ACS-related hospitalization costs and showed very strong evidence that clopidogrel was superior to prasugrel for all-cause and ACS-related outpatient visit costs. At 365 days, Bayesian data analysis showed strong evidence that clopidogrel was superior to prasugrel for all-cause outpatient visit costs and very strong evidence that clopidogrel was superior to prasugrel for ACS-related outpatient visit costs. Point estimates of the all-cause and ACS-related ER visit costs at 30 days and 365 days were similar, but statistical results were inconclusive because of the large variability in this outcome variable.Conclusion:Based on retrospective observational data in a real-world setting, all-cause and ACS-related hospitalization and outpatient visit costs were lower for clopidogrel than prasugrel over 30 days after discharge from a hospitalization or ER visit associated with ACS in patients treated with prasugrel. At 365 days the difference in all-cause and ACS-related outpatient costs remained, but there was little evidence of a difference in either all-cause or ACS-related hospitalization costs.","[Olson, William H.; Crivera, Concetta; Schein, Jeff] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA; [Ma, Yi-Wen] J&J Consumer Co Inc, Horsham, PA USA; [Lefebvre, Patrick; Laliberte, Francois; Dea, Katherine; Germain, Guillaume] Grp Anal Ltee, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lynch, Scott M.] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Duke University,"Olson, WH (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, 1125 Trenton Harbourton Rd, Titusville, NJ 08560 USA.",wolson@its.jnj.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ","This research was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ.",,30,0,1,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This paper describes a microsimulation model as a comprehensive tool to understand the relationship between body weight, health, and economic outcomes.Methods:Patient health and economic outcomes were simulated annually over 10 years using a Markov-based microsimulation model. The obese population examined is nationally representative of obese adults in the US from the 2005-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, while a matched normal weight population was constructed to have similar demographics as the obese population during the same period. Prediction equations for onset of obesity-related comorbidities, medical expenditures, economic outcomes, mortality, and quality-of-life came from published trials and studies supplemented with original research. Model validation followed International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research practice guidelines.Results:Among surviving adults, relative to a matched normal weight population, obese adults averaged $3900 higher medical expenditures in the initial year, growing to $4600 higher expenditures in year 10. Obese adults had higher initial prevalence and higher simulated onset of comorbidities as they aged. Over 10 years, excess medical expenditures attributed to obesity averaged $4280 annuallyranging from $2820 for obese category I to $5100 for obese category II, and $8710 for obese category III. Each excess kilogram of weight contributed to $140 higher annual costs, on average, ranging from $136 (obese I) to $152 (obese III). Poor health associated with obesity increased work absenteeism and mortality, and lowered employment probability, personal income, and quality-of-life.Conclusions:This validated model helps illustrate why obese adults have higher medical and indirect costs relative to normal weight adults, and shows that medical costs for obese adults rise more rapidly with aging relative to normal weight adults.","[Su, W.; Chen, F.; Iacobucci, W.; Dall, T.

In this study, within the framework of the kinematic wave theory, we propose a simple model of capacity drop based on the observation that capacity drop occurs when an upstream queue forms at an active bottleneck. Different from existing models, the new model still uses continuous fundamental diagrams but employs an entropy condition defined by a discontinuous boundary flux function, which introduces a traffic state-dependent capacity constraint. For a lane-drop area, we demonstrate that the model is well-defined, and its Riemann problem can be uniquely solved. After deriving the flow-density relations upstream and downstream to a bottleneck location, we find that the model can replicate the following three characteristics of capacity drop: the maximum discharge flow-rate can be reached only when both upstream and downstream traffic conditions are uncongested, capacity drop occurs when the bottleneck is activated, and some steady traffic states cannot be observed at both locations. We show that the new model is bistable subject to perturbations in initial and boundary conditions. With empirical observations at a merging bottleneck we also verify the three characteristics of capacity drop predicted by the new model. Through this study, we establish that the new model is physically meaningful, conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and mathematically tractable. We finally discuss future extensions and potential applications of the new model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although their model was proposed for pedestrian traffic, it can also be applied to urban cities. The model is very general, and consists of a conservation law (CL) and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that contains a minimum value problem. However, only an isotropic application example was given in their paper. We claim that the HJB equation is difficult to compute numerically in an anisotropic case. To overcome this, we reformulate their model for a dense urban city that is arbitrary in shape and has multiple central business districts (CBDs). In our model, the minimum value problem is only used in the CL portion, and the HJB equation reduces to a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation for easier computation. The dynamic path equilibrium of our model is proven in a different way from theirs, and a numerical algorithm is also provided to solve the model. Finally, we show two numerical examples under the anisotropic case and compare the results with those of the isotropic case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Such phenomenon has been repeatedly seen in the field of transportation systems, such as those related to the booming bioenergy production, among others. We develop a game-theoretic modeling framework using a continuum approximation scheme to address the impacts of competition on the optimal infrastructure deployment. Furthermore, we extend the model to incorporate uncertainties in supply/demand and the risk of facility disruptions. Analytical properties of the optimal infrastructure system are obtained, based on which fast numerical solution algorithms are developed.

A constrained stochastic optimization problem that maximizes the profit function in terms of the long-run, time-average of the flows in the supply chain is formulated. The algorithm is distributed and based on queueing theory and stochastic Lyapunov analysis concepts. The long-run, time averages of the flows generated by the algorithm can get arbitrarily close to the solution of the aforementioned optimization problem.

One of main reasons for congestion is the concentrated arrivals of road trucks at peak hours. A negotiation process for smoothing truck arrivals in peak hours among multiple trucking companies and a terminal is addressed. The negotiation process is to be used for the appointment system for road trucks in container terminals. This paper suggests a mathematical formulation for smoothing the peaks in arrivals considering the inconvenience of trucks from changing their arrival times and the waiting cost of trucks in peak hours. This study proposes a decentralized decision-making model to support the negotiation process between truck companies and the terminal operator. It gives an acceptable solution to every player involved as well as the near optimal solution to the entire system from the global point of view. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the approach in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Privately insured employees (aged >= 18) with >= 1 RA diagnosis (ICD-9: 714.0) were identified from a large-scale US employer claims database (1998-2011). Patients were stratified into treatment groups (anti-TNF-treated patients and MTX-monotherapy patients) based on their treatment history. The anti-TNF- treated patients comprised patients who filled >= 1 prescription for anti-TNFs, with or without MTX (index date defined as the date of the first anti-TNF prescription). The MTX-treated patients comprised patients who filled >= 1 prescription for MTX-monotherapy (index date randomly selected). The primary study outcome was the annual income growth rate (US dollars). Patients were followed from their index date to health plan disenrollment or the end of data availability (maximum follow-up of 5 years). The effect of treatment type on income growth was assessed using a multivariable generalized estimating equation model, adjusting for key baseline characteristics. Income growth was compared to that of the general employed population using Social Security data (1998-2011). Results: The regression-adjusted annual growth rate in income for anti-TNF-treated patients (n = 1848) was 2.8% (CI = 1.9-3.6%), significantly greater (p<0.05) than the 0.6% (CI = -0.2-1.4%) for MTX-monotherapy patients (n = 1866). Compared to the general employed population, income growth was lower (p<0.05) for MTX-monotherapy patients and comparable for anti-TNF-treated patients. Conclusions: Compared to MTX-monotherapy, anti-TNF treatment is associated with a higher income growth rate among employees with RA. Anti-TNF-treated patients experienced comparable income growth to the general employed population norm.","[Bergman, Martin] Taylor Hosp, Ridley Park, PA 19078 USA; [De, Gourab] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY USA; [Ganguli, Arijit; Bao, Yanjun] Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, AbbVie, IL USA; [Signorovitch, James] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; AbbVie; Analysis Group Inc.,"Bergman, M (通讯作者)，Taylor Hosp, 8 Morton Ave,Suite 304, Ridley Park, PA 19078 USA.",mjbergman@prodigy.net,,,AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"The design, study conduct, and financial support for the study was provided by AbbVie.

The combined values of these variables contribute to the costs associated with route operations as well as the costs associated with passenger comfort, such as waiting and overcrowding. The new approach to the problem that we introduce combines both passenger and operator costs within a generalized newsvendor model. From the passenger perspective, waiting and overcrowding costs are used; from the operator's perspective, the costs are related to vehicle size, empty seats, and lost sales. Maximal passenger average waiting time as well as maximal vehicle capacity are considered as constraints that are imposed by the regulator to assure a minimal public transit service level or in order to comply with other regulatory considerations. The advantages of the newsvendor model are that (a) costs are treated as shortages (overcrowding) and surpluses (empty seats); (b) the model presents simultaneous optimal results for both frequency and vehicle size; (c) an efficient and fast algorithm is developed; and (d) the model assumes stochastic demand, and is not restricted to a specific distribution. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model through a case study and sensitivity analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The KRSP problem extends the classical K loopless shortest paths problem to the stochastic networks by explicitly considering travel time reliability. In this study, a deviation path approach is established for finding K alpha-reliable paths in stochastic networks. A deviation path algorithm is proposed to exactly solve the KRSP problem in large-scale networks. The A* technique is introduced to further improve the KRSP finding performance. A case study using real traffic information is performed to validate the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can determine KRSP under various travel time reliability values within reasonable computational times. The introduced A* technique can significantly improve KRSP finding performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This retrospective chart review aimed to quantify hospitalizations and reimbursement in this patient population in France.Methods: Patients aged 18 years and with at least one hospitalization for Ph(-) R/R B-precursor ALL were included in the study. They were relapsed with first remission lasting <12 months, relapsed after first salvage therapy, relapsed any time after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or were refractory to initial or salvage therapy. Data were collected from the index date (first diagnosis of R/R ALL) until death or loss to follow-up. The chemotherapy period was defined as the first chemotherapy date after the index date to the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, last chemotherapy dose plus 30 days, or initiation of HSCT. The primary outcome was the percentage of time hospitalized during the chemotherapy period.Results: Thirty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 49 years. The mean proportion of time spent in the hospital during the chemotherapy period was 46% (95% CI =34-57%). Patients had a mean of 2.2 (SD =1.5) inpatient hospitalizations and the mean length of stay per hospitalization was 16.8 (SD =14.8) days. During the chemotherapy period, the mean amount reimbursed per hospitalization was Euro31 067 (SD = Euro4850) and the total hospitalization reimbursement per patient was Euro68 344. From the index date to death, excluding HSCT, the total reimbursement per patient was Euro108 873.Limitations: The sample size was small, although this was expected given the rarity of the patient population.Conclusions: Adults with Ph(-) R/R B-precursor ALL had repeated and prolonged hospitalizations during salvage chemotherapy. Approximately half the follow-up period was spent in the hospital, and this time was associated with high economic burden in France.","[Dombret, Herve] Univ Paris Diderot, Hop St Louis, Paris, France; [Thomas, Xavier] Hop Lyon Sud, Lyon, France; [Chevallier, Patrice] CHU Nantes, Nantes, France; [Nivot, Edwige] Amgen Hlth Econ, Boulogne, France; [Reitan, John] RJM Grp, Crown Point, IN USA; [Barber, Beth; Barlev, Arie] Amgen Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA USA; [Mohty, Mohamad] Hop St Antoine, Paris, France; [Mohty, Mohamad] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Mohty, Mohamad] INSERM, U938, Paris, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Louis - APHP; CHU Lyon; Nantes Universite; CHU de Nantes; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm),"Dombret, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot, Univ Hosp St Louis, Blood Dis Dept, Leukemia Unit, 1 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75475 Paris 10, France.",herve.dombret@sls.aphp.fr,,"Mohty, Mohamad/0000-0002-7264-808X",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),This study was funded by Amgen.,,23,6,6,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, relationships between higher-order continuum and car-following traffic flow models are still not well understood. In this study, we first categorize traffic flow models according to their coordinates, state variables, and orders in the three-dimensional representation of traffic flow and propose a unified approach to convert higher-order car-following models into continuum models and vice versa. The conversion method consists of two steps: equivalent transformations between the secondary Eulerian (E-S) formulations and the primary Lagrangian (L-P) formulations, and approximations of L-P derivatives with anisotropic (upwind) finite differences. We use the method to derive continuum models from general second- and third-order car-following models and derive car-following models from second-order continuum models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that corresponding higher order continuum and car-following models have the same fundamental diagrams, and that the string stability conditions for vehicle-continuous car-following models are the same as the linear stability conditions for the corresponding continuum models. A numerical example verifies the analytical results. In a sense, we establish a weak equivalence between continuum and car-following models, subject to errors introduced by the finite difference approximation. Such an equivalence relation can help us to pick out anisotropic solutions of higher-order models with non-concave fundamental diagrams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Exclusions included non-AF ablation, surgical ablation, valve replacement or repair, or cardiac implant. Hospitals were required to perform 20 procedures using each technology, with the technology identifiable in at least 90% of cases. The primary endpoint was total variable visit cost, modeled separately for inpatient and outpatient visits, and adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. Technology was categorized as RF or Cryo, with dual-technology procedures classified as Cryo. The Cryo cohort was further divided into Cryo only and Cryo with RF for sensitivity analyses. A composite adverse event endpoint was also compared.Results: A total of 1261RF procedures and 1276 Cryo procedures, of which 500 also used RF, met study criteria. RF patients were slightly older and sicker, and had more cardiovascular disease and additional arrhythmias. Adjusted inpatient costs were $2803 (30.0%) higher for Cryo, and adjusted outpatient costs were $2215 (19.5%) higher. Sensitivity models showed higher costs in both Cryo sub-groups compared with RF. Procedural complication rates were not significantly different between cohorts (p-values: 0.4888 inpatient, 0.5072 outpatient).Conclusion: AF ablation using RF results in significantly lower costs compared with Cryo, despite an RF population with more cardiovascular disease. This saving cannot be attributed to a difference in complication rates.","[Hunter, Tina D.; Palli, Swetha R.] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, 1775 Lexington Ave,Suite 200, Cincinnati, OH 45212 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Hunter, TD (通讯作者)，CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, 1775 Lexington Ave,Suite 200, Cincinnati, OH 45212 USA.",thunter@ctifacts.com,,,"Biosense Webster, Inc.","Biosense Webster, Inc.","This study was funded by Biosense Webster, Inc.

Treating schizophrenia is costly for health systems. The European Medicines Agency has approved paliperidone palmitate (PP-LAI; Xeplion), an atypical antipsychotic depot; however, its pharmacoeconomic profile in Portugal is unknown. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the viewpoint of the Portuguese National Health Service. Methods: PP-LAI was compared with long acting injectables risperidone (RIS-LAI) and haloperidol (HAL-LAI) and oral drugs (olanzapine; oral-OLZ) adapting a 1-year decision tree to Portugal, guided by local experts. Clinical information and costs were obtained from literature sources and published lists. Outcomes included relapses (both requiring and not requiring hospitalization) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were expressed in 2014 euros. Economic outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs); including cost-utility (outcome=QALYs) and cost-effectiveness analyses (outcomes = relapse/hospitalization/emergency room (ER) visit avoided). Results: The base-case cost of oral-OLZ was 4447(sic) (20% drugs/20% medical/60% hospital); HAL-LAI cost 4474(sic) (13% drugs/13% medical/74% hospital); PP-LAI cost 5326(sic) (49% drugs/12% medical/39% hospital); RIS-LAI cost 6223(sic) (44% drugs/12% medical/44% hospital). Respective QALYs/hospitalizations/ER visits were oral-OLZ: 0.761/0.615/0.242; HAL-LAI: 0.758/0.623/0.250; PP-LAI: 0.823/0.288/0.122; RIS-LAI: 0.799/0.394/0.168. HAL-LAI was dominated by oral-OLZ and RIS-LAI by PP-LAI for all outcomes. The ICER of PP-LAI over oral-OLZ was 14,247(sic)/QALY, well below NICE/Portuguese thresholds (approximate to 24,800(sic)/30,000(sic)/QALY). ICERs were 1973(sic)/relapse avoided and 2697(sic)/hospitalization avoided. Analyses were robust against most variations in input values, as PP-LAI was cost-effective over oral-OLZ in >99% of 10,000 simulations. Conclusion: In Portugal, PP-LAI dominated HAL-LAI and RIS-LAI and was cost-effective over oral-OLZ with respect to QALYs gained, relapses avoided, and hospitalizations avoided.","[Einarson, Thomas R.; Bereza, Basil G.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON M5V 3M8, Canada; [Maia-Lopes, Susana] Janssen Cilag Farmaceut Lda, Barcarena, Portugal; [Goswami, Pushpendra; Van Impe, Kristel] Janssen Cilag GmbH, Neuss, Germany",University of Toronto; Johnson & Johnson,"Einarson, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON M5V 3M8, Canada.",t.einarson@rogers.com,,,"Janssen A/S, Beerse, Belgium","Janssen A/S, Beerse, Belgium","This research was funded by Janssen A/S, Beerse, Belgium.",,82,13,15,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Passive sensors simply count vehicles, while active sensors can recognize vehicle plates but are more expensive. We developed a two-stage heterogeneous sensor location model to determine the most cost-effective strategies for sensor deployment. The first stage of the model adopts the path reconstruction model defined by Castillo et al. (2008b) to determine the optimal locations of active sensors in the network. In the second stage, an algebraic framework is developed to strategically replace active sensors so that the total installation cost can be reduced while maintaining path flow observation quality. Within the algebraic framework, a scalar product operator is introduced to calculate path flows. An extension matrix is generated and used to determine if a replacement scheme is able to reconstruct all path flows. A graph model is then constructed to determine feasible replacement schemes. The problem of finding the optimal replacement scheme is addressed by utilizing the theory of maximum clique to obtain the upper bound of the number of replaced sensors and then revising this upper bound to generate the optimal replacement scheme. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed to solve the maximum clique problem, and the optimal replacement scheme can be obtained accordingly. Three numerical experiments show that our proposed two-stage method can reduce the total costs of transportation surveillance systems without affecting the system monitor quality. The locations of the active sensors play a more critical role than the locations of the passive sensors in the number of reconstructed paths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A decision-tree model simulated the clinical pathway for patients with suspected HCC from the first imaging procedure to a confirmed treatment decision. Input data (probabilities and resource consumptions) were estimated and validated by clinical experts. Costs for diagnostic alternatives and related treatment options were derived from published sources, taking into account both payer's and hospital's perspectives. Results: All experts from Korea and Thailand agreed that Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI yields the highest diagnostic certainty and minimizes the need for additional confirmatory diagnostic procedures in HCC. In Korea, from the payer's perspective, total cost was USD $3087/patient to reach a confirmed treatment decision using Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI (vs $3205/patient for MDCT and $3403/patient for ECCM-MRI). From the hospital's perspective, Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI incurred the lowest cost ($2289/patient vs $2320/patient and $2528/patient, respectively). In Thailand, Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI was the least costly alternative for the payer ($702/patient vs $931/patient for MDCT and $873/patient for ECCM-MRI). From the hospital's perspective, costs were $1106/patient, $1178/patient, and $1087/patient for Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI, MDCT, and ECCM-MRI, respectively. Conclusions: Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI as an initial imaging procedure in patients with suspected HCC provides better diagnostic certainty and relevant statutory health insurance cost savings in Thailand and Korea, compared with ECCM-MRI and MDCT.","[Lee, Jeong-Min] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Radiol, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 110744, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong-Min] Inst Radiat Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Myeong-Jin] Yonsei Univ, Res Inst Radiol Sci, Severance Hosp, Dept Radiol,Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Phongkitkarun, Sith] Mahidol Univ, Ramathibodi Hosp, Dept Radiol, Fac Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sobhonslidsuk, Abhasnee] Mahidol Univ, Ramathibodi Hosp, Dept Med, Fac Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Holtorf, Anke-Peggy; Rinde, Harald] Hlth Outcomes Strategies LLC, Basel, Switzerland; [Bergmann, Karsten] Bayer Pharma AG, Clin Supply Management, Berlin, Germany",Seoul National University (SNU); Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Mahidol University; Mahidol University; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Lee, JM (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Dept Radiol, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 110744, South Korea.",jmsh@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Jeong Min/V-3429-2019; Kim, Tae HWan/ABC-5406-2021","Lee, Jeong Min/0000-0003-0561-8777; Kim, Tae HWan/0000-0002-5585-6522; Holtorf, Anke-Peggy/0000-0002-4638-5351","Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany","Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals)","This study was funded by Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany.",,25,11,11,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

At first, we propose the methods of updating the probability of the current net inventory and predicting those in future periods. For each candidate route, we develop a Robust TQL Algorithm to optimize the replenishment time, replenishment quantity and replenishment stage length. Finally, a genetic algorithm based method is developed to optimize the delivery route. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The inventory of new and returned products is managed at forward and reverse distribution centers respectively through a periodic review policy. The proposed model determines the location of forward and reverse distribution centers and the associated capacities, the review intervals of the inventory policy at distribution centers, and the assignments of retailers to the distribution centers. We model six different coordination strategies. All the models are formulated as nonlinear integer programs with chance constraints and transformed to conic quadratic mixed-integer programs that can be efficiently solved by CPLEX. An outer approximation based solution algorithm is developed to solve the conic quadratic mixed-integer program. The benefit of different types of coordination strategies is shown through extensive computational testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: An observational study compared a prospective cohort of patients >= 65 years subjected to pharmacogenetic testing to a propensity score (PS) matched historical cohort of untested patients in a claims database. Patients had a prescribed medication or dose change of at least one of 61 oral drugs or combinations of >= 3 drugs at enrollment. Four-month HRU outcomes examined included hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) and outpatient visits and provider acceptance of test recommendations. Costs were estimated using national data sources. Results: There were 205 tested patients PS matched to 820 untested patients. Hospitalization rate was 9.8% in the tested group vs 16.1% in the untested group (RR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.39-0.95, p = 0.027), ED visit rate was 4.4% in the tested group vs 15.4% in the untested group (RR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.15-0.55, p = 0.0002) and outpatient visit rate was 71.7% in the tested group vs 36.5% in the untested group (RR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.74-2.23, p < 0.0001). The rate of overall HRU was 72.2% in the tested group vs 49.0% in the untested group (RR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.32-1.64, p < 0.0001). Potential cost savings were estimated at $218 (mean) in the tested group. The provider majority (95%) considered the test helpful and 46% followed CDST provided recommendations. Conclusion: Patients CYP DNA tested and treated according to the personalized prescribing system had a significant decrease in hospitalizations and emergency department visits, resulting in potential cost savings. Providers had a high satisfaction rate with the clinical utility of the system and followed recommendations when appropriate.","[Brixner, D.; Biltaji, E.; Bress, A.; Unni, S.; Ye, X.; Biskupiak, J.] Univ Utah, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Brixner, D.; Biltaji, E.] Univ Utah, Program Personalized Hlth, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Mamiya, T.; Ashcraft, K.] Genelex Corp, Seattle, WA USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Brixner, D (通讯作者)，Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Res Ctr, 30 South 2000 East,Room, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",diana.brixner@utah.edu,"Ashcraft, Kristine/IWU-5783-2023","Bress, Adam/0000-0002-2259-5039; Ye, Xiangyang/0000-0003-2722-3653",University of Utah,University of Utah,"Genelex provided services consisting of buccal swab collection materials, shipping, genotyping and curation of the YouScript report.

We set up a two-period game; allowing two ports first choose their facility investment levels, and then decide their cargo-handling amounts and service prices. When investment costs of the two ports are large, the unique equilibrium is no investment. If investment costs of at least one port are small, then one or two ports will invest at equilibria. If both ports invest at equilibrium, they may become worse off than at non-equilibrium of no investment. This means that the ports may face a tradeoff between stability and efficiency. Moreover, we compare the behaviors of risk averse and risk-neutral ports, as well as risk-averse ports' behaviors under uncertainty and no-uncertainty. It is found that ports' risk-averse degrees are the major factor determining their behaviors in different scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to assess the financial consequences of CI-AKI risk reduction in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CA) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in German, Italian, Polish and Spanish hospitals. Methods: This budget impact analysis (BIA) compared a scenario with iodixanol to a scenario without, where only LOCM were used, in patients at increased risk of CI-AKI over a 3-year horizon. A meta-analysis based on a systematic review observed a lower rate of CI-AKI with iodixanol compared to LOCM (Risk Reduction=0.46) in patients with underlying impaired renal function (serum creatinine >= 1.6mg/dl and estimated glomerular filtration rate <= 50ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Contrast media and CI-AKI hospitalization costs were included in the analysis and unit costs were obtained from published literature, official sources or, when available, from hospital data. In the absence of country-specific data, resource utilization for a CI-AKI hospitalization was obtained by interviews with local clinicians in each country. The percentage of patients who received iodixanol was assumed to increase over time. Results: Based on a percentage of patients at increased risk of CI-AKI equal to 20% in Germany, 24% in Italy, 23% in Poland and 10% in Spain, results showed that the introduction of iodixanol would bring a 3-years cumulative net percentage saving on the total hospital budget of 29%, 34%, 25%, and 33% in the four countries respectively. Conclusion: The results of the analysis for the four countries showed that iodixanol use in patients at increased risk of CI-AKI undergoing CA with or without PCI may bring considerable savings on the hospital's budget, due to the associated reduction in CI-AKI incidence.","[De Francesco, Maria; Lamotte, Mark] IMS Hlth, Vilvoorde, Belgium; [Ronco, Claudio] San Bortolo Hosp, Vicenza, Italy; [Wacinski, Piotr J.] Med Univ Lublin, Lublin, Poland; [Wessely, Rainer] Zentrum Herz Gefass & Lungenmed, Cologne, Germany; [Hernandez, Felipe] Hosp Univ Doce Octubre, Madrid, Spain",ULSS 8 Berica; Ospedale San Bortolo di Vicenza; Medical University of Lublin; Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre,"De Francesco, M (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth Real World Evidence Solut, Medialaan 38, B-1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium.",mdefrancesco@be.imshealth.com,"Hernandez Hernandez, Felipe/IUQ-8344-2023; Wacinski, Piotr/HOF-1925-2023","Wacinski, Piotr/0000-0002-8537-8867; Ronco, Claudio/0000-0002-6697-4065; HERNANDEZ, FELIPE/0000-0003-3831-151X",GE Healthcare,GE Healthcare(General ElectricGE Healthcare),GE Healthcare provided funding for this manuscript.,,20,5,5,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The availability of new non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOAC) agents as monotherapy may reduce the likelihood of hospitalization for DVT patients.Objective:To compare hospital visit costs of DVT patients treated with rivaroxaban and LMWH/warfarin.Methods:A retrospective claim analysis was conducted using the MarketScan Hospital Drug Database for care provided between January 2011 and December 2013. Adult patients using rivaroxaban or LMWH/warfarin with a primary diagnosis of DVT during the first day of a hospital visit were identified (i.e., index hospital visit). Based on propensity-score methods, historical LMWH/warfarin patients (i.e., patients who received LMWH/warfarin before the approval of rivaroxaban) were matched 4:1 to rivaroxaban patients. The hospital-visit cost difference between these groups was evaluated for the index hospital visit, as well as for total hospital-visit costs (i.e., including index and subsequent hospital visit costs).Results:All rivaroxaban users (n=134) in the database were well-matched with four LMWH/warfarin users (n=536). The mean hospital-visit costs were $5257 for the rivaroxaban cohort and $6764 in the matched-cohort of patients using LMWH/warfarin. The $1508 cost difference was statistically significant between cohorts (95% CI=[-$2296; -$580]; p-value=0.002). Total hospital-visit costs were lower for rivaroxaban compared to LMWH/warfarin users within 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after index visit (significantly lower within 1 and 3 months, p-values <0.05)Limitations:Limitations were inherent to administrative-claims data, completeness of baseline characteristics, adjustments restricted to observational factors, and lastly the sample size of the rivaroxaban cohort.Conclusion:The availability of rivaroxaban significantly reduced the costs of hospital visits in patients with DVT treated with rivaroxaban compared to LMWH/warfarin.","[Merli, Geno J.; Hollander, Judd E.; Pollack, Charles V.] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Lefebvre, Patrick; Laliberte, Francois; Germain, Guillaume] Grp Anal Ltee, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada; [Raut, Monika K.; Bookhart, Brahim] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA",Jefferson University; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Germain, G (通讯作者)，Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 Gauchetiere Ouest 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",guillaume.germain@analysisgroup.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ","This research was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ.",,19,14,16,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Patient eligibility criteria included: (1) age 18 years; (2) discontinuation of first TKI (sunitinib, sorafenib, or pazopanib) for medical reasons; (3) initiation of axitinib or everolimus as a second targeted therapy during February 2012-January 2013. Real-world dosing patterns were summarized. Dose-specific drug costs (as of October 2014) were based on wholesale acquisition costs from RED BOOK Online. PFS was compared between everolimus and axitinib using a multivariable Cox proportion hazards model. Everolimus and axitinib drug costs per month of PFS were compared using multivariable gamma regression models.Results:A total of 325 patients received everolimus and 127 patients received axitinib as second targeted therapy. Higher proportions of patients treated with axitinib vs everolimus started on a higher than label-recommended starting dose (14% vs 2%) or experienced dose escalation (11% vs 1%) on second targeted therapy. The PFS did not differ significantly between patients receiving everolimus or axitinib (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.73-1.82). After baseline characteristics adjustment, axitinib was associated with 17% ($1830) higher drug costs per month of PFS compared to everolimus ($12,467 vs $10,637; p<0.001).Limitations:Retrospective observational study design and only drug acquisition costs considered in drug costs estimates.Conclusions:Patients with aRCC receiving axitinib as second targeted therapy were more likely to initiate at a higher than label-recommended dose and were more likely to dose escalate than patients receiving everolimus. With similar observed durations of PFS, drug costs were significantly higherby 17% per month of PFSwith axitinib than with everolimus.","[Pal, Sumanta K.] City Hope, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Duarte, CA USA; [Jonasch, Eric] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Signorovitch, James E.; Reichmann, William M.; Li, Nanxin] Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Liu, Zhimei; Perez, Jose Ricardo] Novartis Pharmaceut Corp, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Vogelzang, Nicholas J.] US Oncol Res, Comprehens Canc Ctr Nevada, Las Vegas, NV USA",City of Hope; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada; US Oncology Network,"Signorovitch, JE (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",james.signorovitch@analysisgroup.com,"Li, Nanxin/D-9755-2011","Reichmann, William/0009-0006-9954-2740","Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ","Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ","Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ.",,30,7,9,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Such ignorance overestimates driver capability and leads to most CF models' inability in realistically explaining human driving behaviors. This paper proposes a novel car-following modeling framework by introducing the difficulty of driving task measured as the dynamic interaction between driving task demand and driver capability. Task difficulty is formulated based on the famous Task-Capability Interface (TCI) model, which explains the motivations behind driver's decision making. The proposed method is applied to enhance two popular CF models: Gipps' model and IDM, and named as TDGipps and TDIDM respectively. The behavioral soundness of TDGipps and TDIDM are discussed and their stabilities are analyzed. Moreover, the enhanced models are calibrated with the vehicle trajectory data, and validated to explain both regular and human factor influenced CF behavior (which is distraction caused by hand-held mobile phone conversation in this paper). Both the models show better performance than their predecessors, especially in presence of human factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, while the theory of traffic equilibria is very well-known, fewer results exist on the stability of such equilibria, especially in the context of adaptive routing policy. In this work, we consider the problem of characterizing the stability properties of traffic equilibria in the context of online adaptive route choice induced by GPS-based decision making. We first extend the recent framework of Markovian Traffic Equilibria (MTE), in which users update their route choice at each intersection of the road network based on traffic conditions, to the case of non-equilibrium conditions, while preserving consistency with known existence and uniqueness results on MTE. We then exhibit sufficient conditions on the network topology and the latency functions for those MTEs to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov for a single destination problem. For various more restricted classes of network topologies motivated by the observed properties of travel patterns in the Singapore network, under certain assumptions we prove local exponential stability of the MTE, and derive analytical results on the sensitivity of the characteristic time of convergence to network and traffic parameters. The results proposed in this work are illustrated and validated on synthetic toy problems as well as on the Singapore road network with real demand and traffic data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The design model is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), which is NP-hard due to non-convexity in both the objective function and the feasible set. An analytical method is proposed to solve the MPEC by decomposing it into smaller and easier quadratic programs, each corresponding to a unique departure order of different user classes. The quadratic programs are defined on a polyhedral set, which makes it easier to identify a local optimum. Importantly, each quadratic program is constrained by a set of linear feasibility cuts that define the presence of each user class in the arrival window. We prove that the proposed method ensures global optimality provided that each quadratic program can be solved globally. To obviate enumerating all departure orders, a heuristic method is developed to navigate through the solution space by using the multipliers associated with the feasibility cuts. Numerical experiments are conducted on several small examples to validate the proposed methodology. These experiments show that the proposed heuristic method is effective in finding near-optimal solutions within a relatively small number of iterations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The first approach, following the continuum approximation scheme, builds upon the special case of an infinite homogeneous plane where traffic equilibrium can be described by an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this homogeneous case, sometimes in a closed form, is then used to develop approximate solutions to more general cases (e.g., those in a heterogeneous space). This model provides a computationally efficient way to obtain managerial insights and near-optimal solutions, especially for large problem instances. We also develop a more traditional discrete location model in the form of a mixed-integer program, which builds directly upon a nonlinear partial differential equation description of customer traffic equilibrium. We develop a Lagrangian relaxation based solution approach with an embedded finite-element method subroutine, to separate and solve the location decisions as well as the traffic equilibrium. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate applicability of the proposed models and to compare performance of the two complementing modeling approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although, nowadays, the findings from research efforts and the development of new technologies enable accurate traffic forecasts in almost any conditions, these calculations are usually limited by the data and the equipment available. Most traffic management centres depend on the data provided, at best, by double-loop detectors. These loops supply time means over different aggregation periods, which are indiscriminately used as the bases for subsequent estimations. Since space mean speeds are those needed in most applications (note the fundamental relationship between flow and density in traffic flow theory), most current practice begins with an error. This paper introduces a simple algorithm that the allows estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops without the need for any additional financial outlay, as long as the traffic in each time interval of aggregation is stationary and its speed distribution is log-normal. Specifically, it is focused on the calculation of the variance of the speeds with regard to the time mean, thus making possible to use the relationship between time mean speeds and space mean speeds defined by Rakha (2005). The results obtained with real data show that the algorithm behaves well if the calculation conditions help fulfil the initial hypotheses. The primary difficulties arise with transient traffic and, in this case, other specific methodologies should be used. Data fusion seems promising in this regard. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the improvement provided by the algorithm turns out to be highly beneficial both when used alone in the case of stationarity or as a part of a fusion.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study selected patients who had SEGA surgery and TSC claims between 2000-2011 from three large US nationwide claims databases. Selected patients were age 35 or less and had continuous health insurance in the year before and the year after their first SEGA surgery claim. The study examined the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and estimated inpatient, outpatient, medication, and total medical costs paid by insurance companies for the pre-surgery year, post-surgery year, and other study periods, respectively. Repeated measures analysis and bootstrapping technique were used to assess the impact of the surgery on the direct medical costs. Results: Select patients (n = 47) had a mean baseline age of 11.6 years and 66% were male. Many had seizures (91.0%), hydrocephalus (59.6%), vision disorders (38.3%), stroke and hemiparesis (36.2%), and shunt (34.0%) in the pre-surgery year. The mean direct medical costs were $8543 (inpatient: $3770; outpatient: $3473; medication: $1300) for the pre-surgery year, and $85,397 (inpatient: $71,562; outpatient: $11,497; medication: $2338) for the post-surgery year. With the exclusion of the costs during the surgery month, the inpatient, outpatient, medication, and total costs in the post-surgery year were 1.6-4.3 times as much as the costs in the pre-surgery year (inpatient: 4.3:1; outpatient: 2.5:1; medication: 1.6:1; total: 3.1:1, p<0.05). Repeated measures analysis with bootstrapping confirmed a link between the surgery and increases in direct medical costs (p<0.05). Conclusions: SEGA surgery had a substantial impact on direct medical costs. TSC patients with the surgery experienced significant post-surgery increases in their inpatient, outpatient, and medication costs. Additional research should be conducted to examine the surgery's cost-impact in a longer duration, or to compare the cost-effectiveness of the surgery vs other treatments.","[Sun, Peter] Kailo Res Grp, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Liu, Zhimei] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Krueger, Darcy] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Kohrman, Michael] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Novartis; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University of Chicago,"Sun, P (通讯作者)，Kailo Res Grp, 8247 Jo Ellen Dr, Fishers, IN 46038 USA.",psun001@yahoo.com,,"Krueger, Darcy/0000-0002-7250-7391",Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation,The funding of this project was provided by Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation.,,0,5,6,0,1,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

There are many complex decisions that go into the care of these patients, and practice variation is expected to be compounded in a health system. This study sought to characterize the medical economic impact of tracheotomy patients on the hospital system. Methods: A retrospective review of the health system's hospital billing software was performed for 2013, and pertinent outcomes measures were tabulated. Results: There were 829 tracheotomies performed in the health system of seven hospitals, with total costs of $128,883,865. Average length of stay was 36.74 days for principal procedures, and 43.36 days for tracheotomy as secondary procedures. Mortality was similar to 18% overall, and re-admissions were 10.93% for primary, and 14.36% for secondary procedures. A fairly wide variation in each category among the different hospitals was observed. Conclusions: There are potentially many factors that impact variations of care and outcomes in patients with tracheotomy. Due to their large economic impact and risks for morbidity and mortality, a formalized care pathway is warranted. Goals of the pathway should include understanding medical decisions surrounding these complex patients, monitoring pertinent outcomes, reducing practice variation, and improving the efficiency of compassionate care.","[Altman, Kenneth W.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Otolaryngol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Banoff, Karen Merl] Mt Sinai Med Ctr, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Tong, Charles C.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) accounts for the majority of PKD cases and is the predominant monogenic cause of ESRD. Limited information on patient characteristics and healthcare resource utilization is available in this population. This study assessed hospital-based inpatient utilization of patients with ADPKD in the US to help further understand the disease, which may lead to treatments that delay progression and reduce healthcare resource utilization. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using MedAssets Health System Data to investigate inpatient resource utilization for a total of 1876 patients hospitalized with ADPKD or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient characteristics and inpatient resource utilization were compared between hospitalized patients with ADPKD and CKD, including demographic and clinical characteristics, overall health, rates of complications and surgical interventions, and average length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Results: Compared with patients with CKD, patients with ADPKD were more likely to have commercial insurance as their primary payer (36.1 vs 17.8%) and were significantly younger (mean age 57.9 vs 69.5 years) and generally healthier (Charlson Comorbidity Score of 2.0 vs 3.3). Patients with ADPKD also had a substantially shorter average length of hospital stay (6.3 vs 10.3 days). However, patients with ADPKD experienced more kidney-related complications and a higher surgical procedure rate (mainly for transplant and complete nephrectomy). Conclusions: Although patients with ADPKD were generally healthier than patients with CKD, specific kidney function complications were more frequent. Patients with ADPKD had a higher rate of major kidney procedures, which may contribute to the high burden of ADPKD-related hospital-based inpatient resource utilization.","[Blanchette, Christopher M.] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Craver, Christopher; Belk, Kathy W.] MedAssets Inc, Alpharetta, GA USA; [Lubeck, Deborah P.] Outcomes Insights, Westlake Village, CA USA; [Rossetti, Sandro] Otsuka Amer Pharmaceut Inc, Princeton, NJ USA; [Gutierrez, Benjamin] GlaxoSmithKline, King Of Prussia, PA USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Otsuka Pharmaceutical; Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline","Blanchette, CM (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, Res & Publ Engagement, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",cblanche@uncc.edu,,"Belk, Kathy/0009-0001-0964-9549",,,,,0,11,11,0,0,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of starting basal insulin treatment with insulin detemir in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs) in Mexico, South Korea, India, Indonesia, and Algeria. Methods: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and cost outcomes over a 30-year time horizon. Clinical outcomes, baseline characteristics and health state utility data were taken from the A(1)chieve study. A 1-year analysis was also conducted based on treatment costs and quality-of-life data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as a fraction of GDP per capita, and WHO-CHOICE recommendations (ICER<3.0) used to define cost-effectiveness. Results: Starting insulin detemir was associated with a projected increase in life expectancy (>= 1 year) and was considered cost-effective in all of the studied populations with ICERs of -0.02 (Mexico), 0.00 (South Korea), 0.48 (India), 0.12 (Indonesia), and 0.88 (Algeria) GDP/quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness was maintained after conducting sensitivity analyses in the 30-year and 1-year analyses. A projected increase in treatment costs was partially offset by a reduction in complications. The difference in overall costs between insulin detemir and OGLDs alone was USD518, 1431, 3510, 15, and 5219, respectively. Conclusion: Changes in clinical outcomes associated with starting insulin detemir in insulin-naive individuals with T2D resulted in health gains that made the intervention cost-effective in five countries with distinct healthcare resources.","[Home, Philip] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Baik, Sei Hyun] Korea Univ, Guro Hosp, Div Endocrinol, Seoul, South Korea; [Gonzalez Galvez, Guillermo] Inst Jalisciense Invest Diabet & Obesidad, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; [Malek, Rachid] Univ Hosp Setif, Dept Internal Med, Setif, Algeria; [Nikolajsen, Annie] Novo Nordisk AS, Market Access Value Commun, Soborg, Denmark",Newcastle University - UK; Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Novo Nordisk,"Home, P (通讯作者)，Sch Med, ICM Diabet, Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",philip.home@newcastle.ac.uk,"Gonzalez-Galvez, Guillermo/JPX-1277-2023","Gonzalez-Galvez, Guillermo/0000-0001-9611-2055; Nikolajsen, Annie/0000-0001-8674-6134",Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),This research was supported by Novo Nordisk.,,0,12,13,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In order to assess the environmental impact of road and rail transports, researchers have formulated very detailed microscopic models, which determine vehicle emissions precisely based on a vast number of parameters. They also developed macroscopic models, which estimate emissions more roughly from few parameters that are considered most influential. One of the goals of this paper is to develop mesoscopic models that combine the preciseness of micro-models while requiring only little more information than macro-models. We propose emission models designed for transport planning purposes which are simple to calibrate by transport managers. Despite their compactness, our models are able to reflect the influence of various traffic conditions on a transport's total emissions. Furthermore, contrasting most papers considering either the road or the rail mode, we provide models on a common basis for both modes of transportation. We validate our models using popular micro- and macroscopic models and we apply them to artificial and real world transport scenarios to identify under which circumstances intermodal transports actually effect lower emissions. We find that travel speed and country-specific energy emission factors influence the eco-friendliness of intermodal transports most severely. Hence, the particular route chosen for a transnational intermodal transport is an important but so far neglected option for eco-friendly transportation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The carrier may quote different prices or a single price to the two shipping forwarders who will then order shipping capacity from the carrier and set the selling prices to the shippers before market uncertainties are revealed. Inspired by cooperation between competing parties in many industries including the maritime shipping industry, we propose a new model under which the shipping forwarders are allowed an opportunity to purchase shipping capacity from each other after they order capacity from the carrier but before they set the selling prices and satisfy demand, referred to as the capacity reservation model. We show analytically that capacity reservation between competing forwarders benefits both the carrier and the forwarders, leading to a win-win situation, under various market conditions.

Our modeling results suggest that light-handed regulation is a promising method which may lead to higher welfare than price-cap regulation. However, neither regulation strictly dominates the other in terms of welfare, airport charge or service quality. The relative performance of alternative regulations depends on many market factors and the specification of penalty under light-handed regulation. Our analytical results also suggest that if service quality matters and if an airport is allowed to invest in a higher quality, average cost pricing may not be optimal due to possible sub-optimal choices of quality, and the overall performance of alternative regulatory regimes should be assessed with a comprehensive welfare analysis. Our investigation confirms that light-handed regulation is worth preserving subject to monitoring and continuous improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem involves determining the optimal freight rates, the number of containers to transport and how to transport the containers in a liner shipping network to maximize the total profit. We first consider a tactical-level P-CA with known demand functions that are estimated based on historical data and formulate it as a nonlinear optimization model. The tactical-level P-CA can be used for evaluating and improving the container liner shipping network. We then address the operational-level P-CA with unknown demand functions, which aims to design a mechanism that adjusts the freight rates to maximize the profit. A theoretically convergent trial-and-error approach, and a practical trial-and-error approach, are developed. A numerical example is reported to illustrate the application of the models and approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: The approach is illustrated using data from a sub-group of patients enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial of olaparib maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation (NCT00753545). A semi-Markov model was developed with four health states: progression-free survival (PFS), first subsequent treatment (FST), second subsequent treatment (SST), and death. Transition probabilities were estimated by fitting survival curves to trial data for time from randomization to FST, time from FST to SST, and time from SST to death. Results: Survival projections generated by the model are broadly consistent with the outcomes observed in the clinical trial. However, limitations of the trial data (small sample size, immaturity of the PFS and overall survival [OS] end-points, and treatment switching) create uncertainty in estimates of survival. Conclusion: The model framework offers a promising approach to evaluating cost-effectiveness of a maintenance therapy for patients with cancer, which may be generalizable to other chronic diseases.","[Hettle, Robert; Posnett, John] HERON Commercializat, PAREXEL Consulting, London NW1 2DX, England; [Borrill, John] AstraZeneca Res & Dev, Alderley Pk, Cheshire, England",AstraZeneca,"Posnett, J (通讯作者)，HERON Commercializat, Evergreen Bldg North 160 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DX, England.",john.posnett@parexel.com,,,,,,,20,10,10,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Employed patients, 18-64 years old, with >= 2 MS diagnoses and >= 1 DMT claim during January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2012 were identified from a large commercially-insured US claims database. Adherence was measured as proportion of days covered (PDC) during follow-up. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of adherence on HRU related to urgent care (i.e., inpatient or emergency room visit), days of work loss, direct medical cost, and indirect work loss costs. Model coefficients were used to evaluate the impact of a 10 percentage point increase in adherence on the outcomes. Results: A total of 1510 patients were included (mean age = 43.4 years, 64% female). Patients with higher adherence had lower HRU, fewer days of work loss, and lower direct and indirect costs. A 10 percentage point increase in adherence significantly decreased the likelihood of an inpatient or emergency room visit by 9-19%, days of work loss by 3-8%, and direct and indirect costs by 3-5%, depending on the follow-up period (all p<0.01).

Regenerators are devices to extend the optical reach. The regenerator placement problem seeks to place the minimum number of regenerators in an optical network so as to facilitate the communication of a signal between any node pair. In this study, the Regenerator Location Problem is revisited from the hub location perspective directing our focus to applications arising in transportation settings. Two new dimensions involving the challenges of survivability are introduced to the problem. Under partial survivability, our designs hedge against failures in the regeneration equipment only, whereas under full survivability failures on any of the network nodes are accounted for by the utilization of extra regeneration equipment. All three variations of the problem are studied in a unifying framework involving the introduction of individual flow-based compact formulations as well as cut formulations and the implementation of branch and cut algorithms based on the cut formulations. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution methodologies and to gain insights from realistic instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to estimate the societal costs of hemodialysis in Lebanon. Methods: This was a quantitative, cross-sectional cost-of-illness study conducted alongside the Nutrition Education for Management of Osteodystrophy trial. Costs were assessed with a prevalence-based, bottom-up approach, for the period of June-December 2011. The data of 114 patients recruited from six hospital-based units were collected through a questionnaire measuring healthcare costs, costs to patients and family, and costs in other sectors. Recall data were used for the base-case analysis. Sensitivity analyses employing various sources of resources use and costs were performed. Costs were uprated to 2015US$. Multiple linear regression was conducted to explore the predictors of societal costs. Results: The mean 6-month societal costs were estimated at $9,258.39. The larger part was attributable to healthcare costs (91.7%), while costs to patient and family and costs in other sectors poorly contributed to the total costs (4.2% and 4.1%, respectively). In general, results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Using the maximum value for hospitalization resulted in the biggest difference (+15.5% of the base-case result). Female gender, being widowed/divorced, having hypertension comorbidity, and higher weekly time on dialysis were significantly associated with greater societal costs. Limitations: Information regarding resource consumption and cost were not readily available. Rather, they were obtained from a variety of sources, with each having its own strengths and limitations. Conclusion: Hemodialysis represents a high societal burden in Lebanon. Using extrapolation, its total annual cost for the Lebanese society is estimated at $61,105,374 and the mean total annual cost ($18,516.7) is 43.70% higher than the gross domestic product per capita forecast for 2015.

In this paper, we study the optimization of first train timetables for an urban railway network that focuses on designing convenient and smooth timetables for morning passengers. We propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for minimizing train arrival time differences and the number of missed trains, i.e., the number of trains without transfers within a reasonable time at interchange stations as an alternative to minimize passenger transfer waiting times. This is interesting from the operator's point of view, and we show that both criteria are equivalent. Starting from an intuitive model for the first train transfer problem, we then linearize the non-linear constraints by utilizing problem specific knowledge. In addition, a local search algorithm is developed to solve the timetabling problem. Through computational experiments involving the Beijing subway system, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of the exact model and the heuristic approach. Finally, three practical suggestions are proposed for the operation and management of the urban railway transit system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The attacks are executed using a predictive, coordinated ramp metering controller based on finite-horizon optimal control and multi-objective optimization techniques. The efficacy of the control schemes in carrying out the prescribed attacks is determined via simulations of traffic network models based on the cell transmission model with onramps modeled as queue buffers. Freeway attacks with high-level objectives are presented on two illustrative examples: congestion on-demand, which aims to create precise, user-specified pockets of congestion, and catch me-if-you-can, which attempts to aid a fleeing vehicle from pursuant vehicles.

Explored here is the effect of this management decision on car traffic. Since queuing theory suggests that for a given pedestrian flux the closer the cross walk spacing the lower the effect of pedestrians on cars, scenarios where pedestrians can cross anywhere should be best for both cars and pedestrians. This is the kind of pedestrianization studied. Analytic formulas are proposed for a pedestrianized street's capacity, free-flow speed and macroscopic fundamental diagram. Of these, only the free-flow speed formula is exact. The analytic form of the capacity formula is inspired by analytic upper and lower bounds derived with variational theory for a version of the problem where cars are treated as a fluid. The formula is then calibrated against microscopic simulations with discrete cars. The MFD for the fluid version of the problem is shown to be concave and have a certain symmetry. These two geometrical properties, together with the formulae for capacity and free-flow speed, yield a simple approximation for the MFD. Both the capacity and MFD formulae match simulations with discrete cars well for all values of the pedestrian flux - errors for the capacity are well under 0.2% of the capacity before pedestrianization. Qualitatively, the formulas predict that the street's capacity is inversely proportional to the square root of the pedestrian flux for low pedestrian fluxes, and that pedestrians increase the cars' free-flow pace by an amount that is proportional to the pedestrian flux.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of adults with RA newly initiating TNFi in the Truven Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental Databases during 2010-2013. A sub-group of patients who switched to a bDMARD within 12 months post-index and within 180 days of last index TNFi were subsequently evaluated over 12 months. TNFi/bDMARD treatment patterns were characterized as: continuers, no gap >180 days in prescription/administration of index TNFi; discontinuers, gap >180 days; switchers, initiated new bDMARD. Concomitant conventional synthetic DMARD use, co-morbid chronic illnesses, and RA severity were assessed. All-cause/RA-related HCRU and costs were evaluated 12 months post-index. Results: Of 9567 identified patients, 67.2%, 17.3%, and 15.4% were continuers, discontinuers, and switchers, respectively. Switchers had the highest 12-month unadjusted mean all-cause costs of $34,585 vs $33,051 for continuers (p=0.1158) and $24,915 for discontinuers (p<0.0001; discontinuers vs continuers, p<0.0001). RA-related costs comprised 82.8%, 31.4%, and 85.7% of total costs for continuers, discontinuers, and switchers, respectively. Of 764 switchers, 68.2% switched to alternative TNFi (cyclers), the rest to non-TNFi bDMARDs; 36.7% of patients who switched to TNFi switched again (to third-line bDMARD) vs 27.6% (p=0.0313) of those who switched to non-TNFi bDMARDs. Switchers to non-TNFi bDMARDs had higher mean 12-month all-cause costs of $76,580 compared with $50,689 for switchers to alternative TNFi (p<0.0001); biologic-administration visits comprised 78.8% of the greater total RA-related costs of switchers to non-TNFi bDMARDs. Conclusions: Real-world TNFi discontinuation/switching rates correspond to randomized controlled trial non-response rates. TNFi cycling is common and associated with an increased likelihood of switching to third-line bDMARD. Switching to non-TNFi bDMARDs was associated with higher costs, mostly attributed to in-office administrations.","[Harnett, J.; Wiederkehr, D.] Pfizer Inc, 235 East 42nd St, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Gerber, R.; Gruben, D.] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Koenig, A.; Bourret, J.] Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, PA USA",Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Harnett, J (通讯作者)，Pfizer Inc, 235 East 42nd St, New York, NY 10017 USA.",james.harnett@pfizer.com,,,Pfizer Inc.,Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer),This study was funded by Pfizer Inc.,,58,31,31,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The Energy Strategy 2020 of the European Commission calls for increased use of renewable resources in the energy system, thus pushing the technology of wood biomass system for space heating of the greenhouses, since this resource is considered as 'greenhouse gas' (GHG) neutral when converted to heat, excluding the GHG generation during harvesting, transportation, and pre-processing of raw materials. Taking into account the different climatic areas in the Italian peninsula, power energy load was estimated to be between 30 Wm(-2) (in southern regions) and more than 175 Wm(-2) (in northern regions), while the energy consumption was estimated in the range from 21 to 546 kWh(th)m(-2)year(-1) according to different internal air temperatures. Moreover, the CO2 enrichment in greenhouses from the exhaust gas of a biomass heating system can bring benefits for greenhouse plant production, along with optimal management strategies to reduce fuel consumption. Unfortunately, CO2 enrichment from the exhaust gas of biomass boilers is still challenging and expensive, considering that wood biomass boilers generate a higher volume of particulate matters (PM) and ash emissions than other fossil fuels. However, wet scrubbers and other recent flue gas conditioning devices could help to reduce costs and make this process more feasible. Thus, a techno-economic assessment is highly recommended to ascertain the economic feasibility of wood biomass boilers for the greenhouse industry. Finally, some economic considerations are provided to make cost-effective use of the solid biomass in relation to the economic incentives by the National Decree of 28 December 2012, so-called White Certifies.

Besides, according to the global population dynamic, projected to increase by 2050 up to 9 billion people along with a 70% increase in food production, the resource competition is turning out to become a fundamental issue. To this extent the inter-linkages analysis within the nexus and the role-played by institutions and policies to handle effectively this resources competition is a challenging food for thought. In addition currently discussion on SDGs is taking in consideration all the three dimensions and wellbeing of people. To this purpose the aim of this work is to deal with the nexus through the lens of the Italian BES (Benessere Equo e Sostenibile) modeling framework. In particular focusing on food, considered as the primary need more strictly related to the wellbeing achievement, all the linkages available with water and energy would be investigated.

Based on the travel time prediction, road users can make their optimal decision in choosing route and departure time. In order to utilise adequately the advanced data collection methods that provide real-time different types of information, this paper is aimed at a novel approach to the estimation of long roadway travel times, using Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) technology. Since the long roads contain a large number of scanners, the AVI sample size tends to reduce and, as such, computing the distribution for the total road travel time becomes difficult. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic framework that extends the deterministic travel time progression method to dependent random variables and enables the off-line estimation of road travel time distributions. In the proposed method, the accuracy of the estimation does not depend on the size of the sample over the entire corridor, but only on the amount of historical data that is available for each link. In practice, the system is also robust to small link samples and can be used to detect outliers within the AVI data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model development is based on an observation that the issues of absolute and relative cost differences are analogous to the negative exponential and power impedance functions of the trip distribution gravity model. Some theoretical properties of the hybrid model are also examined, such as the probability relationship among the three models, independence from irrelevant alternatives, and direct and indirect elasticities. To consider the congestion effect, we provide a unified modeling framework to formulate the Logit, Weibit and hybrid SUE models with the same entropy maximization objective but with different total cost constraint specifications representing the modelers' knowledge of the system. With this, there are two ways to interpret the dual variable associated with the cost constraint: shadow price representing the marginal change in the entropy level to a marginal change in the total cost, and dispersion/shape parameter representing the travelers' perceptions of travel costs. To further consider the route overlapping effect, a path-size factor is incorporated into the hybrid SUE model. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the capability of the hybrid model in handling both absolute and relative cost differences as well as the route overlapping problem in travelers' route choice decisions.

The model discussed in this paper, referred as Freight Tour Synthesis (FTS), enhances current techniques by incorporating the time-dependent tour-based behavior of freight vehicles, and the decision maker's (e.g., metropolitan planning agency planner) preferences for different sources of information. The model, based on entropy maximization theory, estimates the most likely set of tour flows, given a set of freight trip generation estimates, a set of traffic counts per time interval, and total freight transportation cost in the network. The type of inputs used allows the assessment of changes in infrastructure, policy and land use. The ability of the model to replicate actual values is assessed using the Denver Region (CO) as a case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem consists in scheduling the deliveries over a multiple-day planning horizon during which requests for transportation arrive dynamically. In addition, the routing of the auto-carriers must take into account constraints related to the loading of the vehicles on the carriers. The objective is to minimize the sum of traveled distances, fixed costs for auto-carrier operation, service costs, and penalties for late deliveries. The problem is solved by a heuristic that first selects the vehicles to be delivered in the next few days and then optimizes the deliveries by an iterated local search procedure. A branch-and-bound search is used to check the feasibility of the loading. To handle the dynamic nature of the problem, the complete algorithm is applied repeatedly in a rolling horizon framework. Computational results on data from a major European logistics service provider show that the heuristic is fast and yields significant improvements compared to the sequential solution of independent daily problems.

This paper examines the effectiveness of popular recovery strategies used to address unpredictable disasters that derail supply chains. We create a formal model to portray dynamic operational performance among supply chain firms facing disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters. Our analysis shows that a supply chain recovers best if member firms adopt a radical, rapid, costly recovery strategy that immediately resolves the disruption. This observation is robust to various resource consumption requirements. We apply our methodology in the case of Taiwan's 2011 food contamination scandal and provide managerial insights.

Existing single-regime models calibrated by the least square method (LSM) could not fit the empirical data consistently well both in light-traffic/free-flow conditions and congested/jam conditions. In this paper, first, we point out that the inaccuracy of single-regime models is not caused solely by their functional forms, but also by the sample selection bias. Second, we apply a weighted least square method (WLSM) that addresses the sample selection bias problem. The calibration results for six well-known single-regime models using the WLSM fit the empirical data reasonably well both in light-traffic/free-flow conditions and congested/jam conditions. Third, we conduct a theoretical investigation that reveals the deficiency associated with the LSM is because the expected value of speed (or a function of it) is nonlinear with regard to the density (or a function of it).

In diabetes, for example, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia may be excluded from trials conducted for regulatory purposes. Using insulin degludec (IDeg), a new basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action as an example, an interim analysis is presented describing whether the decision to prescribe IDeg to patients experiencing treatment-limiting problems on their existing insulin regimes represented good clinical and economic value. Methods: Records from the first 51 consecutive patients with diabetes (35 type 1 [T1D] and 16 type 2 [T2D]) switching to insulin degludec from either insulin glargine (IGlar) or insulin detemir (IDet), mostly due to problems with hypoglycemia (39/51, 76.5%), were reviewed at up to 37 weeks. Patients indicated frequency of hypoglycemia and completed a disease-specific questionnaire reporting six measures of confidence and treatment satisfaction. For the largest group of exposed patents, the T1D module of the IMS Core Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment decision. Findings: HbA(1c) decreased by 0.5 +/- 0.3% points and 0.7 +/- 0.3% points for T1D and T2D, respectively. Hypoglycemic events decreased by 490%. Combined mean scores were >= 3.7 (1 = much worse, 3 = no change, 5 = much improved) for all six satisfaction and confidence items. In T1D, the treatment decision was highly cost-effective in the CDM lifetime analysis. Even when excluding benefits beyond hypoglycemia reduction, predicted cost per quality-adjusted life-year for IDeg vs IGlar/IDet was 10,754 pound. Interpretation: These data illustrate the complementary nature of clinical trial and practice data when evaluating the value of therapeutic innovations in diabetes care. There were reductions in patient-reported hypoglycemia, reduced HbA1c, and improved treatment satisfaction in relation to the decision to prescribe IDeg. Initial health economic evaluation suggested that the decision to prescribe IDeg in this phenotypic group of T1D patients represented good value for money.","[Evans, Marc] Llandough Hosp, Diabet Resource Ctr, Cardiff CF64 2XX, S Glam, Wales; [McEwan, Phil] Univ Swansea, Swansea Ctr Hlth Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Foos, Volker] IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Basel, Switzerland",Swansea University,"Evans, M (通讯作者)，Llandough Hosp, Diabet Resource Ctr, Cardiff CF64 2XX, S Glam, Wales.",marcevans4@sky.com,,,Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),"Editorial support for this manuscript was provided by Gary Patronek, PhD, and Gabrielle Parker of Watermeadow Medical and sponsored by Novo Nordisk.

Given a set of cargoes to be transported and a set of ports with different bunker prices, the proposed problem determines how to route ships to carry the cargoes and the amount of bunker to purchase at each port, in order to maximize the total profit. After building an integer linear programming model for the JSRB problem, we propose a tailored branch-and-price (B&P) solution approach. The B&P approach incorporates an efficient method for obtaining the optimal bunkering policy and a novel dominance rule for detecting inefficient routing options. The B&P approach is tested with randomly generated large-scale instances derived from real-world planning problems. All of the instances can be solved efficiently. Moreover, the proposed approach for the JSRB problem outperforms the conventional sequential planning approach and can incorporate the prediction of future cargo demand to avoid making myopic decisions.

However, the need to consider correlation between observations creates a challenge. In spatial econometrics, a spatial lag term with a pre-defined weight matrix is often used to capture such a correlation. In most previous studies, the weight matrix is assumed to be exogenous. However, this assumption is invalid in many cases, leading to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. Although some attempts have been made to address the endogenous weight matrix issue, none has focused on discrete choice modeling. This paper fills an existing gap by developing a Spatial Autoregressive Binary Probit Model with Endogenous Weight Matrix (SARBP-EWM). The SARBP-EWM model explicitly considers the endogeneity by using two equations whose error terms are correlated. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to estimate the model. Model validation with simulated data shows that the model parameters can converge to their true values and the endogenous weight matrix can be reliably recovered. The model is then applied to a simplified firm relocation choice problem, assuming that similar size firms influence one another. The model quantifies the peer effect, and takes into consideration other independent variables including industry type and population density. The estimation results suggest that peer influence among firms indeed affect their relocation choices. The application results offer important insights into business location choice and can inform future policy making. The sample size for applying the model is currently limited to hundreds of observations. This paper contributes to the existing literature on discrete choice modeling and spatial econometrics. It provides a new tool to discover spatial correlations that are hidden in a wide range of transportation issues, such as land development, location choice, and various travel behavior. Those hidden spatial correlations are otherwise difficult to identify and estimation results may be biased. Establishing a new model that explicitly considers endogenous weight matrix and applying the model to a real life transportation issue represent a significant contribution to the body of literature.

Environmental concerns are likely to add an additional consideration for the state DOTs when allocating their financial resources. Transportation agencies will be concerned with determining maintenance, resurfacing and reconstruction policies for pavement segments in their systems while also addressing the environmental impact of these activities. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to solve for pavement resurfacing and reconstruction policies that minimize societal (agency and user) costs under a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions constraint. The main methodological contribution of this work relative to the state of the art is that we formulate the problem to include multi-dimensional pavement segment states and heterogeneous management activities. It allows for a more realistic representation of the majority of current pavements in the world. For example, the assumption that pavements are perpetual, i.e., do not need reconstruction during their lifetime, can be relaxed. A case study using California roads is performed; we find that, for that specific group of pavement segments, the optimal policies to minimize societal costs do not vary greatly from the policies that minimize GHG emissions. An agency can use these results to determine what GHG emission budgets are feasible for the highway system that it manages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this model was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of high-purity prescription eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) omega-3 fatty acid intervention in secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in statin-treated patient populations extrapolated to the US.Methods: The deterministic model utilized inputs for cardiovascular events, costs, and utilities from published sources. Expert opinion was used when assumptions were required. The model takes the perspective of a US commercial, third-party payer with costs presented in 2014US dollars. The model extends to 5 years and applies a 3% discount rate to costs and benefits. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the influence of various input parameters on costs and outcomes.Results: Using base case parameters, EPA-plus-statin therapy compared with statin monotherapy resulted in cost savings (total 5-year costs $29,393 vs $30,587 per person, respectively) and improved utilities (average 3.627 vs 3.575, respectively). The results were not sensitive to multiple variations in model inputs and consistently identified EPA-plus-statin therapy to be the economically dominant strategy, with both lower costs and better patient utilities over the modeled 5-year period.Limitations: The model is only an approximation of reality and does not capture all complexities of a real-world scenario without further inputs from ongoing trials. The model may under-estimate the cost-effectiveness of EPA-plus-statin therapy because it allows only a single event per patient.Conclusion: This novel model suggests that combining EPA with statin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the US may be a cost-saving and more compelling intervention than statin monotherapy.","[Philip, Sephy; Chowdhury, Sumita; Everett, P.

To reduce stroke incidence, guidelines recommend using anticoagulants in moderate-to-high risk non-valvular AF (NVAF) patients; however, many patients receive no treatment, aspirin only, or remain poorly-controlled on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) due to high VKA discontinuation rates and non-adherence to guidelines. A prevalence-based Markov model was developed to estimate the clinical and budgetary impact of treating these patients with Xarelto (TM) (rivaroxaban, Bayer AG) in Japan. Methods: Population, baseline risk of events, and associated management costs were estimated using data from Japanese publications where available. Treatment efficacy and safety were derived from published data and the J-ROCKET AF trial. Drug and physician visit costs were based on data from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, the J-ROCKET AF trial, and Japanese clinical guidelines. Results: This model demonstrates that increased use of rivaroxaban in inadequately-managed NVAF patients could avoid 456 081 non-fatal ischemic strokes (IS) and 76 975 cardiovascular deaths over 10 years in Japan. This clinical benefit offsets the increased incidence of myocardial infarctions and anticoagulant-related bleeding. Decreased event costs could lead to a (sic)188.4 billion decrease in net spending over the analysis time horizon. Conclusions: Introducing rivaroxaban may decrease the burden of NVAF in Japanese society. From a clinical perspective, the reduction in IS and embolic events outweighs the increased risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding; from an economic perspective, reduced event costs offset drug and physician visit costs, resulting in cost savings.","[Hori, Masatsugu] Osaka Med Ctr Canc & Cardiovasc Dis, Osaka, Japan; [Ikeda, Shunya] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Otawara, Japan; [Okumura, Ken] Hirosaki Univ, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan; [Matsuda, Shinya] Univ Occupat & Environm Hlth, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Koretsune, Yukihiro] Osaka Natl Hosp, Osaka, Japan; [Montouchet, Calypso; Ruff, Lewis] Covance Market Access, Clove Bldg,4 Maguire St, London SE1 2NQ, England; [Watanabe-Fujinuma, Emi; Rossi, Bruno] Bayer Yakuhin Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Evers, Thomas; Briere, Jean-Baptiste] Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany",Osaka Medical Center for Cancer & Cardiovascular Diseases; International University of Health & Welfare; Hirosaki University; University of Occupational & Environmental Health - Japan; Osaka National Hospital; Bayer AG; Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals,"Ruff, L (通讯作者)，Covance Market Access, Clove Bldg,4 Maguire St, London SE1 2NQ, England.",lewis.ruff@covance.com,,"Matsuda, Shinya/0000-0002-8472-8909; Briere, Jean-baptiste/0000-0002-3925-7677",Bayer Pharma AG,Bayer Pharma AG,This study was funded by Bayer Pharma AG.,,69,1,1,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, users do not always follow the UE behavior. In reality, there are likely quiet a few non-collaborative Cournot-Nash (CN) players coexisting with UE players in the common traffic network. Users in a CN player are completely collaborative to minimize their total travel cost and users subordinating to different players are perfectly competitive. Considering both UE and CN players in the congested network, it remains unclear that under what conditions the BP will occur. In this paper, the BP occurrence conditions under the UE-CN mixed equilibrium are firstly investigated using the classical Braess network with linear link cost function. Then, the BP conditions are studied to the ordinary grid network with nonlinear link cost function. It is shown that the BP occurrence in the conventional Braess network depends upon the link travel time function parameters and the demand level of users controlled by UE/CN players, and the BP occurs in the grid network only for certain demand combinations of users under one UE player and two CN players.

However, the extent to which these experiments can replicate real markets continues to be debated in the literature, with particular reference to the potential for biased estimates as a result of the hypothetical nature of such experiments. In this paper, a first in the transportation literature, we compare stated choice responses to revealed preference behavior and examine three methods proposed in the literature for calibrating choice experiments via reported choice certainty. In doing so we provide evidence that the incorrect calibration of responses can produce stated choice results that are more biased than doing nothing at all, however we show that by jointly estimating choice and choice certainty there is a significant reduction in hypothetical bias such that stated choice responses more directly replicate real behavior.

In practice, container lease pricing problem is different from the consumer product pricing in consideration of the fair value of container, limited customer types and monopolistic supply market. In view of the durability of container and the diversified lease time and quantity, the pricing is a challenging task for the leasing company. This paper examines the monopolist's nonlinear pricing problems in static and dynamic environments. In particular, the leasing company designs and commits a menu of price and hire quantity/time pairs to maximize the expected profit and in turn customers choose hire quantities/itime to maximize their surpluses according to their hire preferences. In a static environment, closed-form solutions are obtained for different groups of customers with multiple types subject to capacity constraint. In a dynamic environment, we address two customer types and derive closed-form solutions for the problem of customers with hire time preference. Further, we show that the effect of the capacity constraint increases with time of the planning horizon when customers have the same hire time preference; while in the case with different hire time preferences, the capacity constraint has opposite effects on the low and high type customers. Last, the case of customers with hire quantity preference is discussed. We focus on the lease with alternative given sets of hire time and use dynamic programming to derive the numerical optimal hire time sequence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Guidelines for the management of chronic pain support the use of controlled-release (CR) opioids to treat chronic pain. Although effective in managing chronic pain, oxycodone is associated with high rates of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). The cost-effectiveness of a combination of oxycodone for the management of pain and naloxone for the relief of OIC has not previously been evaluated for Canada. Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-utility of combination oxycodone/naloxone compared to oxycodone alone in four populations. Drug costs for managing pain and healthcare costs related to managing OIC were included in the analysis and the primary measure of effectiveness was quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from OIC rates observed in clinical trials. The analysis was conducted from a healthcare system perspective, used a 1-year time horizon, and results were expressed in 2015 Canadian dollars. Results: In all four patient populations, there was a trade-off between slightly higher total expected costs for Targin treated patients compared to oxycodone treated patients, but also improved clinical benefits in terms of reduced OIC, which resulted in higher QALYs for patients. Although analgesic costs were found to be slightly higher for Targin treated patients, Targin also resulted in cost offsets to the healthcare system in terms of less rescue laxative drug use and other resources required for the management of OIC. The resulting 1-year cost-utility of Targin compared to oxycodone ranged from $2178-$7732 per QALY gained in the base case analysis, and it was found that these cost-utility results remained robust and at low values throughout a series of one-way deterministic analyses of uncertainty. Conclusion: The clinical effectiveness of oxycodone/naloxone in managing pain and OIC compared to CR oxycodone alone resulted in low cost-utility estimates.","[Goeree, Ron; Goeree, Jeff] Goeree Consulting Ltd, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Goeree, R (通讯作者)，10 Sundown Dr, Hamilton, ON L9B 1W3, Canada.",goereer@sympatico.ca,,,Purdue Canada,Purdue Canada,"Purdue Canada provided funding support for the development of the model, analysis, and manuscript preparation.

The contracted network (a simplified network with a few nodes and links) approximates the behavior of the full network but with less complexity. The network contraction method can be advantageous in network design applications where many equilibrium problems must be solved for different design scenarios. The network contraction procedure can also be used to increase the accuracy of subnetwork analysis. This method requires calculating travel time derivatives between two nodes, with respect to the demand between them, assuming that the flow distributes in a way that equilibrium is maintained. Previous research describes two methods for calculating these derivatives. This paper presents a third method, which is simpler, faster, and just as accurate. The method presented in this paper reformulates the linear system of equations defining these sensitivities as the solution to a convex programming problem, which can be solved by making minor modifications to static user equilibrium algorithms. In addition, the model is extended to capture the interactions between the path travel times and network flows, and a heuristic is proposed to compute these interactions. The accuracy and complexity of the proposed methodology are evaluated using the network of Barcelona, Spain. Further, numerical experiments on the Austin, Texas regional network validate its performance for subnetwork analysis applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One key clinical factor limiting improved longer-term outcomes is antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR), the incidence of which appears to be higher in patients who are non-adherent to immunosuppressants. Recent data show that adherence can be improved by reducing pill burden. The aim of the present study was to model the incidence and economic consequences of graft loss and AbMR in patients taking once- vs twice-daily tacrolimus in the UK.Methods:A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to estimate the incidence of graft failure, AbMR and mortality in renal transplant recipients taking once- vs twice-daily tacrolimus. Underlying rates of graft failure and mortality were derived from UK-specific sources. Proportions of patients adherent to once- vs twice-daily tacrolimus were taken from a recent randomized clinical trial and relative risks of graft failure and AbMR were taken from a prospective, multi-center analysis of 315 patients. Cost data were taken from the British National Formulary and National Health Service reference costs and reported in 2014 pounds sterling.Results:Modeling results showed that improved adherence would be associated with reduced incidence of AbMR and graft failure in renal transplant recipients. Based on improvements in adherence resulting from switching from twice-daily to once-daily tacrolimus, the modeling analysis projected cost savings of GBP 4862 per patient over 5 years with Advagraf relative to Prograf, on absolute costs of GBP 40,974 and GBP 45,836, respectively.Conclusions:Using Advagraf in place of Prograf in renal transplant recipients was predicted to be associated with lower pharmacy, dialysis and AbMR treatment costs, with the reduction in AbMR and dialysis costs being driven by improved adherence to the Advagraf regimen and consequent reductions in graft failure and onset of AbMR.","[Muduma, G.; Odeyemi, I.] Astellas Pharma EMEA Ltd, Chertsey KT16 0RS, England; [Pollock, R.

To model such multiple discrete-continuous choices, most multiple discrete-continuous models in the literature use an additively-separable utility function, with the assumption that the marginal utility of one good is independent of the consumption of another good. In this paper, we develop model formulations for multiple discrete-continuous choices that accommodate rich substitution structures and complementarity effects in the consumption patterns, and demonstrate an application of the model to transportation-related expenditures using data drawn from the 2002 Consumer Expenditure (CEX) Survey.

In numerous transportation network studies, there has been an implicit conjecture that stationary states exist in a network when origin demands, route choice proportions, and destination supplies are constant. In this study, we first rigorously formulate the conjecture within the framework of a network kinematic wave theory with an invariant junction model. After defining stationary states, we derive a system of algebraic equations in 3-tuples of stationary link flow-rates, demands, and supplies. We then introduce a new definition of junction critical demand levels based on effective demands and supplies. With a map in critical demand levels, we show that its fixed points and, therefore, stationary states exist with the help of Brouwer's fixed point theorem. For two simple road networks, we show that the map is well-defined and can be used to solve stationary states with a brute-force method. Finally we summarize the study and present some future extensions and applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional solutions considered include new capital works to increase network capacity and expanding public transport offerings to make public transport more attractive. Dynamic ridesharing is a recent alternative in which people with similar travel plans are matched and travel together. Dynamic ridesharing requires no new network infrastructure and offers more convenience than public transport. The (long-term) success of ridesharing schemes, however, depends on their ability to attract a large number of users. We investigate the benefits, complexities, and costs of employing a small number of dedicated drivers to serve riders who would otherwise remain unmatched. An extensive computational study demonstrates the potential benefits of dedicated drivers and identifies environments in which dedicated drivers are most useful. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology consists of a metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) approach. The metamodel combines traffic and emissions information from high-resolution microscopic simulators with information from lower-resolution analytical macroscopic models. This paper formulates and uses an analytical and differentiable macroscopic approximation of the non-differentiable simulation-based microscopic emissions model. A differentiable macroscopic traffic model is also used. This paper shows that the analytical structural information provided by macroscopic analytical emissions models can contribute, despite their lower-resolution, to enhance the computational efficiency of algorithms that embed higher-resolution inefficient emissions models. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, i.e., it can identify points with improved performance within few simulation runs. More generally, the results of this paper highlight the added value of embedding analytical structural information within SO algorithms to address complex SO problems. A traffic signal control case study is carried out. The proposed metamodel identifies signal plans that improve travel time and various emissions metrics. We present the corresponding monetary savings that can be achieved. This optimization framework enables practitioners to use high-resolution microscopic traffic and emissions models to systematically design transportation schemes that account directly, in the design process, for environmental metrics. Hence, the use of such high-resolution models is no longer limited to the environmental evaluation of a small set of predetermined schemes. The tight computational budgets used in this paper show that such complex problems can be addressed in a computationally efficient manner.

Traditional queue discharge models are either microscopic or stochastic, and macroscopic traffic flow models for signalized intersections are based on overly simplistic assumptions. They are incapable of modeling traffic dynamics at signalized intersections as well as capturing realistic queue discharge features. In this study we propose a modified Cell Transmission Model (CTM) by substituting the traditional demand function, which is constant under over-saturated conditions, with a linearly decreasing function. The new demand function is defined through a combination of conventional macroscopic parameters, including critical density, free-flow speed, jam density, and an additional parameter, jam demand. Analytically we show that the new model reproduces observed features in the discharge flow-rate and headway. We further present a new definition of lost times at the macroscopic level based on the modified CTM. Calibration with observations in existing studies, as well as new observations, further suggest that the model can reasonably capture all traffic queue discharge features. We also discuss solutions to the new model under various Riemann problem scenarios and show that they produce realistic results while offering observable improvements in the modeling of traffic dynamics under certain scenarios.

However, many transportation network design models instead focus on maximizing individuals' mobility or the ease of movement within the network. By adapting a space time prism analysis framework, this paper aims to address a new urban network design problem to maximize the system-wide transportation accessibility between major activity locations, subject to a given highway construction budget. By constructing a time-dependent space time network, we formulate the problem as a linear integer programming model to maximize the number of accessible activity locations within travel time budget for road users. A Lagrangian relaxation solution framework effectively decomposes the original complex problem into classical subproblems such as knapsack and time-dependent least cost problems.

Typical school bus routes serve a single school, but mixed load school bus routes carry students for more than one school at the same time. A mixed load policy reduces the number of stops and distance to pick up and drop off children, but it can increase travel distance by visiting multiple schools. This paper provides a general strategic analysis using continuous approximation models to assess the conditions under which mixed loading is likely to be beneficial. We also present a case study for a semi-rural Missouri school district to illustrate the application of the models in practice. Results show that mixed load routing is more beneficial for larger districts, when a large percentage of bus stops are shared by students of different schools, and when schools are closer together.

It is anticipated that the shift from the auto mode to rail mode can greatly help alleviate traffic congestion in urban road networks. However, the right-of-way of many existing commuter rail systems is usually not ideally located. Since the locations of rail systems were typically chosen long ago to serve the needs of freight customers, the majority of current commuter rail passengers have to take a non-walkable connecting trip to reach their final destinations after departing the most conveniently located rail stations. To make rail a more viable commuting option and thus more competitive to the auto mode, a bus feeder or circulator system is proposed for transporting passengers from their departing rail stations to final work destinations in a seamless transfer manner. The key research question with operating such a bus circulator system is how to optimally determine a bus route and stopping sequence for each circulating tour by using the real-time demand information. In this paper, we name this joint routing and stopping optimization problem the circulator service network design problem, the objective of which is to minimize the total tour cost incurred to bus passengers and operators with respect to minimizing the walk time of each individual bus passenger. A bi-level nonlinear mixed integer programming model is constructed and a tabu search method with different local search strategies and neighborhood evaluation methods is then developed for tackling the circulator service network design problem.

The platoon is modeled as an interconnected multi-agent dynamical system subject to physical and safety constraints, and it uses the global information structure such that each vehicle shares information with all the other vehicles. A constrained optimization based control scheme is proposed to ensure an entire platoon's transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic dynamic performance. By exploiting the solution properties of the underlying optimization problem and using primal-dual formulation, this paper develops dual based distributed algorithms to compute optimal solutions with proven convergence. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the unconstrained linear closed-loop system is established. These stability analysis results provide a principle to select penalty weights in the underlying optimization problem to achieve the desired closed-loop performance for both the transient and the asymptotic dynamics. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The analysis was based on the recent 4B Study, which compared exenatide BID and lispro TID as add-on therapies in subjects with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled, despite titrated insulin glargine. The Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to simulate patient costs and health benefits beyond the 4B Study. The Swedish healthcare perspective was adopted for this analysis; costs are reported in (sic)EUR to aid interpretation. The main outcome measure was the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with exenatide BID compared to lispro TID. Results: Exenatide BID was associated with an incremental cost of (sic)1,270 and a QALY increase of +0.64 compared with lispro TID over 40 years. The cost per QALY gained with exenatide BID compared with lispro TID was (sic)1,971, which is within conventional limits of cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness results were generally robust to alternative assumptions and values for key model parameters. Limitations: Extrapolation of trial data over the longer term can be influenced by modeling and parameter uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness results were generally insensitive to alternative values of key model input parameters and across scenarios. Conclusions: The addition of exenatide BID rather than insulin lispro to basal insulin is associated with similar or better clinical outcomes. Illustrated from the Swedish healthcare perspective, analysis with the Cardiff Diabetes Model demonstrated that exenatide BID represents a cost-effective treatment alternative to lispro TID as add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients insufficiently controlled on basal insulin.","[Gordon, J.; McEwan, P.] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, 9 Oak Tree Court,Mulberry Dr, Cardiff CF23 8RS, S Glam, Wales; [Gordon, J.] Univ Adelaide, Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Gordon, J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [McEwan, P.] Swansea Univ, Swansea Ctr Hlth Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Sabale, U.] AstraZeneca Nord Balt, Sodertalje, Sweden; [Kartman, B.] AstraZeneca Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden; [Wolffenbuttel, B.

Incidence of AEs (per 100 person years) and average monthly AE-related healthcare costs (per-patient-per-month) during each line of therapy (first or later lines) were estimated. The association between AEs and total all-cause healthcare costs was estimated using multivariable regression.Results: A total of 729 metastatic breast cancer patients were analyzed. Hematological (202.3 per 100 person years) and constitutional AEs (289.6 per 100 person years) were the most common class of AEs reported. Unadjusted per-patient-per-month AE-related expenditure by class were highest for hematological AEs ($1524), followed by gastrointestinal ($839) and constitutional AEs ($795), with anemia ($942), nausea/vomiting ($699), and leukopenia/neutropenia ($550) having incurred the highest total AE-related costs. Adjusted total all-cause monthly costs increased with the number of AEs ($19,701 for >7 AEs, $16,264 for 4-6 AEs, and $13,731 for 1-3 AEs) compared to no AEs ($5908) (all p<0.01).Conclusions: Among metastatic breast cancer patients treated with systemic therapy in a Medicaid population, AEs were associated with significant increases in costs, which increased with the number of AEs experienced. Therapies associated with a lower incidence of AEs may reduce cost burden and improve patient outcomes.","[Irwin, Debra E.] Truven Hlth Analyt, Durham, NC USA; [Masaquel, Anthony; Barnett, Brian] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Johnston, Stephen] Truven Hlth Analyt, Bethesda, MD USA",Roche Holding; Genentech,"Irwin, DE (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 105 Emerywood Pl, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",debra.irwin@truvenhealth.com,,,Genentech Inc.,Genentech Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech),"This study was funded by Genentech Inc. and conducted by Truven Health Analytics, USA.",,21,11,11,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The cruising-for-parking is modeled through a dynamic aggregated traffic model for networks: the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Firstly, we formulate the commuting equilibrium in a congested downtown network where travelers have to cruise for curbside parking spaces. The cruising-for-parking would yield longer trip distance and smaller network outflow, and thus can induce severe congestion and lengthen the morning peak. We then develop a dynamic model of pricing for the network to reduce total social cost, which includes cruising time cost, moving time cost (moving or in-transit time, which is the duration during which vehicles move close to the destination but do not cruise for parking yet), and schedule delay cost. We show that under specific assumptions, at the system optimum, the downtown network should be operating at the maximum production of its MFD. However, the cruising effect is not fully eliminated. We also show that the time-dependent toll to support the system optimum has a different shape than the classical fine toll in Vickrey's bottleneck model. In the end, analytical results are illustrated and verified with numerical experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that the standard deviation of the velocity increases in a concave way along vehicles in the oscillations. Moreover, all datasets collapse into a single concave curve, which indicates a universal evolution law of oscillations. A comparison with traffic experiment shows that the empirical and the experimental results are highly compatible and can be fitted by a single concave curve, which demonstrates that qualitatively the growth pattern of oscillations is not affected by type of bottleneck and lane changing behavior. We have shown theoretically that small disturbance with an angular frequency a) increases in a convex way in the initial stage in the traditional models presuming a unique relationship between speed and density, which obviously deviates from our findings. Simulations show that stochastic models in which the traffic state dynamically spans a 2D region in the speed-spacing plane can qualitatively or even quantitatively reproduce the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations.

The attractiveness is regressed on the transportation facilities and geographical conditions. Seaport development is found to have a major positive impact, followed by inland waterway, highway, and airport development. These positive impacts decrease with the need for highway haulage and with the distance from Shanghai showing an inverse U-shape distribution. Rail appears to have a U-shape distribution, implying a low application of multimodal transportation. A geographical pattern for the impacts of different transportation modes is delineated.

Costs and patient utilities for liver disease stages were taken from published studies. Rates of disease progression were based on studies of untreated HCV infection and long-term follow-up of those achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) after drug treatment. Impact of OMB/PTV/r+DSVRBV and other drug regimens on progression was estimated through SVR rates from clinical trials. Analyses were performed for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Impact of alternative scenarios and input parameter uncertainty on the results were tested.Results: For genotype 1 treatment-naive HCV patients, for OMB/PTV/r+DSV +/- RBV, PegIFN+ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV), sofosbuvir+PegIFN/RBV, telaprevir+PegIFN/RBV, boceprevir+PegIFN/RBV, lifetime risk of decompensated liver disease was 5.6%, 18.9%, 7.4%, 11.7%, and 14.9%; hepatocellular carcinoma was 5.4%, 9.2%, 5.7%, 7.0%, and 7.4%; and death from liver disease was 8.7%, 22.2%, 10.4%, 14.8%, and 17.6%, respectively. Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of OMB/PTV/r+DSV +/- RBV for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients indicated that it dominated all other regimens except PegIFN/RBV. Compared with PegIFN/RBV, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 13,864 pound and 10,258 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, respectively. The results were similar for alternative scenarios and uncertainty analyses.Limitations: A mixed-treatment comparison for SVR rates for the different treatment regimens was not feasible, because many regimens did not have comparator arms; instead SVR rates were based on those from recent trials.Conclusions: OMB/PTV/r+DSV +/- RBV is a cost-effective oral treatment regimen for chronic genotype 1 HCV infection compared with standard treatment regimens and is estimated to reduce the lifetime risks of advanced liver disease.","[Johnson, Scott J.; Parise, Helene; Virabhak, Suchin] Medicus Econ Inc, Milton, MA USA; [Filipovic, Ivana] AbbVie UK, Maidenhead, Berks, England; [Samp, Jennifer C.; Misurski, Derek] AbbVie Global, Mettawa, IL USA",AbbVie; AbbVie,"Samp, JC (通讯作者)，AbbVie, 26525 North Riverwoods Blvd, Mettawa, IL 60045 USA.",jennifer.samp@abbvie.com,,,AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"The authors acknowledge the technical writing assistance of Josephine Mauskopf, an employee of RTI Health Solutions, in the preparation of this manuscript.

In order to understand its economic value, this study performed a cost evaluation of the EIE valve system used in a MIS rapid-deployment approach (MIS-RDAVR) vs MISAVR and CAVR, respectively, compared to standard prosthetic aortic valves.Methods: A simulation model was developed using TreeAge (and validated with MS Excel) to compare the inpatient utilization and complication costs for each treatment arm. Thirty-day clinical end-points for the MIS-RDAVR (mortality and complications) were taken from the TRANSFORM trial; and a best evidence review of the published literature was used for the MISAVR and CAVR approaches. Studies were pooled and parameter estimates were weighted by sample size in order to compare the TRANSFORM patients. Cost data (2016 USD) were taken from the Premier database. Incremental cost and cost-effectiveness was assessed and one-way/probabilistic sensitivity analyses performed to gauge the robustness of the results.Results: MIS-RDAVR costs $2,621 less than CAVR and had lower mortality rates, making it a superior (dominant) technology relative to CAVR. MIS-RDAVR costs $4,560 more than MISAVR, but was associated with an additional 0.20 life years-per-patient. This implies a cost-effectiveness ratio of $22,903 per-life-year-gained. Thus, MIS-RDAVR is cost-effective compared to MISAVR.Conclusions: The EIE valve system deployed in a MIS approach appears to be a cost-effective technology compared to MISAVR and CAVR. When compared to CAVR it may achieve cost savings as well. These results suggest that MIS-RDAVR confers superior economic value compared to both standard MISAVR and CAVR via lowered key complication rates (re-operation, renal complications, wound infection, TIA, endocarditis) and utilization (cross-clamp time, hospital ward days).","[Moore, Matthew] Edwards Lifesci Inc, Irvine, CA USA; [Barnhart, Glenn R.] Swedish Heart & Vasc Inst, Seattle, WA USA; [Chitwood, Walter Randolph, Jr.] East Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY USA; [Gunnarsson, Candace; Palli, Swetha R.] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Grossi, Eugene A.] NYU, Sch Med, New York, NY USA",Edwards Lifesciences; Swedish Medical Center; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; New York University,"Palli, SR (通讯作者)，1775 Lexington Ave,Suite 200, Cincinnati, OH 45212 USA.",spalli@ctifacts.com,,"GROSSI, eugene/0000-0002-2066-7035","Edwards Lifesciences, Inc.","Edwards Lifesciences, Inc.","This study was funded by Edwards Lifesciences, Inc.

A recent network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the relative efficacy of CNIs ciclosporin, prolonged-release (PR) tacrolimus, and immediate-release (IR) tacrolimus in adult liver transplant recipients based on randomized and large observational trials published since 2000. Based on the NMA findings, the present study evaluated the cost-utility of PR tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin or IR tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients in the UK.Methods: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of immunosuppressive regimens in liver transplant recipients, capturing costs associated with immunosuppression, retransplantation, acute rejection (AR), and cytomegalovirus infection. Mortality, graft loss, and AR odds ratios were derived from the NMA. Costs were taken from the British National Formulary and the NHS National Tariff and expressed in 2016 pounds sterling. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3.5% annually.Results: Over 25 years, PR tacrolimus resulted in increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) relative to IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin. Relative to ciclosporin, QALE increased by 1.17 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with PR tacrolimus while costs increased by GBP 4645, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3962 pound per QALY gained. Relative to IR tacrolimus, QALE increased by 0.78 QALYs and costs by 1474 pound, resulting in an ICER of 1889 pound per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed the analysis to be most sensitive to dosing assumptions.Conclusions: Based on a UK-specific analysis of the projected cost-utility of PR tacrolimus relative to IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin, PR tacrolimus was cost-effective, improving life expectancy and QALE relative to both IR tacrolimus and ciclosporin, yielding ICERs below 20 pound 000 per QALY gained. The main limitations of the study were data source heterogeneity and omitting the economic and clinical effects of treating aspects of recurrent liver disease.","[Muduma, Gorden; Odeyemi, Isaac] Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd, Chertsey, Surrey, England; [Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland",Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Muduma, G (通讯作者)，Astellas Pharma EMEA Ltd, 2000 Hillswood Dr, Chertsey KT16 0RS, Surrey, England.",gorden.muduma@astellas.com,,"Pollock, Richard/0000-0002-9873-7507",Astellas Pharma Europe Limited,Astellas Pharma Europe Limited(Astellas Pharmaceuticals),This study was supported by funding from Astellas Pharma Europe Limited.,,29,7,7,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This DNL solution algorithm, termed eLTM (event-based Link Transmission Model), is based on the seminal Lighthill-Witham-Richards (LWR) model, adopts a triangular fundamental diagram and includes a generalised first order node model formulation. Unlike virtually all DNL solution algorithms, eLTM does not rely on time discretisation, but instead adopts an event based approach. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility of yielding exact results. Furthermore, an approximate version of the same algorithm is introduced. The user can configure an a-priori threshold that dictates the approximation error (measurable a-posteriori). Using this approximation the computational effort required decreases significantly, making it especially suitable for large scale applications. The computational complexity is investigated and results are demonstrated via theoretical and real world case studies. Fixed periods of stationary demands are included adopting a matrix demand profile to mimic basic departure time demand fluctuations. Finally, the information loss of the approximate solution is assessed under different configurations. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Raadsen, Mark P.

However, from an empirical standpoint, when a large number of selfish users travel in a network, the chances of reaching an equilibrium are slim. User behavior in such settings can be modeled using probabilistic route choice models which define when and how travelers switch paths. This approach results in stochastic processes with steady state distributions containing multiple states in their support. In this paper, we propose an average cost Markov decision process model to reduce the expected total system travel time of the logit route choice model using dynamic pricing. Existing dynamic pricing methods in day-to-day network models are formulated in continuous time. However, the solutions from these methods cannot be used to set tolls on different days in the network. We hence study dynamic tolling in a discrete time setting in which the system manager collects tolls based on the state of the system on previous day(s). In order to make this framework practical, approximation schemes for handling a large number of users are developed. A simple example to illustrate the application of the exact and approximate methods is also presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we are concerned with multihop connectivity of instantaneous vehicular one-dimensional ad hoc networks (VANETs) formed by connected vehicles along a communication path in a road network with given either vehicle locations or traffic densities, market penetration rates, and transmission ranges. We first define a new random variable for the location of the end node of a communication chain, which is a discrete random variable with given vehicle locations and a mixed random variable with given traffic densities. Then recursive, iterative, or differential equation models of instantaneous multihop connectivity between two communication nodes are derived from the relationships between end node probability mass or density function and connectivity. Assuming a simple communication model, the new models are applicable for general distribution patterns of vehicles and communication nodes, including non-evenly placed vehicles and nonhomogeneous Poisson distributions of nodes. With given vehicle locations, the computational cost for this new model is linear to the number of vehicles; with given traffic densities, we derive a new closed-form connectivity model for homogeneous Poisson distributions of communication nodes and an approximate closed-form model when distribution patterns of communication nodes are given by spatial renewal processes. We then apply the models to evaluate impacts on connectivity of traffic patterns, including shock waves, and road-side stations. The connectivity model could be helpful for designing routing protocols in VANETs and developing their applications in transportation systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining CSII with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) with a low glucose-suspend (LGS) feature may further improve glycemic control and reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia. A cost-effectiveness analysis of SAP + LGS vs CSII plus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was performed to determine the health economic benefits of SAP + LGS in type 1 diabetes patients using CSII in the UK. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE diabetes model. Treatment effects were sourced from the literature, where SAP + LGS was associated with a projected HbA(1c) reduction of -1.49% vs -0.62% for CSII, and a reduced frequency of severe hypoglycemia. The time horizon was that of patient lifetimes; future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% and 1.5% per annum, respectively. Results: Projected outcomes showed that SAP + LGS was associated with higher mean quality-adjusted life expectancy (17.9 vs 14.9 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], SAP + LGS vs CSII), and higher life expectancy (23.8 vs 21.9 years), but higher mean lifetime direct costs (GBP 125,559 vs GBP 88,991), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 12,233 per QALY gained for SAP + LGS vs CSII. Findings of the base-case analysis remained robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions/interpretation: For UK-based type 1 diabetes patients with poor glycemic control, the use of SAP + LGS is likely to be cost-effective compared with CSII plus SMBG.","[Roze, Stephane] HEVA HEOR, Lyon, France; [Smith-Palmer, Jayne; Valentine, William J.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland; [Cook, Mark; Jethwa, Manisha] Medtron UK, Watford, England; [de Portu, Simona] Medtron Int Trading Sarl, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [Pickup, John C.] Kings Coll London, Guys Hosp, Fac Life Sci & Med, London, England",Medtronic; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; King's College London,"Smith-Palmer, J (通讯作者)，Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Baumleingasse 20, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",smith-palmer@ossianconsulting.com,,,Medtronic International Trading Sarl,Medtronic International Trading Sarl,This study was supported by funding from Medtronic International Trading Sarl.,,39,30,32,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Providing an advance warning for lane change necessity is one of the efficient methods to perform systematic lane change management, which encourages smooth MLC maneuvers occurring at proper locations to, mitigate the negative effects of MLC maneuvers on traffic flow nearby off-ramp. However, the state of the art indicates the lack of rigorous methods to optimally locate this advance warning so that the maximum benefit can be obtained. This research is motivated to address this gap. Specifically, the proposed approach considers that the area downstream of the advance warning includes two zones: (i) the green zone whose traffic ensures safe and smooth lane changes without speed deceleration (S-MLC); the start point of the green zone corresponding to the location of the advance warning; (ii) the yellow zone whose traffic leads to rush lane change maneuvers with speed deceleration (D-MLC). An optimization model is proposed to search for the optimal green and yellow zones. Traffic flow theory such as Greenshield model and shock wave analysis are used to analyze the impacts of the S-MLC and D-MLC maneuvers on the traffic delay. A grid search algorithm is applied to solve the optimization model. Numerical experiments conducted on the simulation model developed in Paramics 6.9.3 indicate that the proposed optimization model can identify the optimal location to set the advance MLC warning nearby an off-ramp so that the traffic delay resulting from lane change maneuvers is minimized, and the corresponding capacity drop and traffic oscillation can be efficiently mitigated. Moreover, the experiments validated the consistency of the green and yellow zones obtained in the simulation traffic flow and from the optimization model for a given optimally located MLC advance warning under various traffic regimes. The proposed approach can be implemented by roadside mobile warning facility or on-board GPS for human-driven vehicles, or embedded into lane change aid systems to serve connected and automated vehicles. Thus it will greatly contribute to both literature and engineering practice in lane change management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We believe this is due to two reasons. Firstly, some of the models in the literature impose artificial upper bounds on time supplements. This causes a high risk of generating infeasibilities. Secondly, some models that leave out these upper bounds often generate solutions that contain some very large time supplements because these supplements are not penalised in the objective function. The reason is that these objective functions often do not completely correspond to the true goal of a timetable. We solve both problems by minimising our objective function: total passenger travel time, expected in practice. Since this function evaluates and indirectly steers all time related decision variables in the system, we do not need to further restrict the ranges of any of these variables. As a result, our model does not suffer from infeasibilities generated by such artificial upper bounds for supplements. Furthermore, some measures are taken to significantly speed up the solver times of our model. These combined features result in our model being solved more quickly than previous models. As a result, our method can be used for timetabling in practice. We demonstrate our claims by optimising, in about two hours only, the timetable of all 196 hourly passenger trains in Belgium. Assuming primary delay-distributions with an average of 2% on the minima of each activity, the optimised timetable reduces expected passenger time in practice, as evaluated on the macroscopic level, by 3.8% during peak hours. This paper demonstrates that we added two important missing steps to make cyclic timetabling for passengers really useable in practice: (i) the addition of the objective function of expected passenger time in practice and (ii) the reduction of computation time by addition of well chosen additional constraints.

The objective of this study is to estimate, with an experimental auction, the difference of willingness to pay for wines with different shares of international grape varieties. The results show that consumers have a general belief that determines a preference for wines made from autochthonous grape varieties. In fact, the values of auction offers limited to information about the grape variety used have shown a willingness to pay greater for wines produced with typical blends than with international blends. However, the auction experiment that uses blind tasting for the wines examined in our study has pointed out a substantial decrease of the premium price for autochthonous grapes varieties. This result therefore highlights the risks of a standardisation of productions and, consequently, a decline in the connection between the wine and the territory. A competition on homogeneous products would inevitably lead to a selection based solely on price, with a loss in terms of variety and quality of the wines and, especially, with the risk of weakening important territorial systems in economic and historical-cultural terms. Communication strategies also aimed at cultivating wine consumption appear to be the principal solutions to adopt in order to limit these dangers. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, cognitive and technological barriers put a practical limit to the degree of differentiation real world implementations can handle. The traditional approach to accommodate for this concern has been a step toll, with the single step coarse charge as its simplest case. In this paper we study how efficiency of the coarse charge can be improved by differentiating its level and timing across groups of travellers. We use the traditional bottleneck model to analyse how the coarse charge can be differentiated over two groups of travellers assuming inelastic peak-hour demand. The results of our analysis indicate that differentiating the coarse charge across two groups of travellers considerably improves its efficiency without increasing cognitive effort and decision making costs for the individual traveller. A numeric illustration reveals a welfare gain of 69% of the first-best charge, up from 53% for the generic coarse charge. This increase is similar to what is obtained by moving from the coarse charge to a generic two step toll. Once different groups have been defined, one could in fact achieve the same gains by temporal separation of drivers, for example by use of licence plate numbers. The presented charging regime has a considerable degree of flexibility with respect to the share of travellers to attribute to each scheme, which further adds to its merits in practical applicability.

As the basis of these kinds of programs, we develop a viable research methodology for modeling the relationship between the fuel consumption rate of a particular container ship and its determinants, including sailing speed, displacement, sea conditions and weather conditions, by using the shipping log data available in practice. The developed methodology consists of an outlier-score-based data preprocessing procedure to tackle the fuzziness, inaccuracy and limited information of shipping logs, and two regression models for container ship fuel efficiency. Real shipping logs from four container ships (two with 13000 TEUs and two with 5000 TEUs) over a six-month sailing period are used to exhibit the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The empirical studies demonstrate the performance of three models for fitting the fuel consumption rate of a ship and the industrial merits of ship fuel efficiency management. In addition, we highlight the potential impacts of the models developed in this study on liner shipping network analysis, as these models can serve as base models for additionally considering the influence of displacement and weather conditions on ship fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions.

GLP-1 RA are effective in combination with insulin, and even slightly superior or at least equal to short-acting insulin in T2D; however, since they work in the incretin system, they may not be effective in long-standing disease. Additionally, only recently have publications reported their cardiovascular safety, and there is limited evidence for long-term effectiveness. The work presented by Huetson et al. offers a much needed perspective through a medical economic model for the long term cost-effectiveness of GLP-1 RA. The authors found benefits in quality-adjusted life years and reduced lifetime healthcare costs. While there are a few limitations, this study contributes to the understanding of these agents and their impact on the epidemics of obesity in T2D, where weight management is no longer an option, but an essential component of the diabetes plan of care.","[Valencia, Willy Marcos] ABIM Internal Med, Geriatr Med Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Geriatr Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Valencia, Willy Marcos] Miami VA Med Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Valencia, Willy Marcos] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Div Geriatr Med, Div Epidemiol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Florez, Hermes Jose] ABIM Geriatr Med, Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Miami, FL USA; [Florez, Hermes Jose] GRECC, Miami, FL USA; [Florez, Hermes Jose] Miami VA Healthcare Syst, Miami, FL 33125 USA; [Florez, Hermes Jose] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Div Epidemiol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Florez, Hermes Jose] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Div Geriatr Med, Miami, FL 33136 USA",Geriatric Research Education & Clinical Center; University of Miami; Geriatric Research Education & Clinical Center; University of Miami; University of Miami,"Valencia, WM (通讯作者)，Miami VA Healthcare Syst, 11 GRC CLC 207 A2, Miami, FL 33125 USA.",wvalenciarodrigo@med.miami.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

With meeting points, riders can be picked up and dropped off either at their origin and destination or at a meeting point that is within a certain distance from their origin or destination. The increased flexibility results in additional feasible matches between drivers and riders, and allows a driver to be matched with multiple riders without increasing the number of stops the driver needs to make. We design and implement an algorithm that optimally matches drivers and riders in large-scale ride-sharing systems with meeting points. We perform an extensive simulation study to assess the benefits of meeting points. The results demonstrate that meeting points can significantly increase the number of matched participants as well as the system-wide driving distance savings in a ride-sharing system.

It can be used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with suspected sepsis, and might reduce the duration of hospital stay. Limiting antibiotic treatment duration is highly important because antibiotic over-use may cause patient harm, prolonged hospital stay, and resistance development. Several systematic reviews show that a PCT algorithm for antibiotic discontinuation is safe, but upfront investment required for PCT remains an important barrier against implementation. The current study investigates to what extent this PCT algorithm is a cost-effective use of scarce healthcare resources in ICU patients with sepsis compared to current practice.Methods:A decision tree was developed to estimate the health economic consequences of the PCT algorithm for antibiotic discontinuation from a Dutch hospital perspective. Input data were obtained from a systematic literature review. When necessary, additional information was gathered from open interviews with clinical chemists and intensivists. The primary effectiveness measure is defined as the number of antibiotic days, and cost-effectiveness is expressed as incremental costs per antibiotic day avoided.Results:The PCT algorithm for antibiotic discontinuation is expected to reduce hospital spending by circa Euro3503 per patient, indicating savings of 9.2%. Savings are mainly due to reductions in length of hospital stay, number of blood cultures performed, and, importantly, days on antibiotic therapy. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses showed the model outcome to be robust against changes in model inputs.Conclusion:Proven safe, a PCT algorithm for antibiotic discontinuation is a cost-effective means of reducing antibiotic exposure in adult ICU patients with sepsis, compared to current practice. Additional resources required for PCT are more than offset by downstream cost savings. This finding is highly important given the aim of preventing widespread antibiotic resistance.","[Kip, Michelle M.

This paper first presents a scenario-based stochastic mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) model that integrates facility disruption risks, en-route traffic congestion and in-facility queuing delay into an integrated facility location problem. We derive lower and upper bounds to this highly complex problem by approximating the expected total system costs across the normal and all probabilistic facility disruption scenarios. This allows us to develop a more tractable approximate MINLP formulation and a Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) based solution approach. The relaxed sub-problem for location and service allocation decisions is further reformulated into a second-order conic program. Numerical experiments show that the approximate model and LR solution approach are capable of overcoming the computational difficulties associated with the problem. Interesting findings and managerial insights are obtained from a series of sensitivity analyses, e.g., regarding the importance of considering in-facility queuing in location design, and the significance of resource pooling on the optimal facility deployment.

To this aim, a traffic-informed methodology is proposed to restore physical and platoon integrity of trajectories in a finite time-space domain, and it is applied to one NGSIM 180 dataset However, as the actual trajectories are unknown, it is not possible to verify directly whether the reconstructed trajectories are really nearer to the actual unknowns than the original measurements. Therefore, a simulation-based validation framework is proposed, that is also able to verify indirectly the efficacy of the reconstruction methodology. The framework exploits the main feature of NGSIM-like data that is the concurrent view of individual driving behaviors and emerging macroscopic traffic patterns. It allows showing that, at the scale of individual models, the accuracy of trajectories affects the distribution and the correlation structure of lane-changing model parameters (i.e. drivers heterogeneity), while it has very little impact on car-following calibration. At the scale of traffic simulation, when models interact in trace-driven simulation of the 180 scenario (multi-lane heterogeneous traffic), their ability to reproduce the observed macroscopic congested patterns is sensibly higher when model parameters from reconstructed trajectories are applied. These results are mainly due to lane changing, and are also the sought indirect validation of the proposed data reconstruction methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is among the first to consider transaction costs into auctions. In the ELP, the shipper is a B2B e-commerce platform by which a number of online orders between goods sellers and buyers are generated, and 3PLs (third-party logistics providers) can fulfill these online orders. The shipper bears transaction costs while goods sellers or buyers eventually pay intermodal services. We extend both Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) auction and primal dual Vickrey (PDV) auction to the ELP where total logistics chain cost is minimized. The VCG-like auction realizes incentive compatibility, allocative efficiency, individual rationality, and budget balance for general valuations; while the PDV-like auction need presume the condition of seller-submodularity, which implies that the effect of each 3PL is decreasing when coalition increases. Computational results show that incorporating transaction costs leads to considerable cost saving for the shipper, shipper's group (that consists of the shipper herself, good sellers and buyers), and the logistics chain, as well as higher profitability for the group of 3PLs. As the variance of transaction costs increases, incorporating transaction costs leads to higher cost saving for the entities that matter to the shipper (i.e., herself, her group, and the logistics chain), and higher profitability for the group of 3PLs, regardless of valuation distribution type. Finally, we investigate the impact of self-interested shipper and the impact of the gap between intermodal service costs and transaction costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Path and link tolls are valid if they encourage motorists to use routes that collectively lead to a target distribution, e.g., one that minimizes travel delay. Because the numbers of valid link and path tolls are typically infinite, an objective in pricing tolls is to find a set of valid tolls that yields the least revenue to lessen the financial burden on motorists. Path tolls are generally more flexible than link tolls and this paper shows that this flexibility can substantially reduce the financial burden on motorists. Additionally, valid path tolls yielding the least revenue possess characteristics with interesting policy implications. To determine these path tolls, it is natural to formulate the problem as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints.

We attempt to close that gap by proposing a bi-objective optimization framework for managing hazmat freight that not only considers congestion at intermodal yards, but also determines the appropriate equipment capacity. The proposed framework, i.e., a non-linear MIP and a multi-objective genetic algorithm based solution methodology, is applied to a realistic size problem instance from existing literature. Our analysis indicates that terminal congestion risk is a significant portion of the network risk; and, that policies and tools involving number of cranes, shorter maximum waiting times, and tighter delivery times could have a positive bearing on risk.

Although the pioneering work on this problem dates back to the early 1990s, only until recently have researchers started to acknowledge and account for the significant amount of uncertainty present in shipping demand in real world container shipping. In this paper, new analytical results are presented to further relax the input requirements for this problem. Specifically, only the mean and variance of the maximum shipping demand are required to be known. An optional symmetry assumption is shown to further reduce the feasible region and deployment cost for typical confidence levels. Moreover, unlike previous work that tends to ignore stochastic dependencies between the shipping demands on the various routes (that are known to exist in the real world), our models account for such dependencies in the most general setting to date. A salient feature of our modeling approach is that the exact dependence structure does not need to be specified, something that is hard, if not simply impossible, to determine in practice. A numerical case study is provided to illustrate the proposed models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Research design and methods: A cumulative cohort model was developed to estimate the 5-year costs associated with introducing everolimus to the Kazakh healthcare system. Two alternative market share scenarios were compared: with everolimus and without everolimus. PFS and OS data were taken from the trial and extrapolated. The background costs of the pre-progressed and post-progressed health states, drug costs and costs associated with adverse events were included in the model. Results: The 5-year results from the budget impact analysis demonstrate that the introduction of everolimus leads to a 12% increase in drug costs, a 2% reduction in pre-progression health state costs, a 1% increase in post-progression health state costs, and a 2% reduction in adverse event costs. The net result is only a modest increase in total costs; a 2.69% increase of T201 million, from T7.5 billion to T7.7 billion over a period of 5 years. Conclusions: The analysis estimated that, if everolimus were to be introduced to the Kazakh healthcare market for the treatment of ER + HER2 - advanced breast cancer, there would be minimal impact upon overall healthcare expenditure. An increase in drug acquisitions costs was almost exactly offset by a reduction in other healthcare costs, due to improved management of the disease.","[Lewis, Lily; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium Ltd, York YO10 5NH, N Yorkshire, England; [Ertugyrovna, Yessentayeva Suriya; Shadybayevich, Nurgaziev Kuanysh; Kabakovna, Smagulova Kaldygul; Zufarovich, Abdrakhmanov Ramil] Kazakh Res Inst Oncol & Radiol, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",University of York - UK; Kazakh Institute of Oncology & Radiology,"Lewis, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium Ltd, Market Sq, York YO10 5NH, N Yorkshire, England.",lily.lewis@york.ac.uk,"Yessentayeva, Suriya/AAV-6440-2020; Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023",,Novartis Pharma AG,Novartis Pharma AG,"LL & MT's employer, York Health Economics Consortium, received funding for health economics consultancy from Novartis Pharma AG.",,0,4,4,0,3,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Using a US administrative claims database, this study identified commercially-insured adults newly diagnosed with carcinoid tumors (ICD-9-CM: 209.xx) or pancreatic islet cell tumors (ICD-9-CM: 157.4 and 211.7) between July 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010 (date of first observed diagnosis denoted the index date). Patients were required to have 6-month pre-index and 12-month post-index continuous enrollment, and treatment by medical and/or surgical therapy during the 12-month follow-up. Descriptive analyses were performed to assess demographic/clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, HRU, and total healthcare cost in two mutually exclusive cohorts, medical and surgical therapy. Results: This study included 625 individuals with NETs treated with medical therapy (mean age: 54.2 years; 53.4% female) and 831 treated with surgical therapy (mean age: 51.3 years; 52.6% female). Among the medical therapy cohort, carcinoid syndrome (72.3%), liver metastasis (62.6%), and diarrhea (28.3%) were the most prevalent symptoms/co-morbidities in the 12-month post-index period; 92.3% received octreotide long-acting release, 35.8% had hospitalization admissions, and 37.9% had emergency room visits. The total monthly healthcare cost increased from $5629.7 in the pre-index period to $9093.3 in the post-index period. Among the surgical therapy cohort, carcinoid syndrome (40.3%), nausea and/or vomiting (28.5%), and liver metastasis (24.3%) were the most prevalent symptoms/comorbidities in the 12-month post-index period; 31.4% received surgical resection or removal of large intestine, 94.7% had hospitalization admissions, and 45.5% had emergency room visits. The total monthly healthcare cost increased from $2547.9 in the pre-index period to $8810.4 in the post-index period.

It also performs an economic simulation that evaluates the cost implications of the changes in QMs and of the incidence rates (IRs) of adverse events (AEs) associated with canagliflozin (CANA) and sitagliptin (SITA) treatments in a real-world setting. Methods: Health-insurance claims and electronic medical records from the Reliant Medical Group database (20072011) were used to identify adult patients with T2DM receiving metformin and sulfonylurea who did not achieve adequate glycemic control. The association between the changes in QMs and healthcare costs was evaluated using multivariate regression and non-parametric bootstrap methods. AE-related costs were taken from the literature. The cost impact of CANA and SITA outcomes was evaluated using the aforementioned costs and the changes in QMs and the IRs of AEs observed in a recent phase 3 trial comparing CANA and SITA as third oral agent (DIA3015). Results: Eight hundred and fifty-six T2DM patients were identified (mean age = 65.8; female 45.4%). The regression analysis found that increases of 1 percentage point in HbA1C and 1% in systolic and diastolic BP, LDL-C, or weight were associated with a per patient per year (PPPY) cost increase of $4476 (p = 0.028) and $566 (p = 0.006), a decrease of $362 (p = 0.070) and $7 (p = 0.817), and an increase of $241 (p = 0.481), respectively. The economic simulation showed that changes in QMs and IRs of AEs equivalent to those reported in DIA3015 would be associated with a reduction in PPPY healthcare costs of $6061 (p = 0.036) for CANA and $2190 (p = 0.098) for SITA. Conclusions: This study suggests that integrated approaches that manage to control a combination of quality measures are most successful at reducing downstream healthcare costs.","[Lafeuille, Marie-Helene; Grittner, Amanda Melina; Gravel, Jonathan; Lefebvre, Patrick] Ltee, Grp Anal, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada; [Bailey, Robert A.; Martin, Silas] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA; [Garber, Lawrence] Reliant Med Grp, Worcester, MA USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Reliant Medical Group,"Lafeuille, MH (通讯作者)，Ltee, Grp Anal, 1000 Gauchetiere West,Suite 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",marie-helene.lafeuille@analysisgroup.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","The funding for this study was provided by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,0,7,7,1,5,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Research design and methods: Employees aged 18-64 with >= 2 UC diagnoses and no more than one diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) were identified from a large, de-identified, private insurance US claims database from January 1, 2005 through March 31, 2013. Patients with UC were matched 1:1 to non-IBD controls based on demographics and index date (a randomly selected UC diagnosis). All patients were required to have continuous eligibility for >= 1 year before (baseline period) and after (study period) the index date. Descriptive analyses compared baseline characteristics and study period outcomes. Multivariate cost analysis adjusted for baseline comorbidities. Sub-group analyses compared patients with moderate-to-severe UC with matched controls.

Methods: A retrospective comparative cohort study was conducted of pregnant women aged 15-49 years using de-identified medical and pharmacy claims from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database incurred between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2011. The total healthcare costs are reported (adjusted to 2011 dollars) from the date of the first pregnancy-related claim through to 3 months post-delivery and these costs were compared to matched controls of nonpregnant women. Pregnancy-related complications were categorized, and the incremental costs associated with each complication were estimated using multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 322,141 eligible women with live births were studied. Compared to matched controls, the average costs of care for pregnant women were nearly $13,000 higher through 3 months post-delivery. A total of 46.9% of women had at least one pre-specified pregnancy complication; the most commonly observed were fetal abnormality (24.7%) and early or threatened labor (16.3%). Multiple gestation (1.9%) resulted in the highest adjusted incremental cost ($12,212; 95% CI = 11,298, 13,216); hypertension ($ 6152; 95% CI = 5312, 6992) and diabetes ($ 5081; 95% CI = 4244, 5918) were also among those complications that led to high incremental costs of care.

The interaction between a dry port and multiple shippers is modelled as a bilevel program. The optimal properties of the proposed model under certain conditions are derived analytically, from which a closed-form solution is obtained. Contrary to intuition, the increase of container delivery frequency from shippers may lead to the reduction of dry port's profit according to model outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Autonomous cars can safely drive closer together than cars driven by humans, thereby possibly increasing road capacity. By allowing drivers to perform other activities in the vehicle, they may reduce the value of travel time losses (VOT). We investigate the effects of autonomous cars using a dynamic equilibrium model of congestion that captures three main elements: the resulting increase in capacity, the decrease in the VOT for those who acquire one and the implications of the resulting changes in the heterogeneity of VOTs. We do so for three market organizations: private monopoly, perfect competition and public supply. Even though an increased share of autonomous cars raises average capacity, it may hurt existing autonomous car users as those who switch to an autonomous car will impose increased congestion externalities due to their altered departure time behaviour. Depending on which effect dominates, switching to an autonomous vehicle may impose a net negative or positive externality. Often public supply leads to 100% autonomous cars, but it may be optimal to have a mix of car types, especially when there is a net negative externality. With a positive (negative) externality, perfect competition leads to an undersupply (oversupply) of autonomous cars, and a public supplier needs to subsidise (tax) autonomous cars to maximise welfare. A monopolist supplier ignores the capacity effect and adds a mark-up to its price. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[van den Berg, Vincent A.

While many works consider only a fraction of the network, created by major airports or airlines, for example, it is not clear if and how such sampling process bias the observed structures and processes. In this contribution, we tackle this problem by studying how some observed topological metrics depend on the way the network is reconstructed, i.e. on the rules used to sample nodes and connections. Both structural and simple dynamical properties are considered, for eight major air networks and different source datasets. Results indicate that using a subset of airports strongly distorts our perception of the network, even when just small ones are discarded; at the same time, considering a subset of airlines yields a better and more stable representation. This allows us to provide some general guidelines on the way airports and connections should be sampled. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since 2010, the Taiwanese National Health Insurance (NHI) has started to reimburse for 1-year adjuvant treatment. This study aims to provide an updated cost-effectiveness analysis from the NHI perspective, which explores assumptions about long-term cardiac toxicity and treatment benefit of 1-year adjuvant treatment sequentially after chemotherapy.Methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab for HER-2/neu positive early breast cancer over a 20-year life-time horizon. A probability sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was performed to characterize uncertainties in the expected outcomes, which are expressed as an incremental costs effectiveness ratio (ICER, cost/QALY). A willingness-to-pay threshold of 3-times the per capita gross domestic product was adopted according to the WHO definition. The Taiwan per capita gross domestic product in 2015 was US$22,355; thus, a threshold was considered as NT$2,011,950 (US$67 065, 1USD=30 NTD in 2015).Results: The model showed that adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in HER-2/neu positive early breast cancer yielded 1.631 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) compared with no trastuzumab treatment. The ICER was US $51,863 per QALY gained in the base-case scenario. The Monte Carlo simulation by varying all variables simultaneously demonstrated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$67,065 was 50% for 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab.Conclusions: From this real-world study, 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab treatment is likely to be a cost-effective therapy for patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3-times GDP per capita in Taiwan.","[Lang, Hui-Chu] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Hosp & Hlth Care Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Hsiao-Wei] Novotech Clinical Res Taiwan PTY LTD, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiou, Tzeon-Jye] Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiou, Tzeon-Jye] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Sch Med, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chan, Agnes L.

However, given the increasing complexity and volume of the emerging mobility datasets, it also becomes challenging to build novel analytical framework that is capable of understanding the structural properties and critical features. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework to deal with high-dimensional human mobility data. To this end, we formulate mobility data in a probabilistic setting and consider each record a multivariate observation sampled from an underlying distribution. In order to characterize this distribution, we use a multi-way probabilistic factorization model based on the concept of tensor decomposition and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). The model provides us with a flexible approach to understand multi-way mobility involving higher-order interactions which are difficult to characterize with conventional approaches using simple latent structures. The model can be efficiently estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

Its signals are pretimed in an arbitrary pattern, and traffic on it behaves as per the kinematic-wave/variational theory with a triangular fundamental diagram. It is shown that the long run average flow on the street when the number of cars on the street (i.e, the street's density) is held constant is given by the solution of a linear program (LP) with a finite number of variables and constraints. This defines a point on the street's macroscopic fundamental diagram. For the homogeneous special case where the block lengths and signal timings are identical, all the LP constraints but one are redundant and the result has a closed form. In this case, the LP recipe matches and simplifies the so-called method of cuts. This establishes that the method of cuts is exact for homogeneous problems. However, in the more realistic inhomogeneous case the difference between the two methods can be arbitrarily large. The paper uses the LP method to obtain the macroscopic fundamental diagrams arising under four different traffic coordination schemes for streets with four different block length configurations. It is found that the best scheme depends on the prevailing density. Curiously, the popular scheme in which all the traffic green phases are started synchronously wins only in rare circumstances. Its performance is particularly underwhelming when the street's blocks are long. The paper also presents density-aware numerical methods to optimize the signal offsets for 1-way and 2-way streets. For 1-way streets operated with a common cycle the method reduces to a simple graphical construction. In this case the resulting flow matches the flow that would arise if all of the street's intersections except one with the shortest green phase had been eliminated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Technical change is calculated using the Malmquist productivity index. The results indicate that European airports have improved their noise efficiency between 2006 and 2011, and some degree of convergence in noise performance across countries is seen.

Methods: In this retrospective study, pharmacy claims were analyzed for those patients with a diagnosis of MM who received thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide from a large specialty pharmacy in the US between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. Average direct cost to patients, per prescription, was analyzed both before and after financial assistance. Adherence was assessed through an analysis of medication possession ratio (MPR) for those patients who filled a prescription >= 2 times throughout the 3-year time period. Results: A total of 77,821 prescriptions for thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide were filled by 6731 unique patients between January 1, 2011, and, December 31, 2013. The average direct cost to patients, per prescription, for any of these three agents was $227.23 prior to financial assistance and $80.11 after financial assistance, representing an average patient savings of $147.14 per prescription. Prior to financial assistance, the average direct cost to patients was <=$50 for 57.6% of all prescriptions. After financial assistance, 86.2% of patients had a direct cost of <=$50 per prescription. Adherence, as assessed by MPR, did not vary significantly based on direct cost to the patient. Limitations: This study included patients receiving therapy from a single specialty pharmacy for a single indication. There may be patients included in the analysis who received prescriptions from other pharmacies prior to or after the prescriptions available for analysis. Most of the prescriptions included in the analysis were for lenalidomide. Conclusions: This retrospective study demonstrated that the specialty pharmacy helped patients significantly reduce their direct cost expenditures by securing funding and co-pay assistance.","[Lee, Claire; Grigorian, Matthew; Nolan, Ryan; Rice, Gary] Diplomat, 4100 S Saginaw St, Flint, MI 48507 USA; [Binder, Gary] Celgene Corp, Summit, NJ USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Celgene Corporation,"Lee, C (通讯作者)，Diplomat, 4100 S Saginaw St, Flint, MI 48507 USA.",clee@diplomat.is,,,Celgene Corporation,Celgene Corporation(Bristol-Myers SquibbCelgene Corporation),"The authors received editorial assistance from MediTech Media, sponsored by Celgene Corporation.",,20,15,18,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Method: The concentration index (CI) and horizontal inequality (HI) of treatment outcomes of cancer patients were calculated and the role of the economy, disease, and other factors to HI was analyzed by describing the influence of treatment expense on the treatment outcomes of different cancer patients. Results: The study showed that the equity of the death rate and the effective rate of six types of cancer patients was good. The HI of the cure rate was 0.225, indicating a strong, pro-rich inequity of the cancer inpatient cure rate, while the contribution of the economic factors to HI was 0.158. The uncured rate in the low-cost group represented the rate of patients who discontinued the treatment; the HI was -0.324, indicating a strong, pro-poor inequity. The relaxation effect on the HI of the cured rate by medical insurance was 14.9%, while the effect on the HI of the uncured rate was 18.7%. Conclusion: At present, medical insurance has demonstrated relaxation effects on the fairness of treatment outcomes to some extent. The main reason for this inequity comes from the payment of the items at present. To relieve such inequity to a greater extent, the payment system should be changed and diagnosis-related groups should be implemented.","[Xu, Jun-Xiu; Peng, Rong; Zhang, Wen] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept HR, Affiliated Hosp 1, Coll Med, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jian-Min] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 76 Yanta West Rd, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Xu, JX (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept HR, Affiliated Hosp 1, Coll Med, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Gao, JM (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 76 Yanta West Rd, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",hollandxu@163.com; gaojm@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,China Medical Board of New York Inc (CMB); Shannxi government [2014KRM99-01],China Medical Board of New York Inc (CMB); Shannxi government,The authors would like to thank China Medical Board of New York Inc (CMB) for financial support; this work was also supported by Shannxi government (serial number: 2014KRM99-01).,,20,0,0,2,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: This retrospective analysis used the societal cost-of-illness framework, consisting of direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs. In order to analyze the societal costs of patients with COPD, this study used a data mining and a macro-costing method on data from a South Korean national-level health survey and a national health insurance claims database from 2004-2013. Results: The total societal cost of COPD in 2013 was estimated to be $439.9 million for 1,419,914 patients. The direct medical cost for COPD was $214.3 million, which included a hospitalization cost of $96.3 million, an outpatient cost of $76.4 million, and a pharmaceutical cost of $41.6 million. The direct non-medical cost was estimated at $43.5 million. The indirect overall cost associated with the morbidity and mortality of COPD was $182.2 million in 2013.

According to the literature, well-being is a multidimensional and subjective concept, it is related to happiness but it does not depend on mere economic welfare. In fact, the bond between material wealth and well-being is not causal: GDP is not the optimum way of assessing the level of well-being. On the contrary, there is a strict relationship between well-being, agriculture and rural development. The man/farmer, transforming the rural landscape, creates modifications that reverberate first on natural landscape, then on the whole territory, and finally back to the man itself. In this context, the generative communication arises as a model that best interprets the need to represent and promote the circular nature of the relationships between man and land. By doing this, it enhances and protects cultural diversity, social and natural environment of the territory itself. Hence, it strengthens the well-being of those who work and constantly transforms this landscape. The paper closes with the analysis of two case-studies, the Comunicazione generativa per il Programma di Sviluppo Rurale 2014-2020 della Regione Toscana project (in english: Generative Communication for the Tuscany Rural Development Programme, RDP, 2014-2020) and the San Casciano Smart Place project, both developed by the Communication Strategies Lab.

The associations between DMT adherence and persistence and inpatient admissions and emergency room (ER) visits were investigated.Methods:Patients with MS who initiated a DMT in a US administrative claims database were followed for 1 year. Persistence to initiated DMT was measured as the time from DMT initiation to discontinuation (a gap of >60 days without drug on hand') or end of 1-year follow-up. Adherence to initiated DMT was measured during the persistent period and was operationalized as the medication possession ratio (MPR). Patients with an MPR <0.80 were considered non-adherent. Claims during the 1-year follow-up period were evaluated for the presence of an all-cause inpatient admission or an ER visit. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for inpatient admission or ER visit comparing persistent vs non-persistent and adherent vs non-adherent patients were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for patient characteristics.Results:The final sample included 16,218 patients. During the 1-year follow-up period, 35.3% of patients discontinued their initiated DMT and 13.9% were not adherent while on therapy. During that same period, 10.0% of patients had an inpatient admission and 24.9% had an ER visit. The likelihoods of inpatient admission and ER visit were significantly decreased in persistent patients (AOR [95% CI]=0.50 [0.45, 0.56] and 0.65 [0.60, 0.69], respectively) and in adherent patients (AOR [95% CI]=0.83 [0.71, 0.97] and 0.86 [0.77, 0.95], respectively).Conclusions:Persistence and adherence with initiated DMT are associated with decreased likelihoods of inpatient admission or ER visit, which may translate to improved clinical outcomes.","[Thomas, Nina Parikh; Yu, Elaine; Hurley, Dana] Genentech Inc, Hlth Econ, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Curkendall, Suellen; Farr, Amanda M.] Truven Hlth Analyt, Hlth Econ, Ann Arbor, MI USA",Roche Holding; Genentech,"Thomas, NP (通讯作者)，Genentech Inc, Hlth Econ, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",thomas.nina@gene.com,,,"Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This analysis was funded by Genentech, Inc.",,24,21,21,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Findings suggest that Hispanic consumers drink wine fairly frequently, with the majority of the sample reporting wine consumption at least once a week. Slightly over half of the sample prefers red and dry wine, but about forty percent give preferences to sweet wine. Hispanic consumers perceive wine as a drink to be consumed at home, rather than in a restaurant or a bar.

This communication is useful for the hinterland operator to plan and deploy its transport capacities. However, further transport of containers on the hinterland involve various transport modes at differing costs. For example, the delivery time requirement of a container dictates the most appropriate mode of inland transport, be it truck, rail, or barge, in decreasing order of speed, flexibility and cost, to move the container to the next destination. In general there may be several types of delivery time requirements and containers of each type is most economically moved inland in a corresponding transport mode. Trucking is usually used for containers that need urgent delivery and train or barge for not so urgent types. In order to efficiently plan the transport capacities for after-arrival conveyance of containers having multi-type delivery time requirements, not only should the aggregate number of containers, but also the number of containers of each type, be made available to the hinterland operator. We consider several information scenarios and in each scenario we solve a single-period capacity planning serving multi-type demands with product substitution. We then compare expected transport costs between information scenarios to evaluate the benefit of specific cargo information in improving the next-step transporting after containers are unloaded at the port of entry.

The Cardiff model generated outputs including macrovascular and microvascular complications, diabetes-specific mortality, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and QALYs were estimated with a time horizon of 40 years at a discount rate of 3% from a societal perspective.Results:Compared with insulin glargine plus OAD treatments, patients on exenatide BID plus OAD gained 1.88 QALYs, at an incremental cost saving of Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 114,593 (i.e., cost saving of RMB 61078/QALY). The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The variables with the most impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio included HbA1c level at baseline, health utilities decrement, and BMI at baseline.Conclusions:Compared with insulin glargine QD, exenatide BID as add-on therapy to OAD is a cost-effective treatment in Chinese patients inadequately controlled by OAD treatments.","[Deng, Jing] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Baltimore, MD USA; [Gu, Shuyan; Dong, Hengjin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Shao, Hui; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Syst & Dev, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Zou, Dajin] Second Mil Med Univ, Changhai Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Zhejiang University; Tulane University; Naval Medical University,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Syst & Dev, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,,,,,,,57,12,15,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The analysis assessed the long-term costs and health outcomes using an individual patient simulation in which AD progression is modeled in terms of cognition, behavior, and functioning changes. Input parameters are based on patient-level trial data, published literature, and publicly available data sources. Changes in anti-psychotic medication use are incorporated based on a published retrospective cohort study. Costs include drug acquisition and monitoring, total AD-related medical care, and informal care associated with caregiver time. Incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), life years, care time for caregiver, time in community and institution, time on anti-psychotics, time by disease severity, and time without severe symptoms are reported. Costs and health outcomes are discounted at 3% per annum.Results:Considering a societal perspective over 3 years, this analysis shows that memantine ER combined with an AChEI provides better clinical outcomes and lower costs than AChEI monotherapy. Discounted average savings were estimated at $18,355 and $20,947 per patient and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by an average of 0.12 and 0.13 from a societal and healthcare payer perspective, respectively.

Only few forms of scheduling preferences provide non-trivial measures which are additive over links in transport networks where link travel times are arbitrarily distributed independent random variables: Assuming smooth preferences; this holds only for specifications with a constant marginal utility of time at the origin and an exponential or affine marginal utility of time at the destination. We apply a generalized version of this model to stated preference data of car drivers' route and mode choice under uncertain travel times. Our analysis exposes some important methodological issues related to complex non-linear scheduling models: One issue is identifying the point in time where the marginal utility of being at the destination becomes larger than the marginal utility of being at the origin. Another issue is that models with the exponential marginal utility formulation suffer from empirical identification problems. Though our results are not decisive, they partly support the constant-affine specification, in which the value of travel time variability is proportional to the variance of travel time.

One is based on the so called s-curve, in which, all else equal, market shares are determined by frequency shares. The other is based on schedule delay the time difference between when travelers wish to travel and when flights are available. We develop competition models that differ only with regard to which of the above approaches is used to capture the effect of frequency. The demand side of both models is an approximation of a nested logit model which yields endogenous travel demand by including not traveling in the choice set. We find symmetric competitive equilibrium for both models analytically, and compare their predictions concerning market frequency with empirical evidence. In contrast to the s-curve model, the schedule delay model depicts a more plausible relationship between market share and frequency share and accurately predicts observed patterns of supply side behavior. Moreover, the predictions from both models are largely the same if we employ numerical versions of the model that capture real-world aspects of competition. We also find that, for either model, the relationship between airline frequency and market traffic is the same whether frequency is determined by competitive equilibrium, social optimality, or social optimality with a break-even constraint.

Due to the disruption, all tracks in a railway segment are out of order for a certain period of time. In the situation that we consider, trains that are blocked by the disruption do not return to their origin by taking over train services in the opposite direction, but wait inside the stations until the disruption is over. Thus the main decisions to be taken are the following: in which stations do trains have to wait, in which order do they have to leave when the disruption is over, and which trains have to be canceled? A Mixed Integer Programming model is formulated to minimize the total weighted train delay and the number of canceled trains, while adhering to headway and station capacity constraints. Most instances can be solved in a single optimization run, but for the most complex instances we propose a two-stage optimization approach to improve the computational efficiency. The model is tested on real-world instances of the Beijing-Shanghai high speed railway line. The results show that the model is promising for reducing the effect of a disruption on passenger service, especially in comparison with a heuristic method used in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

(The dynamical model is based on swapping flow between paired alternative segments (these were introduced by Bar-Gera (2010)) rather than between routes.) It is shown that under certain conditions the dynamical system enters a given connected set of approximate equilibria in a finite number of days or steps. This proof allows for saturation flows which act as potentially active flow constraints. The dynamical system involving paired alternative segment swaps is then combined with a novel green-time-swapping rule; this rule swaps green-time toward more pressurised signal stages. It is shown that if (i) the delay formulae have a simple form and (ii) the pressure formula fits the special control policy P-0 (see Smith, 1979a,b), then the combined flow-swapping/green-time-swapping dynamical model also enters a given connected set of approximate consistent equilibria in a finite number of steps. Computational results confirm, in a simple network, the positive P0 result and also show, on the other hand, that such good behaviour may not arise if the equisaturation control policy is utilised. The dynamical models described here do not represent blocking back effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

INR monitoring is costly, because of associated physician and nurse time, laboratory resource use, and dose adjustments. Objectives: This study assessed the healthcare cost burden associated with out-of-range INR among warfarin initiator patients diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) population. Methods: Adult NVAF patients (>= 18 years) initiating warfarin were selected from the VHA dataset for the study period October 1, 2007-September 30, 2012. Only valid INR measurements (0.5 <= INR <= 20) were examined for the follow-up period, from the index date (warfarin initiation date) until the end of warfarin exposure or death. All-cause healthcare costs within 30 days were measured starting from the second month (31 days postindex date) to the end of the study period. Costs for inpatient stays, emergency room, outpatient facility, physician office visits, and other services were computed separately. Multiple regression was performed using the generalized linear model for overall cost analysis. Results: In total, 29,463 patients were included in the study sample. Mean costs for out-of-range INR ranged from $3419 to $5126. Inpatient, outpatient, outpatient pharmacy, and total costs were significantly higher after patients experienced out-of-range results (INR < 2, INR > 3), compared with in-range INR (2 <= INR <= 3). When exposed to out-of-range INR, patients also incurred higher mean total costs within 2-6 months ($3840-$5820) than after the first 6 months ($2789-$3503) of warfarin therapy. Conclusion: In the VHA population, INR measures outside of the 2-3 range were associated with significantly higher healthcare costs. Increased costs were especially apparent when INR values were below 2, although INR measures above 3 were also associated with higher costs relative to in-range values.","[Nelson, Winnie W.; Schein, Jeffrey R.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA; [Wang, Li] STATinMED Res, Plano, TX USA; [Baser, Onur] MEF Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Baser, Onur] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Baser, Onur] STATinMED Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Damaraju, C.

This research proposes a quantitative model to analyze how a grain processor regains robustness when supply is disrupted by a natural disaster upstream, and how this disruption affects grain retailers downstream. Two supply chain recovery methods, contingent sourcing and government aid, are considered for grain processor recovery. The results show that (1) a processor prefers timely full recovery, and (2) government aid as an intervention means is indispensable but cannot fully replace the backup supplier.

Using the unique capabilities of the DTW algorithm, this paper attempts to examine driver heterogeneity in car-following behavior, as well as the driver's heterogeneous situation-dependent behavior within a trip, based on the calibrated time-varying response times and critical jam spacing. The standard DTW algorithm is enhanced to address a number of estimation challenges in this specific application, and a numerical experiment is presented with vehicle trajectory data extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project for demonstration purposes. The DTW algorithm is shown to be a reasonable method for processing large vehicle trajectory datasets, but requires significant data reduction to produce reasonable results when working with high resolution vehicle trajectory data. Additionally, singularities present an interesting match solution set to potentially help identify changing driver behavior; however, they must be avoided to reduce analysis complexity.

Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine (CSAI) represents an alternative treatment option for advanced PD with motor fluctuation. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CSAI compared with Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), Deep-Brain-Stimulation (DBS) and Standard-of-care (SOC). Methods: A multi-country Markov-Model to simulate the long-term consequences, disease progression (Hoehn & Yahr stages 3-5, percentage of waking-time in the OFF-state), complications, and adverse events was developed. Monte-Carlo simulation accounted for uncertainty. Probabilities were derived from RCT and open-label studies. Costs were estimated from the UK and German healthcare provider's perspective. QALYs, life-years (LYs), and costs were projected over a life-time horizon. Results: UK lifetime costs associated with CSAI amounts to 78,251.49 pound and generates 2.85 QALYs and 6.28 LYs ((sic)104,500.08, 2.92 QALYs and 6.49 LYs for Germany). Costs associated with LCIG are 130,011.34 pound, achieves 3.06 QALYs and 6.93 LYs ((sic)175,004.43, 3.18 QALYs and 7.18 LYs for Germany). The incremental-cost per QALY gained (ICER) was 244,684.69 pound ((sic)272,914.58). Costs for DBS are 87,730.22 pound, associated with 2.75 QALYs and 6.38 LYs ((sic)105,737.08, 2.85 QALYs and 6.61 LYs for Germany). CSAI dominates DBS. SOC associated UK costs are 76,793.49; pound 2.62 QALYs and 5.76 LYs were reached ((sic)90,011.91, 2.73 QALYs and 6 LYs for Germany). Conclusions: From a health economic perspective, CSAI is a cost-effective therapy and could be seen as an alternative treatment to LCIG or DBS for patients with advanced PD.","[Walter, Evelyn] IPF Inst Phamaecon Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Odin, Per] Klinikum Bremerhaven, Dept Neurol, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Odin, Per] Skane Univ Hosp, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Skane University Hospital,"Walter, E (通讯作者)，Inst Pharmaecon Res, Wolfengasse 4-7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",e.walter@ipf-ac.at,,"Odin, Per/0000-0002-0756-7478",EVER Neuro Pharma,EVER Neuro Pharma,This study was funded by a grant from EVER Neuro Pharma.,,0,31,32,0,5,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used US administrative claims data to study patients with T2DM initiating exenatide QW or liraglutide (initiated therapy = index therapy). Patients were included if they had T2DM, were glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) naive, initiated exenatide QW or liraglutide from 1 February 2012 to 1 October 2012 (date of initiation = index), were >= 18 years at index, and had continuous enrollment for 12 months before (baseline) to 6 months after index (follow-up).

This new service provides an attractive alternative way by picking up customer at this/her specified position and at any time he/she preferred and delivering to the airport more conveniently than airport shuttle and thus earn high customer service quality. Compared with the single-trip mode, the multi-trip mode of D2PDCA (MTM-D2PDCA) service can reduce travel distances, the number of vehicles required and the operating cost. To obtain the exact solution of the MTM-D2PDCA problem, we propose a novel, exact algorithm based on the trip-chain-oriented set-partitioning (TCO-SP) model, where a trip-chain represents multiple trips made by a specific vehicle. In the exact algorithm, we propose an improved label-correcting method to remove infeasible trip-chains quickly and thus speed the search process. Based on the feasible trip-chains, the MTM-D2PDCA problem is formulated as the novel TCO-SP model, which can be solved exactly by the optimization software CPLEX. In addition, we present several mathematical insights into the relationship between the number of trip-chains and the number of local optimal trips that are applicable in both theory and practice. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the application of the model and demonstrate the cost savings of the MTM-D2PDCA mode over the single-trip mode and provide managerial insights into successfully operating a MTM-D2PDCA service.

The best-known idling option is the widespread practice of keeping the vehicle engine running while the vehicle is not moving, which primarily stems from the drivers'desire to keep their vehicle at an adequate comfort level during breaks. Here, we explore two additional cleaner idling options: resting at an Electrified Parking Space (EPS) or using an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) while idling. We also account for the initial investments associated with the equipment required for the use of these technologies. We formulate a mathematical model for the TDSP-IO under these three idling options, and we perform extensive computational experiments on realistic benchmark instances. The paper sheds light on the trade-offs between various performance indicators and offers several managerial and policy insights. Our analyses quantify the advantages of using EPSs and APUs, and show that they yield both economical and environmental benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to recover the affected schedule in the most efficient way. One important contribution of this work is to explicitly distinguish two types of uncertainties in liner shipping, and propose different strategies to handle them. The problem can be formulated as a multi-stage stochastic control problem that minimizes the total expected fuel cost and delay penalty. For regular uncertainties that can be characterized by appropriate probabilistic models, we develop the properties of the optimal control policy; then we show how an emerging disruption may change the control policies. Numerical studies demonstrate the advantages of real-time schedule recovery policies against some typical alternatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper deals with the influence of a frequent but so far largely neglected characteristic of bus networks on bus bunching, that is the presence of overtaking and common lines. A set of discrete state equations is implemented to obtain the departure times of a group of buses following the occurrence of an exogenous delay to one bus at a bus stop. Two models are distinguished depending on whether overtaking at stops is possible or not. If two buses board simultaneously and overtaking is not possible, passengers will board the front bus. If overtaking is possible, passengers form equilibrium queues in order to minimise their waiting times. Conditions for equilibrium queues among passengers with different choice sets are formulated. With a case study we then illustrate that, if overtaking is not allowed, the presence of common lines worsens the service regularity along the corridor. Conversely, common lines have positive effects when overtaking is possible. We suggest hence that appropriate network design is important to reduce the negative effects of delay-prone lines on the overall network performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm's solutions are defined on a space time discretized grid. Unlike previous numerical schemes there is no hard upper limit on the time step size for the algorithm to be numerically stable, leaving only the trade-off between accuracy and interpolation errors. This is a major benefit because mandatory small time steps in existing algorithm (required for numerical tractability) are undesirable in most strategic analyses. They lead to highly increased memory costs on larger network instances and unnecessary complex behaviour. In practice results are often aggregated for storage or analysis, which leads to the loss of computationally expensive detailed information and to the introduction of inconsistencies. The novel iterative scheme is consistent with the modelling assumptions independent of the numerical time step. A second contribution of the iterative procedure is the smart handling of repeated runs, which can be initialized (or warm started) by an earlier solution. For applications, repeatedly loading a network is often needed when evaluating traffic states under changing variables or adjusted parameter settings, or in optimization and equilibration procedures. In these cases the iterative algorithm is initialized with the solution of a previous run and iterations are performed to find a new consistent solution. Pseudo-code is provided for both a basic upwind iterative scheme and an extended algorithm that significantly accelerates convergence. The most important computational gains are achieved by ordering and reducing calculations to that part of the network which has changed (most). The properties of the algorithm are demonstrated on a theoretical network as well as on some real-world networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Himpe, Willem; Tampere, M. J.

In stage I, we propose a practical liner shipping network design problem with empty container repositioning. The proposed problem further considers the use of foldable containers and allows the mutual substitution between empty containers to decrease the number of empty containers to be repositioned. In stage II, the inverse optimization technique is used to determine the perceived container leasing prices at different ports, based on the solution obtained in stage I. Based on a set of candidate liner shipping service routes, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is built for the proposed problem in stage I. The nonlinear terms are linearized by introducing the auxiliary variables. Numerical experiments based on a realistic Asia-Europe-Oceania liner shipping network are carried out to account for the effectiveness of our two -stage optimization method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For these patients the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) represents a useful but under-utilized alternative. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the cost-effectiveness of initiating CSII in type 2 diabetes patients failing to achieve good glycemic control on MDI in the Netherlands. Methods: Long-term projections were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical input data were sourced from the OpT2mise trial. The analysis was performed over a lifetime time horizon. The discount rates applied to future costs and clinical outcomes were 4% and 1.5% per annum, respectively. Results: CSII was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with MDI (9.38 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] vs 8.95 QALYs, respectively). The breakdown of costs indicated that approximate to 50% of costs were attributable to diabetes-related complications. Higher acquisition costs of CSII vs MDI were partially offset by the reduction in complications. The ICER was estimated at EUR 62,895 per QALY gained and EUR 60,474 per QALY gained when indirect costs were included. Conclusions: In the Netherlands, CSII represents a cost-effective option in patients with type 2 diabetes who continue to have poorly-controlled HbA1c despite optimization of MDI. Since the ICER falls below the willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 80,000 per QALY gained, CSII is likely to represent good-value for money in the treatment of poorly-controlled T2D patients compared with MDI.","[Roze, S.; Duteil, E.] HEVA HEOR, Lyon, France; [Smith-Palmer, J.; Valentine, W.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland; [de Portu, S.] Medtron Int Sarl, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [de Brouwer, B.

A Markov model based on the natural history of CHC was used for a population that included treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Treatment alternatives considered for GT1 included ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvirribavirin (3DR), sofosbuvir+ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), sofosbuvir+simeprevir (SOF+SMV), simeprevir+pegylated interferon/ribavirin (SMV+PR) and no treatment (NT). For GT4 treatments, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir+ribavirin (2D+R), SOF/LDV and NT were compared. Transition probabilities, utilities and costs were obtained from published literature. Outcomes included rates of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related death (LrD), total costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Results: In GT1 patients, 3D +/- R and SOF-containing regimens have similar long-term outcomes; 3D +/- R had the lowest lifetime risks of all liver disease outcomes: CC =30.2%, DCC = 5.0%, HCC = 6.8%, LT =1.9% and LrD =9.2%. In GT1 patients, 3D +/- R had the lowest cost and the highest QALYs. As a result, 3D +/- R dominated these treatment options. In GT4 patients, 2D+R had lower rates of liver morbidity and mortality, lower cost and more QALYs than SOF/LDV and NT.Limitations: While the results are based on input values, which were obtained from a variety of heterogeneous sourcesincluding clinical trials, the findings were robust across a plausible range of input values, as demonstrated in probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Conclusions: Among currently recommended treatments for GT1 and GT4 in the US, 3D +/- R (for GT1) and 2D+R (for GT4) have a favorable cost-effectiveness profile.","[Saab, Sammy] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Pfleger Liver Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Parise, Helene; Virabhak, Suchin; Johnson, Scott] Medicus Econ LLC, Milton, MA USA; [Wang, Alice; Marx, Steven E.; Gonzalez, Yuri Sanchez; Misurski, Derek] AbbVie, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Mettawa, IL USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; AbbVie,"Wang, A (通讯作者)，AbbVie, Dept GMH1, Bldg ABV1 2nd Floor,26525 N Riverwoods Blvd, Mettawa, IL 60045 USA.",alice.wang@abbvie.com,,,AbbVie,AbbVie(AbbVie),"Design, analysis, and financial support of this study were provided by AbbVie.",,39,11,14,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Solution approaches have been proposed for different planning phases: strategic, tactical, operational, and real-time planning. In this paper we compare two approaches within the operational and real-time planning phase. The first exact approach is based on a known Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) which is solved using CPLEX. The second approach is a new method that is an extension of a recently introduced MILP, which is solved using a column and row generation approach. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of the methods on networks of two countries (Denmark and The Netherlands). We use the approaches to make daily schedules and we test their real time applicability by performing tests with different disruption scenarios. The computational experiments demonstrate that both models can be used on both networks and are able to find optimal rolling stock circulations in the different planning phases. Furthermore, the results show that both approaches are sufficiently fast to be used in a real-time setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although schedules and priori target methods introduce sladc time to delay buses at control points to maintain constant headways between successive buses, too much slack required delay passengers on-board. In addition, these methods focus on regular headways and do not consider the rates of convergence of headways after disturbances. We propose a self-adaptive control scheme to equalize the headways of buses with little slack in a single line automatically. The proposed method only requires the information from the current bus at the control point and both its leading and following buses. This elegant method is shown to regulate headways faster than existing methods. In addition, compared to previous self-equalizing methods, the proposed method can improve the travel time of buses by about 12%, while keeping the waiting time of passengers almost the same.

Methods: Retrospective analysis using healthcare claims from Truven MarketScan commercial, Medicare supplemental, and Medicaid multistate databases was performed. Patients prescribed IR hydrocodone during the 6-month baseline (July-December 2011), and with continuous enrollment during baseline and the 12-month follow-up (2012) were selected. HRU and per-patient-per-month (PPPM) costs (2014 US dollars) were assessed at follow-up. Descriptive analyses and multivariate regressions were conducted to compare HRU and costs at follow-up by days' supply (<60 vs >= 60 days) and average doses per month (<= 60 vs >60 doses/month) of IR hydrocodone at baseline. Results: In total, 1,698,845 commercial, 264,038 Medicare, and 151,063 Medicaid IR hydrocodone patients were identified. During follow-up, commercial patients with prior >= 60 days' supply were more likely to have an inpatient admission (13.2% vs 7.5%), outpatient hospital visit (69.1% vs 57.0%), office visit (97.6% vs 91.0%), emergency room (ER) visit (28.1% vs 21.4%), and had higher PPPM total costs ($1494 vs $842) than the <60 days' supply sub-group (all p<0.05). Among commercial patients the adjusted odds ratio for prior >= 60 days' supply of IR hydrocodone vs prior <60 days' supply was 1.62 (inpatient), 1.33 (outpatient), 2.58 (office visit) and 1.48 (ER) (all p-values <0.05). Adjusted all-cause total costs were higher ($1245 vs $851, p<0.05) among commercial patients with longer days' supply than those with shorter days' supply. Trends were similar with <= 60 vs >60 doses per month sub-groups and across all plan types. Conclusion: Increased days' supply and higher doses/month of IR hydrocodone in the prior 6 months may help to predict levels of HRU and costs in the following year, providing an opportunity to identify patients in order to implement interventions to improve their quality of care.","[Ben-Joseph, Rami; Bell, Jill A.; Holly, Pamela] Purdue Pharma LP, 201 Tresser Blvd, Stamford, CT 06901 USA; [Chitnis, Abhishek; Kansal, Anuraag; Paramore, Clark] Evidera, Lexington, MA USA; [Wild, Howard] MedImpact Healthcare Syst Inc, San Diego, CA USA",Purdue Pharma L.P.; Evidera,"Holly, P (通讯作者)，Purdue Pharma LP, 201 Tresser Blvd, Stamford, CT 06901 USA.",pamela.holly@pharma.com,,"Kansal, Anuraag/0000-0001-5609-1464",Purdue Pharma L.P.,Purdue Pharma L.P.,This manuscript was funded by Purdue Pharma L.P.,,19,0,0,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Based on the fact that in different countries there is no strict priority in conflicts between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, this study focused on analysis of the inherent mechanism of this universal phenomenon. By the analogy of a force model for moving vehicles, this paper developed a micro driving force model, including the safety driving force and efficiency driving force, for right-turn drivers which constitute the dominant party during the non-strict priority crossing process. We further demonstrate that the strict priority crossing behavior is a special case of the proposed driving force model. All the parameters used in this model were calibrated through field data collected at twelve signalized intersection sites in Shanghai. Model validation results proved the accuracy and reliability of the proposed driving force model. The model was further proved that it can be used for right-turn vehicle's average crossing speed prediction. The sensitivity analysis identified the influence of vehicle type, non-motorized traffic flow rate, and non-motorized traffic speed on the average speed, and offered support for the rationality of the non-strict priority.

The underlying data have been collected during large-scale peak avoidance experiment conducted in the Netherlands, in which participants could earn monetary rewards for traveling outside peak hours. The experiment included ca. 1000 participants and lasted for multiple months. Holders of an annual train pass were invited to join the experiment, and a customized smartphone app was used to measure the travel behavior of the participants. We find that compared to the pre-measurement, the relative share of peak trips decreased by 22% during the reward period, and by 10% during the post-measurement. By combining multiple complementary data sources, we are able to specify and estimate (MNL and panel latent class) departure time choice models. These yield plausible estimates for the monetary values that participants attach to reducing travel time, schedule delays, the number of transfers, crowdedness, and unreliability.

In fact, the identification of agricultural production with the territory, its peculiarities and its atmospheres generates a relationship that is mutually advantageous and that the consumer perceives and values. This binomial is the basis that has generated the PDOs, which represent a winning solution for the success of productions that are otherwise fragmented and have little market recognisability. A current debate that has spread to various wine-growing areas questions the advisability of introducing sub-zoning based on quality levels in order to better promote the typical characteristics of each territory. The objective of this paper is to verify whether the strategy of sub-zoning based on the quality diversification of productions could constitute an appropriate tool to further promote a territory's productions. Towards this end, we have developed a discrete choice experiment to compare a new Chianti Classico DOCG type of excellence with other 4 DOCG Tuscan Sangiovese wines. The results show that introducing this new typology into a territory that has already been awarded the DOCG certification can represent a valid development strategy for the firm, as well as for territories.

Furthermore, this strategy can be also considered necessary to guarantee the future development of the wine sector. Given that some wineries have stated that production costs are higher for sustainable wines than for conventional wines, the goal of this paper is to analyze the premium price that consumers are willing to pay for a sustainable wine with respect to the price of a conventional wine with similar characteristics. Contingent valuation has been used to test the differences in the willingness to pay for sustainable wines among the main Spanish wine market segments. Results reveal that most Spanish consumers are willing to pay a higher price for sustainable wines, and that there are differences among the main market segments. (C) 2016 The Authors.

By considering the ever greater presence of women managing Italian farms, the research tries to understand if and how women's role could be decisive also for the short food supply chain, and thus it analyzes some Campania case studies to verify if women can concretely promote the cultural and economical development of a specific area, by leading the agricultural system towards the well being sustainability.

Although persons and goods movements have different objectives and constraints, mixing their travels on the same network is within current trends. So we investigate in this paper how they could share a rapid transit network and use the available transportation capacity within a city more efficiently in an interconnected way. Based on the common characteristics of personal rapid transit (PRT) and freight rapid transit (FRT), this paper proposes an emergent and efficient transportation solution in order to enhance the sustainability of city logistics. Next, the operational level is focused on to characterize the dynamic transportation problem and to propose two strategies to formulate it. This problem aims to respond to the number of transportation requests arriving on a periodic basis with adequate service level while minimizing the empty movements of a set of electric vehicles with limited battery capacity. An efficient solution approach based on the forward optimization of periodic transportation sub-problems is proposed and validated. The applicability of the PRT-FRT mode is demonstrated and computational results in comparison to other transportation option is also presented and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For the case of independent link travel times, we show that the problem can be solved exactly by repeatedly solving a subproblem minimizing the sum of mean and variance of path travel time. The latter is an additive shortest path problem, and can be solved using a standard labeling algorithm. While these subproblems are similar in form to those obtained from Lagrangian relaxation, this formulation admits proof of finite convergence to the optimal solution. An iterative labeling algorithm is developed that solves the non-additive reliable path problem from a single origin to all destinations. Moreover, a labeling technique is employed to further reduce the computational time of the proposed algorithm by partially updating the network in each iteration. As an alternative, a bisection-type search algorithm is developed that solves the problem for the single-origin and single-destination case. Numerical tests are presented, indicating that the proposed algorithm outperform others recently proposed in the literature: unlike Lagrangian relaxation, two of the proposed algorithms find solutions exactly, and the computation time is an order of magnitude faster than outer approximation methods.

In the age of mass data, this paper proposes a nonparametric car-following model driven by field data. Different from most of the existing car-following models, neither driver's behaviour parameters nor fundamental diagrams are assumed in the data-driven model. The model is proposed based on the simple k-nearest neighbour, which outputs the average of the most similar cases, i.e., the most likely driving behaviour under the current circumstance. The inputs and outputs are selected, and the determination of the only parameter k is introduced. Three simulation scenarios are conducted to test the model. The first scenario is to simulate platoons following real leaders, where traffic waves with constant speed and the detailed trajectories are observed to be consistent with the empirical data. Driver's rubbernecking behaviour and driving errors are simulated in the second and third scenarios, respectively. The time-space diagrams of the simulated trajectories are presented and explicitly analysed. It is demonstrated that the model is able to well replicate periodic traffic oscillations from the precursor stage to the decay stage. Without making any assumption, the fundamental diagrams for the simulated scenario coincide with the empirical fundamental diagrams. These all validate that the model can well reproduce the traffic characteristics contained by the field data. The nonparametric car-following model exhibits traffic dynamics in a simple and parsimonious manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

(2014) to more accurately account for three realistic complications: signal offsets, queue spillbacks, and complex signal phasing schemes. The model extensions are derived theoretically based on signal cycle, green split, and offset, and are shown to approximate well traffic operations at signalized intersections treated using the traditional (and more realistic) on-and-off model. We propose a generalized continuum signal model, which explicitly handles complex vehicle spillback patterns on signalized networks with provable error estimates. Under mild conditions, the errors are small and bounded by fixed values that do not grow with time. Overall, this represents a significant improvement over the original continuum model, which had errors that grew quickly with time in the presence of any queue spillbacks and for which errors were not explicitly derived for different offset cases. Thus, the new model is able to more accurately approximate traffic dynamics in large networks with multiple signals under more realistic conditions. We also qualitatively describe how this new model can be applied to several realistic intersection configurations that might be encountered in typical urban networks. These include intersections with multiple entry and exit links, complex signal phasing, all-red times, and the presence of dedicated turning lanes. Numerical tests of the models show remarkable consistency with the on-and-off model, as expected from the theory, with the added benefit of significant computational savings and higher signal control resolution when using the continuum model.

However, there has been no unified approach to deriving such models, analyzing their relationships and properties, and extending them for networks. In this paper, we derive point queue models as limits of two link-based queueing model: the link transmission model and a link queue model. With two definitions for demand and supply of a point queue, we present four point queue models, four approximate models, and their discrete versions. We discuss the properties of these models, including equivalence, well-definedness, smoothness, and queue spillback, both analytically and with numerical examples. We then analytically solve Vickrey's point queue model and stationary states in various models. We demonstrate that all existing point and fluid queue models in the literature are special cases of those derived from the link-based queueing models. Such a unified approach leads to systematic methods for studying the queueing process at a point facility and will also be helpful for studies on stochastic queues as well as networks of queues.

A three-line sequence including two generic (oxybutynin first line and tolterodine extended-release second line) and one branded drug (solifenacin 5 mg third line) resulted in inferior patient outcomes at costs similar to a sequence of branded drugs (mirabegron first line, solifenacin 5mg second line, solifenacin 10 mg third line): controlled patients (generic 29.6/1000 vs branded 38.7/1000); patients with no incontinence episodes (103.6/1000 vs 123.7/1000); patients with <8 micturitions (228.7/1000 vs 262.1/1000). Annual treatment costs per patient were similar (generic 1299 pound vs branded 1385) pound. Conclusions: In the treatment of OAB, low-cost generic treatments are not necessarily more cost-effective than branded drugs, primarily because a better efficacy and tolerability balance improves both symptom control and persistence.","[Nazir, Jameel; Odeyemi, Isaac A.; Garnham, Andrew] Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd, Chertsey KT16 0RS, Surrey, England; [Posnett, John; Walker, Anna] PAREXEL, Heron Commercializat, London, England; [Hakimi, Zalmai] Astellas Pharma Global Dev, Leiden, Netherlands",Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Nazir, J (通讯作者)，Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd, 2000 Hillswood Dr, Chertsey KT16 0RS, Surrey, England.",jameel.nazir@astellas.com,"Hakimi, Zalmai/AAZ-5620-2021",,"Astellas Pharma Europe, Ltd.","Astellas Pharma Europe, Ltd.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals)","The model described was developed by HERON Commercialisation, PAREXEL, with funding from Astellas Pharma Europe, Ltd.

Patients experiencing VTE have heightened risk of recurrence. Initial parenteral anti-coagulation is standard therapy for acute VTE followed by >= 3 months of warfarin, which introduces the risk of major bleeding. Balancing increased risks of bleeding and recurrent VTE remains challenging. Recent clinical trials suggest that rivaroxaban, an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa, provides an effective, safe, simplified approach to treatment. This study considers the economic implications of these data. Methods: This study modeled inpatient, acute, and 1-year VTE costs for a hypothetical commercial plan with 1 million members. At baseline, all VTE patients receive standard therapy. Alternatively, 25% are instead treated with rivaroxaban. Model inputs are trial-and literature-based. Results: Standard therapy for VTE consumes 9474 inpatient days ($31.6 million). Added to that is treatment for 74 recurrences ($1.4 million); major and non-major bleed events ($1 million); and direct costs of anticoagulation ($5.3 million). Alternatively, a 25% shift to oral anti-coagulation with rivaroxaban reduces inpatient days (by 5%); associated acute-care costs (by 2%); recurrences and costs (by 6%). Four major bleeding events are prevented, at the cost of one additional non-major bleeding event, which, taken together, reduce net utilization by 9%. Direct costs of anti-coagulation increase by 5%. Conclusion: The reduction in inpatient utilization, recurrences, and major bleeding resulting from a 25% shift from standard therapy to rivaroxaban following acute VTE would conserve similar to$860,475 for every 1 million commercial health plan enrollees.","[Patel, Aarti A.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA; [Ogden, Kristine] ICON Hlth Econ, San Francisco, CA USA; [Mody, Samir H.; Bookhart, Brahim] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; ICON plc; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Ogden, K (通讯作者)，ICON Plc, 465 Montgomery St,Suite 2200, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA.",kristine.ogden@iconplc.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC; Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.","This research was supported by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,0,3,3,0,1,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Since sea vessels are drastically more fuel efficient when traveling at lower speeds, slow steaming has become a widely adopted practice to reduce bunker costs. However, this leads to a longer transportation time, which together with the unpredictability of the delay has been a big challenge. We propose a model to quantify the relationship among shipping time, bunker cost and delivery reliability.

Furthermore, the TRYPHAENA trial supported the benefit of neoadjuvant dual anti-HER2 therapy. Survival data from these trials is not yet available; however, other studies have demonstrated a correlation between pCR and improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in this patient population. This study represents the first Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive eBC. Methods: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted using a three health state Markov model ('event-free', 'relapsed', and 'dead'). Two separate analyses were conducted; the first considering total pCR (ypT0/is ypN0) data from NeoSphere, and the second from TRYPHAENA. Published EFS and OS data partitioned for patients achieving/not achieving pCR were used in combination with the percentage achieving pCR in the pertuzumab trials to estimate survival. This CUA included published utility values and direct medical costs including drugs, treatment administration, management of adverse events, supportive care, and subsequent therapy. To address uncertainty, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and alternative scenarios were explored. Results: Both analyses suggested that the addition of pertuzumab resulted in increased life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost per QALY ranged from $25,388 (CAD; NeoSphere analysis) to $46,196 (TRYPHAENA analysis). Sensitivity analyses further support the use of pertuzumab, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $9230-$64,421. At a threshold of $100,000, the addition of pertuzumab was cost-effective in nearly all scenarios (93% NeoSphere; 79% TRYPHAENA). Conclusion: Given the improvement in clinical efficacy and a favorable cost per QALY, the addition of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting represents an attractive treatment option for HER2-positive eBC patients.","[Attard, C.

Demand origins, destinations and crosswalks comprise a pedestrian crossing network. An integrated model for optimizing the quantity, locations and signal settings of mid-block crosswalks simultaneously is proposed to best trade-off the operational performances between pedestrians and vehicles. Pedestrian behavior of choosing crosswalks is captured under a discrete demand distribution. Detour distance and delay at signalized crosswalks are formulated as a measure of pedestrian crossing cost. Maximum bandwidths are modeled in analytical expressions as a measure of vehicular cost. To solve the proposed model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) based algorithm is designed and employed to obtain the Pareto frontier efficiently. From the numerical study, it is found that there exists an optimal number of mid-block crosswalks. Excess available crosswalks may make no contributions to improvement in pedestrian cost when the constraint of the minimum interval between crosswalks and vehicular cost are taken into account. Two-stage crosswalks are more favorable than one-stage ones for the benefits of both pedestrian and vehicles. The study results show promising properties of the proposed method to assist transportation engineers in properly designing mid-block crosswalks along a road segment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of lixisenatide versus bolus insulin, both in combination with basal insulin, in patients with type 2 diabetes in Norway. Methods: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model, a non-product-specific and validated simulation model, was used to make clinical and cost projections. Transition probabilities, risk adjustments and the progression of complication risk factors were derived from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, supplemented with Norwegian data. Patients were assumed to receive combination treatment with basal insulin, lixisenatide or bolus insulin therapy for 3 years, followed by intensification of a basal-bolus insulin regimen for their remaining lifetime. Simulated healthcare costs, taken from the public payer perspective, were derived from microcosting and diagnosis related groups, discounted at 4% per annum and reported in Norwegian krone (NOK). Productivity costs were also captured based on extractions from the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration. Health state utilities were derived from a systematic literature review. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. Results: Lixisenatide in combination with basal insulin was associated with increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and reduced lifetime healthcare costs compared to bolus insulin in combination with basal insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes, and can be considered dominant. The net monetary benefit of lixisenatide versus bolus insulin was NOK 39,369 per patient. Results were sensitive to discounting, the application of excess body weight associated disutility and uncertainty surrounding the changes in HbA1c. Conclusions: Lixisenatide may be considered an economically efficient therapy in combination with basal insulin in the Norwegian setting, due to cost savings, weight loss and associated gains in health-related quality of life.","[Huetson, Pernilla] IMS Hlth, Stockholm, Sweden; [Palmer, James L.] IMS Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Levorsen, Andree] Sanofi, Lysaker, Norway; [Fournier, Marie; Germe, Maeva] Sanofi, Paris, France; [McLeod, Euan] IMS Hlth, London, England",Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi France,"Fournier, M (通讯作者)，1 Ave Pierre Brossolette, F-91385 Chilly Mazarin, France.",Marie.Fournier@sanofi.com,,"Fournier, Marie/0000-0002-3805-1706",,,,,0,12,13,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

LDVRP is applicable for transportation activities where the weight of the transported cargo accounts for a significant part of the vehicle gross weight. Contrary to the basic VRP which calls for the minimization of the distance travelled, the LDVRP objective is aimed at minimizing the total product of the distance travelled and the gross weight carried along this distance. Thus, it is capable of producing sensible routing plans which take into account the variation of the cargo weight along the vehicle trips. The LDVRP objective is closely related to the total energy requirements of the vehicle fleet, making it a credible alternative when the environmental aspects of transportation activities are examined and optimized. A novel LDVRP extension which considers simultaneous pick-up and delivery service is introduced, formulated and solved for the first time. To deal with large-scale instances of the examined problems, we propose a local-search algorithm. Towards an efficient implementation, the local-search algorithm employs a computational scheme which calculates the complex weighted-distance objective changes in constant time. Solution results are presented for both problems on a variety of well-known test cases demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach. The structure of the obtained LDVRP and VRP solutions is compared in pursuit of interesting conclusions on the relative suitability of the two routing models, when the decision maker must deal with the weighted distance objective. In addition, results of a branch-and-cut procedure for small-scale instances of the LDVRP with simultaneous pick-ups and deliveries are reported.

The approach assigns paths to users so as to minimize congestion while not increasing their travel inconvenience too much. A maximum level of travel inconvenience is ensured and a certain level of fairness is maintained by limiting the set of considered paths for each Origin-Destination pair to those whose relative difference with respect to the shortest (least-duration) path, called travel inconvenience, is below a given threshold. The approach hierarchically minimizes the maximum arc utilization and the weighted average experienced travel inconvenience. Minimizing the maximum arc utilization in the network, i.e., the ratio of the number of vehicles entering an arc per time unit and the maximum number of vehicles per time unit at which vehicles can enter the arc and experience no slowdown due to congestion effects, is a system-oriented objective, while minimizing the weighted average experienced travel inconvenience, i.e., the average travel inconvenience over all eligible paths weighted by the number of vehicles per time unit that traverse the path, is a user-oriented objective. By design, to ensure computational efficiency, the approach only solves linear programming models. In a computational study using benchmark instances reflecting a road infrastructure encountered in many cities, we analyze, for different levels of maximum travel inconvenience and, the minimum maximum arc utilization and the weighted average experienced travel inconvenience. We find that accepting relatively small levels of maximum travel inconvenience can result in a significant reduction, or avoiding, of congestion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The model features complementary networks, scheduling, price elastic demands, and demand uncertainty. For the case of a given number of vehicles, the analysis shows that carrier collaboration increases vehicle sizes (thus, fleet capacity) if marginal seat costs are low while fleet capacity remains unchanged if marginal seat costs are high. If both vehicle sizes and vehicle numbers can be varied, then collaboration will always increase vehicle numbers and fleet capacity, while the effects on vehicle sizes and, thus, also load factors, are ambiguous and therewith hard to predict. Numerical simulations indicate that collaboration increases expected load factors also when the number of vehicles is endogenous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The COSDM optimizes shipping network design and fleet deployment simultaneously, and it optimizes plans for changing the shipping network and for distributing slots in ships based on the fluctuation in demand and the characteristics of the shippers' choice inertia. To solve COSDM, a heuristic algorithm is created that combines Genetic Algorithm and Simplex Method. The results show that the COSDM gives an optimized design scheme of the system that takes into account the stability of transportation services and improves the user experience of shippers while increasing the revenue of the liner company.

We first develop a new user equilibrium model to describe the equilibrium flow distribution across a road network where charging lanes are deployed. Drivers of electric vehicles, when traveling between their origins and destinations, are assumed to select routes and decide battery recharging plans to minimize their trip times while ensuring to complete their trips without running out of charge. The battery recharging plan will dictate which charging lane to use, how long to charge and at what speed to operate an electric vehicle. The speed will affect the amount of energy recharged as well as travel time. With the established user equilibrium conditions, we further formulate the deployment of charging lanes as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. Both the network equilibrium and design models are solved by effective solution algorithms and demonstrated with numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We then relax the single output restriction and propose a multi-unit multi-attribute double auction (M-MDA) for PSCT in which each supplier offers multiple units of one item.

As shown through analytical relationships, model residuals dynamics are preserved if discrepancy measures of a model against reality are calculated on a cumulative variable, rather than on the variable itself. Keeping memory of model residuals occurrence times is essential in traffic flow modelling where the ability of reproducing the dynamics of a phenomenon - as a bottleneck evolution or a vehicle deceleration profile - may count as much as the ability of reproducing its order of magnitude. According to the aforesaid finding, in a car-following models context, calibration on travelled space is more robust than calibration on speed or acceleration. Similarly in case of macroscopic traffic flow models validation and calibration, cumulative flows are to be preferred to flows. Actually, the findings above hold for any dynamic model.

The objective of this analysis was to analyze the impact of ivacaftor on health resource utilization through analysis of claims data. Methods: Patients diagnosed with CF aged >= 6 years prescribed ivacaftor between January 1, 2012 and July 31, 2014 with >= 12 months of continuous insurance coverage prior to and following the prescription were identified. All-cause and CF-specific healthcare resource utilization during the pre- and post-prescription periods and ivacaftor adherence levels were studied. Results: The 79 identified patients had a mean age of 20.8 years, and 54% were female. The proportion of patients with inpatient admissions (all-cause and CF-related) was significantly higher in the pre index compared to post index period (p <= 0.05). Mean ivacaftor medication possession ratio was 0.8 (SD=0.3), and 73% of patients had a medication possession ratio >0.80. Limitations: Only a small number of patients met the inclusion criteria. Additionally, claims data may contain errors or inconsistencies and cannot be used to determine if medications were taken as prescribed.

This paper investigates the Pareto-improving transportation network design problem under various ownership regimes by allowing joint choice of road pricing and capacity enhancement on free links. The problem of interest is formulated as a bio-bjective mathematical programming model that considers the travel cost of road users in each origin-destination pair and the investment return of the whole network. The non-dominated Pareto-improving solutions of toll and/or capacity enhancement schemes are sought for achieving a win-win situation. A sufficient,condition is provided for the existence of the non-dominated Pareto-improving schemes and then the properties of those schemes are analyzed. It is found that, under some mild assumptions, the optimal capacity enhancement is uniquely determined by the link flow under any non-dominated Pareto-improving scheme. As a result, the joint road pricing and- capacity enhancement problem reduces to a bi-objective second-best road pricing problem. A revenue distribution mechanism with return rate guarantee is proposed to implement the non-dominated Pareto-improving schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There is an urgent need for governments, industries, general public, and academics to take coordinated actions in order to tackle the challenges imposed by the climate change. It is essential to incorporate the environmental objective in the transportation mode selection problem as transportation is a main contributor to carbon emissions. With this in mind, our paper studies the retailer's ordering and transportation mode selection problem using stochastic customer demand and investigates the optimal ordering and transportation mode selection decisions under different carbon emission reduction policies. Our analytical results reveal that there are some important transportation mode shifting thresholds under different carbon emissions reduction policies. These findings do not only help firms to make optimal decisions under different carbon emission reduction policies but also support policy makers to develop effective policies on carbon emissions reduction.

A new powerful adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic is developed and successfully applied to a large pool of new benchmark instances. Extensive analyses are performed to empirically assess the effect of various problem parameters, such as depot cost and location, customer distribution and heterogeneous vehicles on key performance indicators, including fuel consumption, emissions and operational costs.

Whether the higher cost of posaconazole is offset by decreases in IFDs in a given institute requires cost-effective analysis encompassing the spectrum of IFDs and socioeconomic factors specific to that geographic area.Methods:This study performed a cost-effective analysis of posaconazole prophylaxis for IFDs in an Asian teaching hospital, employing decision modeling and data of IFDs and medication costs specific to the institute, in neutropenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).Results:In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the higher cost of posaconazole was partially offset by a reduction in the cost of treating IFDs that were prevented, resulting in an incremental cost of 125,954 Hong Kong dollars/16,148 USD per IFD avoided. Over a lifetime horizon, assuming same case fatality rate of IFDs in both groups, use of posaconazole results in 0.07 discounted life years saved. This corresponds to an incremental cost of 116,023 HKD/14,875 USD per life year saved. This incremental cost per life year saved in posaconazole prophylaxis fulfilled the World Health Organization defined threshold for cost-effectiveness.Conclusion:Posaconazole prophylaxis was cost-effective in Hong Kong.","[Chan, Thomas S.

Two main approaches address food security: the environmental approach seeks to establish a sustainable food system, and the social justice approach aims to eliminate poverty. These two approaches correspond to the two main dimensions of food security: the production and supply of an adequate quality and quantity of food, and the ability of people to access food. I will document the history of the Urban Farmers, a grassroots organization in Lafayette, California, which endeavoured to address both issues of poverty and sustainability in a community-development approach to food security.

We add to the base model optimal stop spacing and train length, a crowding penalty, and a multi-period generalization. These extensions are analytically solvable by simple approximations and lead to meaningful insights. Their significance is illustrated by means of an example in which two road modes and two rail modes are defined by a set of techno-economical parameters. These parameters loaded in the base model yield dominance of road modes for all but the largest demand levels. We consistently keep this set of parameters for all models, and show how the break-even points between road and rail modes progressively recede toward lower demand levels when model refinements not parameter changes - are applied. Scenario analyses of plausible parameter sets highlight the model's versatility, and caution on general conclusions regarding technology dominance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Green areas play a key role in improving well-being perceived by the citizens in urban contexts. The direct and indirect experience with nature helps to reduce psychophysical stress, induces positive emotions, and facilitates renewal of cognitive resources. An example of this is represented by Pinus pinea L. (Italian stone pine) forests located within or around urban areas. These pinewoods were originally diffused in Mediterranean region to produce wood, pine kernels for alimentary purposes and -in coastal areas -to protect dunes and agricultural territories. However, land use change and coastal urbanization modified their principal functions: while productive function has been gradually reduced, they become important elements of the urban landscape contributing to human well-being with a wide range of cultural services. With increasing interest in the use of urban green space to promote human health, it is interesting to analyze if and to what extent different natural settings, as well as restoration components influence well-being by disentangling the effect on physical and psychological benefits. The aim of this paper is to explore the effect of experience variables and restoration components on individuals' physical and psychological wellbeing. A quantile regression approach was used for data analysis. This approach allows us to understand what happens throughout the entire distribution of psychological and physical well-being reported by visitors of pinewoods and, in particular, at its extremes. Our results show that the effect of the selected covariates is different both throughout the distribution of the dependent variable and between psychological and physical subjective well-being.

We develop a hypergraph-based, two-level approach to sequentially minimize passenger and freight costs while scheduling train services. Passenger schedule delay and freight lost demand are explicitly modeled. We explore different solution strategies and conclude that a problem-tailored linearized reformulation yields superior computational performance. Using realistic parameter values, our numerical experiments show that passenger cost due to schedule delay is comparable to in-vehicle travel time cost and rail fare. In most cases, marginal freight cost increase from scheduling more passenger trains is higher than marginal reduction in passenger schedule delay cost. The heterogeneity of train speed reduces the number of freight trains that can run on a corridor. Greater tolerance for delays could reduce lost demand and overall cost on the freight side. The approach developed in the paper could be applied to other scenarios with different parameter values. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a real-time holding mechanism is proposed to dispatch buses on a loop-shaped route using real-time information. Holds are applied at one or several control points to minimize passenger waiting time while maintaining the highest possible frequency, i.e. using no buffer time. The bus dispatching problem is formulated as a stochastic decision process. The optimality equations are derived and the optimal holding policy is found by backward induction. A control method that requires much less information and that closely approximates the optimal dispatching policy is found. A simulation assuming stochastic operating conditions and unstable headway dynamics is performed to assess the expected average waiting time of passengers at stations. The proposed control strategy is found to provide lower passenger waiting time and better resiliency than methods used in practice and recommended in the literature.

We present an infinite-dimensional variational inequality (VI) formulation that is equivalent to the conditions defining a continuous-time E-DUE problem. An existence result for this VI is established by applying a fixed-point existence theorem (Browder, 1968) in an extended Hilbert space. We present three computational algorithms based on the aforementioned VI and its re-expression as a differential variational inequality (DVI): a projection method, a self-adaptive projection method, and a proximal point method. Rigorous convergence results are provided for these methods, which rely on increasingly relaxed notions of generalized monotonicity, namely mixed strongly-weakly monotonicity for the projection method; pseudomonotonicity for the self-adaptive projection method, and quasimonotonicity for the proximal point method. These three algorithms are tested and their solution quality, convergence, and computational efficiency are compared. Our convergence results, which transcend the transportation applications studied here, apply to a broad family of Vls and DVIs, and are the weakest reported to date. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One area where evacuation modeling and analysis has lacked is in the ability to determine the specific evacuation travel demand and capacity and conditions under which a road network can most effectively carry the maximum outflow rate for an area under threat of catastrophic disasters. This is a difficult question to answer because evacuations are so complex and can include millions of people, traveling on tens of thousands of miles of roads, lasting several hours or even days in duration. Knowledge of how to reduce the likelihood of over-saturation would be useful, for example, to develop temporally and spatially phased evacuation plans that meter demand into the system for maximum overall benefit. In this paper an optimization model is proposed to maximize evacuation throughput traffic for regional networks. This model aims at optimizing network outflow and trip complete percentage at a macroscopic level by changing the distribution of evacuation traffic in the time horizon. The productivity function, pioneered by Geroliminis and Daganzo (2007, 2008) is used to assess network performance from a macroscopic point of view. Then, an optimization model with the objective of maximizing both total network productivity and outflow rate is proposed. Further, a simulation based study of the New Orleans metropolitan area is used to validate the effectiveness of the optimization model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A route's TTB is defined as this route's mean travel time plus a travel time margin, which is the route travel time's standard deviation multiplied with a factor. The TTB model violates the Bellman's Principle of Optimality (BPO), making it difficult to solve it in any large stochastic and time-dependent network. Moreover, it is found that if path travel time distributions are skewed, the conventional TTB model cannot reflect travelers' heterogeneous risk-taking behavior in route choice. This paper proposes to use the upper or lower semi-standard deviation to replace the standard deviation in the conventional TTB model (the new models are called derived ITB models), because these derived TTB models can well capture such heterogeneous risk-taking behavior when the path travel time distributions are skewed. More importantly, this paper shows that the optimal solutions of these two derived TTB models must be non-dominated paths under some specific stochastic dominance (SD) rules. These finding opens the door to solve these derived TTB models efficiently in large stochastic and time-dependent networks. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate these findings.

This paper develops a methodology to measure relationships of density and vehicle spacing on freeways. These relationships are central to most traffic flow theories but have historically been difficult to measure empirically. The work leads to macroscopic flow-density and microscopic speed-spacing relationships in the congested regime derived entirely from dual loop detector data and then verified against the NGSIM data set. The methodology eliminates the need to seek out stationary conditions and yields clean relationships that do not depend on prior assumptions of the curve shape before fitting the data. Upon review of the clean empirical relationships a key finding of this work is the fact that many of the critical parameters of the macroscopic flow-density and microscopic speed-spacing relationships depend on vehicle length, e.g., upstream moving waves should travel through long vehicles faster than through short vehicles. Thus, the commonly used assumption of a homogeneous vehicle fleet likely obscures these important phenomena. More broadly, if waves travel faster or slower depending on the length of the vehicles through which the waves pass, then the way traffic is modeled should be updated to explicitly account for inhomogeneous vehicle lengths.

The adopted model came from an elementary thought where drivers associate subjective utilities for accelerations (i.e. gain in travel times) and subjective dis-utilities for decelerations (i.e. loss in travel time) with a perceived probability of being involved in rear-end collision crashes. Following the testing of the model general structure, the authors translate the corresponding behavioral psychology theory - prospect theory - into an efficient microscopic traffic modeling with more elaborate stochastic characteristics considered in a risk-taking environment. After model formulation, we explore different model disaggregate and aggregate characteristics making sure that fidelity is kept in terms of equilibrium properties. Significant effort is then dedicated to calibrating and validating the model using microscopic trajectory data. A modified genetic algorithm is adopted for this purpose while focusing on capturing inter-driver heterogeneity for each of the parameters. Using the calibration exercise as a starting point, simulation sensitivity analysis is performed to reproduce different fundamental diagram regions and to explore rear-end collisions related properties. In terms of fundamental diagram regions, the model in hand is able to capture traffic breakdowns and different instabilities in the congested region represented by flow-density data points scattering. In terms of incident related measures, the effect of heterogeneity in both psychological factors and execution/perception errors on the accidents number and their distribution is studied. Through sensitivity analysis, correlations between the crash-penalty, the negative coefficient associated with losses in speed, the positive coefficient associated with gains in speed, the driver's uncertainty, the anticipation time and the reaction time are retrieved. The formulated model offers a better understanding of driving behavior, particularly under extreme/incident conditions. (C)) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the problem for vessels operating in the spot market in a tramp mode. In the case of known freight rates between origin destination combinations, a dynamic programming formulation can be applied to determine both the optimal speed and the optimal voyage sequence. Analogous results are derived for random freight rates of known distributions. In the case of independent rates the economic speed depends on fuel price and the expected freight rate, but is independent of the revenue of the particular voyage. For freight rates that depend on a state of the market Markovian random variable, economic speed depends on the market state as well, with increased speed corresponding to good states of the market. The dynamic programming equations in our models differ from those of Markovian decision processes so we develop modifications of standard solution methods, and apply them to small examples.

Methods: Electronic patient data from 479 general practices in the UK (THIN database) were examined for new users of glargine (n - 794), detemir (n - 252), or NPH insulin (n - 430). Annualized healthcare costs and clinical outcomes in years 1, 2, and 3 following insulin initiation were quantified and compared with baseline, using ANOVA and linear regression models. Results: A significant difference (p<0.05) in total healthcare costs increases at year 1 vs baseline was observed between glargine and detemir, detemir and NPH, but not between glargine and NPH (increase: +486 pound, +635 pound, and +420 pound for glargine, detemir, and NPH users, respectively). However, increases by year 3 were not significantly different between the insulins. A propensity score analysis comparing analog and NPH insulin showed that, following insulin initiation, increases in costs were higher with insulin analogs at year one (+220) pound, but this difference decreased over time in each year following insulin initiation (+168 pound and +146 pound, respectively, for years 2 and 3). HbA1c reductions were not significantly different between the groups at all time points. Differences in weight gain between glargine and NPH were statistically significant at year 1 (0.87 kg vs 1.11 kg) and year 3 (1.15 kg vs 1.57 kg), but other estimates of between-group differences in weight gain were non-significant. Conclusions: Following insulin initiation, the difference in healthcare costs of long-acting analogs compared to NPH insulin was transient. By year 3, the cost differences were not significantly different between the two cohorts, driven by an observed reduction in the cost of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the analog group and an increase in the cost of bolus insulin in the NPH group.","[Idris, Iskandar] Univ Nottingham, Div Med Sci & Grad Entry Med, Derby DE22 3NE, England; [Gordon, Jason] Univ Adelaide, Dept Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Gordon, Jason] HEOR Consulting Ltd, Monmouth, England; [Tilling, Carl] Sanofi, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Vora, Jiten] Royal Liverpool Univ Hosp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Nottingham; University of Adelaide; Sanofi-Aventis; University of Liverpool; Royal Liverpool & Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust; Royal Liverpool University Hospital,"Idris, I (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Royal Derby Hosp, Diabet Med, Derby DE22 3NE, England.",iskandar.idris@nottingham.ac.uk,,,"Sanofi, the manufacturer of Lantus","Sanofi, the manufacturer of Lantus","This study was funded by Sanofi, the manufacturer of Lantus.",,0,4,5,0,3,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, there lack general continuous formulations of LTM, and there has been no systematic study on its analytical properties such as stationary states and stability of network traffic flow. In this study we attempt to fill the gaps. First we apply the Hopf-Lax formula to derive Newell's simplified kinematic wave model with given boundary cumulative flows and the triangular fundamental diagram. We then apply the Hopf-Lax formula to define link demand and supply functions, as well as link queue and vacancy functions, and present two continuous formulations of LTM, by incorporating boundary demands and supplies as well as invariant macroscopic junction models. With continuous LTM, we define and solve the stationary states in a road network. We also apply LTM to directly derive a Poincare map to analyze the stability of stationary states in a diverge-merge network. Finally we present an example to show that LTM is not well-defined with non-invariant junction models. We can see that Newell's model and continuous LTM complement each other and provide an alternative formulation of the network kinematic wave theory. This study paves the way for further extensions, analyses, and applications of LTM in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Data from the MarketScan and PharmMetrics databases between January 2000 and March 2013 were extracted. Patients who had received at least one diagnosis of GIST, had undergone a primary surgery for GIST, and had received at least one prescription for imatinib were included in the analysis. An algorithm was applied to identify those who had a subsequent GIST recurrence. Patients who experienced a recurrence and those who did not have a recurrence were compared for differences in healthcare utilization measures and healthcare costs within 6 months after the recurrence, while adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: A total of 540 patients with primary resectable GIST who received imatinib adjuvant therapy were identified, including 444 (82.2%) patients who did not experience GIST recurrence and 96 (17.8%) patients who did experience recurrence. Patients who experienced GIST recurrence utilized significantly more healthcare resources in all categories than patients who did not have a recurrence, including the number of hospitalizations, days of hospitalization, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, and other medical services (all p-values <0.01). The total healthcare cost was significantly higher for patients with GIST recurrence, with a difference of $4464 per patient per month (p<0.01). Both the medical and pharmacy costs were significantly higher with adjusted differences of $3488 and $1423 per patient per month, respectively (both p-values <0.01). Conclusions: Patients who had GIST recurrence after surgical resection incurred significantly more healthcare resource utilization and greater healthcare costs within 6 months after the recurrence than patients who did not have recurrence. These findings suggest that GIST recurrence is associated with a substantial economic burden.","[Guerin, Annie; Gauthier, Genevieve; Wu, Eric Q.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Sasane, Medha; Keir, Christopher H.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis,"Guerin, A (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 1000 Rue Gauchetiere Ouest,Bur 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",Annie.Guerin@analysisgroup.com,,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),"This research was sponsored by the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, which manufactures imatinib.",,0,7,7,0,5,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Research design and methods: Rates of psychotic, depressive, and/or manic relapses and serious and non-serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were obtained from the long-term paliperidone palmitate vs placebo relapse prevention study. The total annual medical cost for a relapse from a US payer perspective was obtained from published literature and the costs for serious and non-serious TEAEs were based on Common Procedure Terminology codes. Total annual medical cost differences for patients treated with PP1M vs placebo were then estimated. Additionally, one-way and Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Lower rates of relapse (-18.3%) and serious TEAEs (-3.9%) were associated with use of PP1M vs placebo as reported in the long-term paliperidone palmitate vs placebo relapse prevention study. As a result of the reduction in these clinical event rates, the total annual medical cost was reduced by $7140 per patient treated with PP1M vs placebo. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that variations in relapse rates had the greatest impact on the estimated medical cost differences (range: -$ 9786, -$ 4670). Of the 10,000 random cycles of Monte Carlo simulations, 100% showed a medical cost difference <$0 (reduction) for patients using PPIM vs placebo. The average total annual medical differences per patient were -$8321 for PP1M monotherapy and -$6031 for PPIM adjunctive therapy. Conclusions: Use of PP1M for treatment of patients with schizoaffective disorder was associated with a significantly lower rate of relapse and a reduction in medical costs compared to placebo. Further evaluation in the real-world setting is warranted.","[Joshi, K.] Janssen Sci Affairs, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Titusville, NJ 08560 USA; [Lin, J.; Lingohr-Smith, M.] Novosys Hlth, Green Brook, NJ USA; [Fu, D.

The objective of the present analysis is to determine whether earlier use of iNO in this cohort leads to lower cost of medical care. Methods: We used a decision-analytic model, which was developed to compare hospital resource use and costs associated with early versus standard use of iNO in HRF. The model population included infants with moderate HRF caused by primary pulmonary hypertension with an OI >= 15 and <= 20. A hypothetical case population of 1000 patients was assumed and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were completed where all the clinical inputs into the model were varied. Two deterministic sensitivity analyses were also completed, one surrounding the hospital cost inputs and another surrounding the cost of iNO. Results: Early iNO was associated with fewer hospital days, fewer days of ventilation and fewer hours on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, total costs per patient were $88,518 +/- $ 7574 and $ 92,581 +/- $ 9664 for early iNO and standard iNO, respectively. The probability of early iNO being cost-effective was approximately 72%, based on a willingness to pay $ 100,000 or less to prevent ECMO therapy and/or death. In both deterministic sensitivity analyses, early iNO was cost-saving. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that early use of iNO at an OI of >= 15 and <20 may be associated with shorter hospitalizations and a decreased cost of care for term/late preterm infants with HRF associated with pulmonary hypertension. Our results are based on clinical data from a single trial; future research using data from real-world practice is warranted.","[Konduri, G.

This study investigated the relative burden in terms of HRQoL and utilities of nocturia in a real-world setting. Methods: Patient data were collected from two surveys: a nocturia-specific, cross-sectional survey of physicians and their patients (DSP), and a general UK population health survey (HSFE). Utilities (EQ-5D-5L), productivity (Work Productivity and Activity Index), and the impact of nocturia symptoms (Nocturia Impact Diary and Overactive Bladder Questionnaires) were assessed against the number of voids. A robust linear regression model with propensity score weights was used to control for confounding factors in estimating utilities. Results: Physician-recorded data were available from 8,738 patients across the US, Germany, Spain, France, and the UK; of these, 5,335 (61%) included patient-reported outcomes. In total, 6,302 controls were drawn from the two surveys and compared to 1,104 nocturia patients. Deterioration of HRQoL was associated with increasing number of night-time voids (p<0.0001). In particular, significant differences were observed between 0-1 and 2 voids (p<0.001). The regression model demonstrated that nocturia (>= 2 per night) is associated with a modest but significant deterioration in utility of 0.0134 (p<0.05). Limitations: The cause of nocturia is multifactorial and the mostly elderly patients may have several concomitant diseases. The authors tried to adjust for the most common ones, but there may be diseases or unknown relationships not included. Conclusions: Nocturia negatively affected HRQoL and patient utility. A clear effect is seen already at two voids per night.

Differing from the long-term strategic problems including the two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), the two-echelon location routing problem (2E-LRP) and the truck and trailer routing problem (TTRP) which make location decisions in depots or satellites, the paper introduces a short-term tactical problem named the two-echelon time-constrained vehicle routing problem in linehaul-delivery systems (2E-TVRP) that does not involve location decisions. The line haul level and the delivery level are linked through city distribution centers (CDCs) located on the outskirts of cities. The 2E-TVRP has inter-CDC linehaul on the first level and urban delivery from CDCs to satellites on the second level. Vehicle routes on different levels are interacted by time constraints. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model for the 2E-TVRP is put forward, and a mixed integer linear programming model is used as the benchmark model. The Clarke and Wright savings heuristic algorithm (CW) improved by a local search phase is adopted. The 2E-TVRP formulations and the heuristic algorithm are tested by using 140 randomly-generated instances with up to 10 CDCs and 500 satellites. The computational results indicate that the heuristic can effectively solve various instances of the 2E-TVRP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm assigns phases with associated delays, taking into account the vehicle travelers' values for experienced delay. Applying principles of envy-freeness, we develop a pricing scheme that addresses fairness by minimizing user envy via compensatory monetary transfers among users. PEXIC is Pareto efficient and budget balanced, and thus financially self-sustainable without external subsidy. The optimization is solved sequentially on a rolling horizon basis: first the phasing, and next the pricing. PEXIC achieves significant cost reductions for a large range of volumes and users' value heterogeneity levels. Inclusion of user heterogeneity also proved to be fairer than standard delay minimization that disregards individual vehicles' values for delay savings. Furthermore, we show that arbitrage is not possible, thus there are no incentives to drive just to collect those payments. The method used has polynomial complexity and it is suitable for real-world implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Adult patients with primary pulmonary lobectomy or segmentectomy procedures were categorized by the surgical approach (VATS vs open) and primary diagnosis (primary or metastatic lung cancer vs non-lung cancer). Patients requiring 3 units of blood products with at least 1 unit of PRBCs: significant bleeding cohort; those requiring <3 units: non-significant bleeding cohort; and those not requiring blood products: no bleeding cohort. A matched cohort analysis was performed between the significant bleeding and the no bleeding cohort using matching variables: hospital, lung cancer diagnosis, year of surgery, APR-DRG severity score, procedure type and approach, age, and gender.Results: The All-patient cohort comprised 21,429 patients: 213 significant bleeding; 2,780 non-significant bleeding; and 18,436 no bleeding. Overall incidence of significant chest bleeding was 0.99%. Patients from significant bleeding cohort and non-significant bleeding cohort had 2.5 days and 2 days (p<0.0001) longer length of stay in the hospital compared to those in the no bleeding cohort, respectively. Overall, hospital costs for significant bleeding cohort were higher than no bleeding cohort for those who were covered under Medicare ($59,871 vs $23,641), were 76 years of age ($64,010 vs $24,243), had greater severity of illness ($97,813 vs $51,871) and underwent open segmentectomy ($74,220 vs $21,903). Hospital costs for significant bleeding cohort and non-significant bleeding were significantly higher ($11,589 and $5,280, respectively, p<0.0001) than no bleeding cohort.Conclusions: Although significant bleeding during lung resection surgery is rare, patients with such complication could stay longer at the hospital and cost an average of $13,103 more than those without.","[Ghosh, Sudip K.; Roy, Sanjoy] Johnson & Johnson Ethicon, Global Hlth Econ & Market Access, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Daskiran, Mehmet; Yoo, Andrew; Li, Gang] Johnson & Johnson Med Devices, Global Epidemiol & Hlth Informat, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Fegelman, Elliott J.] Johnson & Johnson Med Devices, Global Med Affairs, Cincinnati, OH USA",,"Roy, S (通讯作者)，Johnson & Johnson Ethicon, Global Hlth Econ & Market Access, 737 Route 22 West,MB02-E, Somerville, NJ 08876 USA.",sanjroy@gmail.com,,"yoo, andrew/0000-0001-7208-3587; Roy, Dr. Sanjoy/0000-0002-9327-6350; Daskiran, Mehmet/0000-0003-4922-8332",Johnson and Johnson Medical Devices,Johnson and Johnson Medical Devices,This manuscript received funding from Johnson and Johnson Medical Devices.,,15,7,11,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study investigates the influence of this novel information on commuters' day-to-day departure time choices. We introduce a general framework for departure time choice with information sharing via social networks, which can be applied to any social network structure and is flexible for future extensions. The key in the framework, the learning process from friends' information in decision-making, is modeled based on the Bayesian learning theory. The properties of this learning model and the dynamics of the day-to-day departure time choice are analyzed. We further propose an agent-based approach to simulate travelers' choices. The parameters in the learning model are estimated based on an experimental data set. The agent-based approach is applied to validate the model and examine the effect of different social network structures, in terms of both travel choices and transportation system performance.

This paper first proposes a new time-discretized multi-commodity network flow model for the VRPPDTW based on the integration of vehicles' carrying states within space-time transportation networks, so as to allow a joint optimization of passenger-to-vehicle assignment and turn-by-turn routing in congested transportation networks. Our three-dimensional state-space-time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space-time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle VRPPDTW problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers' requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms. We further discuss a number of search space reduction strategies and test our algorithms, implemented through a specialized program in C++, on medium-scale and large-scale transportation networks, namely the Chicago sketch and Phoenix regional networks.

This study aims to identify demographics and clinical characteristics associated with high healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and liver disease progression among CHC patients. Methods: Using health insurance claims (January 2001-March 2013), adult patients with >= 2 CHC claims (ICD-9-CM: 070.44 or 070.54), and >= 6 months of continuous insurance coverage before and >= 36 months after the first CHC diagnosis were included. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus were excluded. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of being in the 20% of patients with the highest HRU. Factors predicting liver disease progression were also identified. Results: In the study population (n = 4898), liver disease severity and both CHC- and non-CHC-related comorbidities and conditions were strong predictors of high healthcare costs, with odds ratios (ORs; 95% confidence interval [CI]) for >= 2 CHC-related and >= 2 non-CHC-related comorbidities/conditions of 2.78 (2.48-3.12) and 2.19 (1.76-2.72), respectively. CHC- and non-CHC-related comorbidities and conditions were also strong predictors of liver disease progression with ORs (95% CI) for >= 2 CHC-related and >= 2 non-CHC-related comorbidities and conditions of 2.18 (1.83-2.60) and 1.50 (1.14-1.97), respectively. Limitations: Potential inaccuracies in claims data, information or classification bias, and findings based on a privately insured population. Conclusion: This study suggests that CHC patients with high healthcare resource utilization have a high level of comorbidity at baseline and also that non-CHC comorbidities and conditions are strong predictors of high HRU. Non-cirrhotic CHC patients with one or more comorbidities are at high risk of progressing to cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease.","[LaMori, Joyce; Tandon, Neeta; Prabhakar, Avinash] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Titusville, NJ USA; [Laliberte, Francois; Germain, Guillaume; Pilon, Dominic; Lefebvre, Patrick] Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 Rue Gauchetiere Ouest,Bur 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Laliberté, F (通讯作者)，Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 Rue Gauchetiere Ouest,Bur 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",francois.laliberte@analysisgroup.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, in Titusville, NJ","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, in Titusville, NJ","The research was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, in Titusville, NJ.",,30,9,9,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A Markov model was developed comparing delayed-release DMF to glatiramer acetate and fingolimod using a US payer perspective and 20-year time horizon. A cohort of patients, mean age 38 years, with relapsing-remitting MS and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0-6 entered the model. Efficacy and safety were estimated by mixed-treatment comparison of data from the DEFINE and CONFIRM trials and clinical trials of other disease-modifying therapies. Data from published studies were used to derive resource use, cost, and utility inputs. Key outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Alternative scenarios tested in a sensitivity analysis included drug efficacy, EDSS-related or relapse-related costs, alternative perspectives, drug acquisition costs, and utility. Results: Base-case results with a 20-year time horizon indicated that delayed-release DMF increased QALYs +0.450 or +0.359 compared with glatiramer acetate or fingolimod, respectively. Reductions in 20-year costs with delayed-release DMF were -$70,644 compared with once-daily glatiramer acetate and -$32,958 compared with fingolimod. In an analysis comparing delayed-release DMF to three-times-weekly glatiramer acetate and assuming similar efficacy and safety to the once-daily formulation, 20-year costs with delayed-release DMF were increased by $15,806 and cost per QALY gained was $35,142. The differences in costs were most sensitive to acquisition cost and inclusion of informal care costs and productivity losses. The differences in QALYs were most sensitive to the impact of delayed-release DMF on disease progression and the EDSS utility weights. Conclusion: Delayed-release DMF is likely to increase QALYs for patients with relapsing forms of MS and be cost-effective compared with fingolimod and glatiramer acetate.","[Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Fay, Monica; Iyer, Ravi; Sarda, Sujata; Livingston, Terrie] Biogen Inc, 14 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Biogen,"Mauskopf, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",jmauskopf@rti.org,,"Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548","Biogen, Inc.","Biogen, Inc.(Biogen)","The study was sponsored by Biogen, Inc. and funding provided to RTI Health Solutions to develop the model.

A private monopolist internalizes collision externalities up to the point where compensations to users' benefit matches the full (intangible) costs; in oligopolistic markets, insurers do not fully internalize collision externalities. Analytical results demonstrate how insurance firms' incentives to influence traffic safety coincide with or deviate from socially optimal incentives.

However, few studies exist on the planning and design of ring-radial rail transit systems. With more ring transit lines being planned and built in Asia, Europe and the America's, a detailed study on ring transit lines is timely. An analytical model to find the optimal number of radial lines in a city for any demand distribution is first introduced. Secondly, passenger route choice for different rail networks is analyzed, for a many-to-many Origin-Destination (OD) demand distribution, based on a total travel time cost per passenger basis. The routes considered are: (1) radial lines only; (2) ring line only or radial lines and ring line combined; or (3) direct access to a destination without using the rail system. Mathematica and Matlab are used to code the route choice model. A cost-benefit optimization model to identify the feasibility and optimality of a ring line is proposed. Unlike simulations and agent-based models, this model is shown to be easily transferable to many ring-radial transit networks. The City of Calgary is used as an example to illustrate the applicability of each model. The existing urban rail network and trip distribution are major influencing factors in judging the feasibility and optimal location of the ring line. This study shows the potential net benefit of introducing a ring line by assessing changes in passengers' costs. The changes in passenger cost parameters, such as ride cost and access cost, are shown to greatly influence the feasibility of a ring line. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed at estimating the cost and length of stay associated with hypoglycemia-related hospitalizations in diabetic patients in Belgium and the association between hypoglycemia and in-hospital all-cause mortality, incidence of traumatic fractures, depression, and cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or unstable angina), using retrospective data from 2011.Methods:Patient data were retrieved from the IMS Hospital Disease Database, including longitudinal (per calendar year) information on diagnoses, procedures, and drugs prescribed in approximate to 20% of all Belgian hospital beds. The eligible population included all adult (<19 year) diabetic (both types) patients, further split between those with/without a history of hypoglycemia-related hospitalizations. Diabetes, hypoglycemia, and co-morbidities of interest were identified based on International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Version 9 (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. All costs were extrapolated to 2014 using progression in hospitalization costs since 2001.Results:A total of 43 410 diabetes-related hospitalizations were retrieved, corresponding to 30,710 distinct patients. The average hospitalization cost was Euro10,258 when hypoglycemia was documented (n=2625), vs Euro7173 in other diabetic hospitalized patients (n=40,785). When controlling for age and sex, a higher mortality risk (OR=1.59; p-value <0.001), a higher incidence of traumatic fractures (OR=1.25; p-value=0.009), and a higher probability of depression-related hospitalizations (OR=1.90; p-value <0.001) were observed in hypoglycemic patients. A similar risk of cardiovascular event was observed in both groups, but hypoglycemic patients were more at risk of experiencing multiple events.Conclusion:Hospitalizations for hypoglycemia are expensive and associated with an increased risk of depression and traumatic fractures as well as increased in-hospital mortality. Interventions that can help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, and consequently the burden on hospitals and society, without compromising glycemic control, will help to further improve diabetes management.","[Chevalier, P.; Lamotte, M.] IMS Hlth HEOR, Vilvoorde, Belgium; [Vandebrouck, T.; De Keyzer, D.] Novo Nordisk, Brussels, Belgium; [Mertens, A.] Univ Hosp Leuven, Dept Endocrinol, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven,"Chevalier, P (通讯作者)，IMS HLTH, Medialaan 38, B-1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium.",pchevalier@be.imshealth.com,,"Mertens, Ann/0000-0002-1649-4311",Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk.,,39,8,8,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Recognizing that consumption choices, especially regarding food, are determined by factors different from price and income, incorporating ideas both from behavioral economics, food marketing and psychology, we would try to give a first reflection about the possibility for an adequate use of ' terms' in communication to influence consumer food choices and improve diet and health. In food markets, research has abundantly focused on analysis of consumers' perception of technical parameters, but also on links between psycho-sociological ones and emotions associated to specific foods. Less has been done, however, about opportunities deriving from interlinks between terminology and food consumption behavior. Expressing with a question: ' is it possible to modify food perception and in general, food styles, through the strategy of acting on words, food names, definitions, in order to address nutrition on a health and welfare sustainability path'? From a methodological point of view, work has been done through the tool of experimental choice. This paper, then, will offer a first review of related literature and propose a reflection on the possibility of considering bettering the ' words' used in communication (scientific, marketing, medical, institutional) as a tool to improve health and welfare sustainability of nutrition styles.

Hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, medication, and adverse events were key clinical- and cost-inputs. Cost-benefits were evaluated in terms of costs and bed stays within the German healthcare system. Drug prices were calculated from the German Drug Directory (Euro/2014) and published literature, with a 3% annual discount rate applied. The base case analysis was for a 1-year time horizon.Results:The use of levosimendan vs dobutamine was associated with cost savings of Euro4787 per patient from the German hospital perspective due to reduced adverse events and shorter hospital LOS, leading to increased bed capacity and hospital revenue.Limitations:A pharmacoeconomic calculation for the specific situation of the German healthcare system that is based on international clinical trial carries a substantial risk of disregarding potentially relevant but unknown confounding factors (i.e., ICU-staffing, co-medications, standard-ICU care vs fast-tracking, etc.) that may either attenuate or increase the outcome pharmacoeconomic effects of a drug; however, since these conditions would also apply for patients treated with comparators, their net effects may not necessarily influence the conclusions.Conclusions:The use of levosimendan in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who require inotropic support appears to be cost-saving. The results of the analysis provide a strong rationale to run local clinical studies with pharmacoeconomic end-points which would allow a much more precise computation of the benefits of levosimendan.","[Mardiguian, Silvy; Smare, Caitlin; Bertranou, Evelina] PAREXEL Int, London, England; [Kivikko, Matti; Apajasalo, Marjo; Pollesello, Piero] Orion Pharma, Crit Care, POB 65, FIN-02101 Espoo, Finland; [Heringlake, Matthias] Univ Klinikum Schleswig Holstein, Clin Anesthesiol & Intens Care Med, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany",Parexel International; Orion Corporation; University of Kiel; Schleswig Holstein University Hospital,"Pollesello, P (通讯作者)，Orion Pharma, Crit Care, POB 65, FIN-02101 Espoo, Finland.",piero.pollesello@orionpharma.com,"Pollesello, Piero/I-6884-2019; Heringlake, Matthias/AAJ-8249-2020","Pollesello, Piero/0000-0001-6994-768X;",Orion Pharma,Orion Pharma,"MK, PP, and MA are employees of Orion Pharma.

Using sample-based time-invariant link travel times to capture the uncertainty of a realistic network, a two-stage stochastic integer programming model with the minimized expected travel time and penalty value incurred by transfer activities is formulated. The first stage aims to find a sequence of potential transfer nodes (stations) that can compose a feasible path from origins to destinations in the transfer activity network, and the second stage provides the least time paths passing by the generated transfer stations in the first stage for evaluating the given transfer schemes and then outputs the best routing information. To solve our proposed model, an efficient hybrid algorithm, in which the label correcting algorithm is embedded into a branch and bound searching framework, is presented to find the optimal solutions of the considered problem. Finally, the numerical experiments are implemented in different scales of metro networks. The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approaches even for the large-scale Beijing metro network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method uses a combination of dynamic holding and en-route driver guidance to achieve its objectives. It applies to systems with a mix of headway-based and schedule-based lines but it is evaluated for scheduled systems as this is the more challenging application. Improved schedule adherence is the goal. The method's calculation complexity per piece of advice does not increase with system size. As a result, the method is scalable and can be used with large multi-line systems, no matter how complex. When controlled, each vehicle is mostly affected by exogenous disturbances (e.g. traffic) and very little by other vehicles. As a result, disruptions to a vehicle or group of vehicles caused by inattentive drivers or control equipment failures remain confined to the vehicles experiencing the problems. The control method effectively quarantines disease. The method is evaluated analytically and with simulations over a broad range of conditions, including schedules with zero slack. The method was also evaluated by observing the performance of a real world multi-line system that uses inexpensive on-board tablets to apply the control. The evaluation addresses driver compliance and equipment malfunction issues. It is found that the method is resilient and improves reliability considerably even under challenging conditions.

Especially, we propose a unified relationship that accounts for cars and buses because the classical MFD is not sufficient to capture the traffic flow interactions of a multimodal traffic. The concept of passenger macroscopic fundamental diagram (p-MFD) is introduced. With this new relationship, the efficiency of the global transport system, i.e. behaviors of cars and buses, can be assessed. Intuitively, the p-MFD shape strongly depends on the mode ratio. Thus, user equilibrium and system optimum are studied and compared. Finally, this relationship is used to design bus system characteristics and to identify the optimal domains of applications for different transit strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By exploiting a symmetry property of the stochastic MFD, whereby it exhibits identical probability distributions in free-flow and congestion, it is found that the network MFD depends mainly on two dimensionless parameters: the mean block length to green ratio and the mean red to green ratio. The theory is validated with an exact traffic simulation and with the empirical data from the city of Yokohama.

The mechanism of interest is for a VSL system to prevent the bottleneck from being activated and thus avoid detrimental capacity drop that arises at the activated bottleneck. We firstly consider a VSL system installed along the freeway towards the bottleneck, which adjusts commuters' cruising speeds in a continuous fashion and essentially regulates the upstream flow into the bottleneck. By investigating the resulting departure-time equilibrium of commuters, we find the VSL system can eliminate the efficiency loss caused by capacity drop, and further bound its improvements on various performance measures. We then turn to a more practical VSL system, which adjusts commuters' cruising speeds in a discrete fashion. The conditions for such a system to improve various performance measures are established and its efficiencies are bounded. Based on empirical data, we conclude that the discrete VSL system can avoid or delay capacity drop associated with an active bottleneck and thus reduce queuing delay. It can help reduce the schedule delay cost and total emissions cost. However, it is unlikely for the system to reduce total travel time, individual travel cost and social cost in this particular setting. These results shed light on the effectiveness of VSL systems on realistic freeway networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The economics of staggered work hours. Journal of Urban Economics 9 (3), 349-364), a number of studies have examined the effect of staggered work hours by analyzing models of work start time choice that consider the trade-off between negative congestion externalities and positive production externalities. However, these studies employed flow congestion models to describe traffic congestion. This study develops a model of work start time choice with bottleneck congestion and discloses the intrinsic properties of the model. To this end, this study extends Henderson's model to incorporate bottleneck congestion. By utilizing the properties of a potential game, we characterize equilibrium and optimal distributions of work start times. We also show that Pigouvian tax/subsidy policies generally yield multiple equilibria and that the first-best optimum must be a stable equilibrium under Pigouvian policies, whereas the second-best optimum in which policymakers cannot eliminate queuing congestion can be unstable.

Intrinsically, the boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (BR-DUE) model we present assumes that travelers do not always seek the least costly route-and-departure-time choice. Rather, their perception of travel cost is affected by an indifference band describing travelers' tolerance of the difference between their experienced travel costs and the minimum travel cost. An extension of the BR-DUE problem is the so-called variable tolerance dynamic user equilibrium (VT-BR-DUE) wherein endogenously determined tolerances may depend not only on paths, but also on the established path departure rates. This paper presents a unified approach for modeling both BR-DUE and VT-BR-DUE, which makes significant contributions to the model formulation, analysis of existence, solution characterization, and numerical computation of such problems. The VT-BR-DUE problem, together with the BR-DUE problem as a special case, is formulated as a variational inequality. We provide a very general existence result for VT-BR-DUE and BR-DUE that relies on assumptions weaker than those required for normal DUE models. Moreover, a characterization of the solution set is provided based on rigorous topological analysis. Finally, three computational algorithms with convergence results are proposed based on the VI and DVI formulations. Numerical studies are conducted to assess the proposed algorithms in terms of solution quality, convergence, and computational efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Vehicle relocation, however, can lead to an imbalance of staff members between stations. Thus, staff members, themselves, need to be relocated between stations to perform the vehicle relocations. This study addresses the joint optimization of vehicle relocation and staff rebalancing using two integrated multi-traveling salesman formulations. Results show that fleet size is more sensitive to demand than staff size, staff size is inversely related to vehicle cost, and that vehicle relocation time increases with vehicle cost.

These resources are usually planned separately in a sequential process that typically starts from planning (1) train paths and goes further on to (2) rolling stock and (3) train drivers. Such a sequential approach helps to handle the complexity of the planning process and simplify the underlying mathematical models. However, it generates solutions with higher costs because the decisions taken at one step can drastically reduce the set of feasible solutions in the following steps. In this paper, we propose a Lagrangian heuristic framework to solve an integrated problem which globally and simultaneously considers the planning of two railway resources: Rolling stock units and train drivers. Based on a mixed integer linear programming formulation, this approach has two important characteristics in an industrial context: (i) It can tackle real-life integrated planning problems and (ii) the Lagrangian dual is solved by calling two proprietary software modules available at SNCF. Various relaxation schemes are analyzed. Moreover, coupling constraints are rewritten to improve the heuristic effectiveness.

An integrated multi-objective optimization model that combines resource allocation with emergency distribution is developed, where a time space network is used to incorporate the frequent information and decision updates in a rolling horizon approach. The proposed model is shown to be a convex quadratic network flow problem, for which we design an efficient Variational Inequality algorithm.

The network flow pattern is subject to stochastic user equilibrium, specifically, the logit route choice model. The resulting formulation, a nonlinear nonconvex programming problem, is firstly transformed into a nonlinear program with only logarithmic functions as nonlinear terms, for which a tight linear programming relaxation is derived by using an outer-approximation technique. The linear programming relaxation is then embedded within a global optimization solution algorithm based on range reduction technique, and the proposed approach is proved to converge to a global optimum.

In view of the practice, this paper proposes an optimal container liner shipping network alteration problem based on an interesting idea of segment, which is a sequence of legs from a head port to a tail port that are visited by the same type of ship more than once in the existing shipping network. In segment-based network alteration, the segments are intact and each port is visited by the same type of ship and from the same previous ports. As a result, the designed network needs minimum modification before implementation. A mixed-integer linear programming model with a polynomial number of variables is developed for the proposed segmented-based liner shipping network alternation problem. The developed model is applied to an Asia-Europe-Oceania liner shipping network with a total of 46 ports and 11 ship routes. Results demonstrate that the problem could be solved efficiently and the optimized network reduces the total cost of the initial network considerably. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study using Symphony Health Solutions claims databases that included payer, prescription (Rx), diagnosis (Dx) and procedure (Px) information with unique anonymized patient identifiers. Methods: The percentage of patients with claims for infusion and subcutaneous (SQ) biologics were evaluated across three increasingly restrictive cohorts: (1) patients in step therapy plans versus all others in the database (population), (2) patients in step therapy plans versus patients that were members of plans that were roughly matched (matched) and (3) a subsample of patients that were members of step therapy plans that had sufficient data for a pre/post analysis (pre/post). Results: The population analysis comparison showed 5.1% fewer patients (p<0.0001) with claims for infusion biologics among step therapy plans than among the overall plans. The more controlled matched and pre/post analyses showed a greater percentage of patients with claims for intravenous products in the plans with step therapy policies versus plans without step therapy policies, differences of +7.0% (p<0.0001) and +2.8% (p = 0.0522), respectively. Conclusions: Policies designed to limit utilization of infusion biologics showed equivocal results.

The objective of this study was to conduct a comparison of outcomes following use of advanced flowable hemostatic matrices in a large spine surgery population. Methods: This is an observational retrospective cohort analysis using Premier's US Perspective Hospital Database. Two commonly-used hemostatic matrices (Floseal and Surgiflo kitted with thrombin) were compared in cases categorized as either major or severe spine surgery. Outcomes included complications, blood product administration, hospital length of stay (LOS), surgery time, and amount of matrix used in surgery. Results: Major spine surgery patients treated with Surgiflo were associated with increased risk of blood product transfusion (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.79-3.65, p<0.001), longer surgery time (+8.84 min, p<0.0001), and increased product usage (+3.34 mL, p<0.001), compared to Floseal; however, risk of complications and LOS did not differ by choice of matrix in this patient group. Severe spine surgery patients treated with Surgiflo were associated with longer surgical time (+26.9 min, p<0.001) and increased product usage (+1.52 mL, p<0.01), compared to Floseal; however, risk of complications, transfusion and LOS did not differ by choice of matrix in this patient group. Limitations: Inherent to limitations associated with database analysis, this study did not evaluate potential physician differences such as skill and experience, assess long-term outcomes, nor include cases with missing data. Conclusion: The results from this analysis indicated that surgery time, risk of blood transfusion, and amount of matrix used are greater with Surgiflo patients, compared to Floseal patients. Choice of matrix did not appear to impact hospital LOS or risk of surgical complications. Future research should evaluate the cost consequences of increased clinical and resource utilization by choice of hemostatic matrix in spine surgery.","[Price, J.

Background: RHD is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity during adolescence and young adulthood in low-and middle-per capita income settings. Echocardiography-based screening approaches can dramatically expand the number of children identified at risk of progressive RHD. Cost-effectiveness analysis can inform public health agencies and payers about the net economic benefit of such large-scale population-based screening. Methods: A Markov model was constructed comparing a no-screen to echo screen approach. The echo screen program was modeled as a 2-staged screen of a cohort of 11-year-old children with initial short screening performed by dedicated technicians and follow-up complete echo by cardiologists. Penicillin RHD prophylaxis was modeled to only reduce rheumatic fever recurrence-related exacerbation. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs (in 2010 Australian dollars) associated with each approach were estimated. One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on RHD prevalence and transition probabilities; echocardiography test characteristics; and societal level costs including supplies, transportation, and labor. Results: The incremental costs and QALYs of the screen compared to no screen strategy were -$432 (95% CI = -$1357 to $575) and 0.007 (95% CI = -0.0101 to 0.0237), respectively. The joint probability that the screen was both less costly and more effective exceeded 80%. Sensitivity analyses suggested screen strategy dominance depends mostly on the probability of transitioning out of sub-clinical RHD. Conclusion: Two-stage echo RHD screening and secondary prophylaxis may achieve modestly improved outcomes at lower cost compared to clinical detection and deserves closer attention from health policy stakeholders.","[Zachariah, Justin P.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA USA; [Zachariah, Justin P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Samnaliev, Mihail] Boston Childrens Hosp, Clin Res Program, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Boston Children's Hospital,"Zachariah, JP (通讯作者)，Childrens Hosp, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rhdechoscreencea@gmail.com,"Zachariah, Justin P/Q-1280-2019","Zachariah, Justin P/0000-0001-7302-2401","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Career Development Award [(K23) HL111335]","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Career Development Award(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","This work was supported by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Career Development Award (K23) HL111335.",,0,21,22,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This paper presents a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization model and a Lagrangian relaxation solution method for designing a supply chain resilient to (1) supply/demand interruptions and (2) facility disruptions whose risk of occurrence and magnitude of impact can be mitigated through fortification investments. We study a realistic problem where a disruption can cause either a complete facility shutdown or a reduced supply capacity. The probability of disruption occurrence is expressed as a function of facility fortification investment for hedging against potential disruptions in the presence of certain budgetary constraints. Computational experiments and thorough sensitivity analyses are completed using some of the existing widely-used datasets. The performance of the proposed model is also examined using a Monte Carlo simulation method. To explore the practical application of the proposed model and methodology, a real world case example is discussed which addresses mitigating the risk of facility fires in an actual oil production company. Our analysis and investigation focuses on exploring the extent to which supply chain design decisions are influenced by factors such as facility fortification strategies, a decision maker's conservatism degree, demand fluctuations, supply capacity variations, and budgetary constraints.

When the disruption is over, some stations may be skipped in the recovery period, which speeds up the circulation of trains and makes the number of stranded passengers reduce faster. Considering an overcrowded and time-dependent passenger flow, this paper proposes an optimization model to reschedule a metro line. To achieve a balance between theoretical validity and computational convenience, the optimization model is decomposed, and an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the model.

Both the mean and variance of travel cost, including the covariance of in-vehicle travel costs, are captured in both formulations. To address the covariance of in-vehicle travel costs between different links on the same transit line, an augmented route-section network representation is developed, allowing us to apply the dynamic programming method to compute the value of the mapping function of the VI. The approach-based formulation can be solved by an extragradient method that only requires mild assumptions for convergence. It is found that the number of links carrying flow and equilibrium cost can be underestimated if supply uncertainty is not considered. The study also introduces and examines the capacity paradox, a phenomenon in which the network maximum throughput may be reduced after new transit lines are added to a transit network or after the frequency of an existing line is increased. It is found that the capacity paradox may or may not occur simultaneously with the Braess-like paradox, a phenomenon in which providing new transit lines to a network may deteriorate the network performance in terms of the total weighted sum of the mean and variance of travel cost of all of the passengers. The demand level and the degree of risk aversion of passengers are the key factors that determine the occurrence of the capacity paradox. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The complexity of this disease is likely to result in substantial challenges and costs in disease management throughout the patient's lifetime. This retrospective database study aims to quantify healthcare resources utilized by TSC patients.Methods: TSC patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database were identified between January 1987 and June 2013. Analyses were conducted over the most recent 3-year period of data and stratified by pediatric (< 18) and adult patients. Prescriptions, procedures, diagnostic tests, and healthcare encounters were reported in comparison with a matched comparator cohort. Costs and key economic drivers by primary organ system manifestations were also examined.Results: A total of 286 patients with TSC were identified and consistently reported 2-fold greater resource use than the matched presumably healthy controls. Despite this comparatively greater resource use, half of TSC patients did not record any procedures, and 20% of patients did not record any diagnostic tests; however, inpatient hospitalizations were greater for the TSC cohort (3.1 vs 1.3), but length of stay was comparable. TSC patients had costs totaling 12,681 per patient over the 3-year period, a figure 2.7-fold greater than the total costs in the comparator cohort (4,777) pound. Costs for patients with specific primary manifestations were even greater, with brain manifestations incurring 22,139 pound per affected patient. Kidney and nervous system manifestations were the main cost drivers.Conclusions: The economic burden of TSC and its impact on NHS healthcare resources is mostly attributable to the broad spectrum of manifestations that develop within multiple organ systems. TSC patients may benefit from co-ordinated care based on their requirement for high numbers of healthcare visits across specialties.","[Kingswood, John C.] Royal Sussex Cty Hosp, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Crawford, Pamela] York Hosp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Johnson, Simon R.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Sampson, Julian R.] Cardiff Univ, Inst Med Genet, Sch Med, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Shepherd, Charles] Nobles Isle Man Hosp, Isle Of Man, England; [Demuth, Dirk; Nasuti, Paola; Patel, Keyur; Myland, Melissa] IMS Hlth, London, England; [Erhard, Clement] CE Analyt, Cambridge, England; [Pinnegar, Alun; Gray, Elizabeth] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley, England; [Magestro, Matthew] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",University of Brighton; University of Nottingham; Cardiff University; Novartis; Novartis,"Kingswood, JC (通讯作者)，Royal Sussex Cty Hosp, Renal Unit, Barry Bldg,Eastern Rd, Brighton BN2 5BE, E Sussex, England.",chriskingswood@me.com,"Johnson, Simon/HNP-5584-2023","Johnson, Simon/0000-0002-9837-2763",Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis),This research was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,46,20,22,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Models describing flows across network junctions, referred to as node models, play the role of the coupling between the link models and are responsible for capturing the propagation of traffic dynamics through the network. Node models are typically stated as optimization problems, so that the coupling between the link dynamics is not known explicitly. This renders network flow models analytically intractable. This paper examines the properties of node models for urban networks. Solutions to node models that are free of traffic holding, referred to as holding-free solutions, are formally defined and it is shown that flow maximization is only a sufficient condition for holding-free solutions. A simple greedy algorithm is shown to produce holding-free solutions while also respecting the invariance principle. Staging movements through nodes in a manner that prevents conflicting flows from proceeding through the nodes simultaneously is shown to simplify the node models considerably and promote unique solutions. The staging also models intersection capacities in a more realistic way by preventing unrealistically large flows when there is ample supply in the downstream and preventing artificial blocking when some of the downstream supplies are restricted.

I show that the optimal price for parking is proportional to the rate of arrival of new parkers and is inversely related to the square of the occupancy rate, which is different from previously discussed pricing methods. I show that the primary purpose of pricing is to regulate departures, rather than arrivals, of parkers.

They have been targeted by several research and standardization efforts. An especially interesting class of dissemination protocols are so called timer (or delay) based ones. The recently standardized GeoBroadcast service of the GeoNetworking protocol of ETSI falls into this category. This work lays out an analytical model of message coverage distance and delivery delay with timer-based dissemination protocols in a highway environment. The model is based on the assumption of (possibly non homogeneous) Poisson vehicle spatial distribution. The model results are compared with computer simulations and measured data driven experiments, including scenarios with traffic discontinuities (signalized intersections). The limits of applicability of the proposed model are assessed, showing that it provides accurate predictions with a wide range of system parameters for highway scenarios. It is also shown that one of the most popular timer-based dissemination protocols achieves the same connectivity and coverage performance of the ideal message flooding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find evidence for high levels of systematic risk in shipping stocks, which match the fundamental risk characteristics of the industry (such as high financial and operating leverage). Shipping firms exhibit distinct industry-specific beta dynamics compared to firms from benchmark sectors or the average firm in the S&P 500 index. Changes in both economic conditions and industry-specific risk factors explain large proportions of beta variation in the cross-section of firms and over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the integrated-manufacturer first scenario, we find that (i) decentralization of the supply chain increases quoted leadtime; and (ii) both manufacturers may choose different channel structures under symmetric duopoly. By comparing with the symmetric scenario and the retailer first scenario, we find that a manufacturer facing a decentralized rival adopts decentralization when leadtime sensitivity, leadtime cost, and price elasticity are very small; the effect of decentralization on quoted leadtime largely depends on game scenario.

Several additional side constraints, such as a mandated break period contingent on tour start time, multiple vehicle capacities, and site dependencies are also included. This specific problem was inspired by a real-world application and does not appear in the literature. It is modeled as an MILP which is enhanced with several valid inequalities. Due to the rich nature of the problem, state-of-the-art solvers are only able to tackle instances of small to medium size. To solve realistic instances, we propose a multiple neighborhood search heuristic capable of systematically treating all problem features and general enough to respond to the varying characteristics of the case study regions for which it is intended. The results show that the heuristic achieves optimality on small instances, exhibits competitive performance in comparison to state-of-the-art solution methods for special cases of our problem, and leads to important savings in the state of practice. Moreover, it highlights and quantifies the savings from allowing a flexible depot assignment. The data from the state of practice comes from a company in the waste collection industry in Geneva, Switzerland. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to minimize fuel consumption while retaining the customer transit times including the transhipment times. To avoid too many changes to the time table, changes of port berth times are only accepted if they lead to savings above a threshold value. Since the fuel consumption of a vessel is a non-linear convex function of the speed, it is approximated by a piecewise linear function. The developed model is solved using exact methods in less than two minutes for large instances. Computational experiments on real-size liner shipping networks are presented showing that fuels savings in the magnitude 2-10% can be obtained.

Many of these products are biologic agents, classified as specialty pharmaceuticals, and are distributed through specialty pharmacies. The increasing use of these expensive medications and their growing costs raise the simple question, can payers and purchasers afford to keep doing business as usual? In addition, confusion exists as to what outcomes are relevant for these conditions treated using specialty medications. Available information on outcomes, treatments, and pathways from multiple sources can overload clinicians and the treatment team, making it difficult to select - and receive reimbursement for - the most appropriate regimens.

This study focuses on the economic burden of brain metastasis in lung cancerdirect healthcare costs to payers and indirect costs to patients, payers, and employersin the US.Methods:Retrospective study using claims data from over 60 self-insured Fortune 500 companies across all US census regions (January 1999-March 2013). Adult, non-elderly lung cancer patients with brain metastasis were evaluated over two study periods: (1) pre-diagnosis (30 days prior to first observed lung cancer diagnosis to 30 days prior to first-observed brain metastasis diagnosis) and (2) post-diagnosis (30 days prior to first observed brain metastasis diagnosis to end of continuous eligibility or observation).Outcome measures:Healthcare costs to payers and resource utilization, salary loss to patients, disability payouts for payers, and productivity loss to employers.Results:A total of 132 patients were followed for a median of 8.4 and 6.6 months in the pre- and post-diagnosis periods, respectively. At diagnosis of brain metastasis, 21.2% of patients were on leave of absence and 6.1% on long-term disability leave. Substantial differences were observed in the pre- vs post-diagnosis periods. Specifically, patients incurred much greater healthcare utilization in the post-diagnosis period, resulting in $25,579 higher medical costs per-patient-per-6-months (PPP6M). During this period, patients missed significantly more work days, generating an incremental burden of $2853 PPP6M in salary loss for patients, $2557 PPP6M in disability payments for payers, and $4570 PPP6M in productivity loss for employers.Limitations:Type of primary lung cancer and extent of brain metastasis could not be assessed in the data. The analysis was also limited to patients with comprehensive disability coverage.Conclusions:Development of brain metastasis among lung cancer patients is associated with a substantial economic burden to payers, patients, and employers.","[Guerin, A.; Dea, K.; Nitulescu, R.] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sasane, M.; Zhang, J.; Culver, K.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Wu, E.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab monotherapy or combination therapy (ranibizumab plus laser photocoagulation) compared with laser monotherapy for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). Methods A Markov model was developed in which patients moved between health states defined by best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) intervals and an absorbing 'death' state. The population of interest was patients with DME due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Baseline characteristics were based on those of participants in the RESTORE study. Main outputs were costs (in 2013 CA$) and health outcomes (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. This cost-utility analysis was conducted from healthcare system and societal perspectives in Quebec. Results From a healthcare system perspective, the ICERs for ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy vs laser monotherapy were CA$24 494 and CA$36 414 per QALY gained, respectively. The incremental costs per year without legal blindness for ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy vs laser monotherapy were CA$15 822 and CA$20 616, respectively. Based on the generally accepted Canadian ICER threshold of CA$50 000 per QALY gained, ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy were found to be cost-effective compared with laser monotherapy. From a societal perspective, ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy provided greater benefits at lower costs than laser monotherapy (ranibizumab therapy dominated laser therapy). Conclusions Ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy resulted in increased quality-adjusted survival and time without legal blindness and lower costs from a societal perspective compared with laser monotherapy.","[Haig, Jennifer] Optum, Burlington, ON, Canada; [Barbeau, Martin] Novartis Pharmaceut Canada Inc, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Ferreira, Alberto] Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Optum; Novartis; Novartis,"Ferreira, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",alberto.ferreira@novartis.com,,,Novartis Pharma AG,Novartis Pharma AG,This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.,,57,6,6,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Therefore, an appropriate paradigm for valuing innovation' is urgently required in order to refine pricing and reimbursement decisions. Cost-per-QALY-gained is still the standard metric for assessing the incremental' value of new drugs; however, the high number of comparator' therapies and the huge variety of treatment sequences make plain two-treatment comparisons sub-optimal, while multiple-treatment and multiple-sequence comparisons require complex and less-transparent decision models. A repository of standard backbones for decision models might allow benchmarking and comparability among cost-effectiveness analyses; however, an international effort is required to build it up.Results:Deontology recommends that hematologists act in optimizing healthcare resources while preserving patient-physician alliance, but clinical practice guidelines do not support doctors in balancing cost against clinical outcomes. Decision models of chronic blood cancers unexpectedly proved that cost might be an appropriate value for innovation if treatments avoided severe toxicity and further lines of treatments, despite the eventually long duration of treatment and the competing risk of death due to comorbidity and old age.Conclusion:The improved transparency of decision models allows sharing of relevant structural and analytic parameters (i.e., time horizon, comparator treatments, hierarchy of end-point, assumptions, source of data, sub-group analyses) by stakeholders, physicians and patients, making health economics a noble translator' of values for innovation.","[Monia, Marchetti] Hosp C Massaia, Oncol Unit, Hematol Serv, Corso Dante 202, I-14100 Asti, Italy",,"Monia, M (通讯作者)，Hosp C Massaia, Oncol Unit, Hematol Serv, Corso Dante 202, I-14100 Asti, Italy.",moniamarchettitamellini@gmail.com,"MARCHETTI, MONIA/AAH-9505-2019",,,,,,25,5,5,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

It's well known, in fact, that nutrition is capable of substantially modifying the risk profile of a subject in primary and/or secondary prevention. Several models of diet have been imposed on public attention, but the one that got the most interest is certainly the Mediterranean diet. Recently, several studies have shown that a strict adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with a lower incidence of mortality and incidence of chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Meta-analyses conducted by our group have revealed, in a population of over than 2 million of people, that adherence to Mediterranean diet determines a significant reduction on the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents. To the best of the knowledge the most effective indications for an optimal therapeutic strategy in nutrition include: increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables up to the recommended 5 servings a day, prefer whole grains, replace saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats, reduce the consumption of sugar and sweetened beverages, and limit salt intake. With these simple indications, together with recommendations of following the principles of the traditional Mediterranean diet, a substantial reduction of the risk of incidence and / or mortality from cardiovascular disease can be easily obtained.

The resource allocation problem for urban rail transit systems is considered as a game between two players, the attacker interdicting certain rail stations to generate greatest disruption impact and the system defender fortifying the network to maximize the system's robustness to external interdictions. This paper introduces a game-theoretic approach for enhancing urban transit networks' robustness to intentional disruptions via optimally allocating protection resources. A tri-level defender-attacker-user game-theoretic model is developed to allocate protective resources among rail stations in the rail transit network. This paper is distinguished with previous studies in that more sophisticated interdiction behaviors by the attacker, such as coordinated attack on multiple locations and various attacking intensities, are specifically considered. Besides, a more complex multi-commodity network flow model is employed to model the commuter travel pattern in the degraded rail network after interdiction. An effective nested variable neighborhood search method is devised to obtain the solution to the game in an efficient manner. A case study based on the Singapore rail transit system and actual travel demand data is finally carried out to assess the protective resources' effectiveness against intentional attacks.

This study estimated the potential budget impact (BI) associated with market entry of Sweet Vernal, Orchard, Perennial Rye, Timothy, and Kentucky Blue Grass Mixed Pollens Allergen Extract Tablet for Sublingual Use (5-grass SLIT tablet') for patients aged 10-65 with grass pollen-induced AR.Methods:A budget impact model was constructed to estimate the potential BI from a US payer perspective. The model calculated pharmacy, medical, and total (pharmacy+medical) costs per-member-per-month (PMPM) with and without market entry of the 5-grass SLIT tablet, considering a 3-year time horizon. The target population was determined using an epidemiological approach and existing literature. The treatment market shares without 5-grass SLIT tablet entry were derived from an analysis of de-identified insurance claims data. Pharmacy costs and medical utilization rates and costs were obtained from the claims data analysis and existing literature. One-way sensitivities were conducted for key model inputs.Results:Using an illustrative example of a hypothetical health plan with one million members, the estimated target population of AR patients aged 10-65 was 26,320. On a PMPM basis, pharmacy costs increased by $0.36, $0.44, and $0.51, while total costs (after medical cost offsets) increased by $0.15, $0.18, and $0.22 in the first, second, and third years following entry of the 5-grass SLIT tablet, respectively. Results were most sensitive to changes in the compliance rate, treatment duration, and price. The BI will vary from the base case example when alternative, payer-specific inputs are used.Conclusions:Using base case inputs, use of the 5-grass SLIT tablet to treat grass pollen-induced AR increased the pharmacy budget for a hypothetical third-party payer. Higher pharmacy costs were partially offset by lower medical budget due to reduced resource use compared with existing treatments.","[Ivanova, Jasmina I.; Kelkar, Sneha] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY USA; [King, Sarah; Birnbaum, Howard G.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Hocker, Sue] Lindyn Grp Inc, Baltimore, MD USA; [Phipps, Robert] Greer Labs Inc, Lenoir, NC USA; [Lankow, Richard] Aspen Biosci, Ft Worth, TX USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.,"Ivanova, JI (通讯作者)，Anal Grp, 10 Rockefeller Pl,15th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA.",jasmina.ivanova@analysisgroup.com,,,"Greer Laboratories, Inc","Greer Laboratories, Inc","Funding for the development of this budget impact model was provided by Greer Laboratories, Inc.

Sufficiency conditions for identification of the GHDM parameters are presented. The maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) method is proposed to estimate this jointly mixed model system. This estimation method provides computational time advantages since the dimensionality of integration in the likelihood function is independent of the number of latent factors. The study undertakes a simulation experiment within the virtual context of integrating residential location choice and travel behavior to evaluate the ability of the MACML approach to recover parameters. The simulation results show that the MACML approach effectively recovers underlying parameters, and also that ignoring the multi-dimensional nature of the relationship among mixed types of dependent variables can lead not only to inconsistent parameter estimation, but also have important implications for policy analysis.

However, it is impractical to gather data from an entire population for such estimations because the widely used loop detectors and other more advanced wireless sensors may be limited by various factors. Thus, making data inferences based on smaller populations is generally inevitable. Linear data projection is a commonly and intuitively adopted method for inferring population traffic characteristics. It projects a sample of observable traffic quantities such as traffic count based on a set of scaling factors. However, scaling factors are subject to different types of variability such as spatial variability. Models calibrated based on linearly projected data that do not account for variability may introduce a systematic bias into their parameters. Such a bias is surprisingly often ignored. This paper reveals the existence of a systematic bias in model calibration caused by variability in the linear data projection. A generalized multivariate polynomial model is applied to examine the effect of this variability on model parameters. Adjustment factors are derived and methods are proposed for detecting and removing the embedded systematic bias. A simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To illustrate the applicability of the method, case studies are conducted using real-world global positioning system data obtained from taxis. These data calibrate the Macroscopic Bureau of Public Road function for six 1 x 1 km regions in Hong Kong. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Wong, Wai; Wong, S.

The problem has strong implications in the context of freight logistics and transit system design. This paper first focuses on a Euclidean plane and shows that a tight upper bound can be achieved by a type of elongated cyclic hexagons, while a cost lower bound based on relaxation and idealization is also obtained. The gap between the analytical upper and lower bounds is within 0.3%. This paper then shows that a similar elongated non-cyclic hexagon shape, with proper orientation, is actually optimal for service regions on a rectilinear metric plane. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the analytical findings and to draw further insights. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the behaviour of drivers approaching and passing through intersections, the model family is presented. The headway and the turn delay of vehicles are key variables. Having demand and supply as input creates a natural connection to macroscopic link models. Properties like the invariance principle and the conservation of turning fractions are satisfied. The inherent non-uniqueness is analysed by providing the complete set of feasible solutions. The node models proposed by Tampere et al. (2011), Flotterod and Rohde (2011) and Gibb (2011) are members of the family. Furthermore, two new models are added to the family. Solution methods for all family members are presented, as well as a qualitative and quantitative comparison. Finally, an outlook for the future development of empirically verified models is given.

They try to avoid collisions and to preserve their personal space. State-of-the-art pedestrian motion models automatically reduce speed in dense crowds simply because there is no space where the pedestrians could go. The stride length and its correct adaptation, however, are rarely considered. This leads to artefacts that impact macroscopic observation parameters such as densities in front of bottlenecks and, through this, flow. Hence modelling stride adaptation is important to increase the predictive power of pedestrian models. To achieve this we reformulate the problem as an optimisation problem on a disk around the pedestrian. Each pedestrian seeks the position that is most attractive in a sense of balanced goals between the search for targets, the need for individual space and the need to keep a distance from obstacles. The need for space is modelled according to findings from psychology defining zones around a person that, when invaded, cause unease. The result is a fully automatic adjustment that allows calibration through meaningful social parameters and that gives visually natural results with an excellent fit to measured experimental data.

Study design: Retrospective analysis of the HCMS integrated database from multiple geographically diverse, US-based employers with employee information on medical, prescription, and absenteeism claims. Methods: Employee data were extracted from July 2001-March 2013. Employees with HCV were identified by ICD-9-CM codes and classified into disease severity cohorts using diagnosis/procedure codes assigning the first date of most severe claim as the index date. Non-HCV employees (controls) were assigned random index dates. Inclusion required 6-month pre-/post-index eligibility. Medical, prescription, and absenteeism cost and time were analyzed using two-part regression (logistic/generalized linear) models, controlling for potentially confounding factors. Costs were inflation adjusted to September 2013. Results: All direct costs comparisons were statistically significant (p <= 0.05) with mean medical costs of $1813 [SE = $3] for controls (n = 727,588), $4611 [SE = $211] for non-cirrhotic (n = 1007), $4646 [SE = $721] for compensated cirrhosis (CC, n = 87), $12,384 [SE = $1122] for decompensated cirrhosis (DCC, n = 256), $33,494 [SE = $11,753] for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 17) and $97,724 [SE = $32,437] for liver transplant (LT, n = 19) cohorts. Mean short-term disability days/costs were significantly greater for the non-cirrhotic (days = 2.03 [SE = 0.36]; $299 [SE = $53]), DCC (days = 6.20 [SE = 1.36]; $763 [SE = $169]), and LT cohorts (days = 21.98 [SE = 8.21]; $2537 [SE = $972]) compared to controls (days = 1.19 [SE = 0.01]; $155 [SE = $1]). Mean sick leave costs were significantly greater for non-cirrhotic ($373 [SE = $22]) and DCC ($460 [SE = $54]) compared to controls ($327 [SE = $1]). Conclusions: Employees with HCV were shown to have greater direct and indirect costs compared to non-HCV employee controls. Costs progressively increased in the more severe HCV disease categories. Slowing or preventing disease progression may avert the costs of more severe liver disease stages and enable employees with HCV to continue as productive members of the workforce.","[Baran, Robert W.; Samp, Jennifer C.; Walker, David R.] AbbVie, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, N Chicago, IL USA; [Smeeding, James E.] JeSTARx Grp, Dallas, TX USA; [Young, Jacob W.; Kleinman, Nathan L.] HCMS Grp, Cheyenne, WY USA; [Brook, Richard A.] JeSTARx Grp, Retrospect Anal, Newfoundland, NJ 07435 USA",AbbVie; JeSTARx Group; JeSTARx Group,"Brook, RA (通讯作者)，JeSTARx Grp, Retrospect Anal, 18 Hirth Dr, Newfoundland, NJ 07435 USA.",rbrook@jestarx.com,"Brook, Richard A/A-8010-2009",,,,,,0,15,15,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Adult patients with an initial MS diagnosis were identified from a national managed-care database (IMS LifeLink Health Plans Database). The analysis included newly diagnosed MS patients with 12 months insurance eligibility before and after their first MS diagnosis. Inpatient facility encounters (stays) were analyzed for all-cause and MS-related events (ICD-9-CM = 340. XX), other demyelinating CNS disease (ICD-9-CM = 341.XX), rehabilitation (ICD-9-CM = V57.89), and a group of symptom-related diagnoses. Costs and length of stay were evaluated using a general linear model controlling for age and sex. Results: A total of 57,236 patients met study criteria; 74.3% were female. Mean age for females was 45.5 years and for males it was 47.5 years. In total, 17.0% had an all-cause inpatient stay in the 360-day post index, and 3.2% had an in patient stay with a MS relapse-related diagnosis as primary discharge diagnosis. Additional MS-related diagnoses that led to inpatient stays included other demyelinating CNS disease (0.3%), symptom-related diagnoses (1.0%), and rehabilitation (1.1%). All-cause inpatient cost was higher for males vs females across all age groups; however, cost for females increased at a greater rate as age increased (p = 0.0007). Symptom-related inpatient cost was flat for males, was lower for females than males at an average age of 30, and was greater for females than males at an average age of 60 (p = 0.0199). Cost for MS inpatient stays ($11,931), other demyelinating CNS-related stays ($14,931), and rehabilitation ($23,643) did not differ by age and sex. The average cost for any MS-related relapse inpatient stay was $13,761 and varied with increasing age (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Burden of illness for relapse among MS patients is substantial. Costs vary by age and sex depending on the discharge diagnosis. Inclusion of symptom-related and rehabilitation inpatient stays may account for an under-recognized proportion of total expenditures.","[Meletiche, D. M.; Phillips, A.

Large variations are possible in the path flows obtained using different UETAP solution algorithms. Many transportation planning and management applications entail the need for path flows. This raises the issue of generating a meaningful path flow solution in practice. Past studies have sought to determine a single path flow solution using the maximum entropy concept. This study proposes an alternate approach to determine a single path flow solution that represents the entropy weighted average of the UETAP path flow solution space. It has the minimum expected Euclidean distance from all other path flow solution vectors of the UETAP. The mathematical model of the proposed entropy weighted average method is derived and its solution stability is proved. The model is easy to interpret and generalizes the proportionality condition of Bar-Gera and Boyce (1999). Results of numerical experiments using networks of different sizes suggest that the path flow solutions for the UETAP using the proposed method are about identical to those obtained using the maximum entropy approach. The entropy weighted average method requires low computational effort and is easier to implement, and can therefore serve as a potential alternative to the maximum entropy approach in practice.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the newer topical absorbable hemostat products Surgicel* Fibrillary and Surgicel SNoWz (Surgicel advanced products, abbreviated as SAPs) compared to the older product Surgicel Original (SO) with respect to healthcare resource use and costs in procedures where these hemostats are most commonly used. Research design and methods: A retrospective analysis of the Premier hospital database was used to identify adults who underwent brain/ cerebral (BC), cardiovascular (CV: valve surgery and coronary artery bypass graft) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) between January 2011-December 2012. Among these patients, those treated with SAPs were compared to those treated with SO. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create comparable groups to evaluate differences between SAPs and SO. Main outcome measures: The primary end-points for this study were length of stay (LOS), all-cause total cost, number of intensive care unit (ICU) days, ICU cost, transfusion costs and units, and SO/SAP product units per discharge. Results: Matched PSM created patient cohorts for SO and SAPs were created for BC (n = 758 for both groups), CV (n = 3388 for both groups), and CEA (n = 2041 for both groups) procedures. Patients that received SAPs had a 14-16% lower mean LOS for each procedure compared to SO, as well as 12-18% lower total mean cost per discharge for each procedure (p<0.02 for all results). Mean ICU costs for SAPs were also lower, with a reduction of 20% for BC and 19% for CV compared to SO (p<0.01). However, for CEA, there was no statistically significant difference in ICU costs for SAPs compared to SO. Conclusions: In a retrospective hospital database analysis, the use of SAPs were associated with lower healthcare resource utilization and costs compared to SO.","[Martyn, Derek; Meckley, Lisa M.; Miyasato, Gavin; Prifti, Katerina; Rao, Yajing; Scaife, Jillian G.; Soneji, Yogesh] Trin Partners LLC, Waltham, MA USA; [Kocharian, Richard; Riebman, Jerome B.] Ethicon Inc, Med Affairs, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA; [Lim, Sangtaeck; Corral, Mitra] Ethicon Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Market Access, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA",,"Corral, M (通讯作者)，Ethicon Inc, 737 US 22, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 USA.",mcorral3@ITS.JNJ.com,"Meckley, Lisa M/E-1561-2013","Meckley, Lisa/0000-0002-4791-4294","Ethicon, Inc.","Ethicon, Inc.","This study was funded by Ethicon, Inc.",,0,10,13,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

An analysis was undertaken of aggregated payer data to determine economic costs of non-unions treated with surgery only vs non-unions treated conservatively with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) only. Methods: This study used administrative claims from a health plan database including nearly 80 million people. Patients with a claim for non-union surgery or LIPUS for non-union were identified, from April 2007 until April 2010. A retrospective cohort was formed by pairwise demographic matching among patients who received 'Surgery Only' or 'LIPUS Only'. Date of the first non-union intervention (surgery or LIPUS) was defined as the index date. All medical costs were assessed over 12 months following the index date for the 'Surgery Only' and 'LIPUS Only' cohorts. Results: A total of 1158 matched patients were identified. 'Surgery Only' patients used significantly more healthcare services. In the year following intervention, ` Surgery Only' patients had total medical costs $6289 higher than ` LIPUS Only' patients (Mean = $11,276 vs $4986; p<0.0001). Outpatient costs accounted for >68% of overall costs in both cohorts, and outpatient costs were significantly higher among the ` Surgery Only' cohort (Mean = $7682 vs $4196; p<0.0001). Total inpatient costs were also significantly higher among the ` Surgery Only' cohort (Mean = $3302 vs $381; p<0.0001). Limitations: Limitations of this work are typical of all studies based on administrative claims data: errors in the database are assumed to distribute randomly between cohorts, and some patients may have been miscoded as to treatment received or costs billed. Conclusions: 'Surgery Only' patients used significantly and substantially more healthcare services in treatment of fracture non-union. Conservative treatment with 'LIPUS only' for fracture non-union could potentially result in cost savings projected to $4 billion dollars annually in the US.","[Mehta, Samir] Univ Penn, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Long, Ken; Steen, R.

This study evaluated treatment persistence and adherence across newer anti-hyperglycemic agents (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, liraglutide, or exenatide). Methods: This retrospective cohort study of Truven Health Analytics Marketscan databases included adult patients with type 2 diabetes whose first pharmacy claim for a newer anti-hyperglycemic agent was between February 1, 2014 and July 31, 2014. Treatment persistence and adherence were assessed for 12 months after the first claim (post-index). Persistence was defined as no gap 90 days between the end of one pharmacy claim and the start of the next pharmacy claim post-index. Adherence used two definitions: proportion of days covered (PDC) and medication possession ratio (MPR). Multivariable analyses of non-persistence (hazard ratios) and adherence (odds ratios) were adjusted for baseline demographics, drug cost, clinical characteristics, and other anti-hyperglycemic agents. Results: A total of 11,961 patients met all study selection criteria. Persistence rates at 12 months were significantly greater (p<0.05 for each comparison) for canagliflozin 100 mg (61%) compared with dapagliflozin 5mg (40%), dapagliflozin 10mg (41%), sitagliptin (48%), saxagliptin (42%), linagliptin (52%), liraglutide (47%), exenatide (23%), and long-acting exenatide (39%). The persistence rate was greater (p<0.05) for canagliflozin 300mg (64%) vs canagliflozin 100 mg. Median adherence rates for canagliflozin 100mg (MPR=0.83; PDC=0.79) and canagliflozin 300 mg (MPR=0.92; PDC=0.81) were greater than for the other index anti-hyperglycemic agents (MPR=0.33-0.75; PDC=0.33-0.72). Consistent results for treatment persistence and adherence were observed in multivariable analyses that were adjusted baseline characteristics. Conclusions: Canagliflozin was associated with better treatment persistence and treatment adherence compared with other anti-hyperglycemic agents in real-world settings.","[Cai, Jennifer; Chow, Wing] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, 1000 US Highway 202 S, Raritan, NJ 08869 USA; [Wang, Yuexi; Baser, Onur; Xie, Lin] STATinMED Res, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Baser, Onur] Columbia Univ, Ctr Innovat & Outcomes Res, New York, NY USA; [Chow, Wing] Johnson & Johnson Co, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Columbia University; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Cai, J (通讯作者)，Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, 1000 US Highway 202 S, Raritan, NJ 08869 USA.",jcai22@its.jnj.com,"Wang, Yuexi/AAI-2502-2020; Xie, Lin/AAX-2889-2020",,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC provided funding to STATinMED Research to conduct the analyses.",,38,30,31,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

It remains challenging to incorporate its effect into travel choice behaviors, although there has been some research into this area. Considering random interaction among travelers, we model travelers' day-to-day route choice under the uncertain traffic condition. We further explore the evolution of network flow based on the individual-level route choice model, though that travelers are heterogeneous in decision-making under the random-interaction scheme. We analyze and prove the existence of equilibrium and the stability of equilibrium. We also analyzed and described the specific properties of the network flow evolution and travelers' behaviors. Two interesting phenomena are found in this study. First, the number of travelers that an individual interacts with can affect his route choice strategy. However, the interaction count exerts no influence on the evolution of network flow at the aggregate-level. Second, when the network flow reaches equilibrium, the route choice strategy at the individual-level is not necessarily invariable. Finally, two networks are used as numerical examples to show model properties and to demonstrate the two study phenomena. This study improves the understanding of travelers' route choice dynamics and informs how the network flow evolves under the influence of social interaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We show how one can estimate operational level parameters such as the number of servers at the ports, schedules of departure and capacity of trains, and even speed of trains based on only snapshots of container movements in the network. Subsequently, we were able to calibrate the entire inter-continental transportation network, were able to identify the sources of variability in the network and were able to measure the reliability of the network to shocks.

Immunocompetent HZ-patients were identified and directly matched 1:1 with immunocompetent non-HZ controls using demographic and clinical variables. Analysis was limited to claims 21 days prior to through the first year following HZ diagnosis. Cases with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) were analyzed separately.Results: A total of 98,916HZ-patients were matched to controls. HZ-patients had a mean age of 50.4 (SD=18.8) years and 56.6% were females. HZ-cases had significantly higher RU (0.016 inpatient visits, 0.153 ER visits, 2.116 outpatient office visits, and 3.730 other outpatient services) compared to controls (p<0.001). Differences increased substantially in the presence of PHN. Total mean incremental healthcare costs for HZ-cases were $1308 and quadrupled to $5463 in those with PHN (both p<0.001). Overall, primary cost drivers were outpatient prescriptions and other outpatient services. For those with PHN, inpatient services also played a significant role.Limitations: This study was limited to only those individuals with US commercial health coverage or private Medicare supplemental coverage; therefore, results of this analysis may not be generalizable to HZ patients outside of the US, with other health insurance or without coverage.Conclusions: HZ presents a significant economic and resource burden on the US healthcare system among immunocompetent patients of nearly all ages, particularly when complicated by PHN.","[Johnson, Barbara H.; Palmer, Liisa; Lenhart, Gregory] Truven Hlth Analyt, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Gatwood, Justin] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Pharm, Nashville, TN USA; [Kawai, Kosuke] Harvard Med Sch, Boston Childrens Hosp, Clin Res Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Acosta, Camilo J.] Merck & Co Inc, Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, Kenilworth, NJ USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; Harvard University; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Merck & Company,"Johnson, BH (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 150 Cambridge Pk Dr, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA.",barbara.h.johnson@truvenhealth.com,,,"Merck Co., Inc.","Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company)","This manuscript and the work described herein was funded by Merck & Co., Inc.",,26,11,13,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

First, we formulate the TIP into a 0-1 integer programming model. Then, we decompose the itinerary optimization into a macroscopic tour (i.e., visiting sequence between cities) selection process and a microscopic number (i.e., flight number, train number for each piece of movement) selection process, and use an implicit enumeration algorithm to solve the optimal combination of tour and numbers. By integrating the itinerary optimization approach and Web crawler technology, we develop a smart travel system that is able to capture online transport data and recommend the optimal itinerary that satisfies travelers' preferences in departure time, arrival time, cabin class, and transport mode. Finally, we present case studies based on real-life transport data to illustrate the usefulness of itinerary optimization for minimizing travel cost, the computational efficiency of the implicit enumeration algorithm, and the feasibility of the smart travel system.

The objective of this study was to estimate the budget impact of incorporating Propel post-ESS for CRS patients from a self-insured employer or third-party payer perspective. Methods: An Excel-based budget impact model was developed. Estimates of the prevalence of CRS, rates of ESS, and effectiveness outcomes, along with direct and indirect costs from CRS were obtained from published literature. A total population of 1.5 million members was hypothesized for the analysis. All cost data were adjusted to October 2015 US dollars using the Medical Care Component of the Consumer Price Index. The cost and clinical/economic characteristics of Propel were compared to other treatments commonly used to minimize post-operative complications. The primary outcome was the incremental budget impact reported using per-member-per-month (PMPM) costs. Scenario-based, probabilistic, and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to gauge the robustness of the results and identify the parameters with the most influence on the results. Results: For a US self-insured employer or a commercial health plan of 1.5 million members, the incremental PMPM impact of incorporating Propel was estimated to range from $0.003 to $0.036, respectively, for all members in the health plan. Sensitivity analyses identified the cost of Propel, probability of polyposis recurrence requiring medical intervention, probability of adhesion formation requiring surgical intervention, and the treatment costs for polyposis as the primary parameters influencing the results. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the use of Propel following ESS procedures has a negligible impact on the budget of a US self-insured employer or payer. The upfront cost of Propel was offset by savings associated with reduced probability for polyp recurrence, adhesion formation, and their subsequent treatment.","[Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rudmik, Luke] Univ Calgary, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Mallow, Peter J.; Palli, Swetha R.] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, Hlth Outcomes Res, Cincinnati, OH USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Calgary,"Rizzo, JA (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.",rizzologic@gmail.com,,,"Intersect ENT, Inc.","Intersect ENT, Inc.","This study was funded by Intersect ENT, Inc.

A shadow pricing and shadow credit approach is proposed and applied to an inland network. Such a model can help carriers undertake yield management at the operational level to improve financial performance in a post-conference era. Results also suggest a positive relationship between variability in the imbalance situation of laden containers in a particular trade and volatility of short-term back haul freight rates.

Two main families of population synthesis techniques can be distinguished: (a) fitting methods (iterative proportional fitting, updating) and (b) combinatorial optimization methods. During the last few years, a third outperforming family of population synthesis procedures has emerged, i.e., Markov process-based methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations. In this paper, an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach is presented, which can serve as a better alternative than the existing methods. The approach is characterized by a great flexibility and efficiency in terms of data preparation and model training. The HMM is able to reproduce the structural configuration of a given population from an unlimited number of micro-samples and a marginal distribution. Only one marginal distribution of the considered population can be used as a boundary condition to guide the synthesis of the whole population. Model training and testing are performed using the Survey on the Workforce of 2013 and the Belgian National Household Travel Survey of 2010. Results indicate that the HMM method captures the complete heterogeneity of the micro-data contrary to standard fitting approaches. The method provides accurate results as it is able to reproduce the marginal distributions and their corresponding multivariate joint distributions with an acceptable error rate (i.e., SRSME=0.54 for 6 synthesized attributes). Furthermore, the HMM outperforms IPF for small sample sizes, even though the amount of input data is less than that for IPF. Finally, simulations show that the HMM can merge information provided by multiple data sources to allow good population estimates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We prove that the expected value of the total cost in our proposed formulation is not affected by the correlations, while the variance can be miscomputed when arrival correlations are neglected. We also identify some implications of delay propagation when optimizing vehicle holding decisions in real-time.

One typical household travel can be observed as the consecutive school trip and work trip, which sends the traveler's children to school first and then drive to their workplaces. In this paper, we analyse the departure time choice of the household travels and the equilibrium trip scheduling, i.e., extending the standard Vickrey's bottleneck model from work commute with one single preferred arrival time (work start time) to household commute with two consecutive preferred arrival times (school start time and work start time). Then, we investigate one step toll in peak hour window to best manage the morning commute of household travels and analyse the impact of the school-work start time difference on individual cost, social cost and traffic managements, so that we can optimally set the school-work start time difference to minimize the total travel cost. In addition, an alternative tradable credit scheme is designed to manage the morning commute as a replacement of the road toll scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Efficacy of each agent was based on the results of a 541-patient clinical trial comparing OSS to PEG-ELS. Cleansing agent and colonoscopy procedure costs were calculated from OptumHealth Reporting & Insights claims data for 2010-Q12013. In the model, patients' colonoscopies were tracked over a 25 or 35 year time period until the patients reached age 75. The difference per patient per year (PPPY) in total cleansing agent and colonoscopy procedure costs over the time horizon between the OSS and PEG-ELS cohort was calculated. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the cost model. Results: The model showed lower cost for OSS patients over the time horizon. Total PPPY costs were $280.34 for the OSS cohort and $296.36 for the PEG-ELS cohort, resulting in a cost saving of $16.01 PPPY for the OSS cohort. This was due primarily to OSS patients having fewer colonoscopies (OSS: 0.158 vs PEG-ELS: 0.170 PPPY). Over the time horizon, cost savings of $4 763 335 were observed among 10, 000 OSS patients. Cost savings switched from OSS to PEG-ELS cohort in four cases: (1) base-case cost of a completed colonoscopy decreased by 75%, (2) base-case cost of OSS increased to over $143 per usage, (3) all non-completers were lost to follow-up, and (4) OSS bowel preparation quality dropped below PEG-ELS to 70%. Conclusions: From a payer's perspective, the model showed that the use of OSS as the cleansing agent resulted in potential cost savings compared with PEG-ELS. Cost savings under OSS remained under various sensitivity analyses.","[Lynn Huynh; Yermakov, Sander; Davis, Matthew; Campbell, Romaine; Yenikomshian, Mihran] Anal Grp, Boston, MA USA; [Cleveland, Mark] Braintree Labs, Braintree, MA USA; [Farraye, Francis A.] Boston Med Ctr, Boston, MA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Boston Medical Center,"Huynh, L (通讯作者)，111 Huntington Ave,Tenth Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",lynn.huynh@analysisgroup.com,,,"Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, MA","Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, MA","This work was supported by Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, MA.",,28,6,6,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Besides cost, we find that many shippers are most concerned with transit time in practice; shorter transit time indicates better transportation service. To minimize both the total cost and transit time, the problem faced by shippers is the biobjective transportation service procurement problem with transit time. To solve the problem, we introduce a biobjective integer programming model that can also accommodate some important business constraints. A biobjective branch-and-bound algorithm that finds all extreme supported nondominated solutions is developed. To speed up the algorithm, two fast feasibility checks, a network flow model for particular subproblems, and lower bounds from relaxation are proposed.

Specifically, we look into the day-to-day evolution of network flows that arises from travelers' route choices and their learning behavior on perceived travel costs. We show that the flow dynamics is analogous to a damped oscillatory system. The concepts of energies are introduced, including the potential energy and the kinetic energy. The potential energy, stored in each link, increases with the traffic flow on that link; the kinetic energy, generated by travelers' day-to-day route swapping, is proportional to the square of the path flow changing speed. The potential and kinetic energies are converted to each other throughout the whole flow evolution, and the total system energy keeps decreasing owing to travelers' tendency to stay on their current routes, which is analogous to the damping of a physical system. Finally, the system will approach the equilibrium state with minimum total potential energy and zero kinetic energy. We prove the stability of the day-to-day dynamics and provide numerical experiments to elucidate the interesting findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We study how to select the best subset of routing alternatives for each train among all possible alternatives. The real-time train routing selection problem is formulated as an integer linear programming formulation and solved via an algorithm inspired by the ant colonies' behavior. The real-time railway traffic management problem takes as input the best subset of routing alternatives and is solved as a mixed-integer linear program. The proposed methodology is tested on two practical case studies of the French railway infrastructure: the Lille terminal station area and the Rouen line. The computational experiments are based on several practical disturbed scenarios.

Rather successful health reforms in leading emerging markets such as BRICS reveal a reshaping of their medical care-related expenditures. There is a scarcity of evidence explaining differences in long-term medical spending patterns between top ranked G7 traditional welfare economies and the BRICS nations.Methods:A retrospective observational study was conducted on a longitudinal WHO Global Health Expenditure data-set based on the National Health Accounts (NHA) system. Data were presented in a simple descriptive manner, pointing out health expenditure dynamics and differences between the two country groups (BRICS and G7) and individual nations in a 1995-2013 time horizon.Results:Average total per capita health spending still remains substantially higher among G7 (4747 Purchase Power Parity (PPP) $PPP in 2013) compared to the BRICS (1004 $PPP in 2013) nations. The percentage point share of G7 in global health expenditure (million current PPP international $US) has been falling constantly since 1995 (from 65% in 1995 to 53.2% in 2013), while in BRICS nations it grew (from 10.7% in 1995 to 20.2% in 2013). Chinese national level medical spending exceeded significantly that of all G7 members except the US in terms of current $PPP in 2013.Conclusions:Within a limited time horizon of only 19 years it appears that the share of global medical spending by the leading emerging markets has been growing steadily. Simultaneously, the world's richest countries' global share has been falling constantly, although it continues to dominate the landscape. If the contemporary global economic mainstream continues, the BRICS per capita will most likely reach or exceed the OECD average in future decades. Rising out-of-pocket expenses threatening affordability of medical care to poor citizens among the BRICS nations and a too low percentage of GDP in India remain the most notable setbacks of these developments.","[Jakovljevic, Mihajlo Michael] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Med Sci, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Jakovljevic, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Hlth Econ & Pharmacoecon, Svetozara Markov 69, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",sidartagothama@gmail.com,"Jakovljevic, Mihajlo/B-3002-2014","Jakovljevic, Mihajlo/0000-0002-9160-6846",Ministry of Education Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [OI 175014],"Ministry of Education Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",The underlying studies providing evidence for this contribution where funded out of The Ministry of Education Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia Grant OI 175014.

Given boundedly rational route choice behavior, the lower-level program is replaced with the boundedly rational user equilibria (BRUE). The network design problem with boundedly rational route choice behavior is understudied due to non-uniqueness of the BRUE. In this study, thus, we mainly focus on boundedly rational toll pricing (BR-TP) with affine link cost functions. The topological properties of the lower level BRUE set are first explored. As the BRUE solution is generally non-unique, urban planners cannot predict exactly which equilibrium flow pattern the transportation network will operate after a planning strategy is implemented. Due to the risk caused by uncertainty of people's reaction, two extreme scenarios are considered: the traffic flow patterns with either the minimum system travel cost or the maximum, which is the risk-prone (BR-TP-RP) or the risk-averse (BR-TP-RA) scenario respectively. The upper level BR-TP is to find an optimal toll minimizing the total system travel cost, while the lower level is to find the best or the worst scenario. Accordingly BR-TP can be formulated as either a min -min or a min -max program. Solution existence is discussed based on the topological properties of the BRUE and algorithms are proposed. Two examples are accompanied to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the monotonicity of the route travel cost functions cannot be ensured even if the route travel time functions are monotone. In contrast to traditional formulations, this paper formulates a DUO-SRDTC problem (that can have fixed or elastic demand) as a system of nonlinear equations. The system of nonlinear equations is a function of generalized origin-destination (OD) travel costs rather than route flows and includes a dynamic user optimal (DUO) route choice subproblem with perfectly elastic demand and a quadratic programming (QP) subproblem under certain assumptions. This study also proposes a solution method based on the backtracking inexact Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, the extragradient algorithm, and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The BFGS method, the extragradient algorithm, and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are used to solve the system of nonlinear equations, the DUO route choice subproblem, and the QP subproblem, respectively. The proposed formulation and solution method can avoid the requirement of monotonicity of the route travel cost functions to obtain a convergent solution and provide a new approach with which to solve DUO-SRDTC problems. Finally, numeric examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, count models are typically considered to be different from random utility models such as the multinomial logit (MNL) model. In this paper, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models that are consistent with the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) framework and that subsume standard count models including Poisson, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Binomial, and Logarithmic models as special cases were developed. The ability of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) inference approach to retrieve the parameters of the resulting GEV count models was examined using synthetic data. The simulation results indicate that the ML estimation technique performs quite well in terms of recovering the true parameters of the proposed GEV count models. Also, the models developed were used to analyze the monthly telecommuting frequency decisions of workers. Overall, the empirical results demonstrate superior data fit and better predictive performance of the GEV models compared to standard count models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are designed to be highly relevant to patients with a specific disease. They have advantages over generic PROs that lack relevance to patient groups and miss crucial impacts of illness. It is thought that disease-specific measurement cannot be used in comparative effectiveness research (CER). The present study provides further evidence of the value of disease-specific measures in making valid comparisons across diseases. Methods The Asthma Life Impact Scale (ALIS, 22 items), Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (LCOPD, 22 items) scale, and Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR, 25 items) were completed by 140, 162, and 91 patients, respectively. The three samples were analyzed for fit to the Rasch model, then combined into a scale consisting of 58 unique items and re-analyzed. Raw scores on the three measures were co-calibrated and a transformation table produced. Results The scales fit the Rasch model individually (ALIS Chi(2) probability value (p-Chi(2)) = 0.05; LCOPD p-Chi(2) = 0.38; CAMPHOR p-Chi(2) = 0.92). The combined data also fit the Rasch model (p-Chi(2) = 0.22). There was no differential item functioning related to age, gender, or disease. The co-calibrated scales successfully distinguished between perceived severity groups (p < 0.001). Limitations The samples were drawn from different sources. For scales to be co-calibrated using a common item design, they must be based on the same theoretical construct, be unidimensional, and have overlapping items. Conclusions The results showed that it is possible to co-calibrate scores from disease-specific PRO measures. This will permit more accurate and sensitive outcome measurement to be incorporated into CER. The co-calibration of needs-based disease-specific measures allows the calculation of gamma scores that can be used to compare directly the impact of any type of interventions on any diseases included in the co-calibration.","[Rouse, M.; Twiss, J.; McKenna, S.

This phenomenon contributes to increase the outdoor pollutants concentration and the energy demand for air conditioning. Indoor microclimate conditions depend on several parameters related mainly to the building destination, envelope materials and orientation, its technological equipment, and to the specific region climate. The use of green shading can induce energy savings also in winter, by reducing heat losses from the external surface during mainly the night. An experimental study was carried out at the University of Bari ( Italy, 41 degrees 05 'N, 16 degrees 53 'E) from June 2014 to April 2015 with the aim of investigating the effective influences of this green passive system on a building vertical wall. Three vertical walls were built and equipped with a sealed structure on the backside; the walls were made with perforated bricks. The walls were covered with different evergreen climbing plants: Pandorea jasminoides variegated for the first wall and Rhyncospermum jasminoides for the second one. A third wall was kept uncovered and used as control. A data logger and sensors were used to measure and collect the temperature of the wall, on the surface exposed to the solar radiation and on the inner surface protected by the sealed structure, the external air temperature, the wind speed and direction, the solar radiation falling on the wall. The experimental tests showed that during the daytime of warmest periods the use of the green walls allowed a reduction of the external surface temperature registered on the walls shielded by the green systems: the temperatures observed were lower than the respective temperatures of the control wall of about 3-4.5 degrees C. During the nighttime of coldest periods the use of the green wall allowed to keep the external surface temperature of the walls shielded by the green systems at values higher than the control wall ones: the temperatures observed were higher than the respective temperatures of the control wall of about 2-3 degrees C.

Thus, sustainable claims are becoming credence attributes that compete with other quality indications on a wine label and might influence the choice, the quality perception and willingness to pay (WTP). The objective of this study is twofold: first, to explore the concept of consumers' perception of sustainable wine and second, to investigate different cluster groups based on three factors identified (belief about environmental protection, beliefs about sustainable wine certification and attitude towards sustainable labelled wine) and WTP.

This study examines the impact of local food systems (i.e., access to healthy foods and unhealthy foods) and other control variables on adult obesity rates, general health conditions, and mortality rates in counties across the United States. The findings suggest that adult obesity disproportionately impacts people with less access to healthy food, fewer resources to make healthy food choices, and often lacking the health care needed to provide intervention and care for obesity related health concerns. Policies that seek to reduce obesity will require addressing the underlying socioeconomic and environmental conditions that prevent individuals from making healthier food choices.
