Evidence from a German federal state,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Municipal mergers; Economies of scale; Voluntary and compulsory mergers,SIZE; AMALGAMATIONS; DEMOCRACY,"We study the fiscal consequences of municipal mergers by making use of a large-scale merger reform in the German federal state of Brandenburg. This reform, which was implemented from 2001 to 2003, led to a substantial reduction in the number of municipalities. Individual mergers were heterogeneous across a number of dimensions, which allows us to contribute to the literature by exploring the consequences of different types of mergers within the same institutional setting. Focusing in particular on the distinction between compulsory and (semi-)voluntary mergers, we implement a difference-in-difference design with panel data from 1995-2010 at the level of post-merger municipalities. We find significant reductions in (administrative) expenditures after compulsory mergers. Voluntary mergers, on the other hand, have no effect on expenditures. We also show that the effects of voluntary and compulsory mergers vary according to further (secondary) characteristics of a merger. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Price simulations are based on an extended user cost model that incorporates two dimensions of behavioral change in home buyers: sensitivity of borrowing and the propensity to use tax deductions. We simulate prices with both inelastic and elastic supply. Our results show a wide range of price effects across metropolitan areas and prospective policies. Considering behavioral change and no supply elasticity, eliminating the MID results in average home price declines as steep as 13.5% in Washington, D.C., and as small as 3.5% in Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FL. Converting the MID to a 15% refundable credit reduces prices by as much as 1.4% in San Jose, CA, San Francisco, CA, and Washington, D.C. and increases average price in other metropolitan areas by as much as 12.1% (Miami-Fort Lauderdale).

Using recently developed club convergence methods, we identify three unique clubs in China, each with markedly different energy intensity profiles. Unlike in previous studies, our club groupings do not strictly adhere to common geographic separations e.g. east, west and central divisions. To better understand what commonalities/disparities lay behind their groupings, we undertake a regression of the determinants of energy intensity, in a similar vein to a number of recent studies. Doing so, we demonstrate a number of significant differences in the determinants for each of the identified clubs, given which we are able to offer a rich set of policy implications. Not all determinants are common across the three clubs, and where they are common, they can differ both in magnitude and sign, reflecting the fundamental differences across the groups.","[Zhang, Dayong; Broadstock, David C.] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Broadstock, DC (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China.",davidbroadstock@swufe.edu.cn,"Zhang, Dayong/ABD-4989-2021; Wu, Fei/T-6613-2019","Zhang, Dayong/0000-0001-8722-176X; Broadstock, David/0000-0002-7651-8004","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573214, 71550110255]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),David C.

In the econometric analysis, based on zero-inflated models, we simultaneously estimate the probability of engaging in a cross-border M&A and the intensity of the deals. This allows us to adequately model the two different mechanisms which may result in the absence of deals in the cross-border bilateral M&A transactions. The absence of deals may be due to either the lack of any transactions or unsuccessful negotiations. Taking into account the effect of population, gross domestic product, technological capital, financial conditions and quality of the institutions, we find robust evidence that the multi-dimensional distance between two countries negatively affects both the probability and the intensity of M&A deals.","[Di Guardo, Maria Chiara; Marrocu, Emanuela; Paci, Raffaele] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Cagliari, Italy; [Marrocu, Emanuela; Paci, Raffaele] Univ Cagliari, CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari; University of Cagliari,"Di Guardo, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Cagliari, Italy.",,"; Marrocu, Emanuela/E-2903-2017","PACI, RAFFAELE/0000-0003-0301-438X; di guardo, maria chiara/0000-0002-2821-0427; Marrocu, Emanuela/0000-0002-7436-0055","European Union [FP7-SSH-2010-2.2-1, 266834]",European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7-SSH-2010-2.2-1 (2011-2014) under grant agreement no 266834 SEARCH project.

Firms with high-productivity risk own less CRE assets. When testing dynamic changes to CRE holdings, we estimate a significant and positive elasticity of CRE investments of 5.2% in response to cash flow shocks. If the adjustment cost is high, high-risk firms are expected to hold less CRE assets, so that they could reduce potential losses associated with CRE holdings when negative productive shocks occur.","[Zhao, Daxuan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Daxuan] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Zhao, Daxuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119077, Singapore; [Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",Renmin University of China; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Zhao, DX (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Zhao, DX (通讯作者)，Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore 138632, Singapore.;Zhao, DX (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119077, Singapore.;Sing, TF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",zhaodaxuan@gmail.com; rststf@nus.edu.sg,"Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X; Zhao, Daxuan/0000-0002-9542-779X",,,,,30,16,16,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2016,44.0,2,,,,,521,547,,10.1111/1540-6229.12112,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DJ3ZF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374144500007,0

The only exception concerned the redistributive effects of gold between trading nations. Dupuit's approach to credit and his views on the issuance of banknotes were distinct from those of most French liberals. He did not consider credit to be capital, and he warned against the overissue of banknotes.","[Numa, Guy] Inst New Econ Thinking, 300 Pk Ave South, New York, NY 10010 USA",,"Numa, G (通讯作者)，Inst New Econ Thinking, 300 Pk Ave South, New York, NY 10010 USA.",gnuma@ineteconomics.org,,,,,,,82,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We use propensity score weighting methods and a large longitudinal Danish administrative dataset which allows us to control for a wide range of important baseline characteristics such as education, sector of employment, labour market status, income, health, and demographics. We find that the educational gradient in the effect of cancer is significant in the public sector, where the estimated effects are 11.5 and 3.8 percentage points, respectively, for the low-and high-educated. The corresponding estimates for the private sector are 6.2 and 3.2 percentage points and here the educational gradient is only marginally significant.

Probabilities are evaluated from the perspective of a given type of anchor classified as low-, mid- or high-price. New findings include the trade-off between competition from same type anchors and localization benefits (different type) associated with comparison shopping in a retail cluster.

Over the last two decades, governments have been accepting significant reductions in trade taxes to support trade liberalization. This is particularly problematic for developing economies because trade taxes have been a key source of government revenues. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which international financial institutions (IFIs) successfully assist developing countries with recovering the lost revenue from trade liberalization by implementing various domestic tax reforms. We argue that regime type mediates the effectiveness of IFI assistance in developing economies, after trade reforms have been adopted. More specifically, IFIs will be more effective at assisting authoritarian regimes with domestic tax reforms as a substitute for trade taxes than they will be in poor democracies. Democratically elected leaders inadvertently undermine multilateral assistance with tax reforms because they are more susceptible to middle- and upper-class demands for lower taxes in a competitive global economy. In authoritarian regimes, on the other hand, IFIs such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund tend to be more effective because dictators are likely to experience far fewer political consequences for accepting IFI assistance and implementing tax reform in the global economy than their democratic counterparts.","[Bastiaens, Ida] Fordham Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Rudra, Nita] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Fordham University; Georgetown University,"Bastiaens, I (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",,,"rudra, nita/0000-0003-2336-0562",University of Bremen,University of Bremen,"We would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers as well as Hilary Appel, Tobias Boger, Sarah Brooks, Matthew Carnes, Santiago Lopez Cariboni, Stephen Chaudoin, Philipp Genschel, Christian von Haldenwang, Maksym Ivanyna, Achim Kemmerling, Quan Li, Hanna Lierse, Lauren MacLean, Irfan Nooruddin, Carina Schmitt, Laura Seelkopf, William Vlcek, and the participants of the American Political Science Association Annual Conference in 2015.

Women with continuous work histories are compared with those with gaps due to family leave, unemployment, or other reasons. The German Life History Study, the Swedish Level of Living Survey and the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth are used to estimate Cox regression models of the transition rate to downward or upward occupational mobility. The results indicate that US women face increased downward mobility with increasing duration of both family leave and unemployment. German women with unemployment experience are also more likely to encounter downward mobility, but no such relationship is found for family leave. In Sweden, family leave experience reduces the chances of upward mobility. Results question the human capital approach, according to which skills should deteriorate at the same rate independent of the reason for the leave.","[Evertsson, Marie] Stockholm Univ, Sociol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Grunow, Daniela] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Sociol, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Aisenbrey, Silke] Yeshiva Univ, Sociol, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Aisenbrey, Silke] Yeshiva Univ, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10033 USA",Stockholm University; Goethe University Frankfurt; Yeshiva University; Yeshiva University,"Evertsson, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",marie.evertsson@sociology.su.se,,,Swedish Research Council [2008-1816]; Swedish Social Insurance Agency [25550/2010]; Stockholm University Linnaeus Center for Social Policy and Family Dynamics in Europe (SPaDE) [349-2007-8701]; European Research Council through an ERC [263651]; European Research Council (ERC) [263651] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Social Insurance Agency; Stockholm University Linnaeus Center for Social Policy and Family Dynamics in Europe (SPaDE); European Research Council through an ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC),Marie Evertsson gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VR Dnr: 2008-1816) and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Dnr 25550/2010).

In order to test for the presence of low dimension sources of time variation in parameters and estimate their magnitudes, I develop the factor time varying parameter (Factor-TVP) framework and apply it to [Primiceri, G.E.

I find that one factor explains most of the variability in VAR coefficients, while the stochastic volatility parameters vary independently. The inclusion of post-Great Recession data causes an important change within VAR coefficients and the procedure suggests two factors. The roots of variability in the VAR parameters are likely to have derived from the financial markets and the real sector. The TVP factors have predictive power for a large number of output, investment, and employment series, as well as for the term structure of interest rates.","[Stevanovic, Dalibor] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, 315 Ste Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Stevanovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, 315 Ste Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada.",dstevanovic.econ@gmail.com,"Stevanovic, Dalibor/ABE-7555-2020",,Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec),Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec),"I would like to thank Jean Boivin, Frank Diebold, Jean-Marie Dufour, Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, and Frank Schorfheide for valuable discussions and comments.

Make-up is measured by how much the true value is overstated, suspicion by how much the price offer differs from the value message. We run different computerized treatments varying in information about the gender (constellation) and in embeddedness of gender information. The asymmetry of the game and of information allows for a robust assessment of gender (constellation) effects. We report here the results from just one shot round decision since we expect such effects to be more pronounced for inexperienced participants. We mainly find an effect of gender constellation: when female sellers are aware to confront a female buyer, they overstate more, i.e. there is more make-up. However, we cannot confirm gender (constellation) effects for suspicion.","[Di Cagno, D.; Galliera, A.; Gueth, W.] Luiss Guido Carli, Rome, Italy; [Gueth, W.] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gueth, W.] Max Planck Inst Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Pace, N.] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Venice, Italy; [Panaccione, L.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Max Planck Society; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Di Cagno, D (通讯作者)，Luiss Guido Carli, Rome, Italy.",ddicagno@luiss.it; agalliera@luiss.it; gueth@coll.mpg.de; n.pace@unive.it; luca.panaccione@uniroma2.it,,"Pace, Noemi/0000-0001-6413-4890; Galliera, Arianna/0000-0002-7320-0770; di cagno, daniela/0000-0002-9208-7654",Max Planck Institute of Jena,Max Planck Institute of Jena,We would like to thank the Max Planck Institute of Jena for funding and supporting this research.,,20,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2016,80.0,3,,,,,463,471,,10.1007/s11238-015-9497-9,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DG7OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372272800008,0

In these cases, the collective preference includes cycles and even could prevent the election of any alternative as the collective choice. The likelihood of consistent outcomes under a class of majority rules constitutes the aim of this paper. Specifically, we focus on majority rules that require certain consensus in individual preferences to declare an alternative as the winner. Under majorities based on difference of votes, the requirement asks to the winner alternative to obtain a difference in votes with respect to the loser alternative taking into account that individuals are endowed with weak preference orderings. Same requirement is asked to the restriction of these rules to individual linear preferences.","[Diss, Mostapha] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Diss, Mostapha] CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Diss, Mostapha] Univ Jean Monnet, F-42000 St Etienne, France; [Perez-Asurmendi, Patrizia] Univ Valladolid, Grp Invest PRESAD, Avda Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [Perez-Asurmendi, Patrizia] Univ Publ Navarra, Grp Invest SEED, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Diss, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.;Diss, M (通讯作者)，CNRS, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69130 Ecully, France.;Diss, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jean Monnet, F-42000 St Etienne, France.",diss@gate.cnrs.fr; patrizia.perez@eco.uva.es,"Perez-Asurmendi, Patrizia/A-6234-2016","Perez-Asurmendi, Patrizia/0000-0002-2626-4456","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-32178, ECO2012-34202]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors are grateful to the editor, two anonymous referees, Ahmad Fliti, Jose Luis Garcia-Lapresta, Bonifacio Llamazares, Ana Perez Espartero, and Rachid Seghir for their valuable suggestions and comments.

Against this background, this article reviews arguments and existing blueprints for sovereign insolvency procedures in the euro area and develops a Viable Insolvency Procedure for Sovereigns. This procedure avoids any sudden measures which could destabilize the present fragile situation but carefully designs an irreversible transition toward the new regime.

The combination of the non-linear structure with the long memory framework produces a model which is linear in parameters and therefore it permits the estimation of the deterministic terms by standard OLS-GLS methods. Moreover, the orthogonality property of Chebyshev's polynomials makes them especially attractive to approximate non-linear structures of data. We present a procedure which allows us to test (possibly fractional) orders of integration at various frequencies in the presence of the Chebyshev trends with no effect on the standard limit distribution of the method. Several Monte Carlo experiments are conducted and the results indicate that the method performs well. An empirical application, using data of real exchange rates is also carried out at the end of the article.","[Alberiko Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Navarra; University of Sheffield,"Gil-Alana, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",alana@unav.es,"Cuestas, Juan Carlos/K-4270-2014","Cuestas, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7313-2157","Ministry of Education of Spain [ECO2011-2014 ECON Y FINANZAS]; Jeronimo de Ayanz project of the Government of Navarra; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain) [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]","Ministry of Education of Spain(Spanish Government); Jeronimo de Ayanz project of the Government of Navarra; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain)(Spanish Government)","The authors gratefully acknowledge Jenny Roberts and Kostas Mouratidis, the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comment.

To establish the rationale for FDM, the paper studies the effects of the agent interactions at the core of supply chains, and identifies the important role played by the receivers of supplies in determining when and how deliveries are made. The paper classifies the various modalities of FDM, and summarizes the real-life experiences of their implementation. To illustrate the potential of FDM, the paper analyzes Receiver-Led Consolidation (RLC) programs. The paper provides background on consolidation programs, and estimates a behavioral model to shed light on the factors explaining receivers' interest in cargo consolidation. The resulting model is used to estimate expected participation in a RLC program in New York City. These results are complemented with freight-trip generation analyses, and a behavioral micro-simulation to estimate potential reductions in freight traffic and vehicle-miles-traveled. The results show that RLC programs could bring significant benefits to large metropolitan areas, reducing freight vehicle-miles-traveled and congestion levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The spoken culture of Dongeng Hui Cilembu (Tale of Cilembu Sweet Potato) has made the locals believe that the cultivation of Cilembu sweet potato can only be performed in Cilembu village, thus if grown in other regions, it will not be sweet. This belief generates problems when sweet potato export demand increases while the fields are limited, harvest acceleration is hampered and the price of crop is low because the management is still conventional. On the one hand, Dongeng Hui Cilembu can maintain local wisdom. However, on the other hand, decreased productivity causes financial problems for the farmers. The subject of the study is the young people of Cilembu village and the object of the study is Dongeng Hui Cilembu. This study used the qualitative method with case study approach. Data were collected through interview, observation and document study. Dongeng Hui Cilembu which is believed to be a myth, in fact can be an effective marketing content in the cybernetics era. The marketing of Cilembu sweet potato seeds that is wrapped with ethnostorytelling is an interesting part from the study's findings. Dongeng Hui Cilembu as a folktale can boost the sales of Cilembu sweet potato seeds and increase the farmers' revenue (micro-financial) that affects not only the preservation of local wisdom but also sustainability of economic development.","[Agustina, Susanti] Indonesia Univ Educ, Fac Sci Educ, Dept Curriculum & Educ Technol, Lib & Informat Sci Study Program, Kota Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Erwina, Wina] Padjadjaran State Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Lib, Fac Commun, Sumedang, Indonesia",Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia; Universitas Padjadjaran,"Agustina, S (通讯作者)，Indonesia Univ Educ, Fac Sci Educ, Dept Curriculum & Educ Technol, Lib & Informat Sci Study Program, Kota Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.",susanti@upi.edu,"Erwina, Wina/AAV-3871-2021; Agustina, Susanti/GPC-5890-2022","Agustina, Susanti/0000-0003-3912-1363",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-264-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,18.0,,,,,,20,26,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390913100004,0

Equalized income of the household is perceived as a general indicator of economic sources available to each household member and suitable to perform comparisons across countries and regions. Unfortunately, there does not exist any generally accepted methodology of equivalent income calculation. In the presented paper authors discuss equivalent scales which in a different manner incorporate adults and children in the households according to their age in order to evaluate the number of consumption units. The influence of chosen method on basic summary characteristics of equalized incomes and on the chosen indicators of poverty and inequality is demonstrated on the data file from large European sample survey on incomes and living conditions of households EU-SILC. The paper focuses also on dependence of the relative welfare (represented by the scaling using equalized income) on the type of household.

The paper first presents a neoclassical general equilibrium model with heterogeneous production units. It assumes that developing countries do not generate frontier technologies but can adopt them by investing in new capital, which requires firm renewal. The model analyzes how this process can be hindered by barriers to the entry of new investment projects and the exit of obsolete ones. It finds that there are nonlinearities in the way entry and exit barriers operate: Barriers have increasing costs, and they reinforce each other's negative impact. The paper then calibrates and simulates the model to measure the impact of these barriers on the GDP per capita gap between the United States and a large sample of developing countries. It accounts for a range of 26 to 60% of the income gap between the United States and 107 developing countries. Most importantly, the model implies that, for the median developing economy, about 50% of the simulated gap is explained by the interaction of entry and exit barriers (and the rest by their individual effects). The paper's main policy implication is that only comprehensive reforms can have substantial effects, especially when initial distortions are large. If they are too narrow (focusing on only one barrier) or too mild (leaving in place a large distortion), microeconomic reforms are unlikely to have significant effects on aggregate productivity and output growth.","[Loayza, Norman V.] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bergoeing, Raphael] Univ Chile, Chiles Ctr Publ Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Bergoeing, Raphael] Univ Chile, Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Piguillem, Facundo] Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",The World Bank; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Loayza, NV (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",rbergoeing@cepchile.cl; nloayza@worldbank.org; facundo.piguillem@gmail.com,,,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program; World Bank's Japan Consultant Trust Fund; Chile's Fondecyt [1070805],World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program; World Bank's Japan Consultant Trust Fund; Chile's Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"The research from this article was financed by the World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program, the World Bank's Japan Consultant Trust Fund, and Chile's Fondecyt #1070805.

Combining regulatory data from a survey on Italian provinces before the reform (costs and time to start a business) with industry-level entry rates of limited liability firms, I explore the effects of regulatory barriers on the average of the annual entry rates across industries with different natural propensities to enter the market. The estimates of the cross-sectional analysis show that lengthier and, to some extent, more costly procedures reduced entry in sectors with naturally high entry. A one-day delay in registration procedures reduces the entry rate in highly dynamic sectors by more than 1 percent.

Machines can be placed at different locations in the manufacturing area however, the manipulating arm delivers all semi-products. Moreover, the semi-products are moved to the required machine as well as to the storing zone with use of the same arm. Minimizing the total order realization time is the basic criterion as it brings the total manufacturing costs down. The analysis of the whole problem is supported by means of the simulator created exclusively for the purpose of this work. Implementing various initial data leads to obtaining certain results which are subsequently analyzed thoroughly in order to evaluate the simulation case study. Conclusions form the basis for the derivation of the significant assumptions about further development of information control of logistic systems.","[Chramcov, Bronislav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Nad Stranemi 4511, Zlin 76005, Czech Republic; [Bucki, Robert; Trzopek, Michal] Inst Management & Informat Technol, Ul Legionow 81, PL-43300 Bielsko Biala, Poland",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Chramcov, B (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Nad Stranemi 4511, Zlin 76005, Czech Republic.",chramcov@fai.utb.cz; rbucki@wsi.net.pl,"Bucki, Robert/HHZ-8009-2022; Chramcov, Bronislav/H-6413-2012","Chramcov, Bronislav/0000-0002-3252-1578",,,,,10,1,1,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,313,318,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500054,0

The main objective is to identify whether symptoms such as memory loss are related to normal ageing or to decline in cognitive functions, which is the key feature of dementia. In the identification of people with dementia little attention has been paid to statistical methods and approaches that may contribute to early diagnosis and identification of dementia. For example, logistic regression helps to explain which characteristic or variable is an important criterion for dementia.

The research respondents included representatives of the Russian population, as well as experts who either had a certain experience in crowdsourcing activities or who were involved in practical arrangement of such projects. Among the key areas of focus in the field of crowdsourcing application for improved functioning of public authorities, the respondents identify the following: control over the public authorities while solving the problems critical for the local population, informing the state bodies about such issues and development of relevant tech-savvy strategies for their solutions. The study results suggest that despite the need in such practice from the point of view of the regional population, the current level of crowdsourcing development is not enough for its active and efficient use, resulting in solution of social and state problems.","[Dolzhenko, Ruslan] Altai State Univ, Ul Lenina 61, RF-656049 Barnaul, Russia; [Ginieva, Svetlana] Ural State Univ Econ, 8 Marta Str,62, RF-620144 Ekaterinburg, Russia",Altai State University; Ural State University of Economics,"Dolzhenko, R (通讯作者)，Altai State Univ, Ul Lenina 61, RF-656049 Barnaul, Russia.",Snurk17@gmail.com; ginsb@yandex.ru,"Dolzhenko, Ruslan A/J-2847-2015; Dolzhenko (Ginieva), Svetlana/B-5311-2018","Dolzhenko (Ginieva), Svetlana/0000-0002-7658-516X",,,,,10,2,2,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,372,381,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100037,0

In this paper we point out a specific interpretation of consumer surplus in case of network industries production demand analysis. For the complex characteristics of the network industries market we now discuss a formalized analysis of the producer's activities on this market. Note that also a cost function of the supplier or the producer in this model of the network industry producer is of somewhat atypical pragmatic interpretation.

If countries specialised in renewables most suited to their own endowments and expanded international trade, we estimate that system costs in 2030 could be reduced by 5%, or Sic 15 billion a year, after allowing for the costs of extra transmission capacity, peaking generation and balancing operations needed to maintain electrical feasibility. Significant barriers must be overcome to unlock these savings. Countries that produce more renewable power should be compensated for the extra cost through tradable certificates, while those that buy from abroad will want to know that the power can be imported when needed. Financial Transmission Rights could offer companies investing abroad confidence that the power can be delivered to their consumers. They would hedge short-term fluctuations in prices and operate much more flexibly than the existing system of physical point-to-point rights on inter-connectors. Using FTRs to generate revenue for transmission expansion could produce perverse incentives to under-invest and raise their prices, so revenues from FTRs should instead be offset against payments under the existing ENTSO-E compensation scheme for transit flows. FTRs could also facilitate cross-border participation in capacity markets, which are likely to be needed to reduce risks for the extra peaking plants required.","[Green, Richard; Staffell, Iain] Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Pudjianto, Danny; Strbac, Goran] Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Green, R (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",,,"Green, Richard/0000-0002-8671-8966","Engineering and Physical Science Research Council [EP/L024756/1, EP/I031707/1]; Alan Howard Charitable Trust",Engineering and Physical Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Alan Howard Charitable Trust,"Research support from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, via Projects EP/L024756/1 (UKERC Phase III) and EP/I031707/1 (Transformation of the Top and Tail of Energy Networks), and from the Alan Howard Charitable Trust is gratefully acknowledged.

Motivated by connections to Internet advertising, several variants of this problem have been studied since the seminal work of Mehta, Saberi, Vazirani, and Vazirani (FOCS 2005). However, this entire body of work focuses on a single budget for every advertising campaign, whereas in order to fully represent the actual agenda of an advertiser, an advertising budget should be expressible over multiple tiers of user-attribute granularity. A simple example is an advertising campaign that is constrained by an overall budget but is also accompanied by a set of sub-budgets for each target demographic. In such a contract scheme, an advertiser can specify their true user-targeting goals, allowing the publisher to fulfill them through relevant allocations. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the ADWORDS problem for general advertising budgets. In the most general setting, we show that, unlike in the single-budget ADWORDS problem, obtaining a constant competitive ratio is impossible and give asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds. However for our main result, we observe that in many real-world scenarios (as in the above example), multi-tier budgets have a laminar structure, since most relevant consumer or product classifications are hierarchical. For laminar budgets, we obtain a competitive ratio of e/(e-1) in the small bids case, which matches the best known ADWORDS result for single budgets. Our algorithm has a primal-dual structure and generalizes the primal-dual analysis for single-budget ADWORDS first given by Buchbinder, Jain, and Naor (ESA 2007). However many new ideas are required to overcome the barriers introduced by laminar budgets-our algorithm uses a novel formulation that overcomes non-monotonicity in the syntactically defined dual variables, as well as a dynamically maintained labeling scheme that tracks the most-limiting budgets in the hierarchy.","[Kell, Nathaniel; Panigrahi, Debmalya] Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Kell, N (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",kell@cs.duke.edu; debmalya@cs.duke.edu,,,,,,,23,3,5,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,419,436,,10.1145/2940716.2940770,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300035,0

The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.","[Kiayias, Aggelos] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Koutsoupias, Elias; Kyropoulou, Maria] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Tselekounis, Yiannis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Athens, Greece; [Kiayias, Aggelos] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Athens, Greece",University of Edinburgh; University of Oxford; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Kiayias, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",akiayias@inf.ed.ac.uk; elias@cs.ox.ac.uk; kyropoul@cs.ox.ac.uk; tselekounis@di.uoa.gr,,,,,,,21,122,133,1,45,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,365,382,,10.1145/2940716.2940773,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300032,0

In this situation it is impossible to avoid conflict of interest between the participants which together with significant level of uncertainty and information asymmetry creates opportunistic behavior and welfare losses caused by transaction costs. For the system of competencies and qualifications certification to become an effective tool for minimizing transaction costs in the labor market it is necessary to understand the reason for low efficiency of the present recruitment system. The paper investigates the problem of constructing a national system for certification of employee competencies and qualifications in regions of Russian Federation within the framework of the contract theory. The contractual environment of the Russian labour market is described; existence of a potential positive effect of introduction of the certification system is formally proved. A comparative analysis of different strategies for implementing a certification system is provided. Having analyzed the practice of introducing certification systems in the Sverdlovsk oblast the authors prove that transaction costs and specifics of employment contracts limit significantly the incentives for employers to create a unified system of certification. The recommendations on the optimal model of the certification system are given. In this article we showed that overcoming the negative effects of high monopoly power of the employer in individual markets can be provided by involving trade unions and other stakeholders in creating the system of certification under corporate social responsibility system principles.

The paper uses the data derived from the Polish FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) database for 2004-2013. We analyse farms specialising in field crops. Due to the dependence of the energy consumption from the volume of output, the study is conducted for farms belonging to four separate economic size classes as specified on a basis of the FADN typology. The results show that adopted definitions of energy poverty of households are not appropriate for the diversification of farms in terms of the share of energy expenses when compared to the current financial possibilities of the agricultural producer. Farms belonging to the group characterized by the lower profitability rate and the higher rate of energy expenses, i.e., those which in case of households would be included into the group at risk of energy poverty, in this case are regularly, on average, more profitable than other farms.","[Kuszewski, Tomasz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Sielska, Agata] Inst Agr & Food Econ, Natl Res Inst, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Sielska, A (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Food Econ, Natl Res Inst, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland.",Tomasz.Kuszewski@sgh.waw.pl; Agata.Sielska@ierigz.waw.pl,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,92,101,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000010,0

In such situation, additional information of surrounding countries can be incorporated to the mortality model. Shorter prediction intervals as well as better prediction results can be obtained by using credibility mixing of mortality data. This paper presents comparison of two methods that can improve the estimates of old age mortality models. Cohort approach is used. The first improvement is recalculation of the population data with the Extinct cohorts method. Second improvement is incorporation of the data collected from surrounding countries using credibility theory. For all three datasets (original data + 2 improvements), extrapolation of the mortality rate is calculated assuming a parametric function for the increase with age.

The objective of this study is to determine the potential biodegradability of coffee wastewater that has high concentration of organic material into biogas using a composite of microorganisms derived from specific anaerobic reactor. Fluctuated coffee wastewater concentration in coffee cherry processing and limited time of coffee harvested cause limited time to get coffee wastewater with certain concentration.

Results of study showed combination of floccular and granular sludge that has broad tropic microorganism composite is the best type of bacteria to convert organic matter into biogas. Moreover, it can overcome acidic environment in coffee wastewater.

Just mentioned procedure is called a roundabout route to depot. This paper studies ways how to manage that every running board contains a feasible roundabout route to depot. The proposed procedure is like that: First calculate bus schedule with the minimum number of vehicles. Then create a large set of fictive dummy trips starting and finishing in depot with time duration equal to the required time length of stay in depot. Afterwards calculate bus schedule with the minimum number of vehicles that contains exactly so many fictive trips as the number of vehicles.

Since the stock market processes tend to be not stationary we can expect that prioritization of recent information will lead to improvement of these parameter estimations and thus to better results of the entire model. For this purpose a modified algorithm was design to estimate expected return and correlation matrix more stable. For implementation and verification of this algorithm we needed to build a program which was able to download historical stock market data from the internet and compute optimal portfolio using either traditional Markowitz model and its modified approach.

There exists extensive theory concerning one dimensional stochastic dominance of different orders. However it is not obvious how to extend the concept to multiple dimension which is especially crucial when utilizing multidimensional non separable utility functions. One possible approach is to transform multidimensional random vector to one dimensional random variable and put equivalent stochastic dominance in multiple dimension to stochastic dominance of transformed vectors in one dimension. We suggest more general framework which does not require reduction of dimensions of random vectors. We introduce two types of stochastic dominance and seek for their generators in terms of von Neumann -Morgenstern utility functions. Moreover, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic dominance between two discrete random vectors with uniform distribution.","[Petrova, Barbora] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Petrová, B (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",petrova@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,675,680,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500116,0

This study was assigned in T-test for dependent sample and consists of two in vitro experiments. First experiment consists of 2 treatments by different enzyme levels (0 and 1% w/v) with 3 replications. All treatment samples were measured for chemical compositions, reducing sugar content and oligosaccharides. The results showed that chemical compositions were significantly different among treatments (P < 0.01) except crude protein and cellulose. Enzyme-treated taro leaves had lower fat content (2.96 vs. 4.31%) and hemicelluloses (14.55 vs. 15.18%) as compared to untreated taro leaves (P < 0.01). Moreover, enzyme-treated taro leaves had higher reducing sugar content than untreated taro leaves (P < 0.01). They were 29.78 and 6.23 mg/g, respectively. In addition, oligosaccharides analysis by thin layer chromatography (TLC) found that oligosaccharides in enzyme-treated and untreated taro leaves can digest product and releasing oligosaccharides. Second experiment was conducted to examine prebiotic properties. The results found that sugar product from taro leaves using pre-treated enzymes (Hemicell r) can increase growth of Lactobacillus plantarum (concentration of hydrolyzed products 400, 800, 1,200 and 1,600 mu g/ml) but cannot inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli. In conclusion, it was suggested that enzyme-treated taro leaves can be used as prebiotic in animal feed.

The goal of this paper is to provide some quantitative and qualitative information on the size of public procurement transaction costs in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The base is Czech data - estimates of the level of transaction costs of building firms. Because these data are really negative, we investigate their validity and discuss most important factors behind. The very specific issue is high indirect costs of tendering which private firms bear. The data show that one of the causes might be too high percentage of cancelled tenders, as the ultimate result of a non-functional public procurement system. Large construction companies can bear higher procurement transaction costs than previously found by other researchers.","[Sumpikova, Marketa] Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic; [Busina, Filip] Moscow State Technol Univ STANKIN, 3A Vadkovsky Per, Moscow 127055, Russia; [Grega, Matus] Univ Matej Bel, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Nemec, Juraj] Masaryk Univ Brno, Lipova 41a, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Orviska, Marta] Matej Bel Univ, Tajovskeho 10, SK-97590 Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Prague University of Economics & Business; Moscow State Technology University Stankin; Matej Bel University; Masaryk University Brno; Matej Bel University,"Sumpikova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague, Czech Republic.",sumpik@vse.cz; filipbusina@seznam..cz; matus.grega@umb.sk; juraj.nemec@umb.sk; marta.orviska@umb.sk,"Orviska, Marta/U-5000-2019; Sumpikova, Marketa/AAA-8595-2020; Nemec, Juraj/M-5467-2013","Sumpikova, Marketa/0009-0008-6632-918X;",,,,,15,8,8,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1749,1758,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100173,0

Special attention is paid to possible impact of trade integration on BCS. It seems that the BCS between the NMS and the euro area was catalyzed by the EU integration process until 2008 and was only slightly negatively affected by the crisis in Europe. Moreover, significant differences between countries with the European currency and without the European currency are not observed. Afterwards, we document that the trade integration between the NMS and the euro area has continued to increase since the beginning of the transformation process in the NMS, including the crisis and post-crisis periods. Concerning the effect of the trade integration of the NMS to the European Monetary Union (EMU) on the BCS, our results indicate a positive and significant relationship.

Students' patterns are kind of markers that characterized various situations and scarcities of such situations in different type of labor market and different branch of science where they are studying. Based on the hypotheses of relative scarcity that underlie individual behavior we recognized different patterns and models of the initial patterns across data set.

Last, some suggestions on incorporation of three feedback are proposed: First, online feedback from automated scoring system can be given first, then peer feedback for students' drafts is followed by teacher feedback from different aspects to provide comments and suggestions. Second, teacher focus on giving concrete suggestions on macro-level of text organization, content and structures, peer students on micro-level of vocabulary and grammar to propose some complementary feedback for the online feedback.

Results from analysis showed that delays are the most frequent in Palma de Mallorca and the least often in Burgas airport. It was proved that delays caused by delay of preceding flight are the most common cause of delay at all. Only at Charles de Gaulle airport there was also found out that delay is also quite often caused by problems at the airport and in the flight traffic, by unusual events and also by airlines and suppliers. Delayed preceding flights cause mainly longer delay of connecting flight. Contingency tables present an easy way to display the relationship between categorical data. We used the Pearson's chi-square test; the null hypothesis of the test assumes independence of variables.

We estimate a structural model where providers make continuous strategic choices of capacity based on their private information about own costs and knowledge of the distribution of competitors' private information. We evaluate the impact on the market structure and providers' profits under counterfactual regulatory policies that increase the costs or reduce the payment per unit of capacity. We find that these policies reduce the market capacity as measured by the number of dialysis stations. However, the downward-sloping reaction curve shields some providers from negative profit shocks in certain markets.

The novelty of this paper is that we model jointly in the euro area and the USA (1) the equilibrium in the money market that takes into account the cross-border portfolio shifts and (2) the equilibrium in the domestic asset markets, by finding a relation between domestic long-horizon expected stock and bond returns. We estimate a stable money demand in the long-run and find that the short-run correlation between annual inflation and model-based excess money growth is not statistically different from unity in both the euro area and the USA.

We find that this strategy, which is not played in either Nash equilibrium or iterated dominance equilibrium, is indeed chosen quite frequently. This provides evidence that ambiguity-aversion influences behaviour in games. While the behaviour of the Row Player is consistent with randomising between her strategies, the Column Player shows a marked preference for avoiding ambiguity and choosing his ambiguity-safe strategy.","[Kelsey, David] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter, Devon, England; [le Roux, Sara] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Oxford OX33 1HX, England",University of Exeter; Oxford Brookes University,"le Roux, S (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Wheatley Campus, Oxford OX33 1HX, England.",sle-roux@brookes.ac.uk,,"Kelsey, David/0000-0002-8368-7818",,,,,24,16,16,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,DEC,2015,79.0,4,,,,,667,688,,10.1007/s11238-015-9483-2,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CW6TT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365131600007,0

All quantile and mean functions are parallel in these models; this implies that quantile estimators cannot reveal any-per assumption non-existing-heterogeneity. Quantile estimators are nevertheless useful for testing the conditional independence assumption because they are consistent under the null hypothesis. We propose tests of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov type based on the conditional quantile regression process. Monte Carlo simulations show that their size is satisfactory and their power sufficient to detect deviations under plausible data-generating processes.

As a source of exogenous variation we use the opening of a new bypass in The Hague, the Netherlands that reduced traffic on a number of local streets, leaving others unaffected. We make use of a unique longitudinal dataset on traffic densities and residential sales, and calculate the effect of the change in traffic nuisance on housing prices. We find that, on average, a reduction of 50% in traffic density induces a 1.4% increase in housing prices. Reductions in traffic nuisance are valued much more positively when the traffic density is already high. Furthermore, our results indicate that traffic nuisance effects are likely to be biased in cross-sectional studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the prioritization of maintenance activities - which is critical when resources are limited - requires special considerations. Within these considerations, there are socio-political criteria that are not formally considered in current UPMS (Urban Pavement Management Systems). In practice, decision makers consider these socio-political factors but without a formal procedure and proper information, leading to decisions based on subjective information, which lack traceability and reliability. The objective of this study is the identification and formal definition - including the quantification method - of socio-political criteria relevant for the sustainable management of urban pavement networks. The research method included the application of interviews and a survey of experts and practitioners in various agencies involved in the pavement maintenance decision-making process in Chile. As a result of the study, five primary socio-political criteria were identified: neighbors' perception, proximity to critical infrastructure, benefited population, presence of alternative routes, and strategic selection based on public policy. These criteria were formalized - including how they should be quantified - through an expert panel. A regression analysis applied to various scenarios considered in the survey resulted in the quantification of the relative importance of the formalized socio-political factors to be considered in the decision process, complementing technical and economic criteria. Future research will explore the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to quantify the recommended socio-political factors and implement them in an UPMS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, establishing a society with resource conservation and environmental harmony, typically reusing the pollution and waste from the industrial production, has attracted attention from both the government and the public in recent years. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely used in measuring two-stage network structures that constituted with homogenous decision making units. However, previous works failed to take the undesirable intermediate products into account in the two-stage network structures including production system and disposal system. In this study, we build an additive DEA approach to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed new two-stage network structures, and propose a better efficiency decomposition to the individual system. Finally, our approach is applied to analyze the industrial production in 30 provincial level regions in mainland China and some implications are given.","[Wu, Jie; Zhu, Qingyuan; Chu, Junfei; Liang, Liang] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Wu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",jacky012@mail.ustc.edu.cn,"li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; Wu, Jie/B-2273-2016; ZHOU, YUE/IZE-6277-2023","Chu, Junfei/0000-0002-0895-7558",National Natural Science Funds of China [71222106]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20133402110028]; Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of P.

I trace the origins of the disciplinary characterisation of Smith as the founder of IPE's liberal tradition to invocations of his thought by centrally important figures in the perceived Austrian, Chicago and German historical schools of economics, and reflect upon the significance to IPE of the reiteration of this portrayal by apparent members of its so-called American and British schools. I additionally contrast these interpretations to those put forward by scholars who seek to interpret IPE and Smith's contribution to it in pre-disciplinary terms, which I claim reflects a distinct ontology to that attributed to the British school of IPE with which their work is often associated. I therefore contend that reflection upon invocations of Smith's thought in IPE problematises the longstanding tendency to map its intellectual terrain in terms of competing schools, reveals that the disciplinary ontological consensus that informs this tendency impacts upon articulations of its core concerns and suggests that a pre-disciplinary approach offers an alternative lens through which such concerns might be more effectively framed.","Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Glaze, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Glaze@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03615X/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03615X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I03615X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),For financial assistance I am grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant Reference: ES/I03615X/1).,,147,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It argues that this group of Southern trade intellectuals' has formed a loose epistemic community, and traces the impact the group is having on global trade governance. The subject examined differs from most other uses of the epistemic community framework in that it analyses a case in which there is no objective, scientific knowledge being promoted by the group. Instead, the group is engaged in promoting one subjective understanding of events over another. However, the emergence of this epistemic community has been important in providing an alternative trade narrative that has weakened the dominance previously enjoyed by the Western powers over trade analysis. This broadening of the range of trade analysis and expert opinion forms an important, though potentially problematic, area of leadership provided by the rising powers to less developed countries.","Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Scott, J (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Strand Bldg, London WC2R 2LS, England.",james.m.scott@kcl.ac.uk,,"Scott, James/0000-0003-3296-0375",,,,,54,12,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We use the standard system generalized methods of moments (GMM) approach as well as the dynamic common correlated effects pooled mean group (CCEPMG) methodology for estimation to account for cross-country heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and feedback effects. Using both annual data for 1970-2007 and 5-year non-overlapping observations, we find that while CToT growth enhances real output per capita, CToT volatility exerts a negative impact on economic growth operating mainly through lower accumulation of physical and human capital. Productivity, however, is not affected by either the growth or the volatility of CToT. Our results also indicate that the negative growth effects of CToT volatility offset the positive impact of commodity booms. Therefore, we argue that volatility, rather than abundance per se, drives the resource curse' paradox. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Cavalcanti, Tiago V.

Using a set of time series data, we simultaneously estimate the aggregated demand and supply functions of air cargo at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). We find that during the entire sampling period of 2001-2013, the price elasticity for air cargo transport demand at HKIA ranges from -0.74 to -0.29, suggesting that air cargo demand in Hong Kong reacts negatively to price (as expected) but does not appear to be very sensitive to price. The income elasticity ranges from 0.29 to 1.47 and appears sensitive to seasonality adjustment approaches. However, in terms of the speed of changes, air cargo demand changes much faster than overall economy, indicating the presence of a pro-cyclical pattern of air cargo traffic with respect to the overall economy. Our analysis shows that air cargo demand becomes more sensitive to changes in both price and income after 2008. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Several optimization models based on the use of real-time information have been shown to achieve this, through the planning of holding of the buses at bus stops. In the majority of the cases the benefits of these models have been estimated assuming ideal operational conditions while only few of them have been tested in real conditions. However, neither the simulation experiment, nor the real implementations have quantified the effects of real-life phenomena that harm the performance of the system, preventing it from achieving the full potential of these control schemes. This paper examines three phenomena that may occur during the operation of a bus service, which would limit the effectiveness of a holding-based control strategy in the sense that some of the planned holdings might not be executed. These phenomena are drivers non-compliance, failure of communication systems with buses, and the combination of both.

However, the number of bulk carriers using the NSR remains extremely limited, despite higher fuel prices since 2009 and subsequent significant fuel savings. In 2013, there were 53 transits via the Arctic, out of which 27 by oil tankers and 6 by bulk carriers. In this article we show that this result might be attributable to a factor, which is not considered in most studies: the spot freight rate to fuel ratio which governs ship owners' decisions regarding the sailing speed. Due to a low ratio since 2011, the speed of vessels on the SCR is at its lowest level, and potential NSR fuel savings are too limited to provide a viable alternative. We further argue that, contrary to most studies, internalizing NSR environmental benefits marginally improves the attractiveness of the NSR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We first study the effects of increased information on market outcomes in a theoretical framework where sellers are uncertain about the demand their house faces. We argue that increased information is more valuable to sellers who underestimate the value of their house than to sellers who overestimate the value of their house. Because of this asymmetry, house price information leads to higher prices. If more detailed information also improves matching in the housing market, higher prices may be accompanied by shorter time on the market. In the empirical part of the paper, we utilize a Finnish policy intervention to estimate these effects. In 2007, a website with detailed information about individual housing transactions in part of the country was opened. Differences-in-Differences estimation results suggest that increased information on past transactions led to higher prices and faster sales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Managerial resources underlie export initiation in the theory of the multinational enterprise developed in international business studies, but they are largely ignored in empirical studies of international trade. This is probably not because they are unimportant, but more due to the challenges of identifying and measuring these resources. We exploit Danish employer-employee matched data to overcome this challenge and analyse the impact of managers' international experience, together with other managerial characteristics, on the likelihood that the firm starts exporting. We find that productivity and fixed costs associated with exporting are not the sole determinants of selection of firms into international markets, but that managerial inputs' are just as important. Our data allow us to identify manager export experience based on the CEO's historical career as documented in official registry statistics, a feature that makes our analysis different from other work that relies on self-assessments.","[Sala, Davide] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Yalcin, Erdal] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Sala, D (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark.",,,"Yalcin, Erdal/0000-0001-9459-1718",CESifo,CESifo,"We are grateful to the Tuborg Research Centre for Globalisation and Firms at Aarhus University, most especially to Philipp Schroder and Valdemar Smith for granting us access to the data without which this research would not have been possible.

This union strategy adopts social change goals beyond member representation and contract negotiations and often requires allying with community organizations in pursuit of these goals. As a term, however, social movement unionism is often described in opposition to union organizational functions, such as member representation. This article challenges this organization-movement dichotomy by demonstrating the important influence of union organizational dimensions on the dynamics of social movement unionism. Analysis is based on case study research of labour union involvement in the 2006 immigrant rights marches in Los Angeles. Unions that participated in organizing these marches - thus, practicing social movement unionism - allied with large community organizations, preferred reform goals and advocated tactics perceived as effective. Such strategic decisions were informed by organizational considerations regarding members' interests and unions' long-term capacity for mobilization.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Engeman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",engeman@umail.ucsb.edu,,"Engeman, Cassandra/0000-0003-0526-6679",University of California Labor and Employment Research Fund,University of California Labor and Employment Research Fund(University of California System),Generous support for this project was provided by a fellowship from the University of California Labor and Employment Research Fund.,,54,31,40,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

There is a growing body of research supporting the hypothesis that travel time has some value of its own, and the proliferation of information and communication technology (ICT) may be contributing to that value. Travelers' attitudes are confounded with their mode choice, and as telecommunications mediate travel behavior, analysts must recognize the interaction between time use and customer satisfaction for appropriate travel demand management. To that end, this paper presents results from jointly estimated models of travelers' latent satisfaction and on-board activity engagement using Chicago transit rider data gathered in April 2010. The simple questionnaire and small sample corroborate the findings of past research indicating travel attitudes and activity engagement have potential to influence travelers' value of time, and many transit riders consider transit a better use of time and/or money than driving. The findings affirm the need for a more holistic understanding of value of time for travel demand management and infrastructure valuation. As time use has an influence on users' valuation of the transit mode, offering opportunities to conduct certain leisure activities could improve the perceived value of travel time.

It also is learned that when it comes to the mathematics and analytics involved both disciplines are miles apart, though both with founded reasons to do so. In brief, transportation research relies on modeling to make predictions whereas social sciences apply statistics to their data to draw conclusions. In line with the interdisciplinary philosophy of the Time Use Observatory workshops, this contribution aims to communicate 30 years of experience in analyzing time-diary data. To do so, it demonstrates the latter by calculation transportation habits and aims to illustrate that multi-day time-diary data might have some additional benefits for computing temporal regularities. It shows that including a flexible notion of both regular tempo (or recurrence) of activities (e.g. every day) and regular timing of activities (e.g. always at 6 am) produces different results for different kind of transportation purposes.

While there exists a significant body of empirical studies documenting these effects, theoretical developments have lagged this empirical work and in particular, microeconomic time allocation models have not to date been fully extended to accommodate the implications of an increasingly digitised society. To address this gap, we present a modelling framework, grounded in time allocation theories and the goods-leisure framework, for joint Modelling of the choice of mode of activity (physical versus tele-activity), travel mode and route, and ICT bundle. By providing the expression for a conditional indirect utility function, we use hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate how our framework can conceptualise various activity-travel decision situations. In our scenarios we assume a variety of situations such as the implications of severe weather, the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and the interaction between multiple decision makers. Moreover, our approach lays the microeconomic foundations for deriving subjective values of ICT qualities such as broadband speed or connection reliability. Finally, we also demonstrate the means by which our framework could be linked to various data collection protocols (stated preference exercises, diaries of social interactions, laboratory experiments) and modelling approaches (discrete choice modelling, hazard-based duration models).

We document lower serial correlation (downward price rigidity) and greater mean reversion of house prices in periods of falling house prices. The asymmetric sensitivities of the serial correlation of house prices to income changes and population growth help explain the downward price rigidity.

Using both parametric and non-parametric techniques, this paper examines the impact of external debt on labour productivity growth and convergence across SSA economies over the period 1970-2010. The results indicate the presence of debt-overhang effects, regardless of model and sample specification. Debt reduction through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral Debt Relief initiatives enhanced growth but was not successful in offsetting the debt-overhang effects. Moreover, excessive levels of external debt were responsible for divergence in output per worker over the early 1990s. Although this trend was reversed over the 2000s, reduction in debt through the debt relief initiatives seems to have been insufficient in helping heavily indebted countries in SSA catch up with the labour productivity levels of the best-performing economies in the region.","[Wamboye, Evelyn] Penn State Univ, Business Dept, Du Bois, PA 15801 USA; [Tochkov, Kiril] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Texas Christian University,"Wamboye, E (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Business Dept, Du Bois, PA 15801 USA.",,"Tochkov, Kiril/F-1779-2017","Tochkov, Kiril/0000-0001-8356-1310",,,,,48,12,13,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2015,38.0,5,,,,,856,877,,10.1111/twec.12166,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CH9RF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354373000005,0

This paper, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first comprehensive study of the pre- and post-acquisition performance of foreign-acquired firms in NMS. Distinguishing between the impact of target selection and post-acquisition improvements on performance, we find that, on average, foreign investors are targeting lemons' with growth potential rather than picking cherries'. Regardless of targeting cherries' or lemons', performance of acquired firms improved after the acquisition, whereby the boost in productivity is not achieved by reducing employment but mostly by increased efficiency in the use of production factors especially labour.","[Damijan, Joze; Kostevc, Crt; Rojec, Matija] Univ Ljubljana, Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Leuven, Belgium; [Damijan, Joze] Katholieke Univ Leuven, VIVES, Leuven, Belgium; [Rojec, Matija] UMAR, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Damijan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"This paper was produced in the framework of SERVICEGAP (http://www.servicegap.org/) and GRINCOH (http://www.grincoh.org/), funded by the EU Seventh Framework Programme.

A case of decreasing revenue from electric vehicles,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Funding transportation infrastructure; Taxes and fees; Electric vehicles; Gas tax,POLICIES,"Annual expenditures for transportation infrastructure have recently surpassed the funding available through tax and fee collection. One large source of revenue generation for transportation infrastructure is use fees that are charged through taxes on gasoline both on a federal and state level. A massive adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States would result in significantly lower gasoline consumption and thus reduce the revenue collected to maintain the U.S. transportation infrastructure. We investigate how different vehicles will change the annual fee collected on a marginal basis. In addition, we assess the effects of adoption of alternative vehicles on revenues using several projections of alternative vehicles adoption, both on a state-by-state basis and at the national level. We find that baseline midsize and compact vehicles such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Civic generate approximately $2500-$4000 in tax revenue over their lifetime. Under the current funding structure, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) such as the Nissan Leaf generate substantially less at $400-$1300, while plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) such as the Chevrolet Volt generate $1500-$2700. Even in states with high lifetime fees due to fuel taxes, such as California, revenue generation can be upwards of 50% lower than in states with high registration fees such as Colorado. Total annual revenue generation decreases by about $200 million by 2025 as a result of EV adoption in our base case, but in projections with larger adoption of alternative vehicles could lead to revenue generation reductions as large as $900 million by 2025. Potential schemes that charge user fees on alternative fuel vehicles to overcome the decrease in revenue include a flat annual registration fee at 0.6% of the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) or 22 phi per mile fee.

Adjusting government expenditure in response to these revenue movements involves economic, social and political costs. Many jurisdictions have established rule-based revenue stabilization funds to address revenue volatility, but there is little evidence on whether these funds improve welfare or if some fund designs increase welfare more than others. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we provide a quantitative welfare comparison of several types of rule-based stabilization funds for a petroleum-producing jurisdiction. We find large potential gains from the use of a fund to stabilize revenue, but some fund types reduce welfare, particularly those that accumulate large stocks of assets or debt. A fund that performs well, and is generally robust to changes in the simulation parameters, has a fixed deposit rate out of resource revenue and a fixed withdrawal rate out of assets.","[Landon, Stuart; Smith, Constance] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Alberta,"Smith, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",constance.smith@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,71,8,8,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2015,36.0,2,,,,,117,143,,10.5547/01956574.36.2.6,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CH5JS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354072500007,0

I discuss the consequences of globalisation by surveying the empirical globalisation literature. My focus is on the KOF indices of globalisation that have been used in more than 100 studies. Early studies using the KOF index reported correlations between globalisation and several outcome variables. Studies published more recently identify causal effects. The evidence shows that globalisation has spurred economic growth, promoted gender equality and improved human rights. Moreover, globalisation did not erode welfare state activities, did not have any significant effect on labour market interaction and hardly influenced market deregulation. It increased, however, within-country income inequality. The consequences of globalisation thus turn out to be overall much more favourable than often conjectured in the public discourse.","[Potrafke, Niklas] Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany; [Potrafke, Niklas] Ifo Ctr Publ Finance & Polit Econ, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,211,222,239,5,105,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2015,38.0,3,,,,,509,552,,10.1111/twec.12174,0.0,,,44,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CD6DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351179700005,0

The spline function specification of the temporal pattern of technical efficiency can accommodate more than one turning point and thus can be non-monotonic. This allows the modeler to account for firm or individual efficiency gains that can occur relatively quickly, for example, changes related to regulation or policy changes, as well as those related to ownership/organization changes (e.g., merger or acquisitions).","[Almanidis, Pavlos] Ernst & Young LLP, Int Tax Serv, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Karagiannis, Giannis] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA",University of Macedonia; Rice University,"Sickles, R (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",pavlos.almanidis@ca.ey.com; karagian@uom.gr; rsickles@rice.edu,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,,,,,36,1,2,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Hence, both the absolute productivity measures and, more importantly, the productivity ranking will be distorted. A major driver of transaction costs is poor access to information and contract enforcement assistance. Social networks often catalyse information exchange as well as generate trust and support. Hence, we use measures of a firm's access to social networks as a proxy for the transaction costs the firm faces. We develop a microeconomic production model that takes into account transaction costs and networks. Using a data set of 384 Polish farms, we empirically estimate this model and compare different parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric model specifications. Our results generally support our hypothesis. Especially, large trading networks and dense household networks have a positive influence on a farm's productivity. Furthermore, our results indicate that transaction costs have a measurable impact on the productivity ranking of the farms.","[Henningsen, Geraldine] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Henningsen, Arne] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Henning, Christian H.

With a method for measuring voting power with correlated votes, we can address a question of practical importance. Given that most of the applied power analysis is carried out with either the Penrose-Banzhaf or the Shapley-Shubik measures of power, what happens when you use these two measures in games with correlated votes? Simulations of all possible voting games with up to six players show that both measures tend to overestimate power when the votes are positively correlated. Yet, in most voting scenarios, the Shapley-Shubik index is closer to the probability of criticality than the Penrose-Banzhaf measure. This also holds for the power distribution in the EU Council of Ministers. Based on these simulations, we conclude that, while the Penrose-Banzhaf measure may be ideal for designing constitutional assemblies, the Shapley-Shubik index is better suited for the analysis of power distributions beyond the constitutional stage.","[Kaniovski, Serguei; Das, Sreejith] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Kaniovski, S (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",serguei.kaniovski@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2,,,,,349,367,,10.1007/s00355-014-0831-x,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000007,0

The author develops a stylized dynamic economic model in which tourism is the trigger of the incentive mechanism leading to abatement activities and economic growth. The basic idea is that tourists choose the location to visit according to a number of factors (including environmental quality) which are affected by residents' choices. If residents engage in environmental protection activities, it then may be possible for environmentally based tourism economies to reach a smooth development process. The author shows that the (sustainable) balanced growth path is the only viable equilibrium, and along such a path consumption grows while environmental quality rises. Tourists' preferences crucially affect the long-run outcome, since economic and environmental growth rates increase with the green preference and decrease with the grey preference and crowding aversion parameters. Thus, if tourism specialization is to be the pathway to development, green tourism will need to be promoted.","Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Marsiglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",simonem@uow.edu.au,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012","Marsiglio, Simone/0000-0003-2540-4338",,,,,39,52,55,6,84,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The first shows that women, either in full-time or part-time employment, report significantly higher levels of job satisfaction than men. Secondly, work orientations are closely associated with one's job satisfaction and their relationships vary significantly across men, women full-time and part-time workers.

In doing so, we merge a detailed emergency room data and police-reported crash data for a specific region in Denmark. To disentangle potentially common observable and unobservable factors that affect drivers' injury severity risk and their crash reporting behavior, we formulate a bivariate ordered-response probit model of injury severity risk and crash reporting propensity. To empirically identify the reporting bias in this joint model, we exploit an exogenous police reform that particularly affects some specific municipalities of the region under consideration. The empirical analysis reveals substantial reporting bias in the commonly used police-reported road crash data. This non-random sample selection associated with the police-reported crash data leads to biased estimates on the effect of some of the explanatory variables in injury severity analysis. For instance, estimates based on the police-reported crash data substantially underestimate the effectiveness of seat belt use in reducing drivers' injury severity risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Complex problem solving requires that multiple experts with specialized knowledge share and combine their tacit knowledge for co-created solutions. However, the personal, complex, and hard to codify nature of tacit knowledge as well as the virtual interaction make tacit knowledge sharing difficult. Secondly, different professional cultures and the lack of face-to-face interaction complicate complex problem solving. Thirdly, the individual experts may be cautious of sharing their personal knowledge in the absence of face-to-face contact, because of insecurities related to accuracy and relevance of knowledge, and be afraid of losing their future value capturing potential. Research design and methodological approach - Our research question is stated as How do experts share and protect tacit knowledge on virtual problem solving platforms? We shortly review earlier research on tacit knowledge sharing and protection. Thereafter we study individual expert tacit knowledge sharing and protection in the Case Firm Alpha digital problem solving platform. We collect qualitative data by interviewing problem solving project team members and analyse the data inductively. Value/novelty - Research on tacit knowledge sharing on virtual platforms is still scarce and research on individual expert knowledge protection even more rare. Practical implications - The topic is highly relevant for knowledge-based network economy, and the various approaches in leveraging dispersed expert knowledge across organizational and professional borders. Also, the use of digital platforms, the development of collaborative tools and increasing freelance economy makes understanding how to manage individual level tacit knowledge sharing and protection critical.","[Blomqvist, Kirsimarja; Olander, Heidi] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Blomqvist, K (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, POB 20, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland.",,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,632,648,,,,,,17,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200049,0

To assess the effect of biorregulators on fruit quality near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used as a non-destructive, real-time analysis to evaluate the terpene content in essential oils of the fruit peel without solvent extractions within three days of harvest. Postharvest quality trait changes in intact limes stored at 10 degrees C and 85% relative humidity were monitored during eight weeks after harvesting. The GA treatments resulted in fruits whose color took longer to change from green to yellow after harvesting. Trees treated with AVG, GA(4&7) and GA(3)+GA(4&7) produced fruit with significantly more juice than other trees. AVG-, AHS- and AN-treated trees had higher fruit retention rates and yielded the most fruits for six weeks at the beginning of the harvesting season. NIRS revealed C-H stretch bands that confirmed the presence of terpenes in Tahiti lime flavedo analyzed directly on the fruit peel, and strongly suggests a directly proportional relation between terpene content and fruit maturity.

The paper presents a new methodology of how to utilize these estimators in the Bayesian estimation (using a complex MCMC algorithm) of the parameters and latent state variables of a Stochastic-Volatility Jump-Diffusion (SVJD) model with self-exciting jumps. Two newly developed models are presented: the SVJD-RV model using the realized variance and the SVJD-RV-Z model using in addition to that the Z statistics (used often for the non-parametric jump identification). The models are applied to the past history of the EUR/USD time series. The results indicate superior properties of the new models especially in their ability to model jump clustering when compared to the standard SVJD model (i.e. not utilizing the power-variation estimators).

Since 2011, the domestic production and value of vegetables has exceeded food crops, making vegetables the largest agricultural product in China. How to facilitate the efficient distribution of fresh vegetables is concerning more and more people both at home and abroad. Efficient distribution is necessary to balance supply and demand, maintain freshness and to increase farmers' income. In this paper, consumer choice theory provides the theoretical foundation to discuss the necessity and feasibility of a direct sales model. As a relationship exists between distribution channels and consumer preferences in the vegetable market we use convenience as a proxy indicator to build a dual-channel market demand function. We then construct a price game model for a dual-channel market and analyze the results. Finally, we draw our conclusions: (1) the price of the direct sales channel is usually higher than the regular sales channel with the same marginal cost; (2) setting up a direct sales channel will increase producers' profits while reducing the profit of conventional market intermediaries; (3) producers are more likely to change the traditional single channel for direct sales co-existing with traditional channels to reduce costs via e-commerce technology; and (4) the direct sales channel not only expands the conventional channels, but also threatens conventional channel market intermediaries who will make changes or even lower prices in the process of game.","[Gao, Q.; Li, C.

Contamination with c2 phage specific for Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis C2 is lower than the contamination induced by e72 phage. The contamination level with E. coli and coliforms in the core of burduf cheese was initially high, while the initial Staphylococcus spp. contamination was not high enough to pose a threat through toxin production. During the ripening period of the analyzed cheese, there was a high statistical significant decrease in E. coli, coliforms and staphylococci counts. This decrease was highly unexpected according to the scientific literature that indicates low lactococcal counts and low microbiological quality in bacteriophage contamination cases. The presence of wild bacteriophages, known to reduce the number of lactic acid bacteria, preventing the inhibition effect of the latter on contaminating bacteria growth, was proven not to induce a poor hygiene level of the raw milk burduf cheese, even if the initial contamination was considered to be high. This study is an example of natural, persistent and statistical significant lactococcal resistance to contaminating bacteriophages. The results are also scientifically significant due to the atypical time resistance of the microbiological balance between the contaminating bacteriophages and cheese bacterial microflora with positive consequences over cheese quality.

Our research is relevant from the perspective of the financial integration process in the European Union, as financially integrated markets should demonstrate similar behaviour, even in highly turbulent times. Using stock market return distributions from CEE countries between 1999 and 2014, we find that CEE countries are rather heterogeneous in terms of skewness, but more homogeneous in terms of mean returns and excess kurtosis. Also, their return distributions' properties change across high-volatility episodes and place them in different clusters from one episode to another, thus making forecasting these countries' stock return an endeavour in turbulent times. At the same time, they can be successfully used as diversifiers in European portfolios in times of high-volatility, given their dissimilarity with EMU returns.","[Horobet, Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 PiataRomana, Bucharest 1, Romania; [Belascu, Lucian] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Horobet, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 PiataRomana, Bucharest 1, Romania.",alexandra.horobet@rei.ase.ro; lucian.belascu@ulbsibiu.ro,"BELASCU, LUCIAN/Q-5282-2019; Horobet, Alexandra/D-2301-2010","BELASCU, LUCIAN/0000-0002-7711-3746; Horobet, Alexandra/0000-0001-5821-0244",,,,,10,1,1,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,530,540,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000051,0

Using panel data from Chinese customs for 1997-2007, the capacity for Chinese domestic firms to begin exporting new varieties to new markets is shown to respond positively to the export activity of neighboring foreign firms. These spillovers are shown to be product and country specific. This conclusion is robust to fixed effects and instrumental variable specifications that control for both supply and demand shocks that could bias the estimations. The impact is sizable. The marginal impact of product-country-specific foreign export spillovers is five times as large as the effect of a 10 percent increase in the demand for the product in the destination country. Foreign export spillovers are also shown to be primarily limited to ordinary trade activities. Overall, our findings suggest that even for a country with an important cost-advantage such as China, there is room for initiatives from policy-makers that will diffuse best practices regarding export experience among exporters.","[Mayneris, Florian] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Mayneris, Florian] IRES, Paris, France; [Mayneris, Florian] CORE, Paris, France; [Poncet, Sandra] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Poncet, Sandra] CEPII, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universite Catholique Louvain; Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Mayneris, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium.",florian.mayneris@uclouvain.be; sandra.poncet@cepii.fr,,,,,,,28,26,31,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Against this background, cities are developing collaborative open-innovative (Chesbrough & Appleyard, 2007) and digital environments to boost local competitiveness and prosperity by using knowledge networks and partnerships (Paskaleva, 2009). This paper will describe the process enacted within those initiatives, explaining their relevance in the perspective of urban policy and design. Design/methodology/approach - The authors will firstly identify the general framework of their research through a brief review of literature related to urban living labs, then they will focus on a relevant case-study in order to describe paths of knowledge and value creation process generated by cooperative and shared design projects in the public domain, with the effective support of technologies (Folke, Hahn, Olsson, & Norberg, 2005). They will analyse the Atenistas experience, an ongoing Greek experience, which experiments actions around public space, improving citizens involvement in city life. The conclusion will sketch some emerging tendencies and criticalities arising from the relation between space and organizations, also in comparison with other international mature cases. Originality/value - The absence of a strong frame and objective, the variability of the roles played by actors involved in the decision-making processes about urban environment, and the combination with virtual platform, as described in the cases study, are in our perspective some key factor to open up new paths and process for the design of collective spaces. To analyse existing local based experiences, can help to underline where and how innovative processes can concretize and become value co-creation process with concrete effects on the urban environment. Practical implications - The paper describes some possible outcomes for planning and policy design, identifying some starter device which generate unplanned chains or clusters of process-project that are developing in time. This reveal some eventual opportunities in the way technicians and institution may operate, learning form how the binomial urban places-cyberspaces relations is testing new practices.

With the increasing availability of sequencing data, SNPs and InDels become major classes of codominant markers with genome wide coverage. We have analyzed the respective values of SSRs, InDels, and SNPs for intra and interspecific Citrus genetic diversity analysis. Moreover, we have compared the diversity structure revealed by markers mined in a single heterozygous genotype (clementine) and markers mined from a large interspecific survey. A random set of markers was selected for each marker class to genotype 48 citrus accessions. SSRs were the most polymorphic markers at the intraspecific level allowing complete varietal differentiation within basic taxa (C. reticulata, C. maxima, C. medica). However, SSRs gave the lowest values for interspecific differentiation, followed by SNPs and InDels, that in average displayed low intraspecific variability but high interspecific differentiation. A clear effect of the discovery panel was observed for SNPs and InDels. The ascertainment biases associated with the clementine heterozygosity mining resulted mainly in an over estimation of within C. reticulata diversity and an underestimation of the interspecific differentiation. In conclusion pluri-allelic SSRs are very useful for intraspecific structure analysis but have limitations for interspecific and phylogenetic studies. SNPs and InDels mined in large discovery panels appear to allow efficient selection of more specialized markers with high potential for phylogenetic diagnosis and to decipher the interspecific mosaic structure of secondary cultivated species or to analyze intraspecific diversity. Several SNP genotyping methods are available for different analysis scales, from high throughput genotyping to small set of data production. With the ongoing resequencing projects, SNPs markers will soon be the most important class of markers for citrus genetics.","[Ollitrault, Patrick] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Ollitrault, Patrick; Garcia-Lor, Andres; Curk, Franck; Ollitrault, Frederique; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Terol, Javier; Talon, Manuel] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Genom, Valencia, Spain; [Curk, Franck] Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, UR GEQA, Lyon, France",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); INRAE,"Ollitrault, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France.",ollitrault@cirad.fr,"Terol, Javier/H-6401-2013; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Talon, Manuel/C-8540-2014; Lor, Andres García/B-1246-2016","Terol, Javier/0000-0003-3345-0078; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Talon, Manuel/0000-0003-4291-9333; Lor, Andres García/0000-0002-5625-5470; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",,,,,31,10,10,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,457,466,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600056,0

The empirical investigation of a large sample of ports finds that 'regulatory quality', 'market openness', 'ease to start a business' and 'enforcing contracts' are important institutional determinants of port PPP success and may ultimately contribute to port development and economic growth.

They issue 'permits' to selected cane growers a few weeks before harvest. These permits specify the amount of cane to be delivered during a narrow time period. This article investigates why processors create uncertainty among farmers using ex post permits instead of ex ante production contracts. The theoretical model predicts that ex post permits are more profitable than ex ante contracts or the spot market under existing government regulations in the sugar sector, which include a binding price floor for cane and the designation of a reserve area for each processor wherein it has a legal monopsony for cane. The use of ex post permits creates competition among farmers to increase cane quality, which increases processor profits and farmer costs. Empirical analysis supports the hypothesis that farmers operating in private factory areas have higher unit production costs than do their counterparts who patronize cooperatives.","[Patlolla, Sandhyarani] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Goodhue, Rachael E.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Goodhue, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sandhya@sfsu.edu; goodhue@primal.ucdavis.edu; rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Goodhue, Rachael/0000-0003-4576-9035",,,,,32,4,5,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

In this study the mathematical background is described based on a Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm. The method is then demonstrated using concrete data with the age and the average spending of the respondents of a questionnaire enquiry as two input variables for the clustering method. A method of quota selection was used for the data structure to match the reality. Demand segmentation is used for targeting a smaller, relatively homogenous market and is helpful for managers to reach the chosen segment of customers effectively with one marketing mix. Using the suggested method, the managers can determine which segment is still of interest to an enterprise in terms of financial income and which no longer is. In this way, it is possible to define the optimal number of segments to be focused on by the enterprise. Future research will be concerned with an analysis of the potential use of the method in a space of dimension greater than two and the graphical output options.

According to FAO Policies, family farming is a means of organizing agricultural, forestry, fisheries, pastoral and aquaculture production which is managed and operated by a family and predominantly reliant on family labour, including both women's and men's. Family farming is the predominant form of agriculture in the food production sector for both in developing and developed countries. In this sense, Agropuzzle II is a partnership project under LLP Leonardo da Vinci Program targeting to develop, update and completing specific competence profile and training in sustainable agriculture and agribusiness, with a view for promoting knowledge transfer to all stakeholders in agricultural production and rural community development. The team of Bucharest Faculty of Agriculture is beneficiaries of education and training courses in the partner countries: Czech Republic, Portugal, Poland, Slovakia and Romania, leading to a European perspective on the importance of sustainable agriculture and agribusiness among all entities interested and involved in this orientation. During these mobilities it could be highlight the contribution of smallholder and family farmers to food security, rural development, developing new employment and management of natural resources and also, the opportunity to encourage research that improves food security and supports sustainable rural development, safeguards cultural heritage, protects the environment and maintains biodiversity.

In a randomized block experimental design, compost from pastazzo (a mixture of citrus pulp and peel), poultry manure, bovine manure, compared to a mineral fertilizer, was applied to the soil (455 g N/plant/year). For each plant, the same volume (0.022 m(3)) of soil was sampled at the same distance from the trunk for determination of root density (root weight/soil volume). Representative young roots were selected and analyzed by electron scanning microscopy (SEM). As far as soil characterization concerns, TOC, TEC, HA and FA were determined and then the related humufication parameters (HR% and DH%) were calculated. Results showed that organic fertilization, when compared to the mineral one, determines not only an improvement of soil organic matter humification, but also an increase of root biomass in citrus trees. The SEM analysis evidenced that organic fertilizers induce the appearance of adventitious buds on the terminal portions of the roots, a higher regularity of the elongating meristematic cells and, also, an increase of the production of root mucigel, thus improving their potential ability to up take nutrients from soil.","[Trinchera, Alessandra; Rinaldi, Simona; Rea, Elvira] Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Ctr Ric Studio Relaz Tra Pianta & Suolo CRA RPS, Rome, Italy; [Torrisi, Biagio; Allegra, Maria; Intrigliolo, Francesco; Roccuzzo, Giuseppe] Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee CRA, Acireale, CT, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Trinchera, A (通讯作者)，Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Ctr Ric Studio Relaz Tra Pianta & Suolo CRA RPS, Rome, Italy.",alessandra.trinchera@entecra.it,"Roccuzzo, Giancarlo/M-2851-2019","Roccuzzo, Giancarlo/0000-0002-0851-1329",,,,,6,7,8,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1807,1813,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600231,0

Thus, there were determined: phenology of varieties, fertility and productivity for table varieties and wine varieties, the behavior of these varieties at the attack of the main diseases and phylloxera, physico-mechanical characteristics, the technological attributes of varieties, the physico-chemical characteristics of wines. For determination of the volatile compounds from grapes was used the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. The vine varieties studied were: Valeria and Muscat de Poloskei (table vine varieties), Seyval, Valerien and Purpuriu (varieties of wine). In ecopedoclimatic terms from the southern Romania, varieties mature in the ages II-III (Valeria), IV-V (Muscat de Poloskei, Seyval and Purpuriu) and V-VI (Valerien). From the point of view of fertility varieties, Valeria and Valerien had the best behavior (over 80% fertile shoots) and as productivity were noted the varieties Muscat de Poloskei and Purpuriu with the absolute productivity index of 424, respectively 332 g. Towards the major diseases and phylloxera, the varieties behaved differently, thus, we see that the Valeria variety with an attack grade of 1% at all diseases and phylloxera and the Seyval variety with an attack grade of 0% at most diseases but with a significant sensitivity to mold (12% attack degree). Regarding the accumulation of the sugars in the grape, the sugar content has varied between 168 and 212 g/L at the wine varieties and between 184 and 186 g/L at the table varieties, were noted the varieties Valeria and Seyval. Regarding the analysis of the main volatile compounds shows that limonene, hexanol, 2-methyl propanol and 3-methyl butanol is found in highest concentration in all varieties; concerning terpenes, at the expressing of olfactory characteristics of grapes, in the highest proportion is found limonene, in lower concentration are found terpenes as: myrcene, cymene, pinene.

These processes are reflected in the level of the burden of household budgets repayments of loans. The volume of loan repayments is an important element of household budget not only due to maintain solid liquidity, but also influence the level of consumer spending, which determines the possibility of meeting needs in the long term. The aim of this paper is to determine the burden of household budgets repayments of loans, as well as knowledge of the socio-economic profile of indebted households. Using econometric modelling, based on data from the household budget survey in Poland conducted by the Central Statistical Office in the years 2005-2013, the authors identified the determinants of the expenditure level related to repayment of loans incurred by households. The study indicates that the amount of household expenditure on loans and credits repayments is impact by income, age of household head and the size of the city, which is situated household.","[Walega, Grzegorz] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Walega, Agnieszka] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Walega, G (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",grzegorz.walega@uek.krakow.pl; agnieszka.walega@uek.krakow.pl,"Wałęga, Grzegorz/T-9206-2019; Wałęga, Agnieszka/ABD-6566-2021","Wałęga, Grzegorz/0000-0002-4355-5204; Walega, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6386-0433",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1774,1783,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000170,0

The testing procedure is simple and involves evaluating various linear restrictions on lagged price levels in an error correction model of prices, equivalent to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. Unit root behaviour at low frequencies implies cyclical non-stationarity. In our empirical application, we fail to reject unit roots at frequencies associated with 3- to 5-year-long price cycles for 7 of 16 major commodities. Our results suggest that longer cycles in many commodity prices are highly stochastic, and care should be taken when interpreting the regularity and out-of-sample predictability of such cycles using historical price movements.","[Oglend, Atle; Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Oglend, A (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",atle.oglend@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728",Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors would like to thank the Norwegian Research Council for financial support.,,32,8,10,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Studies using household data typically find a weak response in hours of work to changes in the wage. This paper finds that rather than indicating a small elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the weak dependence of hours on wages is the result of delayed adjustment. The coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is found to be between 0.31 and 0.33, which suggests that it takes 1.5 years for an individual in the sample to adjust hours of work to a change in the wage or other preference variables, an important consideration in policy evaluation. Failure to correct for incidental parameter bias leads to underestimating this effect by more than 15%.

More importantly, these disruptions often have ripple effects that spread to other stations and lines. In order to provide better management and plan for emergencies, it has become important to identify such disruptions and evaluate their influence on travel times and delays. This paper proposes a novel approach to achieve these goals. It employs the tap in and tap-out data on the distribution of passengers from smart cards collected by automated fare collection (AFC) facilities as well as past disruptions within networks. Three characteristic types of abnormal passenger flow are divided and analyzed, comprising (1) missed passengers who have left the system, (2) passengers who took detours, and (3) passengers who were delayed but continued their journeys. In addition, the suggested computing method, serving to estimate total delay times, was used to manage these disruptions. Finally, a real-world case study based on the Beijing metro network with the real tap-in and tap-out passenger data is presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A common thread in this literature is the use of sophisticated statistical/econometric methods. The present study builds on and extends an article critical of the statistical craftsmanship in prior LOS modelling studies. On the basis of an updated assessment of current practice and two small-scale case studies, two main conclusions are drawn. First, the available evidence suggests that the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model produces qualitatively similar findings to much more complicated methods, such as duration and count data models. The principle of parsimony and the so-called KISS rule thus dictate that OLS regression analysis should be the preferred estimation technique in LOS modelling studies. Second, the quality of LOS modelling studies will most likely be improved by intensifying the use of the long-established tools of the trade explicated in influential econometric textbooks rather than by testing new estimation methods.","[Thrane, Christer] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Lillehammer, Norway",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Thrane, C (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, POB 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",christer.thrane@hil.no,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Recent studies address this issue by looking at residents' quality of life measures. These studies, however, are based on convenience sample with investigation that is usually limited to one single destination at a given point of time. Socioeconomic characteristics of individuals have strong effect on the perception of tourism impact. In the present study, we investigate the impact of tourism intensity on residents' satisfaction with life using the theoretical framework of the bottom-up spillover theory. The analysis is based on a representative socioeconomic panel of German households over a period from 2000 to 2011. The analysis conducted involves the whole country distinguishing tourism destinations at administrative districts level. The empirical models suggest that tourism intensity and well-being of employed and unemployed residents present nonlinear U-shaped relationship. For low tourism intensities, residents' well-being is weakly affected while for higher intensities, the positive effect is stronger.","[Tokarchuk, Oksana; Maurer, Oswin] Free Univ Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Bolzano, Italy; [Gabriele, Roberto] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Trento,"Tokarchuk, O (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Piazza Univ 1, Bolzano, Italy.",oksana.tokarchuk@unibz.it,"Maurer, Oswin/AAK-6081-2020; Tokarchuk, Oksana/AAJ-3468-2021; Gabriele, Roberto/AAY-2080-2021; Maurer, Oswin/HQZ-1558-2023","Maurer, Oswin/0000-0003-3728-0598; Tokarchuk, Oksana/0000-0001-7602-9780; Maurer, Oswin/0000-0003-3728-0598",Free University of Bolzano,Free University of Bolzano,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Free University of Bolzano project The impact of tourism on quality of life of German residents.''",,42,12,13,2,51,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The design of the charging system implies that the path disutility cannot be computed as a sum of link attributes. The route choice model is therefore implemented as a hierarchical algorithm, applying a continuous value of travel time (VTT) distribution. The VTT distribution was estimated from stated choice (SC) data. However, based on experience of impact forecasting with a similar model and of impact outcome of congestion charges in Stockholm, the estimated VTT distribution had to be stretched to the right. We find that the forecast traffic reductions across the cordon and travel time gains were close to those observed in the peak. However, the reduction in traffic across the cordon was underpredicted off-peak. The necessity to make the adjustment indicates that the VTT inferred from SC data does not reveal the travellers' preferences, or that there are factors determining route choice other than those included in the model: travel distance, travel time and congestion charge.

Three service quality clusters, interaction and information, physical facility improving, and program and outcome, were extracted. Later, the contingent behavior method was used to measure the hypothetical benefits from service quality improvements. This study's findings discover that the amenity of Sun Moon Lake and its surroundings at current status is not sufficient to make participants come back. Findings show that an improvement in the service quality of sports program and the outcome will result in an NT$85.78 million consumer surplus gain, with the facility improvement producing a gain of NT$72.90 million arising simply from the event in each year. Therefore, recreation managers may find it justifiable to improve an event's service quality in this regard.","[Yeh, Chun-Chu] Transworld Univ, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Yeh, Chun-Chu] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Touliu, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Hua, Kuo-Ting] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Puli Township, Taiwan; [Huang, Chin-Huang] Natl Taiwan Univ Sport, Taipei, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; National Chi Nan University; National Taiwan University of Sport,"Huang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sport, Dept Sport Management, 16,Sect 1,Shuang Shih Rd, Taichung, Taiwan.",hch55@ntupes.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,9,9,2,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, evidence is presented that rank-based groupings are used to determine the compensation of rookie players in the National Football League (NFL). The NFL draft, which largely determines rookie compensation, provides two signals of player quality, selection number, and round. However, the rounds are simply groupings based on selection number; thus, the rounds should not affect subsequent decisions. Sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) estimates of discontinuities in rookie compensation at the round cutoffs are shown to be very large and robust. The first to second round discontinuity is -US$240,000 to -US$250,000, or 36% of the average salary of the first selection in the second round. The second to third round discontinuity is -US$60,000 to -US$70,000, or 17% of the average salary of the first selection in the third round. The results show rookie compensation, which comprises a large share of career earnings, is subject to heuristic thinking.","[Keefer, Quinn A.

Research often frames these efforts as solutions to perceived problems arising from globalization. Yet the narrow focus on the rulemaking process - coordination, distributive implications and implementation - misses second-order political repercussions. Giving special attention to the interaction between international soft law and the political landscape of business advocacy, this article offers an alternative account of the relationship between transnational rules and powerful actors. We argue that transnational informal institutions are not only sites of cooperation that resolve the economic policy concerns of the day, but are also sources of policy feedback that can transform the political landscape. To illustrate the potential empirical traction of these arguments, we examine the critical case of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Institute of International Finance (IIF). The IIF went from being a struggling organization with no regulatory agenda or lobbying skills to the world's most influential financial industry advocate directly engaging transnational forums. We find that second-order effects of soft law were a primary cause of the IIF's transformation. Our study has major implications for research on global governance as we highlight the political ramifications and temporal effects of informal institutions for business representation.","[Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Posner, Elliot] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Newman, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Newman, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",aln24@georgetown.edu,,"Posner, Elliot/0000-0002-7178-6528",,,,,94,9,9,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The problem is complicated by the need to decompose the selling price of a unit into a component that can be attributed to the structure area of the unit and another component that can be attributed to the unit's share of land value. There is very little information on the value of condominium land and so this paper develops a methodology for reducing this knowledge gap. The paper extends the builder's model which was developed in Eurostat (2013). Characteristics which prove to be important in explaining condominium prices are: the floor space area of the unit, the total land area of the building, the number of units in the building, the total number of stories in the building, the height of the sold unit, the age of the structure and the amount of excess land. The paper also derives an estimate for the annual geometric structure depreciation rate for condominiums in Tokyo. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Diewert, W.

We develop a mortgage choice model where the coefficient on the long-term bond risk premium is conditional on the borrower's perceived risk. We show that the perceived risk fluctuates over time according to the short-term interest rate level and housing market conditions. We find that when the short-term rate level is high (low), the borrowers perceive low (high) risk of a short-term rate rise, thus opting for ARMs (FRMs). Also, during a down housing market they become more risk-averse perceiving higher risk in choosing ARMs. The perceived risk level alters the borrowers' sensitivity to the long-term bond risk premium.","[Kim, Dongshin; Ziobrowski, Alan J.] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Dept Real Estate, 35 Broad St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Dept Real Estate, 35 Broad St, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",dkim56@gsu.edu; aziobrowski@gsu.edu,,,,,,,13,2,3,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2016,44.0,3,,,,,606,626,,10.1111/1540-6229.12114,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DR8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380134000003,0

States have difficulty resolving trade conflicts when they involve certain types of trade-restrictive domestic regulations. While such regulations vary in their extent of legitimacy-fulfilling non-trade domestic regulatory objectives and availability of less trade-restrictive options-complainant states cannot always distinguish legitimate barriers from illegitimate ones. In such scenarios of disguised protectionism, which I argue is most prevalent with policies involving WTO's Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement, disputants confront difficulties concluding their disputes. Disputes last longer and are more likely to recur. I test the argument against a data set of WTO disputes structured in an innovative manner-one that links together related and recurring disputes into single conflicts. Both an event history analysis of conflict duration and a count analysis of conflict recurrence using this data strongly support this argument.","[Kim, Moonhawk] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",moonhawk.kim@colorado.edu,"Kim, Moonhawk/O-7883-2019","Kim, Moonhawk/0000-0001-8376-3908",Colorado European Union Center of Excellence (CEUCE); Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder; CU Political Science; One Earth Foundation,Colorado European Union Center of Excellence (CEUCE); Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder; CU Political Science; One Earth Foundation,"The research for this article was generously supported by the Colorado European Union Center of Excellence (CEUCE) and the Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

This paper studies the effect of online dating services on marital sorting, using a novel dataset with verified information on people and their spouses. Estimates based on matching techniques suggest that, relative to other spouse search methods, online dating promotes marriages that exhibit weaker sorting along occupation and geographical proximity but stronger sorting along education and other demographic traits. Sensitivity analysis, including the Rosenbaum Bounds approach, suggests that online dating's impact on marital sorting is robust to potential selection bias.

In their view, the available behavioural and neuro-psychological findings enable paternalists to address traditional anti-paternalistic objections and reliably enhance the well-being of their target agents. In this paper, I combine insights from decision-making research, moral philosophy and evidence-based policy evaluation to assess the merits of this case.

The data are extracted from newspaper announcements and georeferenced. Using hedonic regressions, quality-adjusted rent indices are constructed and employed to analyze the rental dynamics during World War I, when housing market experienced several shocks. The outbreak of the war led to an outflow of men from cities. Toward the end of the war, the construction freeze together with an inflow of workers and discharged soldiers resulted in a housing shortage. The analysis shows a rent decline (particularly for cheap dwellings) during the first half of the war, followed by a moderate increase. In 1917, given a dramatic overall price increase, real rents lost half of their value. Thus, regulatory policy did not emerge as a result of market failure, but rather the fear of rapid rent increases as a consequence of the supply stagnation despite growing housing demand.","[Kholodilin, Konstantin A.] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kholodilin, KA (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",kkholodilin@diw.de,"Kholodilin, Konstantin/ABA-7108-2021; Kholodilin, Konstantin/AAI-9535-2020","Kholodilin, Konstantin/0000-0001-7165-0228",,,,,58,6,7,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The point of departure is to construct and estimate a baseline Markov-switching common factor model in which the co-movement of several individual economic series and the inherently different behavior of the economy across expansion/recession phases are accommodated. The importance of house price variables is then evaluated by comparing the results of the baseline model and those of the extended models that have been augmented with the house price variables. Two strands of extended models are considered: one in which house prices directly affect the individual macroeconomic series (and thereby the business cycle) and another in which house prices affect the probabilities of transitions between expansion/recession phases. The results for the first extension support that only house price decreases have nontrivial effects on the movements in macroindicators (and consequently on the business cycle), while house price increases do not. In the second extension, we find strong evidence that changes in house prices significantly affect the transition of the US economy between the recession-expansion phases. It is also reaffirmed that the influence of house price decreases is more important than that of the increases. Finally, the above results are generally robust to using a different data frequency, a subsample of the data excluding the recent episode of housing boom-bust, replacing house price with housing permits, and incorporating financial variables as additional driver of the business cycle.","[Kim, Jan R.] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imun Dong, Seoul 130791, South Korea; [Chung, Keunsuk] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business Adm, 50 UNIST Gil Eonyang E Ulju Gun, Ulsan 689798, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Chung, K (通讯作者)，Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business Adm, 50 UNIST Gil Eonyang E Ulju Gun, Ulsan 689798, South Korea.",chungk@unist.ac.kr; kjryoul@hufs.ac.kr,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies; Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) [1.100038],Hankuk University of Foreign Studies; Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST),Jan R.

Public sector investments have, therefore, traditionally not been considered as viable options due to some persistent arguments and general beliefs. This commentary discusses five common arguments against public investments in brownfield redevelopment and addresses each one by presenting approaches, views, and examples that would aim to persuade researchers, practitioners, and local governments to think otherwise. Addressing the argument that brownfield redevelopment has higher costs than benefits and that greenfield development is more economical than brownfield redevelopment, one has to see beyond perceived costs and benefits and understand the true nature of infrastructure costs and the intangible benefits of redeveloping inner-city, deteriorated, and blighted areas to be able to fully justify brownfield redevelopment. Addressing other arguments that state brownfield redevelopment is not an effective use of public funds as it does not generate tax revenue and is too complex an issue for public agencies, is that an effective use of public funds is anything, in general, that benefits residents, be it econommic, environmental, social, or health-related. Even though public investments in brownfield redevelopment might not result in an economic endeavor, it does have a positive ripple effet on nearby communities and leads to increased assessed property values that ultimately result in increased tax revenue. Finally, increasing political interest and local capacity is vital to ensuring successful brownfield redevelopment projects by public agencies.","[Kotval-K, Zeenat] Michigan State Univ, Urban & Reg Planning, 552 W Circle Dr,Room 404, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Kotval-K, Z (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Urban & Reg Planning, 552 W Circle Dr,Room 404, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kotvalze@msu.edu,,,,,,,32,15,18,3,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This task is very dependent on uncontrollable external factors. In the hospitality industry, rooms of the hotel represent perishable assets and fixed capacities at the same time. Therefore, in the case of a stochastic process for customers calling in reservations prior to a particular booking date, a common problem for hotels is to devise a policy for maximizing the total expected profit conditional on the set of bookings. We propose a fuzzy model for the hotel revenue management under an uncertain and vague environment. Fuzziness of objective and constraint functions have been incorporated into a stochastic booking model considering multiple-day stays to show the effect of uncertainty on the optimal demand. By changing the relaxation parameters of the objective function, we have found a set of optimal solutions with, in most of the cases, a value of the objective function equal to the optimal solution of the stochastic model, providing several alternative optimal room allocations.","[Lacagnina, Valerio; Provenzano, Davide] Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Provenzano, D (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Stat, Viale Sci,Ed 13, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",davide.provenzano@unipa.it,"Provenzano, Davide/I-4147-2019; Lacagnina, Valerio/M-1835-2015","Provenzano, Davide/0000-0003-0674-0387; Lacagnina, Valerio/0000-0003-4011-0442",,,,,43,3,4,1,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In particular, Latent Dirichlet Analysis is applied to the corpus after some preparatory work. Second, for some of the topics which are closely related to specific economic indicators, the developments of topic weights and indicator values are confronted in dynamic regression and VAR models.

By using data from proto-industrial Japan, the paper demonstrates, first, that not just the rate of urbanisation but population density would also work as another predictor of the secondary- and tertiary-sectoral shares when growth was rural-centred; and second, that regional panel data should be constructed from earliest possible sets of modern data to estimate the coefficients of these two variables on the sectoral shares. In order to apply the coefficients derived from modern data for the calculation of pre-modern estimates, regional panel data are far superior to simple time-series statistics.

While there is evidence on the determinants of FTA formation, still little is known on the processing of trade agreements, particularly regarding the pre-implementation duration. This paper fills the research gap by using event data on the negotiation, the signing and the implementation of trade agreements. Duration analysis is employed to examine the connection between regime types and the lengths of the negotiation and the ratification stages. The results support the claim that higher levels of democratisation are associated with shorter negotiations, while political constraints lead to delays. Moreover, the depth of an agreement matters: a higher number of WTO-X and WTO+ provisions do not only prolong the negotiation stage, but also the subsequent ratification. Against the background of potential anticipation effects of trade agreements, these results are of interest for exporting firms that assess the timing of implementation.","[Molders, Florian] Int Finance Corp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",,"Mölders, F (通讯作者)，Int Finance Corp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,40,10,12,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2016,39.0,7,,,,,890,924,,10.1111/twec.12280,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DR5OU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379953100001,0

Our data are a unique cross section of over 23,000 actual marijuana transactions where price, quantity, and quality are reported, allowing for an estimation of the full demand elasticity rather than the participation elasticity. In addition, we account for the endogeneity of price by using instrumental variable estimation to calculate price elasticity. Price elasticity of demand estimates ranges between 0.67 and 0.79.

Significant price variation is also found by medical marijuana status and census region, although this variation depends critically on the quality of the marijuana.","[Davis, Adam J.] ADM Energy, 3239 Ramos Circle, Sacramento, CA 95827 USA; [Geisler, Karl R.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Econ Appl Stat & Int Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Nichols, Mark W.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA",New Mexico State University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Nichols, MW (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",mnichols@unr.edu,,"Geisler, Karl/0000-0001-9998-4211",,,,,30,21,24,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The evidence demonstrated that, related to the identified different growth periods, income elasticities showed significant variations. For 1977-1992, it was possible to measure the highest income elasticities of all periods. For 1994-2003 and 2004-2013, the income elasticities decreased from period to period. For the last decade, the values of the income elasticities were lower than 1. The reasons for the decline in the income elasticities from the first to the second period were the ongoing saturation process and the slowing down of economic growth resulting in a change in consumer behaviour. The decline in income elasticities from the second to the third period was mainly due to the dramatic deterioration in the economic environment contributing to higher uncertainty about the future, with the result that precautionary saving increased, liquidity constraints limited expenditures on luxuries in favour of necessities and tourists preferred domestic destinations instead of going abroad.","[Gunter, Ulrich; Smeral, Egon] MODUL Univ Vienna, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Smeral, Egon] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Smeral, E (通讯作者)，MODUL Univ Vienna, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.;Smeral, E (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",egon.smeral@wifo.ac.at,,,,,,,82,40,43,1,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Stationary subgame perfect equilibria (SSPE) exist whenever the geometric mean of the players' risk coefficients, ratios of utility differences between alternatives, is at most one. SSPEs ensure agreement within finite expected time. For generic parameter values, SSPEs are unique and exclude Condorcet cycles. In an SSPE, at least two players propose their best alternative and at most one player proposes his middle alternative with positive probability. Players never reject best alternatives, may reject middle alternatives with positive probability, and reject worst alternatives. Recognition probabilities represent bargaining power and drive expected delay. Irrespective of utilities, no delay occurs for suitable distributions of bargaining power, whereas expected delay goes to infinity in the limit where one player holds all bargaining power. An increase in the recognition probability of a player may weaken his bargaining position. A player weakly improves his bargaining position when his risk coefficient decreases.","[Herings, P.

The politics associated with TTIP are different from those associated with previous trade negotiations. Moreover, they diverge from the prevailing International Political Economy (IPE) account of trade policy. The politics of TTIP diverge from the conventional IPE account of trade politics in two particularly noteworthy ways. First, rather than being rivals, American and European business interests are allies, adopting common positions on what they want the agreement to look like. Second, opposition within both the USA and the EU comes not primarily from firms and workers fearing increased economic competition, but from less traditional trade actors - consumer and environmental groups and citizens - concerned about the erosion of valued regulations. I argue that the unusual politics is the product of two distinct, but related factors. The first is the extraordinary level of cross-investment between the two economies. The second concerns the unique emphasis on addressing non-tariff barriers, particularly regulatory differences, and the significance of the negotiating partner. I test the plausibility of these arguments through within-case variation and by preliminary comparison to other contemporary negotiations of deep' preferential trade agreements.","[Young, Alasdair R.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Young, AR (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",alasdair.young@gatech.edu,,,European Commission [2012-3121]; European Commission (Jean Monnet Center of Excellence) [2014-1842],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commission (Jean Monnet Center of Excellence),"This paper is part of a wider project that has been funded with support from the European Commission (Jean Monnet Chair 2012-3121 and Jean Monnet Center of Excellence 2014-1842).

This paper reviews the literature on efficient contracting in general and its application to public transport contracts and found little empirical evidence on the influence of risk preferences of contracting agents on contract choice, a fundamental premise of classical contracting theory. Departing from the existing literature, this paper develops a choice experiment to study public transport operators' preferences for different contractual forms. People involved in the public transport industry across Australia are invited to do the survey but the respondents are mainly bus operators in New South Wales. The respondents are offered two hypothetical contracts with different risk profiles and incentives and asked to indicate their preferences as well as their acceptance to provide the services under the contract they prefer. A non-linear scaled multihomial logit model is estimated to establish the role of risk allocation on contract preference of bus operators and the optimal amount of risks and incentives, conditioned on the operators' attitude towards risk. The results help authorities design performance based contracts to obtain their objectives while maintaining the operators' level of satisfaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2003, the CBOE changed their volatility index design and introduced the VIX in order to enhance its economic significance and to facilitate hedging. In this paper, using data from the USA and the German stock markets, we compare the forecasting capability of the volatility indexes with that of historical volatility and conditional volatility models. Following this analysis, we have studied whether it may be the case that volatility indexes forecast the realized volatilities more accurately for a different period to 30 (or 45) days, attempting to answer the question: what time horizon is the informational content of volatility indexes best adjusted for? The optimal prediction period of each volatility index (VXO, VIX, VDAX and V1X) in terms of coefficient of determination is analysed. The results identify a difference between the observed optimal forecasting period and the theoretical one.

Higher fuel economy reduces per-mile driving costs and may increase miles traveled, known as the rebound effect. The magnitude of the elasticity of miles traveled to fuel economy is an important parameter in welfare analysis of fuel economy standards, but all previous estimates from micro data impose at least one of three behavioral assumptions: (a) fuel economy is uncorrelated with vehicle and household attributes; (b) for multi vehicle households, each vehicle can be treated as an independent observation in statistical analysis; and (c) the effect of gasoline prices on vehicle miles traveled is inversely proportional to the effect of fuel economy. Two approaches to relaxing these assumptions yield a large estimate of the rebound effect; a one percent fuel economy increase raises driving 0.2 or 0.4 percent, depending on the approach, but the estimates are not statistically significantly different from one another.","[Linn, Joshua] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Linn, J (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",linn@rff.org,"Linn, Joshua/AAT-6768-2021",,,,,,27,26,31,0,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2016,37.0,2,,,,,257,288,,10.5547/01956574.37.2.jlin,0.0,,,32,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH3EO,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372670500011,0

We broaden the study of dispute settlement design beyond legalization and instead reorient theorizing around a multi-faceted conceptualization of the strength of DSMs. We posit that strong DSMs are first and foremost a rational response to features of agreements that require stronger dispute settlement, such as depth and large memberships. Multivariate empirical tests using a new data set on PTA design confirm these expectations and reveal that depth - the amount of policy change specified in an agreement - is the most powerful and consistent predictor of DSM strength, providing empirical support to a long-posited but controversial conjecture. Yet power also plays a sizeable role, since agreements among asymmetric members are more likely to have strong DSMs due to their mutual appeal, as are those involving the United States. Important regional differences also emerge, as PTAs across the Americas are designed with strong dispute settlement, as are Asian PTAs, which contradicts the conventional wisdom about Asian values and legalization. Our findings demonstrate that rationalism explains much of international institutional design, yet it can be enhanced by also incorporating power-based and regional explanations.","[Allee, Todd] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Elsig, Manfred] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Bern,"Allee, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",tallee@umd.edu; manfred.elsig@wti.org,,"Elsig, Manfred/0000-0001-6950-108X",Swiss Science Foundation,Swiss Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We are grateful to the Swiss Science Foundation (www.nccr-trade.org) for financial support and to our research assistants for help in collecting the data used in this paper.

We assume that the extracted factors span the same space of basic Engel curves representing the fundamental forces driving consumers' behaviour. We identify these curves by imposing statistical independence and by studying their dependence on total expenditure using local linear regressions. We prove consistency of the estimates. Using data from the UK Family Expenditure Survey from 1977 to 2006, we find strong evidence of two common factors and mixed evidence of a third factor. These are identified as decreasing, increasing, and almost constant Engel curves. The household consumption behaviour is therefore driven by two factors respectively related to necessities (e.g.food), luxuries (e.g.vehicles), and in some cases by a third factor related to goods to which is allocated the same percentage of total budget both by rich and poor households (e.g.housing).

Several alternative explanations of this phenomenon have been suggested, but so far little evidence has been available to assess the relative importance of these explanations. We study attitudes to congestion pricing in Gothenburg before and after congestion charges were introduced in January 2013. Attitudes to the charges did indeed become more positive after the introduction, just as in previous cities. Using a two-wave postal survey, we separate contributions to the attitude change from a number of sources: benefits and costs being different than anticipated, use of hypothecated revenues, reframing processes, and changes in related attitudes such as attitudes to environment, equity, taxation and pricing measures in general. We conclude that the dominant reason for the attitude change is status quo bias, rather than any substantial changes in beliefs or related attitudes, although some of these factors also contribute. Contrary to a common belief, nothing of the attitude change is due to benefits being larger than anticipated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Focusing on causality measures that make use of delay vectors from time series, the idea is to account for non-stationarity by considering the ranks of the components of the delay vectors rather than the components themselves. As an exemplary measure, we introduce the partial symbolic transfer entropy (PSTE), which is an extension of the bivariate symbolic transfer entropy quantifying only the direct causal effects among the variables of a multivariate system. Through Monte Carlo simulations it is shown that the PSTE is directly applicable to non-stationary in mean and variance time series and it is not affected by the existence of outliers and VAR filtering. For stationary time series, the PSTE is also compared to the linear conditional Granger causality index (CGCI). Finally, the causal effects among three financial variables are investigated. Computations of the PSTE and the CGCI on both the initial returns and the VAR filtered returns, and the PSTE on the original non-stationary time series, show consistency of the PSTE in estimating the causal effects.","[Papana, Angeliki; Kyrtsou, Catherine] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Egnatias 156, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Kyrtsou, Catherine] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Strasbourg, France; [Kyrtsou, Catherine] Univ Paris 10, Nanterre, France; [Kyrtsou, Catherine] CAC IXXI ENS Lyon, Lyon, France; [Kugiumtzis, Dimitris] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Diks, Cees] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Ctr Nonlinear Dynam Econ & Finance CeNDEF, Valckenierstr 65, NL-1018 XE Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Macedonia; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite Paris Nanterre; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Amsterdam,"Papana, A (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Egnatias 156, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",angeliki.papana@gmail.com; ckyrtsou@uom.gr; dkugiu@auth.gr; C.G.H.Diks@uva.nl,"Papana, Angeliki/GRN-7781-2022; Papana, Angeliki/P-2010-2019; Kugiumtzis, Dimitris/N-9295-2015","Papana, Angeliki/0000-0003-4472-8274; Kugiumtzis, Dimitris/0000-0002-5337-5688; Kyrtsou, Catherine/0000-0002-0976-3034",European Social Fund (ESF); Greek State,European Social Fund (ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek State,"The research project is implemented within the framework of the Action 'Supporting Postdoctoral Researchers' of the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' (Action's Beneficiary: General Secretariat for Research and Technology), and is co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Greek State.",,53,48,50,4,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

These groups, however, are reliant on international funds. This makes sense in politically repressive environments, where potential donors fear government retaliation, but is puzzling elsewhere. We interviewed 263 LHRO leaders and key informants from 60 countries, and conducted statistically representative surveys of 6180 respondents in India, Mexico, Morocco, and Nigeria. Based on these data, we believe LHRO funding in non-repressive environments is shaped by philanthropic logics of appropriateness. In the late 1990s, transnational activists successfully mainstreamed human rights throughout the international donor assistance community, freeing up development money for LHROs. Domestic activists in the global South have not promoted similar philanthropic transformations at home, where charitable giving still focuses on traditional institutions. Instead, domestic rights activists have followed the path of least resistance toward international aid, a logic of outcomes produced by variations in global logics of (philanthropic) appropriateness.","[Ron, James] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Ron, James] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Pandya, Archana] Human Rights Org Project, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ron, James; Crow, David] CIDE, Div Int Studies, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

For this purposes, oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus was cultivated on mixed sawdust of Shorea wood (major species; Shorea leprosula), and then the residual wood obtained from mushroom production (spent waste) was subjected to methane fermentation by mixing with cow dung in two steps utilization process. The effects of the bio treatment on biogas production and correlation with compositional changes in the wood by mushroom cultivation were evaluated. P. ostreatus preferentially decomposed lignin in the tropical wood with high productivity of matured fruiting body. During 44 days, fruiting bodies were harvested and collected four times, and lignin and holocellulose in the Shorea wood decreased by 24.7% and 15.8%, respectively. Biological activity expressed as yields of the fruiting body was the maximum at the first flush, and decreased gradually. In methane fermentation, addition of pretreated wood waste increased production of biogas by 2-3 times higher than those without the bio-treated wood. The combination of mushroom and biogas production of residual Shorea wood biomass creates a new industrial application of unutilized wood biomass from tropical rainforests, with a great deal of advantages supplying value-added foodstuff and also renewable energy for the local community.

Building on recent research which documents the existence of a national naming pattern for African American males in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Cook, Logan and Parman, 2014), we analyze long-term consequences of distinctively racialized names. Using over 3 million death certificates from Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina from 1802 to 1970, we find a robust within-race mortality difference for African American men who had distinctively black names. Having an African American name added more than 1 year of life relative to other African American males. The result is robust to controlling for the age pattern of mortality over time and environmental factors which could drive the mortality relationship. The result is not consistently present for infant and child mortality, however. As much as 10% of the historical between-race mortality gap would have been closed if every black man was given a black name. Suggestive evidence implies that cultural factors not captured by socioeconomic or human capital measures may be related to the mortality differential. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Resource-based theory is working with the three assumptions. 1. It depends on the social context. 2. Organizations develop strategies that help them keep their autonomy and objectives. 3. Power is important for understanding why organizations were acting in certain ways (Davis, Cobb, 2010). Social enterprises are relatively new economic entities in the Czech Republic. They are private and in their activities they follow not only economic but also social and environmental goal. Social enterprises are partly commercial companies, cooperatives and also some of the non-state non-profit organizations. Using the methodology of the European international research company EMES (Defourny, 2001) authors of the paper came to the conclusion that in social enterprises is used a combination of financial resources; and that the motivation for social entrepreneurship in nongovernmental, non-profit organizations is the possibility to generate own resources. It confirmed the resource-based theory in particular, provided that the custom funding helps to maintain the autonomy and can influence the behaviour of the organization.","[Dohnalova, Marie] Charles Univ Prague, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Legnerova, Katerina] Univ Econ Prague, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dohnalova, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",marie.dohnalova@fhs.cuni.cz; katerina.legnerova@vse.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,2,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,364,371,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100036,0

This paper uses copula approach to investigate the dependence between commodities and stock markets. More specifically, we focus on the tail dependence between both markets. We used two-dimensional Gumbel copula and censored log-likelihood optimization procedure with Generalized Pareto Distribution as a marginal distribution to obtain upper and lower tail dependence coefficients. Our results show that tail dependence between commodity and stock markets exists and safe-haven role of gold is evidenced. We find the asymmetric tail dependence with the larger upper than lower tail dependence.

Sea and marine environment are an invaluable natural resource that must be protected and preserved from the harmful impact of human activities. The Member States of the European Union are parties to the most important conventions aimed to protect the marine environment, and the European Union has adopted a number of important directives aimed at protecting the environment. The European Union has recognised the importance of protecting the marine environment and has therefore adopted Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) in 2008, establishing a framework within which Member States take the measures necessary to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by 2020. As a Member State, the Republic of Croatia should develop a marine strategy for the Adriatic Sea and for that purpose it has to cooperate with both other Member States and third countries. The paper analyses the activities related to the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which Croatia has carried out, legal solutions made for that purpose, the problems they faced as well as measures to be taken and the plans to be executed. It also gives a brief overview of the implementation of the Directive in the European Union, the existing situation and the goals of the neighbouring countries as well as a critical review of the adopted solutions.","[Erceg, Biljana Cincurak] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Erceg, BC (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",biljana.cincurak@pravos.hr,"Činčurak Erceg, Biljana/HCG-9298-2022","Činčurak Erceg, Biljana/0000-0002-8303-7524",,,,,12,0,0,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,336,346,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400035,0

We use a stochastic mixed integer quadratic model to analyze the impact of uncertainty about future natural gas consumption in Europe on optimal investments in pipelines. Our data is based on results from the PRIMES model of natural gas demand and technology scenarios discussed in Knopf et al. (2013). We present a comparison between the results from the stochastic model and the expected value model, as well as an analysis of the individual scenarios. We also performed sensitivity analyses on the probabilities of the future scenarios. Comparison of the results from the stochastic model to those of a deterministic expected value model reveals a negligible Value of the Stochastic Solution. We do, however, find structurally different infrastructure solutions in the stochastic and the deterministic models. Regarding infrastructure expansions, we find that 1) the largest pipeline investments will be towards Asia, 2) there is a trend towards a larger gas supply from Africa to Europe, and 3) within Europe, eastward connections will be strengthened. Our main finding using the stochastic approach is that there is limited option value in delaying investments in natural gas infrastructure, until more information is available regarding policy and technology in 2020, due to the low costs of overcapacity.","[Fodstad, Marte; Egging, Ruud; Midthun, Kjetil; Tomasgard, Asgeir] SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Appl Econ, Trondheim, Norway; [Egging, Ruud; Tomasgard, Asgeir] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Fodstad, M (通讯作者)，SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Appl Econ, Trondheim, Norway.",,"Tomasgard, Asgeir/AAX-2832-2020; Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/AAF-3005-2020","Egging-Bratseth, Ruud/0000-0002-5061-636X",Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies-FME CenSES from the Research Council of Norway [209697],Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies-FME CenSES from the Research Council of Norway,This work is partially funded by the Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies-FME CenSES under grant 209697 from the Research Council of Norway for authors R.

In these proceedings, assets of a larger number of Jews in Osijek, who were the owners of a large number of companies before World War II, were confiscated. Paradoxically, the Jews were in fact punished twice, i.e. their property was confiscated twice. The first time was when their property was nationalized during the war in the NDH, and the second when after the war the new government instead of correcting the wrongs that had been done against the Jews, confiscated their assets once again. It is particularly ironic that the large number of former Jewish owners were taken in the German concentration camps and killed there, and the new government seized their property because of the economic cooperation with the German forces.","[Gardas, Miro] Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Gardas, M (通讯作者)，Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",mgardas@pravos.hr; a.gavran1989@gmail.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,244,252,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400025,0

Several statistical hypotheses (zero trend, absence of seasonal variation) were being tested. The results indicated a requirement to consider the relationship between labour date and milk production.

The equilibrium price-rent ratio, however, assumes that the sold and rented dwellings being compared are of equal quality, which is typically not the case. Using hedonic methods applied to prices and rents for 730,000 houses in Sydney, Australia, we find that quality-adjusting reduces the actual price-rent ratio by on average 18%. Failure to make such a correction therefore will seriously bias the results towards a finding that the price-rent ratio is above its equilibrium level. We also explore ways of imputing the expected capital gain - a key input into the equilibrium price-rent ratio formula, and show that price-rent ratios (both actual and equilibrium) vary in systematic ways over the housing distribution.

One of the fundamental input data in the zone tariff planning is origin-destination (OD) matrix as the demand matrix which can have a major influence on the system design, but it can usually contain some uncertainties. To deal with this problem and to test robustness of the design several approaches can be used. In this paper we present two integer programming based approaches, one of them is based on the theory of fuzzy sets and second one on the model reformulation with parameters modeling the impact of fare changes on the demand for traveling. We formulate mathematical model of the tariff zones design problem and present both approaches. Designed approaches are verified on the real data set from the Zilina municipality, where we have an OD matrix calculated using passengers' smart card transactions for a period of one week (approx. 110 000 transaction records).

However, imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood, and only weak algorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known. We develop the first general, algorithm-agnostic, solution quality guarantees for Nash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in imperfect-recall abstractions, when implemented in the original (perfect-recall) game. Our results are for a class of games that generalizes the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions for which any such results have been obtained. Further, our analysis is tighter in two ways, each of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error bound. We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties, the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of the game reduces to a clustering problem, where the increase in our bound is the distance function. This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds. We proceed to show a divide in the class of abstraction problems. If payoffs are at the same scale at all information sets considered for abstraction, the input forms a metric space, and this immediately yields a 2-approximation algorithm for abstraction. Conversely, if this condition is not satisfied, we show that the input does not form a metric space. Finally, we provide computational experiments to evaluate the practical usefulness of the abstraction techniques. They show that running counterfactual regret minimization on such abstractions leads to good strategies in the original games.","[Kroer, Christian; Sandholm, Tuomas] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Kroer, C (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ckroer@cs.cmu.edu; sandholm@cs.cmu.edu,,"Kroer, Christian/0000-0002-9009-8683",,,,,32,13,13,0,3,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,459,476,,10.1145/2940716.2940736,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300039,0

This reflects the problem of embedding in both its specific sense, of options being nested within one another, and its more general sense, whereby respondents cannot discriminate between close substitutes or between more-disparate rivals for the same budget. Furthermore, high proportions of reversals between WTP-value and simple preference based rankings of options are often highlighted. Although an incremental WTP approach was devised to encourage more differentiated answers and a higher degree of consistency among respondents, a theoretical basis for this approach has not been elucidated, and there is little evidence to show that this approach might indeed achieve greater consistency between explicit and implicit rankings inferred from WTP values. We address both these issues. Following our theoretical exposition, standard and incremental approaches were compared with explicit ranking in a study assessing preferences for different French emergency care services. 280 persons, representative of the French adult population, were interviewed. Half received the incremental version, the other half the standard version. Results suggest that the incremental approach provides a ranking of options fully in line with explicit ranking. The standard approach was reasonably consistent with explicit ranking but proved unable to differentiate between the five most preferred providers, as predicted by theory. Our findings suggest that the incremental approach provides results which can be used in priority-setting contexts.","[Lamiraud, Karine] THEMA Univ Cergy Pontoise, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Oxoby, Robert] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Donaldson, Cam] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Yunus Ctr Social Business & Hlth, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",CY Cergy Paris Universite; University of Calgary; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Lamiraud, K (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, Ave Bernard Hirsch,BP 50105, F-95021 Cergy, France.",lamiraud@essec.edu,,"Donaldson, Cam/0000-0003-4670-5340",Health Chair-a joint initiative by PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; ENSAE; MGEN; ISTYA under the aegis of the Fondation du Risque (FDR),Health Chair-a joint initiative by PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; ENSAE; MGEN; ISTYA under the aegis of the Fondation du Risque (FDR),"We would like to acknowledge colleagues at the Joint Meeting of UK and French Health Economists, Aix en Provence, 11-13th January 2012, and, in particular, Stephen Birch of McMaster University.

Indeed, in the last two decades the practice of investment treaty arbitration has revealed FET standard as the most important standard for foreign investors' international legal protection. This paper analyzes the relationship of this in principle treaty standard with general international law. Investment treaties generally do not provide a definition of FET standard and they are not uniform with regard its association with general international law. This has placed a lot of burden on investment arbitration tribunals who interpret this standard by taking into account the text and context of particular investment treaty. The paper gives an overview of relevant literature and practice of investment arbitration tribunals in considering two main questions. Firstly, the author considers whether the FET standard as such represents the existing general customary international law in the form of the long time acknowledged minimum standard of treatment of aliens. Secondly, the author considers whether the very large number of contemporary investment treaties, accompanied by the constantly growing arbitration practice with regard to FET standard has some sort of a rebound effect on general customary international law. The main conclusion of the paper is that the mutual influence of relevant customary and treaty law, as well as FET standard's more objective and clearer nature than the minimum standard says a lot about the potency of this standard to confirm its place in general international law.","[Muhvic, Davor] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Muhvic, D (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",dmuhvic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,33,42,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400004,0

These VAR models are estimated using seven variables: real GDP, consumer price inflation, real house prices, volumes of mortgages, and total loans to households, mortgage interest rate and money market interest rate. Point estimates of impulse responses show that monetary policy shock has a (i) negative effect on the real GDP and mortgages of households; (ii) temporary positive effect on the real house price and (iii) positive effect on the spread between the mortgage rate and the money market interest rate.

Apart from being the medium for fulfillment of fiscal goals, taxes can be used for a wide spectrum of non-fiscal goals, of which the most relevant is influence on income redistribution and the creation of a righteous society. Despite this importance, the system faces a problem which arises from an economic reality and manifests in the fact that, contrary to theory, practice knows not of optimal taxation. The aforementioned generates significant implications and creates practical limitations for achieving economic growth in a modern country and, consequently, society as whole. The aim of this paper is to perceive, detect and alter the characteristics of a tax system which create income and wealth inequality. An analysis had been conducted on the Croatian tax system, which was used to show how structure can provide incentive for creating and maintaining the persistent inequality. The results have shown that the effects of negative tax practices on inequality, in recent history, are still existent and untackled. The organization of tax rates is not working toward the direction of a positive distribution of the tax burden. High shares of regressive taxes in Croatian budget are proof of the system's departure from the equality principle. From the taxation aspect, capital income enjoys a privileged status when being compared to labor income. An obligation to pay lower corporate tax, instead of higher income tax, is being forced by lawmakers. The system suffers from loopholes that can be used for tax evasion and many categories are either not a subject of taxation, or their status is inadequate. Acknowledging theory and using empirical analysis of economic practice, it can be concluded that the Croatian tax system creates and deepens inequality and acts in favor of preserving a wide gap between contradictory societal structures. The latter confirms the necessity of tax system reform, taking into account the aims of curbing inequality and carrying out a righteous distribution of the tax burden with a simultaneous, efficient redistribution of collected assets. In order to achieve stability and create a base for future growth, the fulfillment of goals recognized under the scope of this paper need to be considered in the context of a societal priority.","[Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunja] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Rubinic, Ivan] Univ Rijeka, Fac Law, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Skalamera-Alilovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",skalamer@efri.hr; irubinic1@pravri.hr,"Rubinić, Ivan/S-6965-2019; Škalamera-Alilović, Dunja/R-6910-2018","Rubinić, Ivan/0000-0003-3352-3898; Škalamera-Alilović, Dunja/0000-0003-2346-154X",,,,,44,2,2,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,459,477,,,,,,19,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400048,0

Rosc.) is an annual herbaceous plant of high economic value, with a harvest of 10-12 months. The export demand of red ginger rhizome has increased up to 20-22 % for the last five years and it has not been able to be sufficed by the red ginger producers in Indonesia. This situation happens because of the very limited amount of red ginger production area, a still very conventional method of red ginger cultivation and the low quantity of organic substances in the soil. Other than that the use of expensive inorganic fertilizers often increases the production cost of red ginger, besides from being unsafe to both the environment and also the health of humans. Various technological breakthrough innovations have been done in order to meet the needs of red ginger export, one of which is the use of the polybag cultivation system which utilizes the organic waste as a media composition. The combination of organic substances with the application of liquid organic fertilizers was expected to increase and improve the growth and yield of red ginger rhizome. The research was conducted at Agrotechnopark experimental field Jember University from January 2013 until June 2014. The aim of field experiment was to find out the effect of media compositions and organic fertilizer concentrations on growth and yield of red ginger rhizome (Zingiber officinale. Rosc.). The field experiment factorials (3x4) used in randomized block designs with three replications. The first factor is the media compositions (bokashi : charcoal husk : coco peat) consisting of three levels : M1 (40% : 30% : 30%), M2 (50% : 25% : 25%), and M3 (60% : 20% : 20%) and the second factor being the organic fertilizer concentration consisting of four levels: P1 (0 cc/l), P2(1.5 cc/l), P3 (3 cc/l), and P3 (4.5 cc/l). The results of this study concluded that a single factor of various composition media (M) was not significantly influence on all the parameters of growth and yield of red ginger rhizome. The single factor of concentrations of liquid organic fertilizer (P) and the interaction of two factors treatments (MP) was significantly influence on all parameters of the growth and yield of red ginger rhizome. The combination of treatments (M3P3) gave the best response to all parameters: plant height (58.8 cm), number of leaves (25.2), number of buds (35.6), rhizome fresh weight per plant (2329.64 g), total biomass (258.14 g), zingeron level (1.88 %) and oleoresin level (1.57 %).

Our main goal is to investigate if it is possible to identify homogeneous clusters regarding the companies' financial health by using the financial longitudinal data. The k-means partitioning of companies is based on time trajectories of these criteria. The clustering is made by using statistical system R and the package kml.

Because of the different goals of spatial analyses, one needs to particularise a set of information which will represent the population. The results of analyses based on spatial data are obtained by applying the relevant methods depending on the types of input information. This dependence results mainly from the location of data relating to objects or processes in the geographic space (topological, geometric or geographic properties). Changes to the location of the objects or processes not only affect the final analysis results, but also the spatial distribution of the analysed variable in particular time intervals. This means that the interdependence and heterogeneity of the localised spatial observations results from their nature. These properties are connected with a relevant location of the measurement points, i.e. spatial autocorrelation and also indicate the existence of directly unobservable factors, which differentiate the occurrence of the spatial phenomena. The aim of this paper is to present selected aspects of two theories: (1) design-based sampling, which assumes that the characteristics of a population in a given region are unknown, but permanent; and (2) model-based sampling, where the set of observed values for the entire region is obtained through the observation of a single implementation of a stochastic volatility model in that system.","[Suchecka, Jadwiga] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Rewolucji 1905 37, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Suchecka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Rewolucji 1905 37, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",suchecka@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,218,227,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000023,0

The position of the consumers as the weaker party in the contractual relation results with the implementation of various safe-guarding mechanisms in both national and international legislations. In cross-border transactions the position of the consumers is considered even more sensitive and the need for their protection results with numerous special provisions. Such provisions in Rome I are contained in the Article 6 that provides definition of the consumer contract (and also the exemptions) and establishes the rules for determination of the law that should be applied thereon. The main principle is that consumers should be protected by such rules of the country of their habitual residence that cannot be derogated from by agreement. Such solution still enables the parties to choose the governing law for their agreement, but provides the minimum of the protection to the consumers by not depriving them from the protection of their local rules they supposed to be familiar with. The aim of this paper is to analyse whether such solution is well balanced and well harmonized with the other EU instruments adopted with the purpose to ensure protection of the consumers, particularly in the field of the increasingly present on-line commerce.","[Zunko, Ivana Markovinovic] Law Firm Vedris & Partners Ltd, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Zunko, IM (通讯作者)，Law Firm Vedris & Partners Ltd, Zagreb, Croatia.",ivana.markovinovic@vedris-partners.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,13,22,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400002,0

In order to isolate the causal effect between family structure and children's condition, we estimate an econometric model that uses male preference for firstborn sons and local sex ratios to instrument the probability of a woman becoming a single mother. Our results have a local average treatment effect interpretation (LATE). We find that children being raised by a single mother (whose marital status is affected by a firstborn girl and a low sex ratio) have a height-for-age z-score that is lower than that of children of similar characteristics that cohabit with both progenitors. We claim that the increasing trend of single motherhood in Brazil should be of concern in health policy design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the pre-crisis period, causality is linear and unidirectional, running from oil to gold. In the post-crisis period, a bidirectional nonlinear causality relationship emerges. Volatility spillover transpires as the source of nonlinearity during this period. The time path of the causal linkages both for the returns and the levels (cointegration) was assessed via dynamic bootstrap causality analysis. We find that the causal linkage from gold to oil is time dependent and that the non-Granger causality null hypothesis rejection rate increased considerably in the post-financial crisis period.

The benefit of participating into a common currency area exceeds the cost of losing autonomy in national monetary policy only in case of cycle co-movement. However, synchronization was put back mainly due to country-specific differences and asymmetries in terms of trade and fiscal policies that became profound at the outset of the global financial crisis. As opposed to previous studies that are mostly based on linear correlation or causality modeling, we utilize the cross-wavelet coherence measure to detect and identify the scale-dependent time-varying (de) synchronization effects amongst Eurozone and the broad Euro area business cycles before and after the financial crisis. Our results suggest that the enforcement of an active monetary policy by the ECB during crisis periods could provide an effective stabilization instrument for the entire Euro area.

During this time the highest increase in both mean BMI and excess weight was observed between 1988 and 2012, i.e. after the political transformation, resulting in the improvement of living conditions. However, with respect to girls in late adolescence, between these years, the mean BMI as well as the prevalence of overweight were leveling off, while the percentage of boys with excess body fat in the same developmental category significantly increased in 2012. In the years 1966-1978 and 1978-1988 the pattern of changes in the prevalence of overweight and obesity reflected the social and economic circumstances, i.e. temporary economic improvements, or deepening political crises and food shortage. In conclusion, the weight status of schoolchildren strongly reflects socio-political changes that took place in Poland, as well as in most of the Central European countries in the last half century.

The Federal Reserve's accumulation of MBS and Treasury securities lowered MBS yields and mortgage rates by more than what would have been suggested by changes in market expectations alone, suggesting that portfolio rebalancing effects of LSAPs are an important consideration for monetary policy transmission. Our estimates also suggest that the Federal Reserve must hold a substantial market share of agency MBS or of Treasury securities to significantly lower MBS yields and in turn significantly lower mortgage rates.","[Hancock, Diana; Passmore, Wayne] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Hancock, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Di-ana.Hancock@frb.gov; Wayne.Passmore@frb.gov,,,,,,,37,19,26,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2015,43.0,4,,,,,855,890,,10.1111/1540-6229.12109,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,CU6ZL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363683900003,0

Based on this information, three new variables were created to analyse the competitive positioning of firms in a specific tourism destination: 'quality', 'value' and 'added value'; and a measurement method was proposed. The result is a manageable methodology that can be used by practitioners and researchers to analyse the lodging market and companies' positioning. The findings show that value is a subjective concept that depends on customers' expectations.

Holding technology adoption constant, the marginal returns to spending were relatively modest. Hospitals increasing the pace of technology diffusion (tigers) experienced triple the survival gains compared to those with diminished rates (tortoises).

It is well known that the HP filter is an optimal filter under some restrictive assumptions, especially that the cycle is white noise. In this paper we show that we can get a good approximation of the optimal Wiener-Kolmogorov filter for autocorrelated cycle components by using the HP filter with a much higher smoothing parameter than commonly used. In addition, a new method - based on the properties of the differences of the estimated trend - is proposed for the selection of the smoothing parameter.","Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Haig, G (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",gebhard.flaig@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This estimation is done separately for the major international source markets for Spain: Germany, the UK, Italy and the Netherlands. For this purpose, the authors use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration and the bootstrap method to construct empirical confidence intervals for each estimate. The results reveal that the tourism demand in all the countries studied has a similar income elasticity, which is approximately unitary. However, there is an important difference with regard to price elasticity: tourism demand from the UK is statistically price inelastic, but demand is elastic for the remaining countries. This finding is relevant because, first, it underlines the importance of studying the source markets separately instead of analysing an aggregate international tourism demand, and, second, it supports the need to implement different tourism policies and strategies with respect to the pricing decisions for each source market.","[Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos; Gonzalez-Gomez, Manuel; Soledad Otero-Giraldez, Maria] Univ Vigo, Dept Econ, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Alvarez-Díaz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain.",marcos.alvarez@uvigo.es,"Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos/AGF-3176-2022; , Manuel/C-9211-2019","Otero Giraldez, Maria Soledad/0000-0003-3247-2363; ALVAREZ-DIAZ, MARCOS/0000-0003-2372-1102; , Manuel/0000-0002-8433-0941",,,,,16,12,12,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The statutory right of redemption exposes purchasers to the risk that they may lose their property ownership and may not be reimbursed for property improvements. This study examines a large sample of Alabama foreclosure transactions to determine the effect of the statutory right of redemption on the net selling price. The findings of a search of redeemed properties indicate that the actual number of property redemptions is quite small; however, the average economic loss is estimated to approach 40 %. Also, an examination of 1,860 foreclosed properties from 2004 to 2012 shows that the right of redemption option influences the net selling price. For a property purchased with a $ 90,000 exercise price (foreclosed auction selling price), a 10 % increase in the foreclosed auction price increases the net selling price by as much as $ 250 in 2007-2012. The effect of the redemption option is less during 2004-2006 but it is still statistically significant for the most distant time to expiry.","[Gordon, Bruce L.] Univ North Alabama, Finance & Real Estate, Florence, AL 35632 USA; [Winkler, Daniel T.] Univ N Carolina, Joseph M Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Finance & Real Estate, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Winkler, DT (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Joseph M Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Finance & Real Estate, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",blgordon@una.edu; dt_winkler@uncg.edu,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Well-known examples are quotas, per unit tariffs, and, in part, transportation costs. In spite of this, we have no broad and systematic evidence of the magnitude of these costs. In this paper, we develop a new empirical framework for estimating additive trade costs from standard firm-level trade data. Our results suggest that additive barriers are on average 14%, expressed relative to the median price. The point estimates are strongly correlated with common proxies for trade costs. Using our microestimates, we show that an additive import tariff reduces welfare and trade by more than an equal-yield multiplicative tariff.","[Irarrazabal, Alfonso] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway; [Irarrazabal, Alfonso] Norges Bank, Oslo, Norway; [Moxnes, Andreas] Univ Oslo, NBER, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Moxnes, Andreas] CEPR, Berlin, Germany; [Opromolla, Luca David] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Banco Portugal, CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany; [Opromolla, Luca David] UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",BI Norwegian Business School; Norges Bank; University of Oslo; Ifo Institut,"Irarrazabal, A (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway.",,,,project European Firms in a Global Economy: Internal Policies for External Competitiveness (EFIGE); national funds by FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [PTDC/EGE.ECO/122115/2010]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/122115/2010] Funding Source: FCT,project European Firms in a Global Economy: Internal Policies for External Competitiveness (EFIGE); national funds by FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This is a substantially revised version of a paper previously circulated under the title The Tip of the Iceberg: Modeling Trade Costs and Implications for Intra-Industry Reallocation.

In this study the authors analyse the usefulness of applying a non-linear input-output (NLIO) model, in which price-induced input substitution is accounted for. For large changes in final demand, a NLIO model is more useful than a traditional IO model, leading to higher or lower impacts. For small changes in final demand input substitution is less likely. In that case the application of the NLIO may lead to the same results as a traditional IO model. To analyse changes of subsidies, a traditional IO model is not an option. A more flexible model, such as the NLIO, is required. The NLIO model forces researchers to make choices about capacity constraints, factor mobility and the substitution elasticity, which can be difficult but create flexibility and allow for more realism.","[Klijs, Jeroen] Wageningen Univ, Acad Tourism, NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, NL-4817 JT Breda, Netherlands; [Klijs, Jeroen; Peerlings, Jack; Heijman, Wim] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Breda University of Applied Sciences; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Klijs, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Acad Tourism, NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Mgr Hopmansstr 1, NL-4817 JT Breda, Netherlands.",klijs.j@nhtv.nl,"Peerlings, Jack/C-8473-2015",,INTERREG IVA 2 Mers Seas Zeeen Cross-border Cooperation Programme [03-007 - SusTRIP],INTERREG IVA 2 Mers Seas Zeeen Cross-border Cooperation Programme,"This research was part-financed by the INTERREG IVA 2 Mers Seas Zeeen Cross-border Cooperation Programme 2007-2013, under Grant Number 03-007 - SusTRIP.

While many studies focus on how residential proximity to transit influences the travel behaviors of individuals, the effect of workplace proximity to transit is less understood. This paper asks, does working near a light rail transit station influence the travel behaviors of workers differently than workers living near a station? We begin by examining workers' commute mode based on their residential and workplace proximity to transit station areas. Next, we analyze the ways in which personal travel behaviors differ between those who drive to work and those who do not. The data came from a 2009 travel behavior survey in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, which contains 8000 households, 16,000 individuals, and nearly 80,000 trips. We measure sustainable travel behaviors as reduced mileage, reduced number of trips, and increased use of non-car transportation. The results of this study indicate that living near a transit station area by itself does not increase the likelihood of using non-car modes for work commutes. But if the destination (work) is near a transit station area, persons are less likely to drive a car to work. People who both live and work in a transit station area are less likely to use a car and more likely to take non-car modes for both work and non-work (personal) trips. Especially for persons who work near a transit station area, the measures of personal trips and distances show a higher level of mobility for non-car commuters than car commuters - that is, more trips and more distant trips. The use of non-car modes for personal trips is most likely to occur by non-car commuters, regardless of their transit station area relationship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When a negative externality is produced the mechanism allows agents suffering from it to compensate those who reduce its production, by way of transfers implemented via a two-stage design. We investigate various factors that might affect the likelihood that subjects coordinate on a Pareto optimum: the size of the strategy space, the number of subgame perfect equilibria and inequality of the payoff distribution. Our experimental findings suggest that the mechanism's effectiveness crucially depends on the final payoff distribution (after transfers). It is also strongly negatively affected by the size of the strategy space. Finally, the impact of the number of equilibria on coordination only has a weak negative effect.","[Midler, Estelle] Basque Ctr Climate Change, BC3, Bilbao 48008, Spain; [Figuieres, Charles] INRA, LAMETA, CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Willinger, Marc] LAMETA, IUF, UM1, CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Figuières, C (通讯作者)，INRA, LAMETA, CS 79606, UFR Econ Ave Raymond Dugrand Site de Richter, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",estelle.midler@bc3research.org; Charles.Figuieres@supagro.inra.fr; willinger@lameta.univ-montp1.fr,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2015,45.0,3,,,,,513,535,,10.1007/s00355-014-0840-9,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CT8DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363044200003,0

Based on the Technology-Organization-Environment framework for organizational adoption decision making and organizational buying criteria a theoretical construct was developed. Variables were validated in exploratory preliminary research and subsequently tested based on factor analysis using 27 survey items in a quantitative web-based study among 177 organizations operating HDV in Germany. Knowledge, experience, use and purchase consideration concerning alternative power train technologies and further measures to reduce fuel consumption were additionally queried. Based on a multiple linear regression analysis, key findings show that at the current stage of market maturity environmental attitude and corporate social responsibility exert the strongest significant influence on willingness to select CO2-saving power train technologies. A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed six customer groups in order to yield behavioral market segmentation. Hereby it is shown that the performed transportation tasks do not determine the preference structures. Early adopting organizations are larger than average and driven by non-economic aspects as image or corporate social responsibility, whereas the mass market awaits lower purchasing prices.

The case is puzzling for a number of reasons. First, BITs were an initiative of the presidency, and the Brazilian political system is notorious for executive branch's high level of success at enacting legislation. Second, the record of treaty ratification is very high in the country; between 1988 and 2006, 98% of the treaties signed entered into force in less than 18 months. Finally, the Brazilian Congress approved various investor-friendly policies that required even higher voting thresholds in the same period that BITs were being negotiated. We use primary legislative data and interviews with policymakers and bureaucrats to argue that a concentrated but strong ideological opposition in the Congress certainly contributed to hinder BIT ratification, but an unresolved executive - which addressed most investor's demands through alternative channels - was the decisive factor in explaining non-ratification. Ultimately, our findings imply that scholars need to open the black box of the executive in order to better understand the determinants of treaty ratification.","[Campello, Daniela] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Campello, Daniela] FGV EBAPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lemos, Leany] Oxford Princeton GLF Programme, Princeton, NJ USA",Princeton University; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Campello, D (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,Oxford-Princeton Global Leaders Fellowship,Oxford-Princeton Global Leaders Fellowship,"We thank all commentators to the article, especially Cesar Zucco, Timothy Power, Andrew Hurrell, Duncan Snidal, Ngaire Woods, Bob Keohane, Valeria Palanza and Ken Shadlen.

The major part is dedicated to the complications within each phase of the EU ETS and to the recent developments it has undergone. We will briefly discuss the remedies suggested by prominent commentators. Furthermore, any policy tool to tackle climate change should be evaluated in view of the profound equity issues that are inherent to the climate problem. We will evaluate the EU ETS according to two justice-based criteria, related to effectiveness and the distribution of the duties involved in climate change, respectively. We will conclude that the EU ETS, in its current form, clearly lacks fairness on both criteria. However, the biggest problem is the unwillingness of EU leaders to mend, what could be, a commendable climate policy tool.

This study offers such an analysis by examining an important channel of cooperation against terrorism: international police liaisons, such as the FBI agents deployed worldwide. It is hypothesized that police liaisons are less likely to be sent to countries where human rights violations are widespread, since repressive governments see threat in foreign agents stationed on their territory. Survival analysis finds support for this hypothesis. An FBI presence does not require democratic government or a strong rule of law in the host country; but human rights abuse reduces the likelihood of an FBI deployment. These findings substantiate a link between human rights and counterterrorism cooperation, offering insights for the study of cross-border law enforcement and transgovernmental networks.","[Efrat, Asif] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC, Lauder Sch Govt Diplomacy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel; [Efrat, Asif] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC, Inst Policy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel",Reichman University; Reichman University,"Efrat, A (通讯作者)，Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC, Lauder Sch Govt Diplomacy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel.",asif@idc.ac.il,,,,,,,62,12,13,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We examine the evidence for the latter channel for Canada, using consumer confidence survey data. The composition of households' financial wealth between stock and pension funds holdings as well as the unique 6-month forecast horizon in the consumer confidence survey make Canada a particularly interesting case relative to the USA and the European countries. We find that both stock price changes and their volatility are significant predictors of consumer responses to questions that are unrelated to expectations of future personal finances, even after controlling for inflation, unemployment and interest rates. Moreover, there is a significant short-term increase in consumer pessimism after an unexpected rise in stock market volatility. Overall, the evidence for the confidence channel suggests that this channel can amplify the effects of the well-understood wealth channel. Consequently, it should be taken into account in determining quantitative impacts of the stock market on consumer behavior.","[Karnizova, Lilia] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Khan, Hashmat] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",University of Ottawa; Carleton University,"Karnizova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",Lilia.Karnizova@uOttawa.ca; Hashmat.Khan@Carleton.ca,,"Karnizova, Lilia/0000-0003-1841-567X",,,,,21,4,5,0,33,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Estimation of this model is easy and can be done within any econometrics software which supports maximum likelihood estimation of the Heckman selection model. The most important benefit of our model is that it provides an easy-to-interpret measure of the composition of the fully observed sample with respect to unobservables. As an example, we apply our model to the study of the composition of the female full time full year workforce, as has been done by Mulligan and Rubinstein (Q J Econ 123:1061-1110, 2008). We find that their conclusion that the female workforce was negatively selected in the late 1970s is robust to accounting for the potential endogeneity of education in a Heckman selection model. However, we find that accounting for endogeneity leads to a huge increase in the estimated returns to education.","Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Schwiebert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",schwiebert@leuphana.de,,,,,,,25,16,18,0,24,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Dynamic stable set satisfies (i) an external direct stability property, and (ii) an internal indirect stability property. Importantly, stability criteria are conditioned on the histories of past play, i.e. the dominance system has memory. Due to the asymmetry of the defining stability criteria, a dynamic stable set is stable both in the direct and in the indirect sense. We characterize a dynamic stable set directly in terms of the underlying tournament relation. A connection to the covering set of Dutta (J Econ Theory 44:63-80, 1988) is established. Using this observation, a dynamic stable set exists. We also show that a maximal implementable outcome set is a version of the ultimate uncovered set.","[Vartiainen, Hannu] HECER, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Vartiainen, Hannu] Univ Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Vartiainen, H (通讯作者)，HECER, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",hannu.vartiainen@helsinki.fi,,,Academy of Finland,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"I am grateful for an anonymous referee on comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

This article explores how employees who work in a public service support function and receive little, if any, direct feedback from citizens may maintain their public service identity during their back office work. The study finds, against much previous empirical research, that these back office employees achieve positive identity affirmation through bureaucratic work. The findings also show that they affirm their caring and community focused public service identity by noting their superiority in this regard when compared with colleagues. However, this augmented self-narrative results in many experiencing feelings of isolation. The article discusses how these findings extend the understanding of identity affirmation among back office public servants and may improve our ability to effectively support these workers.","[Butler, Clare] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Work & Employment, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Doherty, Anne Marie] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Finniear, Jocelyn] Swansea Univ, Organisat Behav, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Hill, Stephen] Sohar Univ, Sohar, Oman",Newcastle University - UK; University of Strathclyde; Swansea University; Sohar University,"Butler, C (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",clare.butler@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,2,2,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Following this line of research, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of pedestrian saturation flows in public transport doors and show some values of this variable under different conditions. The methodology to achieve this aim was real-scale experiments performed in both PAMELA and the Human Dynamics Laboratory at Universidad de los Andes in Santiago de Chile. Different groups of people getting off a mock-up of a public transport vehicle were recorded by means of video cameras. The videos were then visually processed to find values of passenger saturation flow according to door configurations. The variables studied were the vertical gap between the platform and the vehicle chassis and the width of the door. Results indicate that it is possible to define values of passenger saturation flows for different characteristics of public transport doors. These values proved to be statistically sensitive to both the vertical gap and the width of the door. In addition, results indicate that there seems to be both a vertical gap and a door width for which the flow of passenger reaches its optimum rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the presumed benefits but not the actual harm of the eminent domain actions typically eludes the working-class and low-income segments of the community that often shoulder the greatest consequences of the action. Municipal governments must be much more exacting, deliberative, and strategic in ensuring there is an obvious and direct connection between the potential economic development opportunities leveraged by eminent domain practices and the benefits, opportunities, and resources that the community derives from those transactions of local government.

While the existing spatial econometric literature focuses on tax and spending competition, very little is known about spatial interaction via public debt. If jurisdictions compete for mobile capital to finance public spending, they may compete in debt levels as well as taxes. We use a theoretical model to derive the reaction of jurisdictions' debt levels to their neighbors' debts. We then estimate the spatial interdependence of public debt among German municipalities using a panel on municipalities in the two largest German states from 1999 to 2006. We find significant and robust interaction effects between debt levels of neighboring municipalities, which we compare to spatial tax and spending interactions.

Most price convergence occurred before 1870, mainly as a consequence of the abolition of the European trading monopolies with Asia, and, to a lesser extent, the repeal of duties on Atlantic trade. After 1870, price differentials continued to decline thanks to falling freights and to better communication after the lay-out of telegraph cables.

The empirical results are basically consistent with an insider view of labor market institutions. Labor market institutions tend to protect (older) employees but might harm (young) entrants. Remarkable is especially the significant and very high effect of employment protection for regular jobs on youth unemployment. In addition, the combined effects of powerful unions and a coordinated wage bargaining system are beneficial for older people and detrimental to youth. Finally, the paper identifies a significant link between a demographic as well as an educational factor and both youth and total unemployment.","[Sachs, Andreas] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Smolny, Werner] Univ Ulm, D-89069 Ulm, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Ulm University,"Sachs, A (通讯作者)，Prognos AG, Europa Zentrum Wirtschaftsforsch & Strategieberat, Nymphenburger Str 14-2, D-80335 Mannheim, Germany.",andreas.sachs@prognos.com; werner.smolny@uni-ulm.de,,,,,,,36,5,6,3,41,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

I use variation in the timing and nature of drug testing regulation to identify the impacts of testing on black hiring. I find that adoption of protesting legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7% to 30% and relative wages by 1.4% to 13.0%, with the largest shifts among low-skilled black men. The results are consistent with ex ante discrimination and suggest that drug testing may benefit African Americans by enabling nonusing blacks to prove their status to employers.","[Wozniak, Abigail] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Wozniak, Abigail] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wozniak, Abigail] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Wozniak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,,,Princeton University; Upjohn Institute,Princeton University(Princeton University); Upjohn Institute,"I thank Princeton University and the Upjohn Institute for financial support and Reed College for research space during the writing of this paper.

The data are based on skier visits to the largest ski-lift operator in the world (Compagnie des Alpes) for the winter seasons 1993/1994 to 2011/2012. Using dynamic panel data models for six ski resorts, the study finds relatively low income and price elasticities in absolute terms, with long-run elasticities of 0.64 and -0.40, respectively. Furthermore, the study finds that snow depth measured at the weather station Col de Porte - located at the medium elevation of 1,325 metres above sea level - is a significant predictor of skier days in the high-elevation ski areas. However, the magnitude of the effect of poor snow years is very small: on average, low-snow winter seasons (such as 1989/1990 or 2006/2007) will lead to a reduction in skier visits of about 2.5%. The results are not sensitive with respect to the measurement and timing of snow depth.","Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Falk, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",martin.falk@wifo.ac.at,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513",,,,,54,27,29,5,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In this case, the number of variables can be very large. For instance, usual dynamic factor models in central banks handle over 100 variables. However, there is a growing body of literature indicating that more variables do not necessarily lead to estimated factors with lower uncertainty or better forecasting results. This paper investigates the usefulness of partial least squares techniques that take into account the variable to be forecast when reducing the dimension of the problem from a large number of variables to a smaller number of factors. We propose different approaches of dynamic sparse partial least squares as a means of improving forecast efficiency by simultaneously taking into account the variable forecast while forming an informative subset of predictors, instead of using all the available ones to extract the factors. We use the well-known Stock and Watson database to check the forecasting performance of our approach. The proposed dynamic sparse models show good performance in improving efficiency compared to widely used factor methods in macroeconomic forecasting.

What has been missing from the existing literature on ideational change at times of crises however, is a sense of how processes of persuasive struggle, and how the success of those 'norm entrepreneurs' arguing for ideational change is shaped by two contextual variables: the most immediate material symptoms and problems that a crisis displays (the variety of crisis); and the institutional character of the policy subsystem that agents have to operate within to affect change. Introducing these two variables into our accounts of persuasive struggle and ideational change enables us to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of ideational change at times of crisis. The article identifies that a quite rapid and radical intellectual change has been evident in the field of financial regulation in the form of an embrace of a macroprudential frame. In contrast in the field of macroeconomic policy - both monetary and fiscal policy, many pre-crash beliefs remain prominent, there is evidence of ideational stickiness and inertia, and despite some policy experimentation, overarching policy frameworks and their rationales have not been overhauled. The article applies Peter Hall's framework of three orders of policy changes to help illuminate and explain the variation in patterns of change in the fields of financial regulation and macroeconomic policy since the financial crash of 2008. The different patterns of ideational change in macroeconomic policy and financial regulation in the post-crash period can be explained by timing and variety of crisis; sequencing of policy change; and institutional political differences between micro policy sub systems and macro policy systems.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Polit Int Studies & Philosophy, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.baker@qub.ac.uk,,"Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-6677-930X",,,,,51,48,50,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

With the newly implemented choice program, students are able to choose high schools outside as well as within their school districts. I estimate hedonic models using boundary fixed approach and panel fixed approach together. With sales price, rental price and advertised price of apartments as dependent variables, the findings consistently reveal that school choice reform reduces housing prices in a high-performing school district relative to the housing prices in a low-performing school district by approximately 10-27%. In addition, after reform, people in a high-performing school district are more likely to outmigrate to other communities compared to one in a low-performing school district. This implies that school choice could have unintended consequences driven by change in housing price and student composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we describe an integrated hierarchical approach to determine line plans by defining the stations and trains according to two classes. Based on a bi-level programming model, heuristics are developed for two consecutive stages corresponding to each classification. The approach determines day-period based train line frequencies as well as a combination of various stopping patterns for a mix of fast trunk line services between major stations and a variety of slower body lines that offer service to intermediate stations, so as to satisfy the predicted passenger transport demand. Efficiencies of the line plans described herein concern passenger travel times, train capacity occupancy, and the number of transfers. Moreover, our heuristics allow for combining many additional conflicting demand-supply factors to design a line plan with predominantly cost-oriented and/or customer-oriented objectives. A range of scenarios are developed to generate three line plans for a real-world example of the HSR network in China using a decision support system. The performance of potential train schedules is evaluated to further examine the feasibility of the obtained line plans through graphical timetables. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The main findings are as follows: the Bundesbank was clearly stability oriented with regard to inflation and included output stabilization, interest rate smoothing and inflation forecasts in its decision-making process during the period under investigation, that is 1979M01-1998M12. Furthermore, evidence of the inclusion of the quantity of money in the decisions has been found at least for the 1980s. The estimation results for the ECB from 1999M01 onwards reveal a monetary policy that is less stability oriented than that of the Bundesbank in that it clearly violates the Taylor principle. According to this, the ECB cannot be seen as the successor of the Bundesbank as regards the way it has conducted monetary policy.","Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Rühl, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Univ Str 12, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",tobias.ruehl@uni-due.de,,,,,,,35,7,7,1,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Especially the differentiation between long-term vs. short-term as well as functional/rational vs. extrafunctional/emotional motivators is assessed. Results suggest a predominance of functional motivators and rational connotations over extra-functional/emotional ones. The models to check whether short-term or long-term effects dominate did not clearly confirm a predominance of long-term factors as hypothesized. In several regression models a moderating effect of rational short-term connotations on different long-term motivators was found, thus contributing notably to the prediction of future vehicle use-intention.

Despite the growing number of papers published in recent years, an overall conceptualization of parking policy is still missing. Previous attempts (Shoup, 2005; Litman, 2006; Barter, 2010) focus mainly on the North American planning experience. We try to bridge this gap analysing the evolution of parking policy in Europe. In this paper we first present the key aspects of parking policy, and describe their generic evolution. Next we suggest a novel approach for parking policy making. We conclude by discussing some of the major challenges policy makers will face in the near future regarding parking in urban areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We use annual data from 1890 to 2012 and find that at the 1- and 2-year horizons and over time, generally the housing return positively affects consumption growth while the stock return negatively affects it. For the 3- to 6-year horizons, the two return shocks generally exert a negative, but small, effect on consumption growth. These opposite responses to changes in housing and stock returns suggest different mechanisms through which wealth affects consumption. Further, the housing return effect generally increases after 1980. The sub-period from 1980 to 2012 includes the 1997/2002 asset price boom/bust where house prices continued to rise moderately as stock prices fell. These findings suggest that the magnitude of the relative return effects differs with both time and horizons and also depends on whether prices increase or decrease.","[Simo-Kengne, Beatrice D.; Gupta, Rangan; Aye, Goodness C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",University of Pretoria; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",stephen.miller@unlv.edu,"Simo-Kengne, Beatrice/AAA-4303-2019; Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019","Simo-Kengne, Beatrice/0000-0002-4948-5868; Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605",,,,,25,21,21,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Chi-Squared Automatic Identification Detector (CHAID) was used to identify groups (segments) in order to understand how functional limitations contribute to the need for traveler information. The key findings suggest that people with functional limitations have a greater need for traveler information concerning different aspects of travel beyond traveler information that relates to their functional limitation(s); this greater need also relates to groups of people with covert functional limitations to which little consideration is usually given. Further, it is feasible to consider the need of traveler information generated by functional limitation(s) in providing traveler information in public transportation, and people with combinations of functional limitations that include loss of lower extremity skills and prevalence of poor balance are particularly in need of relevant traveler information.

As the monetary policy rule has endogenous regressors, the conventional Kalman filter cannot be applied. Thus, the two-step procedure proposed by Kim and Nelson (J Monet Econ 53:1949-1966, 2006) is used for consistent estimation of the hyper-parameters of the model. The results indicate that the reaction function parameters of the Central Bank of Brazil are time-varying and that the regressors of that function are endogenous. Besides, we observed that: (i) the monetary policy interest rate (Selic rate) responses to current inflation and the inflationary expectations present considerable changes and have diminished with the passing of time; (ii) since mid-2010, policy rule has violated the Taylor principle; (iii) the implicit target for the Selic interest rate has shown a decline over time; and (iv) the degree of interest rate smoothing has shown a relative stability. Finally, the policy instrument response to the output gap presents an increasing trend over the 2010-2011 period.","[da Silva Bejarano Aragon, Edilean Kleber] Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Post Grad Program Econ PPGE, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [de Medeiros, Gabriela Bezerra] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Post Grad Program Econ PPGE, BR-90040000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Aragón, EKDB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Post Grad Program Econ PPGE, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.",edilean@hotmail.com; gabriela.bm@hotmail.com,,,Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Personnel (CAPES); National the Brazilian Council of Science and Technology (CNPq),Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National the Brazilian Council of Science and Technology (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors would like to thank the editor, two anonymous referees, Marcelo S.

We find that REITs with overconfident CEOs tend to invest more; these REITs acquire more assets and are less likely to sell assets than their counterparts if they have enough discretionary cash. Valuable private information is not the main driver for CEOs to be net buyers of company shares: the shares of their companies perform relatively weakly. In addition, we find that overconfident managers have lower property investment performance measured by net operating income and gain on sale of real estate.","[Eichholtz, Piet] Maastricht Univ, Dept Finance, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Yonder, Erkan] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkey",Maastricht University; Ozyegin University,"Eichholtz, P (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Finance, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",p.eichholtz@maastrichtuniversity.nl; erkan.yonder@ozyegin.edu.tr,"Yönder, Erkan/AAV-6196-2020; Yonder, Erkan/I-7799-2015","Yonder, Erkan/0000-0003-4758-7841","European Centre for Corporate Engagement (ECCE); METEOR, the graduate research school of Maastricht University's School of Business and Economics","European Centre for Corporate Engagement (ECCE); METEOR, the graduate research school of Maastricht University's School of Business and Economics","We thank Jaap Bos, Brad Case, David Geltner, Jay Hartzell and seminar participants at Maastricht University for their helpful comments.

The Sao Paulo subway network reaches 74.2 km of length and is involved in around 20% of the commuting trips by public transportation, enhancing mobility and productivity of workers. This paper uses an integrated framework to assess the higher-order economic impacts of the existing underground metro infrastructure. We consider links between mobility, accessibility and labor productivity in the context of a detailed metropolitan system embedded in the national economy. Simulation results from a spatial computable general equilibrium model integrated to a transportation model suggest positive economic impacts that go beyond the city limits. While 32% of the impacts accrue to the city of Sao Paulo, the remaining 68% benefit other municipalities in the metropolitan area (11%), in the State of Sao Paulo (12.0%) and in the rest of the country (45%).

We show that goodness of fit, forecasting performance and parameter estimates vary substantially with the frequency bands over which the model is estimated. Estimates obtained using subsets of frequencies are characterized by significantly different parameters, an indication that the model cannot match all frequencies with one set of parameters. In particular, we find that: (i) the low-frequency properties of the data strongly affect parameter estimates obtained in the time domain; (ii) the importance of economic frictions in the model changes when different subsets of frequencies are used in estimation. This is particularly true for the investment adjustment cost and habit persistence: when low frequencies are present in the estimation, the investment adjustment cost and habit persistence are estimated to be higher than when low frequencies are absent.

The proposed test is useful for reducing potential data snooping bias. Unlike previous methods, we model the covariance matrix by factor models and develop a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test statistic for the above testing problem. The GLR test is also extended to a stepwise GLR (step-GLR) test in the spirit of the step-RC test of Romano and Wolf (Econometrica 73(4):1237-1282, 2005) and step-SPA test of Hsu et al. (J Empir Financ 17(3):471-484, 2010). The step-GLR test can identify the most contributed predictive models to the rejection of the null hypothesis. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that the GLR test is much more powerful and less conservative than the SPA test of Hansen (J Bus Econ Stat 23(4):365-380, 2005). We also present an application to illustrate the use of the GLR test and make a comparison between our GLR and Hansen's SPA tests.","[Cai, Zongwu] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Cai, Zongwu] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zongwu] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jiancheng] Univ N Carolina, Dept Math & Stat, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Zhang, Jingshuang] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xibin] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",University of Kansas; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Xiamen University; Monash University,"Cai, ZW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",caiz@ku.edu; jjiang1@uncc.edu; zhang.jshuang@gmail.com; xibin.zhang@monash.edu,"Jiang, Jiancheng/G-4792-2016",,,,,,24,0,0,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Most existing approaches use a manifestation of the copula that requires kernel density estimation of bounded variates lying on a -dimensional unit hypercube. This gives rise to a number of issues as it requires special treatment of the boundary and possible modifications to bandwidth selection routines, among others. Furthermore, existing kernel-based approaches are restricted to continuous data types only, though there is a growing interest in copula estimation with discrete marginals. We demonstrate that using a simple inversion method can sidestep boundary issues while admitting mixed data types directly thereby extending the reach of kernel copula estimators. Bandwidth selection proceeds by a recently proposed cross-validation method. Furthermore, there is no curse of dimensionality for the kernel-based copula estimator (though there is for the copula density estimator, as is the case for existing kernel copula density methods).","McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Racine, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",racinej@mcmaster.ca,"Racine, Jeffrey/N-9476-2014","Racine, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5680-3705",,,,,23,17,18,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Analysis based on field work suggests that although patriotism includes a basic consensus about the homeland, a clue to the success of the concept is its capacity to be appropriated, distorted, or embedded in diverse understandings and practices. Easily 'captured' by different actors according to their needs and goals, patriotism also appears to be deeply rooted in the personal and the private. Everyday patriotism is thus far from being reduced to its top-down or official dimension. While patriotism is a tool that officials efficiently use to promote their political goals, it is also a symbolic resource that Russian society uses in its attempts to reformulate a new collective identity.","Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Dept Slav Studies, Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Le Huérou, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Dept Slav Studies, Paris, France.",lehuerou@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,23,23,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 2,2015,67.0,1,,,SI,,28,48,,10.1080/09668136.2014.988999,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AZ9HU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348525400003,0

There is no stable basis for that claim because Marshall's discussion was contradictory and Robert Giffen rejected a key assumption made by Marshall. By the mid-1920s, discussion of an upward-sloping demand curve attached no particular significance to a Marshallian story. The formulation of the Irish famine Giffen exemplar by P.A.

The main characteristic of the construction of roads is connecting people from different parts of the county in order to ensure their participation in all aspects of life together with free movement of goods and passengers. County and local roads are of great importance as a part of the road network in the distribution of traffic at a lower level. Modernization in all aspects of life requires modernization and development of transport infrastructure, which leads to faster and better flow of transport services. Based on the provisions of the Road Act public roads are divided into: motorways, state roads, county roads and local roads. County roads are public roads connecting county seat with towns and municipalities. Local roads are public roads connecting the towns or a municipality with settlements of more than 50 residents within the town or municipality. County Roads Administration is an institution for management, construction, reconstruction and maintenance of county and local roads. One of the main activities of County Roads Administration is the construction of roads. In the process of performing its basic activity the County Roads Administration faces issues with the ongoing implementation of the actions required for the settlement of property rights relations. Settlement of property rights relations is the key part in the procedure of road construction. The issue of resolving property rights relations arises from complex property relations of real estate that are necessary for the construction of a particular road. The aim of this paper is to show the way and phases in the process of resolving property relations concerning real estates planned to become an integral part of the road, the conclusion of contracts with property owners as well as the expropriation procedure that occurs if the owners disagree with the donation or sale of their property.","[Boskovic, Zrinka Vulic] Zupanijska Uprava Ceste Pozesko Slavonske Zupanij, M Gupca 6, Pozega 34000, Croatia; [Tepsa, Ivana Vulic] Hrvatske Ceste Doo, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Boskovic, ZV (通讯作者)，Zupanijska Uprava Ceste Pozesko Slavonske Zupanij, M Gupca 6, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",zrinka.vulic.boskovic@zuc-pz.hr; ivana.vulic@hrvatske-ceste.hr,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,789,793,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100078,0

Much of the literature in this field studies the effects on a stylized financial system of an initial exogenous shock, typically consisting in the default of a given bank. Although purely idiosyncratic shocks occur they are rare, moreover this sort of disturbance reflects only partially what happened in the recent crisis, which was indeed caused by a shock generated at real level (i.e. the inability of hundreds of thousands of American families of paying their mortgages). In this paper we provide a general framework to assess systemic risk when the shock is due to firms' default. Design/methodology/approach - We developed a model with two types of agents, banks and firms, linked one another in a two-layer network by their reciprocal claims. We used numerical simulations to investigate the emergence of systemic crisis and the evolution of contagion in presence of a shock at firms level. The shock that we impose on the system consists in the default of a given number of firms, which are assumed to become unable to pay back their loans. Banks exposed toward defaulted firms mark them as bad loans and reduce their value accordingly. In this way the original shock is transmitted to the financial network, which can absorb or amplify it, determining the default of one or more financial institutions. The model is calibrated with empirical data on the banking sector of Italy, Germany and United Kingdom. Originality/value - The work formalizes one aspect of the interplay between financial and real side of the economy, two worlds too often left separate from one another. Moreover, compared to other studies on this subject, it gives a more solid foundation for the initial shock and put emphasis on the relationships between banks and firms. Even though the model presented is a stylized representation of reality and its calibration is necessarily rough due to the lack of public available data, it provides a different and until now little explored insight for the emergence of systemic crisis, constituting a useful starting point for future research. Practical implications - This study shows how firms' default can generate systemic crisis in a financial network through the web of credit and debit relationships. The results of the simulations confirm the idea that a higher degree of interconnection is not always good for financial stability and that it may actually exacerbates contagion, contrasting with the standard view that diversification is the key element to reduce risk. The model is able to assess the frequency and the extent of a crisis and to track the evolution of contagion. From a regulatory point of view, the outcomes of the model suggest that banks' size distribution and capital ratio can make some countries more prone to systemic crisis than others.","[Bottazzi, Giulio; Vanni, Fabio; De Sanctis, Alessandro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, I-6127 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"De Sanctis, A (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Pzza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-6127 Pisa, Italy.",,"De Sanctis, Alessandro/HPE-4008-2023",,,,,,13,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,248,259,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200020,0

Although there has been a growing number of studies on the relationship between entrepreneurship and culture, much less is known about how this relationship in turn affects access to finance. We locate our study in Tunisia, a country, with a relatively high score of ease of doing business, but which does not score as highly around two specific indicators: starting a business and accessing credit. This prompts enquiry into how Tunisian economic agents such as start-up entrepreneurs and financial institutions operate in order to optimize on the increasing post-revolution fund flows and to create an inclusive and entrepreneurial private sector led economy. The information and communication technology (ICT) sector is selected because of its perceived ability to draw out culturally-constructed norms and practices and also because it captures the millennial generation that triggered the Arab Spring uprising. Relevant models such as those by Hofstede and Hofstede (2005) are used in conjunction with ethnographic field research that allows for mapping of key culturally-constructed norms and practices from both the demand and supply side. The study finds that culture is not only a major determinant of business start-up but also access to finance. Causality is however not unidirectional. Entrepreneurship amongst the millennial generation exerts influence on social and business culture, but not so much on financial sector practice which is still predominantly in the hands of a more conservative and older generation. Access to finance does not appear to have as much effect on entrepreneurship as was originally thought. Specific implications for the Tunisia case are presented. Choke point interventions are suggested, with some suggesting shifts towards increasingly targeting specific aspects of culture and not just business.","[Bougacha, Houda] Avicenne Private Business Sch, Tunis, Tunisia; [Chileshe, Christian] Univ Lusaka, Lusaka, Zambia",,"Bougacha, H (通讯作者)，Avicenne Private Business Sch, 90 Ave Mohamed 5, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,709,721,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200055,0

Therefore, it becomes important for both academics and practitioners to examine all drivers (tangible and intangible) of innovation process. In researching the linkages between intellectual capital (IC) and innovation, it is widely accepted that IC is associated with organization's innovative performance. Nevertheless, traditional assessment of innovation performance does not usually tackle IC and knowledge issues. For that reason, this paper presents an empirical analysis of the effect of different IC categories on various types of innovation performance. The main objectives are to understand the role of IC in different aspects of companies' innovation performance better and enable companies to capture as much of innovation potential as possible in order to capitalize IC for innovation. Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on survey data, collected in Serbia during 2014. The survey included 78 Serbian companies with at least 100 employees. The companies were diverse with regard to ownership structure, industry and geographic location. Seven IC categories were analysed (human, structural, internal relational, external relational, renewal, entrepreneurial, trust) in terms of their effect on five different types of innovation performance (innovation in products/services, processes, management practices, marketing practices, business models). Correlation and linear regression analyses were used to identify correlations between aforementioned measures and significant influence of IC stocks on different types of innovation performance. Originality/value - It is well-accepted in the relevant literature that IC encompasses three interrelated categories: human capital, structural capital, and relational capital. However, to explain the linkages between IC and innovation better, the following new IC dimensions were added: renewal capital, entrepreneurial capital and trust capital, which could be especially influential for innovation. This study is original also in examining the linkages between IC categories and different innovation performances to identify the most significant IC elements for various aspects of innovation. Practical implications - The outcomes reveal potential and barriers within IC, crucial to different aspects of innovation performance. In this way, this study enables deeper understanding of intangible drivers of various types of innovation and highlights possibilities to foster intangible innovation potential. Finally, our findings help the managers to capture more innovation potential, facilitate and capitalize IC in process of innovation and improve different types of innovation in Serbian companies.","[Cabrilo, Sladjana; Raspopovic, Neda] Educons Univ, Fac Business Econ, Sremska Kamenica 21208, Serbia; [Kianto, Aino] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, FI-53851 Lappeenranta, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Cabrilo, S (通讯作者)，Educons Univ, Fac Business Econ, Vojvode Putnika 87, Sremska Kamenica 21208, Serbia.",,"Kianto, Aino/Y-6931-2019; Cabrilo, Sladjana/AAG-8606-2021","Kianto, Aino/0000-0001-7173-3525;",,,,,37,0,0,1,17,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,989,1000,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200075,0

Studies on multicultural management in organizations recognize the relevance of CD and the positive relationship between diversity and corporate performance. However, only a paucity of literature addresses the issue of CD and its value for innovative firms. We strongly believe that CD is a key driver for innovation. Based on this assumption, our paper aims to highlight the relationship between CD and innovation, and pinpointing the role of how knowledge is managed towards the enhancement of innovation. The paper also aims to identify some effective policies for managing CD in the service of promoting innovative behavior. Methodology - This study is based on an inductive approach according to which, proposing specific company experiences, one may try to draw more general considerations. The paper initially comprehensively reviews the existing literature on management of CD within organizations. Thereafter, an analysis of the experiences of three innovative and competitive companies that operate internationally has been conducted. To collect data we consulted secondary sources and the websites of each company. The data collection will provide target information on the approach and the policies adopted by companies to deal with success CD in terms of innovation. Integrating the literature analysis with the data collection, we propose a conceptual framework to explain the links between CD and knowledge management (KM), and the ways in which they impact upon innovativeness. Originality - This paper highlights the value of CD for innovative firms and how it can promote the ability of companies to expand their knowledge horizons in order to promote and support innovativeness. Practical implications - The proposal of a conceptual framework that links CD, KM and innovation, and the analysis of some business experiences that can be a benchmark in the field, can yield important insights for management. Enhancing management awareness and appreciation of corporate orientation to CD, may have significant implications in terms of innovation and human resources.","[Castellani, Paola; Rossato, Chiara] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Josman, Zvi] Bar Ilan Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",University of Verona; Bar Ilan University,"Castellani, P (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Artigliere 19, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1250,1264,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200096,0

The presence of certain practices, traditions, customs and other events (promotion of traditional products, practicing a sustainable tourism, etc.) can lead to a more efficient local sustainable development. Identifying the mechanisms by which local identity contributes to the process of sustainable development is the main objective of this research. The subject has been addressed through a case study on Tirgu Neamt ethnographic sub-area (located in the North East Region of Romania). We carried out participant observations and interviews with the relevant territorial actors, through which we determined the specific leverages by which the feeling of local identity helps to increase the local cohesion and leads to a better development and promotion of touristic/economic activities in the area. In Tirgu Neamt ethnographic sub-area, local identity is still well protected and represented by identity referents (the presence of popular craftsmen, the existence of cattle markets and fairs, the existence of artistic cultural manifestations like festivals and celebrations regarding the patron saints of churches, etc.) which contribute to the touristic promotion of the area and to the sustainable development of the whole community. In addition to those above, it is worth mentioning other ways of fostering local identity in a community, like manifestations aiming to revitalize forgotten habits and traditions by involving the young (traditional dances, handicraft evening sittings), through local practices of traditional crafts and other aspects related to the sustainable development of the community.","[Cazacu, Mihaela-Daniela; Iatu, Corneliu; Cruceanu, Alexandrina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Geog & Geol, Dept Geog, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Cazacu, MD (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Geog & Geol, Dept Geog, Iasi, Romania.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,1,18,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,317,324,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400040,0

The study was performed in two stages. At the first stage, research was undertaken in the form of in-depth interview about the trends of the CI process at Latvian companies (N=12). The interview was prepared on the basis of the theory developed by Calof J. and Breakspeare A. regarding the competitive intelligence process and the role of organisational culture in ensuring of CI. At the second stage, quantitative research was carried out regarding the role of organizational culture in the implementation of competitive intelligence technologies in Latvian companies (N=39). The questionnaire was carried out based on the theory of organisational culture developed by Cameron K.S. and Quinn R.E. The results of the empirical study show that organisations in Latvia have a leak of systematic approach in ensuring of managerial processes. The process of competitive intelligence was usually spontaneous and unplanned; therefore, it could be superficial and unfocused. Besides, the study about the role of organisational culture in ensuring of CI Latvian enterprises shows that organisational culture can facilitate successful process of CI within the company. If innovations comply with main norms and values of organisational culture, if the changes themselves become a cultural value of the company, then culture plays a positive role in development of the organisation. Development of organisations has become increasingly associated with learning or accumulation of knowledge and experience, with the concepts of innovation and adaptation, as well as with implementation of constant changes determined by accelerated processes of technological, social, economic and political changes.","[Cekuls, Andrejs] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Cekuls, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Cekuls, Andrejs/V-2423-2018","Cekuls, Andrejs/0000-0003-3696-818X",,,,,8,0,0,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,947,954,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400121,0

The paper highlights how this transformation was led by the design culture (Deserti and Rizzo, 2014; Concilio, Deserti and Rizzo, 2014) as a pervasive character of the city. The analysis of the case compares the Milano Design Week business model with the fair business model, focusing on the elements of differentiation and on the scaling up mechanisms. In addition, the comparative analysis provides lessons learnt on: The ways of combining bottom up initiatives with the overall innovation strategies of the official fair and of the city; The ways of building and managing the value chains in the field of CCI; The effectiveness of the scaling up model of the Milano Design Week. Design/methodology/approach - Milano Design Week is presented as a business case study, with the aim of investigating how the multiple actors result in a constellation that coproduce value (Chesbrough and Rosembloom, 2002), representing and diffusing design culture outside its professional community in the larger context of the entire city. The authors conducted a field research, meeting and interviewing some of the actors, as well as a desk research, retrieving documentation on the historical aspects and on the more recent developments of the Milano Design Week. Originality/value - The construction of the Milano Design Week is discussed as a design-driven innovation (Verganti, 2010) and as a long-term strategic action conducted through the use of design thinking (Brown, 2009; Lockwood, 2009; Martin, 2009), that has led to an original business model based on the application of design knowledge and tools. Practical implications - The paper provides a better and detailed understanding of the working dynamics of specific and contextualised solutions for the Milano Design Week, explaining how they have been transferred and/or replicated in different contexts and what impacts they have had on the city.","[Deserti, Alessandro; Cobanli, Onur] Politecn Milan, Design Dept, I-20158 Milan, Italy; [Rizzo, Francesca] Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture & Terr Dev, I-40136 Bologna, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Bologna,"Deserti, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Design Dept, Via Durando 38-A, I-20158 Milan, Italy.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1604,1615,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200123,0

If one addresses the study of knowledge retention in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), however, there is a particular shortage of research. Against the prevalence of SMEs, this situation is unsatisfactory. Therefore a better understanding of knowledge retention is important both in practice and in theory. Accordingly, the purpose of our study is to increase our understanding of how SMEs retain critical knowledge. The paper deals with the following issues: How is knowledge treated in the company? How is critical knowledge retained? What methods are applied in order to retain relevant knowledge? How is knowledge shared in the company? Design/methodology/approach - Taking the purpose of our study, we selected an explorative (qualitative) research approach. As research technique, we chose qualitative interviews as this technique allows us to gather data about the participants' point of view (Bryman, 2012). More precisely, we conducted semi-structured interviews with organization members (i.e. executive and regular staff) from five Austrian SMEs operating in the building and construction industry. Originality/value - This study provides fresh insights into knowledge retention in SMEs. The findings advance the limited body of knowledge regarding knowledge retention in SMEs and also contribute to the further development of the study of knowledge management in SMEs. Practical implications - Based on the study's findings we derive suitable measures to better manage the process of knowledge retention in SMEs. These measures may be useful for SMEs operating in other industries as well.","[Durst, Susanne] Univ Skovde, Sch Business, Hogskolevagen, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden; [Edvardsson, Ingi Runar] Univ Iceland, Sch Business, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Bruns, Guido] Incipere, D-40223 Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Skovde; University of Iceland,"Durst, S (通讯作者)，Univ Skovde, Sch Business, Hogskolevagen, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden.",,"Edvardsson, Ingi R/I-6813-2012; Durst, Susanne/GSD-4541-2022; Edvardsson, Ingi/AAC-7981-2019; Durst, Susanne/J-8919-2017","Edvardsson, Ingi/0000-0002-1167-3994; Durst, Susanne/0000-0001-8469-2427",,,,,32,1,1,0,2,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,594,605,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200046,0

The second objective is to measure the effort of governments in implementing policies for innovation. The overall aim is to shed light on whether, and if so, to what extent the public hand may be desirable for the development of CoI. Design/methodology/approach - Through a comparative study of Puglia and Guangdong, we first explore the innovation programs implemented by each government in the attempt of identifying those explicitly designed or having as an effect the promotion of CoI. We analyse characteristics, recipients, and objectives of the programs and highlight differences and similarities. The analysis of these programs brings us to the selection of indicators measuring the efforts made by governments for the promotion of innovation policies. We use these indicators for the computation of composite indices measuring the intensity of policies and compare the two areas in terms of public policy efforts for innovation. Originality/value - Considering two regions that greatly differ in terms of economy, and political and social background, we show whether and how local governments are involved in the promotion of innovation and in particular of CoI. Furthermore, we contribute to the debate that focuses on understanding the extent to which the involvement of the governments in the promotion of innovation produces desirable results. Finally, from a practical perspective, this work offers a critical analysis of a number of policy levers for the promotion of investments and initiatives aimed at creating favourable conditions for the flourishing of formal and informal CoI. Practical implications - The outcomes of the work gives strength to the idea that in the last few years innovation has become the main objective of governments, and CoI are one of the privileged mechanisms to achieve this objective. The comparison of Puglia and Guangdong, taken as two diametrically opposed examples in terms of institutional setting, may lead to uncover similar roles and uses of public interventions in the establishment and development of CoI. The demonstration of consistencies between the two areas in the implementation of policies would contribute to the more general industrial policy debate heralding the importance of public policies in favour of innovation, even in places where industrial policies are not clearly institutionalized.","[Elia, Gianluca; Petti, Claudio; Sarcina, Angela] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Sarcina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Via Monteroni SN,Campus Ecotekne, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",,"ELIA, Gianluca/N-5942-2015; Petti, Claudio/L-8735-2015","Petti, Claudio/0000-0002-0628-5145",,,,,23,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,42,57,,,,,,16,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200003,0

Further publications discuss the linkages among big data, analytics, experiential learning connected with executive and managerial decision-making processes in academia and practice (Liebowitz, 2014). In light of this, the increasing importance of process complexity within organisations can be seen as an on-going challenge. This implicates new ways of company specific knowledge creation. Although knowledge creation is widely discussed within KM literature, relatively little attention has been paid to business process complexity linked with process knowledge, process innovation and ways to deal with it. Business process complexity impacts process costs, process quality and process effectiveness within organisations. Business process complexity interacts with employees' individual and detailed business process knowledge. This leads to different areas of interdependencies: firstly, the flow of business process creation between organisational procedures and employees` knowledge, secondly, how to deal with business process complexity, and thirdly, how to link employees' business process knowledge and business process complexity for its effective application. This study applies a mainly qualitative research approach. It uses interviews for analysing complexity, and measures complexity based on process data within the billing processes at Fraport AG. Aim is to demonstrate interdependencies among complexity, processes, knowledge creation and innovation. The findings reveal significant interdependencies among tacit and explicit knowledge creation, such as business process content, complexity increase and decrease effects, complexity drivers and business process descriptions. It shows, that the increasing growth of business products requests an allembracing treatment of KM and business processes to achieve innovative goals and to handle with process complexity.","[Frueauff, Dieter H.] Fraport AG, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gisy, Jenny R.] SRH Hsch Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany",,"Früauff, DH (通讯作者)，Fraport AG, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1628,1641,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200125,0

A rich complex of natural enemies (NE) exploits these two species. However, NE usually colonize citrus trees once aphid populations have exceeded economical thresholds. Hence, successful biological control should be based on anticipating the arrival of NE. Recently, our group has found that citrus orchards with a ground cover of grass (Poales: Poaceae) had less aphids per colony and these colonies lasted shorter than those colonies found in orchards with bare soil management. These differences were attributed to an earlier appearance of aphid NE in the grass cover which attracted NE to the citrus orchard. This early appearance of NE contributed to a successful control of aphids in the canopy.","[Gomez-Marco, Francesc; Tena, Alejandro; Urbaneja, Alberto] IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Moncada, Spain; [Jacas, Josep A.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Unitat Associada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Urbaneja, A (通讯作者)，IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Asociada Entomol Agr UJI IVIA, Moncada, Spain.",urbaneja_alb@gva.es,"Tena, Alejandro/E-1143-2014; Jaques, Josep A./B-8352-2009; Gomez Marco, Francesc/X-4766-2018; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011","Tena, Alejandro/0000-0002-5001-4334; Jaques, Josep A./0000-0003-1353-1727; Gomez Marco, Francesc/0000-0002-2881-1396; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685",,,,,18,0,0,1,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1125,1128,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.141,0.0,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600141,0

Indeed, several genotypes of economic importance developed in Parana State, Brazil, have been found to have satisfactory tolerance to citrus canker. The objective of this research was to evaluate sweet orange 'Pera' genotypes for their susceptibility to citrus canker. A total of 25 'Pera' genotypes were evaluated in two orchards test in greenhouse inoculation studies. Disease incidence and severity in the field was estimated by assessing citrus canker on 10 plants per genotype. Four branches were sampled per plant on which the number of healthy and diseased leaves were counted, and the lesion numbers and the average severity (percent leaf area) were estimated for each diseased leaf. Estimates of severity were made using standard area diagram sets as an assessment aid. In the greenhouse, plants were grown in containers, and leaves of each genotype were inoculated by piercing the leaf with a needle and immersing the injured leaf in a suspenasion of X. citri subsp. citri inoculum (10(8) CFU/ml).

Often the proposed analyses focus on the economic performance of a company that is considered a stand-alone entity and not an organization correlated with the macroeconomic system. The purpose of this paper is to provide to the entrepreneurs, and propose to the scientific community, a newly structured knowledge system that includes the quality of customers and suppliers, to facilitate learning processes about the current state of the enterprise and new strategic approaches. Design/methodology/approach - The knowledge system is elaborated combining a long day by day experience in a specific Italian field (the Independent After Market -IAM) with the theoretical knowledge of both economic and financial issues and multiple criteria methods of decision aid. The economic and financial key performance indicators are generated ad hoc for a specific sector and created with the concept that a company is in the center of a network composed of its suppliers, customers, competitors and the State. A multiple criteria (MC) model easily and consistently includes aspects that are different in terms of source and formal language. An MC method transparently synthesizes all these elements in relation to a specific decision problem. Integrating the potential of MC models and methods with economic and financial issues and context experience facilitates an effective knowledge transfer to the operators of the sector. Originality/value - The added value of this approach is to allow even small and medium enterprises, without an internal know-how for economic analyses, to use tools that clarify their relations with the interested parties of the macroeconomic system and facilitate the quality assessment of their portfolio of customers/suppliers. For the companies already equipped with business intelligence tools, a comparison with this new approach can be a stimulus to confirm or question their own analysis method. Practical implications - This methodology is oriented to the companies involved in the IAM and in particular to the Manufacture, Distributor and Spare Parts Dealer categories ( in Italy almost 500 manufacturers, 150 distributors and 5.000 dealers). Manufacturers can use the methodology and its results to know the economic and financial performances of their customers, distributors can identify their strengths and weaknesses and the situation of their competitors and dealers can identify the most reliable future partners. Also foreign manufacturers may be interested in this analysis, before selling in Italy, and banks and financiers could consult our knowledge frameworks to analyse the risk default.","[Guelfi, Silvano; Norese, Maria Franca; Saluto, Paolo] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn DIGEP, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Guelfi, S (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn DIGEP, Cso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,106,116,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200008,0

I then use it to compute the price and real wage impacts of trade policy over 2001-2007, as well as the impacts of hypothetical, nonsigned trade agreements. I find that real wage gains positively predict the probability to sign a preferential agreement. Gains from multilateral opening reduce this probability. Finally, expected production price increases, reflecting market access gains, are a stronger determinant of the signing of PTAs than gains in the form of lower consumption prices.","[Jarreau, Joachim] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Jarreau, Joachim] Aix Marseille Univ, EHESS, Marseille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Jarreau, J (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France.",joachim.jarreau@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Nowadays organizations have to follow technological trends which are reshaping the landscape of reporting development process from slow and inflexible to much more flexible and agile reporting process. This new trend requires three critical components: Technology: As we know, data warehouses deliver a single version of the truth. In order to fulfill this condition we have to also modify DWH. For this purpose we can apply agile DWH modelling process which follow the actual needs of end users. Culture: It's always very complicated process to persuade management of organization to change business supportive environment.

Tips roots from Swingle citrumelo and Carrizo citrange (sensitive and tolerant rootstocks, respectively), growing in pots with control and chlorotic soil, were used for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. CombiMatrix array was performed to isolate differential genes, among which glutathione peroxidase (GPX), SAUR gene and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) showed to be the most involved ones. They were switched on Swingle grown on calcareous conditions compared to Carrizo (in the same soil) and to the same stock in the control soil. The over-expression of GPX could be the effort of plants to neutralize the oxidative environment produced by stress. The involvement of auxin (and as consequence of SAUR gene) in the regulation of Fe deficiency responses is also well known. Both genes were considered in association to peroxidase, ferric chelate reductase activities, iron and chlorophyll content, to monitor the degree of suffering of rootstocks. Among differentially expressed proteins, identified by means of 2D-PAGE and RP-HPLC/nESI-MSMS, a strong down-regulation of cytosolic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase beta-subunit and NADPH-isocitrate dehydrogenase could produce plant inability to sustain the energetic request of cell roots.","[Licciardello, Concetta; Torrisi, Biagio; Allegra, Maria; Sciacca, Fabiola; Intrigliolo, Francesco; Recupero, Giuseppe Reforgiato] Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr CRA ACM, Acireale, Italy; [Muccilli, Vera; Foti, Salvatore] Univ Verona, Dipartimento Biotecnol, I-37100 Verona, Italy; [Tononi, Paola; Delledonne, Massimo] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Chim, I-95125 Catania, Italy; [Fontanini, Debora] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Biol, Pisa, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); University of Verona; University of Catania; University of Pisa,"Licciardello, C (通讯作者)，Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr CRA ACM, Acireale, Italy.",concetta.licciardello@entecra.it,"licciardello, concetta/C-9296-2019; Delledonne, Massimo/O-8685-2017; Fontanini, Debora/G-6743-2017; Muccilli, Vera/L-3644-2017","Delledonne, Massimo/0000-0002-7100-4581; Fontanini, Debora/0000-0002-5519-993X; MUCCILLI, Vera/0000-0002-6212-5154",,,,,33,0,0,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1293,1301,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600164,0

Online reputation has become a significant and important element influencing the decisions of future tourists. The article deals with the perception of reviews in tourism and taking them to account, before any travel. Key segments in which the survey was conducted were mainly youngsters. Choosing youngsters was important due to their predominant use of elements and means of technical and technological environment. Thus, the survey participated mainly in the so-called Generation X,so those who are born from the year 1991 to 2000. Currently they are well known for their dependence on smart technologies and up to surveys they are more confidential to information, which is precisely through them or which they find on internet. For the realization of the survey method was used questionnaire survey, which based on more questions focused its attention on the track reviews for tourism. Three of them were used for the purpose of this paper.

Rural homes, 'bordei' type, had an extensive occurrence in Europe and beyond, found in various forms in different geographic regions throughout the history of manmade dwellings. Unfortunately, the construction of this housing typology in Romania, found mostly in the southern part, has stopped instead of evolving because of the failure to understand its benefits and degree of self-sufficiency in terms of energy consumption, protection, environmentally friendly approach, and so on. The main cause of the disappearance or scarce presence of the underground or half buried houses is their association with the early typologies of homes built by less fortunate people and therefore related to poverty and misery. Different global crisis led people to re-design underground homes or even restore vernacular ones for personal purpose or to include them in tourism circuits. One of the conclusions of this paper is that buried houses, derived from the traditional models and equipped with the contemporary technologies, could be a solution built in all respects with less impact on the environment and capable of revitalizing rural areas through eco-tourism.

The empirical analysis is based on a dynamic panel model, in which the data for the EU 14 countries in the period of 2002-2013 are used. Our findings suggest that deficit decreasing by the changes in debt service has the strongest positive effect among all estimates. Actually, every expenditure cut other than public investment is recommended. On the revenues side, we do not consider the growth of indirect taxes to be appropriate.

The genetic improvement objective is to increase meat production, based on maximizing meat production per female of breeding stock. Estimation of genetic progress using the character selection requires the use of selection indices. The study consists in identifications of the selection indices of some morphological traits which can lead to maximizing the meat production in a population of Ropsa carp. In the structure of selection index was measured the characters on live animal: weight (W), body depth (BD) and standard length (SL). The biologic material was represented by 50 individuals of Ropsa carp from 5 families, each family consisting of a mother and two fathers. Individuals were reared intensively in the same environmental conditions, since juvenile stage until the age of three summers. For each selection index was determined line vector of partial regression coefficients and the hierarchy was based on the accuracy of genetic evaluation and genetic progress provided by each variant. After calculating indices for each character considered, it was found that selection to maximize meat production of Ropsa carp population can be done on the basis of selection for live weight character (selection accuracy is 52.22%). This provides a genetic gain of 60.6318 grams for live weight. By transformation of morphological traits of individuals in the population of cyprinids can increase the quantity of meat/individual and contribute to sustainable aquaculture development and traceability.

Audit methodology reform of Business Risk Audit (BRA) and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires external auditors to give an opinion that there is a comprehensive, efficient and effective control framework clearly documented and consistently applied to prevent material misstatement in financial statements. Recently, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has recommended that external auditors rely more on the work of others to reduce the greater-than-expected costs associated with compliance with Section 404 of the SOX. External auditors' reliance on internal auditors have been researched for almost three decades, but the main focus of many studies has been on objectivity, work performance and competence of the internal audit function. This current study is therefore different. Its main objective are to explore the effects of external auditors' working styles, perceived communication barriers and moderating effects of client's risk management on the reliance of internal audit work. In order to obtain the necessary information and opinion, questionnaires were distributed to 250 audit firms in the Wilayah Persekutuan Malaysia and only 109 responses were received. The results showed that two factors, which are external audit working style and communication barriers, had a significant relationship with external audit reliance on the internal audit work.

Recent and older studies demonstrate a variable degree of sensitivity of citrus species to medfly infestations. It seems that the chemical properties of the citrus fruit rind are the most important barrier prohibiting survival and development of medfly immature stages. The toxic properties of rind vary a lot among different citrus species as a result of quantitative and qualitative (composition) aspects of citrus essential oils. Effects of fruit flesh on biological traits of larvae do not vary much among different citrus species. On the other hand, citrus essential oils affect, in a variable manner among different fruit species, a range of adult behavioral traits. For example, male medflies are attracted to citrus essential oils while exposure to them increases mating competitiveness over non-exposed males. Likewise, citrus oils regulate female ovipositional decisions. The current paper provides a comprehensive account on the complex interactions between medfly and citrus plants. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.","[Papadopoulos, Nikos T.; Ioannou, Charalambos] Univ Thessaly, Lab Entomol & Agr Zool, N Ionia Magnisias, Greece; [Papachristos, Dimitrios P.] Benaki Phytopathol Inst, Kifisia, Atiki, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Papadopoulos, NT (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Lab Entomol & Agr Zool, N Ionia Magnisias, Greece.",nikopap@uth.gr,"Papachristos, Dimitrios/AHC-0813-2022; Papadopoulos, Nikos/B-9156-2011","Papachristos, Dimitrios/0000-0002-0524-0180; Papadopoulos, Nikos/0000-0003-2480-8189",,,,,62,9,10,1,12,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1009,1018,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.126,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600126,0

The aim of the study described in this paper was to obtain data on the prevalence of Lawsonia intracellularis infections in Romanian pig herds. To realize this we used Lawsonia FIRST test (TM) kit (MicroCoat Biotechnologie GmbH), a qualitative single-use test designed to be used for the detection of Lawsonia intracelluaris in porcine feces. The samples were collected from four wean-to-finish herds from the west part of Romania, 15 samples / herd, from pigs with ages between 90 and 140 days. These herds were from different counties as it follows: Timis - 2 herds, Bihor and Hunedoara - one herd from each one. This study showed that Lawsonia intracellularis infection percent is different between herds, varying between 0% (herd 1 from Timis county) and 80% (herd 2 from Timis county). In herds from Bihor and Hunedoara counties the infection percent was 60, respectively 46.6%. The results indicate that infection with Lawsonia intracelluaris is very widespread in investigated pig herds-46.6% of samples were positive - and it occurs in herds with digestive disorders and in herds without clinical symptoms.

Digital technologies altered the way creative products were created, produced, reproduced, distributed, and commercialised at national and international levels. In the face of the continual emergence of digital disruptions, the traditional, existing sector is failing to rapidly enough adapt. The purpose of the paper is to provide a better understanding of an emerging framework for the transformation of incumbent cultural and creative enterprises in a digital age, called The AmbITion Approach. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical work developed The AmbITion Approach into a framework for business transformation in a digital age: blending participatory action research methods with modern management consultancy tools and design and creative practices. Digital research tools for inquiry were designed and prototyped, tested by a pilot study, and then embedded in a longitudinal study over two years of twenty-one participant organisations from Scotland's creative sector. Detailed grounded thematic analysis of the data corpus was undertaken, along with analysis of rich media case studies produced by enterprises about their change journeys. Empirical work also introduced to the framework Coghlan and Rashford's change categories. Originality/value - These enabled the description of the extent to which organisations developed: whether they experienced first order (change), second order (adaptation) or third order (transformation) change. The results of studies on participants, and validation criteria applied to the results, have demonstrated the approach triggers second and third order change. It is suitable for incumbent creative businesses to apply within the continuing landscape of digital disruption. However, all sectors face ongoing digital disruption. Practical implications - Management consultancy practices, and business strategy academics have called for new, empirically tried and tested, strategy development frameworks and toolkits, fit for a digital age. The concepts, methods, toolkits, and processes of The AmbITion Approach have been validated in the field as a new framework for business transformation for creative industries in a digital age. The findings justify provocations on current UK government creative economy policies. Governments must improve digital/economic development policy to better support incumbent, traditional creative enterprises providing cultural value, if they are to survive.","[Rudman, Hannah; Benyon, David; Hall, Hazel] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh Napier University,"Rudman, H (通讯作者)，Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp, Merchiston Campus,10 Colinton Rd, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Hall, Hazel JR/A-8511-2013","Rudman, Hannah/0000-0003-4502-3583",,,,,20,0,0,0,42,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1391,1403,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200107,0

The choice of a suitable rootstock is often very restricted by a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses. In this work we investigated the behavior of 4x and 2x 'Carrizo' citrange (Citrus sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata) subjected to the main abiotic stresses that threat the Spanish citrus industry. Seedlings were exposed to salinity, drought and iron deficiency, and physiological parameters were measured. Results suggest that 4x plants stressed by drought were less affected than 2x. Under salt stress no difference was found in leaf ion content, neither in gas exchange parameters, but leaf burn was less severe in 4x than in 2x. Concerning iron deficiency, a better tolerance of 4x compared to 2x was supported by higher Ferricchelate reductase activity, SPAD index and chlorophyll fluorescence. These preliminary results suggest that 4x 'Carrizo' citrange could be a promising rootstock, having nearly the same performance than the original 2x, but producing smaller trees more tolerant to abiotic stresses.","[Ruiz, Marta; Pina, Jose A.; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA Moncada, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Moncada, Spain; [Alcayde, Enrique; Primo-Millo, Eduardo] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA Moncada, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Moncada, Spain; [Morillon, Raphael] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier,"Ruiz, M (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA Moncada, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Moncada, Spain.",mvruiz@ivia.es,"Primo-Millo, Eduardo/D-8584-2014","Primo-Millo, Eduardo/0000-0002-2146-0175; Morillon, Raphael/0000-0001-6762-1715",,,,,40,5,5,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1283,1292,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600163,0

Employing a time -varying parameter framework (the Kalman filter), it is shown that a positive effect of nominal depreciation (as measured by the changes in the nominal effective exchange rate) on exports tend to disappear since 2009, while a restrictive impact on imports had been strengthened since then. The expansionary output effect of nominal devaluation has disappeared since 2009, with a weak evidence of the restrictionary effect in the wake of the latest devaluation of 2014. However, the impact of a large devaluation (or currency collapse) as measured by the appropriate dummy is likely to be restrictionary in respect to exports, imports and industrial output. Among other results, it is found that export dynamics is stimulated by the world prices of metals and agricultural goods as well as by industrial output in the eurozone and Russia. There is a strong correlation of imports with the domestic industrial output. Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the Ukraine's industrial output has become stronger linked to the performance of foreign trade partners.","[Shevchuk, Victor] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Technology,"Shevchuk, V (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",victorshevchuk@netscape.net,"Shevchuk, Victor Oleksiy/F-9951-2019",,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-05-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,195,204,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE9WH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378308600020,0

A simple model illustrates how both an increase in regulatory autonomy and privatization may influence the effect of corruption. The interaction is analyzed empirically using a fixed-effects estimator on a panel of 153 electricity distribution firms across 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean from 1995-2007. Greater corruption is associated with lower firm labor productivity, but this association is reduced when an independent regulatory agency is present. These results survive a range of robustness checks, including instrumenting for regulatory governance, controlling for a large range of observables, and using several different corruption measures. The association between corruption and productivity also appears weaker for privately owned firms compared to publicly owned firms, though this result is somewhat less robust.

Excerpts from the exchange have been used as a relevant piece of evidence by scholars who claim that Keynes came to reject rational decision criteria, thus focusing on the necessity for economic agents to form expectations on market sentiment, rather than fundamentals. This note concentrates instead on the whole correspondence and tries to show that a comprehensive reading of the exchange between Keynes and Townshend, unfolding through the years 1936-1938, suggests that its discussion thread was more technical than usually understood. It is argued that the correspondence provides evidence for the fact that Keynes still had a keen interest in a problem left unsolved in the Treatise on Probability, namely, the definition of an alternative to what he termed normal ethical theory in the Treatise and identified with strict mathematical calculation in the General Theory. The correspondence reveals that the issue of whether a useful decision rule can be devised under uncertainty still appears central in Keynes's thought in 1938.","[Zappia, Carlo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Zappia, C (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",carlo.zappia@unisi.it,,"ZAPPIA, CARLO/0000-0003-2471-5839",,,,,51,5,5,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Each of these is connected with spiritual, emotional and cognitive knowledge although the studies that have been developed so far neglect the relationship between knowledge management and cultural management. Therefore, we aim to determine the main barriers that appear in the process of knowledge sharing in the cultural organizations from Romania. How is the process of knowledge sharing developed? What barriers interfere? How do the cultural entrepreneurs deal with them? Design/methodology/approach - We propose an exploratory research, based on an ethical and qualitative approach in which we combine the results of a comprehensive literature review with the ones generated by a structured interview. The literature review focuses on the articles published in Scopus, Emerald, EBSCO, ProQuest and Sage databases. The results serve as a starting point in developing an interview guide for the Romanian cultural entrepreneurs who represent our research population. Then, we present interviews conducted with 8 representatives of Romanian public and private cultural organizations (managers, employees and entrepreneurs). We aim to determine how they are sharing their knowledge inside and outside their organization's boundaries and what are the institutional and cultural obstacles that they have to overcome. Data collected are processed using Nvivo software and research techniques like systematization and tabling are applied. Originality/value - This methodology focuses on the main cultural and institutional obstacles which Romanian cultural entrepreneurs have to overcome in order to share their knowledge inside and outside organization's boundaries. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application have both theoretical and practical implications. On one hand, we propose a nexus between knowledge management and cultural organizations. Knowledge creation, sharing and use seem to be ignored by researchers from the field of cultural entrepreneurship. Therefore, by bringing the obstacles that interfere in the process of knowledge sharing from the cultural organizations to the forefront we extend theory from both fields of research: knowledge management and cultural management. On the other hand, we facilitate the development of cultural organizations by monitoring their practices and signalling the challenges they face regarding knowledge management.","[Zbuchea, Alexandra; Leon, Ramona -Diana] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Fac Management, Bucharest 012104, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Zbuchea, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Fac Management, 30A Expozitiei,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",,"Leon, Ramona D./G-1091-2015; Zbuchea, Alexandra/A-2771-2011","Leon, Ramona D./0000-0002-1448-0522; Zbuchea, Alexandra/0000-0002-5341-7622",,,,,35,11,11,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1716,1727,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200131,0

We also show that there are higher murder and incarceration rates after the arrival of crack cocaine and that these are predictive of lower black high school completion rates, a result consistent with human capital theory.

These studies, as expected, conclude that BSS infrastructure (number of stations and capacity) have substantial influence on BSS usage. The earlier studies consider usage as a dependent variable and employ BSS infrastructure as an independent variable. Thus, in the models developed, the unobserved factors influencing the measured dependent variable (BSS usage) also strongly influence one of the independent variables (BSS infrastructure). This is a classic violation of the most basic assumption in econometric modeling i.e. the error component in the model is not correlated with any of the exogenous variables. The model estimates obtained with this erroneous assumption are likely to over-estimate the impact of BSS infrastructure. Our research effort proposes an econometric framework that remedies this drawback. We propose a measurement equation to account for the installation process and relate it to the usage equations thus correcting for the bias introduced in earlier research efforts by formulating a multi-level joint econometric framework. The econometric models developed have been estimated using data compiled from April 2012 to August 2012 for the BIXI system in Montreal. The model estimates support our hypothesis and clearly show over-estimation of BSS infrastructure impacts in models that neglect the installation process. An elasticity analysis to highlight the advantages of the proposed econometric model is also conducted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that business and consumer groups outside finance activate boundaries between legitimate risk management and illegitimate speculative practices. This categorical distinction delegitimised certain practices within the financial industry and affected both the relative power of interest groups and the political agenda. First, the mobilisation of moral boundaries strengthened the position of legitimate groups and weakened that of the financial industry in negotiations. This forced the latter to alter its lobbying strategies. Second, by highlighting inappropriate speculative practices, groups outside the financial sector changed policy-makers' perception of problems. Policy-makers adopted a position which is congruent with broader moral understandings. The study is based on data from Congressional hearings, interviews, media articles, letters and interest group publications. The process tracing analysis advances our understanding of the social mechanisms linking moral perceptions and institutional change in financial markets.","[Orban, Agnes] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, POB 411020, D-50870 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Orban, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, POB 411020, D-50870 Cologne, Germany.",aorban@uni-koeln.de,,"Janssen, Agnes/0000-0001-8913-159X",,,,,82,8,9,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We first show that the asymptotic theory for the bivariate test fails to apply to the multivariate case, because the kernel density estimator bias and variance cannot both tend to zero at a sufficiently fast rate. To overcome this difficulty we propose to reduce the order of the bias by applying data sharpening prior to calculating the test statistic. We derive the asymptotic properties of the sharpened' test statistic and investigate its performance numerically.

We find that this shock is not important for unemployment fluctuations in normal times. However, it plays a somewhat larger role during the Great Recession when it contributes to raise the actual unemployment rate by around 1.3 percentage points and the natural rate by around 2 percentage points.

Interestingly, the persistent deficits in many peripheral countries have not been accompanied by a significant growth process able to stimulate a log run rebalancing as neoclassical theory predicts. To shed light on the issue, this paper investigates the determinants of Eurozone CA imbalances, focusing on the role played by financial integration. The analysis considers two samples of 22 OECD and 15 EU countries, three time horizons corresponding to various steps in European integration, different control variables and several panel econometric methods. The results suggest that within the EU group of countries financial integration contributed to explain the CA deterioration in the peripheral countries especially in the post-EMU period creating an asymmetric behaviour within the EMU. From a financial stability perspective, this divergence' could hinder the effectiveness of monetary policy. By reducing the apparent benefits of participating in the monetary union, it also raises the risk of a break-up.","[De Santis, Roberta] Istat Italian Natl Inst Stat, Rome, Italy; [Cesaroni, Tatiana] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"De Santis, R (通讯作者)，Istat Italian Natl Inst Stat, Rome, Italy.",,,"De Santis, Roberta/0000-0003-4410-1375",,,,,32,17,18,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2016,39.0,10,,,,,1514,1538,,10.1111/twec.12418,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DZ2LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385673000003,0

Relevant research has not focussed on cycling for transport in a general context (as opposed to bike share), nor allowed for multi-modal trips. The influence of trip- and personal characteristics on whether cycling replaces car-driving have yet to be considered. The present study aimed to address these research gaps. An on-line cross-sectional survey was completed by 1525 Australians who cycle for transport at least once per week. For the most recent trip completed (at least partly) by bicycle participants provided trip distance, and percentage travelled by car, public transport (PT), and walking. They also provided the percentage travelled by each mode for the same trip before taking up transport cycling; and a hypothetical future trip when riding is not possible. Compared to the same trip before, fifty percent of recent trips reduced car use, and around 1 /1 eliminated a 100%-car trip. Reduced car use was significantly less likely for trips under 7.5 km, commuting, females, respondents under 55, and regular cyclists. Reduced car use was less likely for respondents who started riding because it is flexible, and more likely for those who started riding to avoid parking. Car-use was reduced by an average of 6.2 km per trip, and each bicycle km cycled replaced 0.5 car-km. Participants report that since taking up cycling, even when they cannot use their bike, they use cars less and use PT more compared to before they took up cycling. Results suggest that previous studies underestimated the extent to which transport cycling replaces car travel, and highlights trip types and population groups to target with cycling promotion strategies. Information about the per-trip and per-bicycle-km replacement of car, PT and walking may be used for more accurate estimation of the benefits of transport cycling than has hitherto been possible.

Airports are a common example where the supply of runway and terminal capacity is the core good and the supply of various concession services (for example, car rental services) is the side good. While side-good supply can be responsible for a major share in total revenue, monopoly regulation typically concentrates on the control of core-good prices (core prices in short). Whether market power can indeed be effectively controlled by the regulation of core prices alone then depends on whether core-good consumption is a function of the price for side goods. This study empirically shows that a one-dollar increase in the daily car rental price reduces passenger demand at 199 US airports by more than 0.36%. A major implication of our findings is that for the case of airports, the effective control of market power may require regulation of both prices for core and side goods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the ratio of the Potential to Safety Improvement (PSI) along the road, the objective of the paper is to propose a novel dynamic road segmentation model. According to the fundamental model assumption, the determined segments must have the same pattern of PSI. Experimental results obtained from implementation of the proposed method took four Performance Measures (PMs) into consideration; namely, Crash Frequency, Crash Rate, Equivalent Property Damage Only, and Expected Average Crash Frequency with Empirical Bayes adjustment into the accident data obtained from Highway 37 located between two cities in Iran. Results indicated the low sensitivity of the method to PMs. In comparison with the real high accident-proneness segments, identified High Crash Road Segments (HCRS) obtained from the model, demonstrated the potential of the method to recognize the position and length of high accident-proneness segments accurately. Based on the road repair and maintenance costs limitation index for safety improvement, in an attempt to compare the proposed method of road segmentation with conventional ones, results demonstrated the efficient performance of the proposed method. So as to identify 20 percent HCRS located on a read, the proposed method showed an improvement of 38 and 57 percent in comparison with the best and worst outcomes derived from conventional road segmentation methods.

However, road freight vehicles are a main source of the traffic air pollutants and noise emissions in cities. Available vehicle types, tour planning and purchase decisions in urban road freight transport differ from the passenger transport segment. The political and scientific literature lacks a comprehensive discussion of specific policy measures to support electric urban road freight vehicles. This article contributes to the existing body of knowledge, by undertaking a multi-criteria analysis of policy measures to support battery electric freight vehicles based on the rating by two stakeholder groups, policymakers and freight electric vehicle users. These stakeholders rate 23 policy measures as suggested in the literature or which are implemented in European countries. In comparing and ranking the rating results of the groups, we find that the discordance between the groups can be large and offers noticeable insight and room for future research and practice. Although financial support of electric vehicles is often named in the literature as the primary measure to overcome the total cost of ownership gap of freight electric vehicles, the current study shows that the effect of special legal measures and supporting the setup of company-charging infrastructure are underestimated by the policymakers. Recommendable policy options beyond several fiscal measures are to request emission-free vehicles in municipal tenders, to allow drivers with a class B license to drive freight EVs over 3.5 tons, or to implement a city toll on the long-term. The practicability of other policy measures depends on the local implementation goals of the municipality. Hence, a transparent debate on the aim of supporting electric freight mobility is as necessary as choosing measures targeted at the freight transportation segment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A different story is told here by examining how 'international terrorism' appeared as threatening and co-operation in the context of the EC became regarded as a logical solution. The article frames this as political events ('international terrorism') overflowing the space of politics (the state), whereby the latter felt it necessary to set up a series of arrangements to try to encapsulate the excesses of the former. It shows how the interpretation of terrorism as an illegitimate political provocation constituted an obligation for states to respond. Stressing the international character highlighted individual states' inability to tackle terrorism, which made it possible for co-operation to appear as obvious. Trevi and the Dublin Agreement are examined as manifestations seeking to work around, and thus reinventing, the limits of state sovereignty.","[Wittendorp, Stef] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Wittendorp, S (通讯作者)，Oude Boteringestr 23, NL-9712 GC Groningen, Netherlands.",s.wittendorp@rug.nl,,"Wittendorp, Stef/0000-0001-9626-6054",,,,,71,7,8,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Based on survival analysis, we examine the determinants of timing of land development empirically, using a sample of 783 residential projects in Hangzhou, China from 2005 to 2011. We use monetary policy indices as measurement of policy environment, and results verify our theoretical prediction that when the expected policy is positive, an increase in policy uncertainty significantly lowers the likelihood of land development; otherwise, policy uncertainty accelerates land development. However, market uncertainty fails to meet the prediction of standard Real Options, which indicates that developers in China focus more on policy uncertainty rather than market uncertainty in exercising their real options. We further find that in the face of declining demand, price volatility significantly accelerates land development, which verifies Grenadier, The Journal of Finance, 51(5), 1653-1679, (1996)'s prediction of Recession-induced Construction Booms. Empirical finding also verify that competition alone exerts a negative effect on development timing and also has a positive crossing effect with policy uncertainty.","[Wang, Yuan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Business, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Tang, Wei] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Jia, Shenghua] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Fudan University; Zhejiang University,"Tang, W (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",ywang@jjx.ecnu.edu.cn; tangwei616@gmail.com; jsh@zju.edu.cn,"Tang, Wei/IZQ-1283-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303060]; Morning Light Plan of Shanghai Educational Development Foundation [14CG26],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Morning Light Plan of Shanghai Educational Development Foundation,"We would like to thank anonymous referee, Hongyu Liu, Kwan Ok LEE, the 2012 APRES conference, and Center For Real Estate Study of Zhejiang University for many helpful comments.

A key contribution to the debate about the career paths of MEPs is made by Scarrow ( 1997). Her work, which identified three different career paths taken by MEPs, has been widely cited and used as a basis for other studies on this topic. Building on Scarrow's work, this paper describes two additional categories of MEPs-former national politicians and 'one-off' MEPs - and links MEPs' careers with their activities in Parliament. It finds that over and above the factors that have previously been identified as influential on an MEP's behaviour, his or her career path and ambitions are relevant in explaining certain legislative behaviour across Member States and party groups.","[van Geffen, Robert] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"van Geffen, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",r.j.van-geffen@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,16,16,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

With the rapid growth in the tourism industry and optimistic travelling trends, the destination competitiveness concept brings tourism economics theory and practices into sharper focus. The purpose of this study is to design performance-based destination competitiveness measurement for tourist destinations, grounded by competitiveness theory. This article asserts that a significant measurement of destination competitiveness is performance. The article integrates previous research in the field and proposes a conceptual framework of performance-based destination competitiveness. Indicators of tourism performance and future research directions are also presented.","[Hanafiah, Mohd Hafiz; Hemdi, Mohamad Abdullah; Ahmad, Ismail] Univ Teknol MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Hanafiah, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Hotel & Tourism Management, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",hafizhanafiah@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Hanafiah, Mohd Hafiz Mohd/B-6158-2017; Hanafiah, Mohd Hafiz/S-9696-2019; Hemdi, Mohamad Abdullah/N-3139-2017","Hanafiah, Mohd Hafiz/0000-0002-3378-7300; Hemdi, Mohamad Abdullah/0000-0003-1928-5192",Fundamental Research Grants Scheme (FRGS); Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOHE); Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia,Fundamental Research Grants Scheme (FRGS); Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOHE); Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work described in this study was funded by the Fundamental Research Grants Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOHE) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia.",,44,24,26,7,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This means that having an accurate estimate of VTTS for different segments of travel continues to retain currency, despite there being a rich literature on estimates of VTTS for different travel modes, travel purposes, income groups, life cycles, and distance bands. In contrast, there is a dearth of research and evidence on vehicle VTTS, although joint travel by car is an important segment of travel. This paper fills this gap by developing a group-based modelling approach to quantify the vehicle VTTS and compares this with the VTTS for a driver with and without a passenger. An online survey was conducted in Sydney in 2014 and the data used to obtain a number of new empirical estimates of vehicle and driver VTTS. The new evidence questions the validity of various assumptions adopted in current practice for valuing the time savings of car passengers and multiple occupant cars. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In a number of spheres of policy, it appears uncertainty has intensified in the face of globalisation, economic instability, climate change, technological innovation and changing consumer preferences. How can planners and policymakers plan for an uncertain future? There is growing interest in, and use of, techniques that can help decision making processes where deep uncertainty is involved. This paper is based upon one of the most recent international examples of a foresight exercise employed to examine uncertainty - specifically that which concerns uncertainty over the nature and extent of future demand for car travel. The principal focus of the paper is on the insights and guidance this examination of uncertainty brings forth for transport planning and policymaking. To accommodate deep uncertainty requires a flexible and open approach in terms of how policy and investment possibilities are formulated and judged. The paper argues for a focus upon the Triple Access System of spatial proximity, physical mobility and digital connectivity as a framework for policy and investment decisions that can harness flexibility and resilience. Uncertainty becomes an opportunity for decision-makers with the realisation that they are shaping the future rather than (only) responding to a predicted future. The paper outlines two forms of policymaking pathway: regime-compliant (in which adherence to trends and the nature of the world we have known pushes policy) and regime-testing (in which the nature of the world as we have known it is brought into question and vision pulls policy decisions). Stronger orientation towards regime-testing to assist in managing an uncertain future is advocated. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This article examines the interrelated role of rural tourism and motorcycle tourism, suggesting the formation of Regional Tourism Organizations (RTOs) in order to attract motorcycle tourists. This market has substantial disposable income and represents significant opportunity. However, barriers include regional boundaries, misperceptions regarding motorcyclists in general and failure to understand the demand generators of motorcycle tourism. This study shows that the motorcycle tourism market enjoys rural tourism and amenities and has significant disposable income, with the majority of motorcycle tourists spending more than $100 per day when visiting and touring an area. RTOs would do well to attract this lucrative market to rural areas because motorcyclists enjoy the existing rural nature, character, and amenities when they leave the beaten path.","[Sykes, Diane] Kaplan Univ, 451 Queen St, Northumberland, PA 17857 USA; [Kelly, Kathryn Gibson] Kaplan Univ, 577 Anita St, Laguna Beach, CA 92651 USA",,"Sykes, D (通讯作者)，Kaplan Univ, 451 Queen St, Northumberland, PA 17857 USA.;Kelly, KG (通讯作者)，Kaplan Univ, 577 Anita St, Laguna Beach, CA 92651 USA.",dsykes@kaplan.edu; kkelly3@kaplan.edu,"Sykes, Diane/M-8902-2013; Sykes, Diane/P-6447-2019","Sykes, Diane/0000-0001-7458-2929; Sykes, Diane/0000-0001-7458-2929",,,,,58,29,30,7,75,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Using housing samples during the period from 1999 to 2009, our main results show that private housing prices within 1-km zone and in 1-km to 2-km zone from the old school zone decline by 2.9% and 6.0%, respectively, 6 months before the school relocation events. Larger price declines of 5.5% and 6.9% are found for houses located in 1 km and 1 km to 2 km school zones 12 months before the school relocations. In the public housing market, we find that school relocations cause significant housing price declines of between 0.7% and 1.4% for households living within the 1-km school zone. The school relocation treatment effects are amplified by the school popularity ranking. The prioritization in school allocation accorded to houses within 1-km school zone has significant economic value in the private housing market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, information supply by interest groups has typically been viewed as part of an expertise-based exchange with policy-makers. Less attention has been devoted to whether the supply of information is also used to exert political pressure. In addition to expertise-based exchanges between interest groups and policy-makers, can we identify the prevalence of information supply that aims to put pressure on EU policy-makers? And under what conditions are different modes of information supply likely to occur? My analysis relies on interviews with 143 lobbyists who were active on a set of 78 legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. The results demonstrate that expertise-based exchanges are dominant in interactions with civil servants, while political information is predominantly communicated to political officials and often the key substance in outside lobbying tactics.","[De Bruycker, Iskander] Univ Antwerp, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"De Bruycker, I (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Iskander.DeBruycker@uantwerpen.be,"De Bruycker, Iskander/AAA-3066-2022","De Bruycker, Iskander/0000-0002-8304-4257",European Science Foundation [10-ECRP-008]; Research Foundation-Flanders [GA 171-11N],European Science Foundation(European Science Foundation (ESF)); Research Foundation-Flanders(FWO),"The work presented in this article was made possible by research grants from the European Science Foundation (10-ECRP-008) and the Research Foundation-Flanders (GA 171-11N).

Seduced by the promises of repo market-driven financial integration, the EU institutions and Member States encouraged private finance to generate its own architecture for the European repo market in the early years of the euro, sidelining known problems about systemic fragilities. These fragilities materialized after Lehman Brothers' collapse and were exacerbated by the ECB's collateral policies.

This article focuses on flexible parental leave for fathers in Norway, which until now has rarely been studied. Based on interviews with 20 fathers, the article explores their experiences with flexible organization of the leave, which provides them with a menu of choices, and considers how it affects their caring. Findings show that it allows work to invade care, produces a double stress and promotes half-way fathering. Flexible use of the father's quota tends to confirm fathers as secondary carers instead of empowering them as carers.","[Brandth, Berit; Kvande, Elin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Sociol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Brandth, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",beritb@svt.ntnu.no,"Brandth, Berit/Q-4511-2019",,Research Council of Norway [219116/F10],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This research has been funded by the Research Council of Norway (grant no. 219116/F10).,,42,40,43,2,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The RBF technique is demonstrated by solving the partial integro-differential equation for American and European options on non-dividend-paying stocks in the Merton jump-diffusion model, using the inverse multiquadric radial basis function. The method can in principle be extended to L,vy-models. Moreover, an adaptive method is proposed to tackle the accuracy problem caused by a singularity in the initial condition so that the accuracy in option pricing in particular for small time to maturity can be improved.","[Chan, Ron Tat Lung] Univ London, Royal Docks Business Sch, Docklands Campus 4-6 Univ Way, London E16 2RD, England",University of London,"Chan, RTL (通讯作者)，Univ London, Royal Docks Business Sch, Docklands Campus 4-6 Univ Way, London E16 2RD, England.",t.l.chan@uel.ac.uk,,"Chan, Tat Lung/0000-0002-4048-6370",,,,,32,10,10,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It draws on a survey of 2000 urban residents in 20 Ukrainian cities with a diversity of population size, administrative status, and geographic location. Correspondence analysis is used to show how different groups of the population are distributed along the two dimensions of responsiveness of local authorities and citizen participation. A typology of four ideal-types of city residents is elaborated: alienated, protesters, compliant, and interactive. The data reveal remarkably large differences among cities: from four to six of the cities are associated with each of the four typology categories based on the clustering patterns along the two dimensions. The main policy implication of the study is that general measures for local government reform should be combined with targeted measures directed at the various types of challenges experienced in different Ukrainian cities.","[Aasland, Aadne] Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res NIBR, Oslo, Norway; [Lyska, Oleksii] Dept Improvement Reg Competitiveness Kharkiv Reg, Kharkov, Ukraine",,"Aasland, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Urban & Reg Res NIBR, Oslo, Norway.;Lyska, O (通讯作者)，Dept Improvement Reg Competitiveness Kharkiv Reg, Kharkov, Ukraine.",aadne.aasland@gmail.com; alex_lsk@mail.ru,,"Aasland, Aadne/0000-0002-6516-9283",Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [12/0002],Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,The project has received funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [grant no. 12/0002].,,19,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

An implausibly high level of risk aversion is required to rationalize any investment into bonds when stocks are available.

Moreover, the levels of loss aversion typically reported in the experimental studies imply overinvestment in bonds, which is not observed in the data.

If the planner still worries about equality of resources, some of the social ordering functions satisfying equality and efficiency remain independent of ORP.

Using the experimental intervention as an instrument, the IV estimates of the effect of calories on height are an order of magnitude larger than the OLS estimates. Information from a unique measurement error process in the calorie data, counterfactuals results from the estimated model and external evidence from migration studies suggest that IV is not identifying a policy relevant average marginal impact of calories on height. The preferred, attenuation bias corrected OLS estimates from the height production function suggest that, averaging over ages, a 100 calorie increase in average daily calorie intake over the course of a year would increase height by 0.06 cm. Counterfactuals from the model imply that calories gaps in early childhood can explain at most 16% of the height gap between Guatemalan children and the US born children of Guatemalan immigrants.

One argues that globalization promotes convergence towards a neo-liberal system. Another stipulates that diverse capitalist regimes promote different comparative advantages, enabling diverse political economies to co-exist. In this article, we argue that the compatibility of diverse models of capitalism is contingent upon monetary regime. We examine how different currency regimes influence the mutual co-existence of export-led growth models (euro core) and domestic demand-led growth models (euro periphery). Under EMU, we find that these two models have become increasing incompatible, as unsustainable divergences in external balances have emerged between them. We hypothesize that external imbalances between these two growth regimes did not emerge prior to EMU because of the presence of two inflation adjustment mechanisms in the real exchange rate; the nominal exchange rate (in soft currency regimes) and national central banks' promotion of inflation convergence (in hard currency regimes).","[Johnston, Alison] Oregon State Univ, 330F Ballard Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Regan, Aidan] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Oregon State University; University College Dublin,"Johnston, A (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, 330F Ballard Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",Alison.Johnston@oregonstate.edu,,"Regan, Aidan/0000-0001-7558-730X",,,,,38,123,128,0,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We argue that combined use of the bicycle and public transport should be understood in a broader perspective, especially where bicycles link to higher speed and higher capacity public transport, such as the train. Cycling and public transport can, have a symbiotic relationship forming a hybrid, distinct transport mode, which should be reflected in transport planning. The bicycle is as a way to soften the rigid nature of public transport and thus accommodate diverse individual travel needs and situations. Public transport can be seen as a means to dramatically extend cycling's speed and spatial reach. We combine a system perspective with conceptuaLanalysis to explore how, why and when this reconsideration is important. We use the Netherlands as illustrative case because of the relative maturity of its bicycle-train connections. The case shows that the synergy between rather opposite yet highly complementary aspects, high speed of the train, high accessibility of the bicycle and flexibility in combining tooth sub-modes, are the fundamental characteristics to understand the functioning of this system in a wider spatial context. In our conclusion we propose a research agenda, to further explore the relevance of this system for land-use and transport planning and distil wider implications for the international debate.

This was achieved by introducing additional socioeconomic variables into a standard national-level trip end model (TEM) and using purpose-based analysis of the travel behaviours of certain key socially disadvantaged groups. Specifically the paper aims to explore how far the economic and social disadvantages of these individuals can be used to explain the inequalities in their travel behaviours. The models demonstrated important differences in travel behaviours according to household income, presence of children in the household, possession of a driver's licence and belonging to a vulnerable population group, such as being disabled, non-white or having single parent household status. In the case of household income, there was a non-linear relationship with trip frequency and a linear one with distance travelled. The recent economic austerity measures that have been introduced in the UK and many other European countries have led to major cutbacks in public subsidies for socially necessary transport services, making results such as these increasingly important for transport policy decision-making. The results indicate that the inclusion of additional socioeconomic variables is useful for identifying significant differences in the trip patterns and distances travelled by low-income.

These differences may reflect observable and unobservable characteristics of economic actors as well as differences in behaviour, norms, and individuals' attitudes.","[Schnabel, Claus] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lehrstuhl Arbeitsmarkt & Reg Polit, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Schnabel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lehrstuhl Arbeitsmarkt & Reg Polit, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",claus.schnabel@fau.de,"Schnabel, Claus/K-9668-2019","Schnabel, Claus/0000-0001-5979-8879",,,,,68,19,20,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The explanatory framework merges the theoretical insights of the moderation paradigm with the specific devices that characterise the post-communist religious field in investigating Muslims' support for democracy. The empirical analysis draws on a within-case comparison of Muslims' behaviour in three consequential stages of democratic transitioneach marked by different configurations of institutional settings and ideological options, which we trace as potential explanations. The analysis suggests that institutional arrangements played the primary role. Yet, learning from the experience of dictatorship and from a ready pool of inherited Albanian-specific templates facilitated the consensual reclaiming of Islam in a local, pro-democratic, and pro-European manner.","[Elbasani, Arolda] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Via Fontanelle 19, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy",European University Institute,"Elbasani, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Via Fontanelle 19, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy.",arolda.elbasani@eui.eu,"Elbasani, Arolda/H-6309-2015","Elbasani, Arolda/0000-0003-0225-3549",Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies (RSCAS); ReligioWest Project; European Research Council (ERC) [269860]; European Research Council (ERC) [269860] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies (RSCAS); ReligioWest Project; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author is grateful for financial support to Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies (RSCAS), ReligioWest Project, and European Research Council (ERC grant agreement no 269860).

Then, we assume that the decision maker is not only risk-averse, but also prudent and we obtain new minimum demand conditions as well as intuitively appealing interpretations for them. Finally, we consider the general case of investor's preferences exhibiting risk apportionment of any order and we derive the corresponding minimum demand conditions.

Nevertheless, it does not provide good empirical results, especially in the case of transitive economies. One of possible explanation is the existence of Balassa-Samuelson (BS) effect. It is one of the theoretical approaches which try to explain the development of exchange rate and price level. It proposes that faster growth of productivity leads to appreciation of domestic currency and/or to growth of domestic price level. The aim of this paper is to assess the role of BS effect in the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, this approach includes some strong assumptions such as validity of PPP theory for tradeable goods or, in the case of the domestic BS effect, the assumption that wages tend to be equalized across tradable and non-tradable sectors. In this paper, the significance of BS effect is tested even if some of these conditions are not valid. We use quarterly data (2000 - 2015) in regression analysis. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is used to assess the influence of productivity on inflation rate.","[Adamek, Emil] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Adámek, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",emil.adamek@vsb.cz,"Adámek, Emil/O-7152-2019; Adamek, Emil/H-6850-2018","Adámek, Emil/0000-0003-4779-5392; Adamek, Emil/0000-0003-4779-5392; Jajkowicz, Ondrej/0000-0002-1769-3793",,,,,15,1,1,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1,6,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500001,0

If a product of compromised quality is sold, it would first of all have an impact on the health of patients and, consequently, on the economic performance of the manufacturer. Destructive testing of medical devices is expensive and there are attempts to replace it by non-destructive tests. During the substitution of destructive tests with non-destructive ones, the strength of the test should be rationalized at the stage of process control planning. To do so, logit or probit models are the first choice. This article deals with an evaluation of typical destructive test results from both product and process verification and validation of medical devices. The differences between the estimated logit and probit models are discussed and arguments when to prefer which one are collected. Finally, replacement of destructive testing by non-destructive testing is evaluated numerically.","[Benes, Oldrich; Hampel, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Benes, O (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xbenes19@mendelu.cz; qqhampel@mendelu.cz,"Hampel, David/B-6765-2013","Hampel, David/0000-0002-3865-5948",,,,,10,1,1,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,37,42,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500007,0

For evaluation of alternatives the stochastic multicriteria evaluation method is proposed. It is based on a combination of the principles of ELECTRE I and III methods. Further, the algorithms must be modified and improved (not only) in order to accept an input data with stochastic character. In a practical part, bank products (bank deposit, building savings and supplementary pension insurance) and investments products (open unit trusts) of the Ceska sporitelna are chosen.

Each attraction is evaluated by a positive number called attractiveness, i.e. the degree of pleasure when a tourist sees it for the first time. In the theory of tourism networks it is a relatively new concept introduced by the authors in 2013 and explored in 2014 in cooperation with Italian colleagues. The attractiveness of a route is derived from them. It is not additive and less than the sum of individual values of attractiveness. Some vertices are terminal points of tourist trips and an OD matrix expresses the flows of tourist among them. Another matrix of the same dimension represents the duration limits.

Steel companies obtain some amount of emissions allowances for free which authorizes them to manufacture products (together with emissions). That is why that number of allowances is considered as the input in our model. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 emissions released is regarded as the output. In addition, the structure of companies size and GDP per capita are other inputs and amount of production is the second output. Two methods are used to evaluate the efficiency of units and compared. Apart of the traditional DEA approach, the PROMETHEE analysis is also used. The both approaches are applied to data set of 22 national steel sectors in Europe for year 2014.

Polish society is faced with concerns about jobs. Meanwhile, data from labor offices on the professions in which employers report the greatest demand clearly indicate that these are positions in industry and trade. For the purposes of achieving the objective, in addition to the study of literature, studies were carried out using a questionnaire survey among craft in Poland. The study was conducted from November 2015 to January 2016. The sample covered 990 craftsmen employers representing 29 trades. The results of research by the author shows that craft show great ability to create new jobs, which contributes to reducing unemployment. The process of vocational training of young workers is being implemented by Polish crafts largely on their own needs. Studies show nearly 50% of respondents craftsmen declare their willingness to work in his factory a young apprentice learning the craft at the time of the exam apprentice and as much as 45% expressed a desire to employment of a skilled worker.

We apply a bottom up techno-economic electricity sector model to determine transformation scenarios of the European electricity sector. It has a very detailed spatial disaggregation that allows for a fine representation of domestic and international electricity flows and transmission expansion. The cost-minimizing mixed-integer model calculates investments for time steps of ten years. The model results indicate that network requirements are lower than generally assumed. The largest share are domestic upgrades, rather than country interconnectors. Most investments (20bn EUR) occur in the near future, by 2030 the latest. Only the high-mitigation scenarios require large additional network investments. The timing and location of investments differ, depending on generation scenarios and cost assumptions for inter connectors. The results indicate that carbon emission reduction targets alone provide insufficient information for long-term network planning.","[Egerer, Jonas; Gerbaulet, Clemens; Lorenz, Casimir] Berlin Univ Technol TU Berlin, WIP, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Egerer, Jonas; Gerbaulet, Clemens; Lorenz, Casimir] DIW Berlin, Dept Energy Transportat Environm, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Egerer, J (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol TU Berlin, WIP, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.;Egerer, J (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Dept Energy Transportat Environm, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",je@wip.tu-berlin.de,,"Egerer, Jonas/0009-0009-2134-3532",,,,,38,15,15,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,3,,101,124,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI3.jege,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EF7OQ,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390519300006,0

The purpose of this catalog of methods is to provide a basis for evaluating the efficiency of measures for the control of water catchment areas. A Zone monitoring model (ZMM) which is a basis for appropriate monitoring schemes in view of risks for the groundwater coming from agricultural lands has been developed. Based on this scheme, various methods to monitor nitrate concentrations at different unit levels, from the farm to the soil zone and on to the groundwater are described. At farm level, nutrient balances are mandatory to identify the potentially remaining concentrations of nutrients in the soil. Nutrient balances are incorporated in the latest information and communication technology (ICT) and farm management information systems (FMIS). The methods at groundwater-level described here are groundwater sampling by means of a suction lance, soil sampling beneath the groundwater table, groundwater sampling using the direct-push method, sampling from observation wells, from multi-level observation wells and from production wells. These practices are the early-warning systems which can prevent the surface and/or underground drinking water from contaminating with unwanted chemicals. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Although this model continues to be a preferred means of analysis, many criticize it is far too aggregate in scope to capture the complexity of interactions between agents. This article aims to transverse the vulnerability of its broad-based scope by introducing an enhancement to the New Keynesian DSGE model used in conjunction with an Input-Output model for the case of the Czech economy. This enhanced model, based on the model of the Czech Ministry of Finance, HUBERT, incorporates individual features to account for overflows of intermediate products. The variable of intermediate products as inputs in an industry assimilates the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate. This approximation is also present for the consumption bundle and labour supply, which introduce price and wage stickiness into the model. Subsequent simulation reveals the extent to which external shocks affect intermediate-product demands. Disaggregating the DSGE model instills higher precision and consistency within the real economy. The findings from the multi-industrial model of the Czech economy assist to make conclusions about the effect of these shocks on industries. Finally, this model can serve as an instrumental means for policy makers to garner additional insight into the process of how real disturbances affect the economy.","[Gawthorpe, Katerina] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Gawthorpe, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",xzimk04@gmail.com,,,"University of Economics, Prague, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics in collaboration; Faculty of Business Administration under the Grant [IGA IG404035]","University of Economics, Prague, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics in collaboration; Faculty of Business Administration under the Grant","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics in collaboration with the Faculty of Business Administration under the Grant IGA IG404035",,11,0,0,0,0,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,105,117,,,,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100011,0

Even though the EU has authorized some GMOs to be marketed, they have to be labelled properly unless they are contained in foodstuffs as trace elements only.

Solow's own interpretation locates its origins in his view that Harrod's growth model implied a tendency toward progressive collapse of the economy. He formulates his view in terms of Harrod's invoking a fixed-coefficients production function. We challenge Solow's reading of Harrod's Essay in Dynamic Theory, arguing that Harrod's object in providing a dynamic theory had little to do with the problem of long-run growth as Solow understood it, but instead addressed medium-run fluctuations, the inherent instability of economies. Solow's interpretation of Harrod was grounded in a particular culture of understanding embedded in the practice of formal modelling that emerged in economics in the post-Second World War period. Solow's interpretation, which ultimately dominated the profession's view of Harrod, is a case study in the difficulties in communicating across distinct interpretive communities and of the potential for losing content and insights in the process. Harrod's objects - particularly, of trying to account for a tendency of the economy toward chronic recessions - were lost to the mainstream literature.","[Halsmayer, Verena] Univ Vienna, Dept Hist, Sci Hist Philosoph & Cultural Contexts, Maria Theresien Str 3-27, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hoover, Kevin D.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Hoover, Kevin D.] Duke Univ, Dept Philosophy, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of Vienna; Duke University; Duke University,"Halsmayer, V (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Hist, Sci Hist Philosoph & Cultural Contexts, Maria Theresien Str 3-27, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;Hoover, KD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Hoover, KD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Philosophy, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",verena.halsmayer@univie.ac.at; kd.hoover@duke.edu,,"Halsmayer, Verena/0000-0001-7253-507X",Austrian Science Fund [W 1228-G13],Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),Verena Halsmayer's work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund [grant number W 1228-G13].,,67,16,16,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In this contribution we focus on a novel nonparametric regression approach based on fuzzy transform technique. The original definition is extended into multivariate higher degree F-transform so that we are able to smooth (2 + 1) D discrete data. Proposed procedure allows us to calculate also partial derivatives of the estimated function easily. Extending the optimization problem by suitable constraint we can prevent most of the sources of arbitrage related to option valuation with implied volatility smiles.","[Holcapek, Michal] NSC IT4Innovat, Inst Res & Applicat Fuzzy Modelling, 30 Dubna 22, Ostrava 70103 1, Czech Republic; [Tichy, Tomas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Holcapek, M (通讯作者)，NSC IT4Innovat, Inst Res & Applicat Fuzzy Modelling, 30 Dubna 22, Ostrava 70103 1, Czech Republic.",michal.holcapek@osu.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Holcapek, Michal/AAV-9459-2021; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330",,,,,11,3,3,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,277,282,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500048,0

This noise is caused by rounding of prices, bidask spread and overall discrete nature of transactions and can significantly bias estimates. Microstructure noise is often modelled as i.i.d. variables independent of the efficient price process. However, real data indicate much more complicated structure than a white noise. In this paper we consider various models of microstructure noise. First, we model the noise as AR and MA time series. Next, we consider the noise dependent on asset prices. Another type of model is a noise created purely by rounding of prices. We study the impact of microstructure noise on realized variance and other integrated variance estimators such as maximum likelihood estimator, the realized kernel estimator and the pre-averaging estimator. We simulate various structures of microstructure noise which violate the assumptions of estimators and we analyze the resulting integrated variance estimates.","[Holy, Vladimir] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Holy, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vladimir.holy@vse.cz,"Holý, Vladimír/I-5814-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,289,294,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500050,0

Due to the lack of the residual series at hand, estimation of the model parameters is often performed by several ways. The most convenient way to estimate them is to use a multistage least squares method. Then the alternatives can be the maximum likelihood method or the Kalman filter approach where unknown history is treated as nonexistent.

In the literature the applications of multivariate statistical analysis are focused more on the prediction of bankruptcy than the evaluation of the financial standing of enterprises after bankruptcy. Studying the path of recovering from insolvency can be a source of valuable information useful in assessing the probability of a success of the restructuring. The aim of the paper is to present the results of the pilot research on the financial standing of construction enterprises after bankruptcy in comparison with the situation of financially sound companies. We use the logit model to classify enterprises as healthy ones and the ones after bankruptcy. The maximum likelihood estimation (classical approach) and Bayesian approach is applied. The point and interval estimators of probability of a bankruptcy risk are compared with medians and histograms of their posterior distributions. The evaluation of the classification accuracy is based on the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC measures. We apply the one-dimensional methods (quartile analysis, Tukey's criterion) and the multi-dimensional method (projection depth function) to detect outliers. We also employ a method of analyzing discriminatory power of financial ratios. The pilot research covers construction enterprises in Poland in 2005 and 2009.","[Kostrzewska, Jadwiga; Pawelek, Barbara] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Kostrzewski, Maciej] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Galuszka, Krzysztof] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Publ Finance, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics; University of Economics in Katowice,"Kostrzewska, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",jadwiga.kostrzewska@uek.krakow.pl; maciej.kostrzewski@uek.krakow.pl; barbara.pawelek@uek.krakow.pl; krzysztof.galuszka@ue.katowice.pl,"Kostrzewski, Maciej/K-1517-2012; Kostrzewska, Jadwiga/L-3238-2018; Pawelek, Barbara/I-1518-2018","Kostrzewski, Maciej/0000-0003-1544-4221; Kostrzewska, Jadwiga/0000-0002-6142-9156; Pawelek, Barbara/0000-0002-9589-6043",,,,,13,3,3,0,6,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,72,81,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000008,0

This paper develops a general simulation framework for testing which assumptions are necessary to get these outcomes. It also tests the conjectures in a simulated heterogeneous Solow model. The simulation shows that inequality does not grow by capital accumulation when there is no economic growth in the model.","[Kvasnicka, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Kvasnicka, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",michal.kvasnicka@econ.muni.cz,"Kvasnička, Michal/B-4233-2014",,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,489,494,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500084,0

A special sub-class of hyper-preferences satisfying betweenness is defined by using theKemeny distance criterion. Aneutral SWFis hyper-stable (resp.

Corporate income tax is one of the traditional tax revenues of the state and for companies is perhaps the biggest direct tax liability. Amount of corporate taxes paid can also be reduced (or even increased) by indirect effect through reported income because accounting standards are relatively flexible and they establish a framework within which companies can operate and choose their accounting policy. The aim of this paper is to statistically analyse determinants of effective tax rates (ETR) for corporate tax because corporate taxes are paid at same rate but ETR can differ significantly due to tax exemptions prescribed by tax laws. Sample was formed using companies listed on stock exchanges.","[Mladineo, Luka; Susak, Toni] Univ Dept Profess Studies, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Mladineo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Dept Profess Studies, Split, Croatia.",lmladine@oss.unist.hr; tsusak@oss.unist.hr,"Šušak, Toni/B-5217-2019",,,,,,30,0,0,1,40,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,597,606,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400061,0

Since the late 80s, a new, broader concept of capital and a new approach of its measuring penetrate the theory of economic growth. One of the most often used methods of measuring the human capital, is the number of years of formal schooling or the share of tertiary educated people to population. The issue of incorporating of human capital into the new models of economic growth has been advanced e.g. P. Romer, R. Lucas, S. Rebelo, G. N. Mankiw, D.N. Weil. This contribution analyses the relationship between the number of years of formal schooling and the labor productivity across the selected European countries. Using the panel data analysis, the authors show what part of variability in the labor productivity (measured as GDP per employee and GDP per hour worked) can be explained by the differences in the number of years of formal schooling (measured as the school life expectancy). The findings show an increasing importance of education in the European countries and document - despite improving trends - still suboptimal situation of the Czech economy.","[Nedomlelova, Iva; Kocourek, Ales] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Nedomlelová, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",iva.nedomlelova@tul.cz; ales.kocourek@tul.cz,"Kocourek, Ales/HKW-2602-2023; Nedomlelova, Iva/HLP-5065-2023; Nedomlelová, Iva/AAD-1593-2022","Kocourek, Ales/0000-0002-5880-7515; Nedomlelová, Iva/0000-0001-9038-6610",,,,,16,8,8,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1315,1324,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100130,0

The results come out from modelling of measurement system for postal transport network efficiency in proportion to real postal traffic flows with particular discriminant characteristics. The result of on-time performance is represented by estimate of on-time probability, which can be defined as probability of case, when transit time of postal item does not exceed just one day. On-time probability is interpreted by variable called weighted estimate of on-time probability, which also includes distribution of mail flows within geographical stratification according to disjunctive set of defined postal areas. The rate of variability caused by used sample design is expressed by parameters of sample dispersion in various forms and by design factors regarding particular samples. Assessment of these calculated key parameters is the main objective of this paper, because they evaluate measurement system efficiency and could serve as base for next modelling of this system.

Assessment of this indicator in the long run needs comparable statistical data that are quite scarce. For such reason we constructed time series of gross value added at constant prices and number of workers for the period of socialism of the Czech Republic covering years 1970 - 1989. Our results are broken down by sections of CZ-NACE. These figures were prepared in line with ESA 2010 methodology and they are fully compatible with official statistical data published 1990 onwards. Data for the period between 1970 and 1989 come from our original research. They were calculated on the basis of published economic indicators based on the Material Product System used in socialist countries and transformed to the System of National Accounts.

The hypothesis is that, given a lack of religious background in the majority of the population and strong temporary interest in religious issues promoted by a particular provocative event, mass media substantially affect religious choice. To check if this is the case, I compare the dynamics of religious choice of those exposed to alternative media reports on church topics and the rest of the population. As a proxy of familiarity with an alternative view, I use a dummy variable for using the Internet to obtain news. The main finding is that, during the experiment run over the year 2012, the growth of self-reported Orthodox believers was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group.

This multi-expert (ME) multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model utilizes fuzzy evaluations of absolute type and stems from the partial-goals tree evaluation methodology introduced by Talasova in 2003. The fuzzy evaluations of alternatives are in the form of fuzzy numbers on a universe representing the degree of fulfillment of a given goal and as such they express the fuzzy degrees of fulfillment of the given goal by the respective alternatives for each expert. Each expert is assigned a decision competence expressed by a fuzzy number. The group aggregation of expert evaluations is based on the idea of the 'soft' consensus introduced by Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi in 1986. The alternatives which are evaluated good enough by a sufficient amount of important experts are identified and those alternatives form the set of possible solutions. In this paper we briefly recall the steps of the multi-expert 'soft' consensus reaching method by Sukac et al. and discuss its performance on practical examples in comparison with one of the most commonly used ME-MCDM approaches based on the weighted average of expert fuzzy evaluations. The center of gravity based ordering is applied to select the best evaluated alternative in this case. This way the paper analyzes the performance of the 'soft' consensus based MCDM method in the context of a well known benchmark and points out the added value of the 'soft' consensus based MCDM model.,"[Sukac, Vojtech; Talasova, Jana] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Stoklasa, Jan] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Appl Econ, Krizkovskeho 12, Olomouc 77180, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc; Palacky University Olomouc,"Sukac, V (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",vojta.sukac@gmail.com; jana.talasova@upol.cz; jan.stoklasa@upol.cz,"Stoklasa, Jan/O-5858-2016; Talašová, Jana/N-9789-2017","Talašová, Jana/0000-0002-1903-170X",,,,,8,1,1,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,791,796,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500136,0

This paper mainly discusses how to show the features of the regional natural landscape in the creation of the landscape architecture cultures. In various regions of the world, there are differences in the history, geography, cultures, climates and other natural conditions, so that the different areas show the cultural landscapes and the geographical landscapes rich in styles, and there are different features in the geographical characteristics. In the planning and design of the landscape architecture, different geographical characteristics will usually form various types of the landscape architectures. The landscape architecture works in various different geographical environments and in different historical periods can fully reflect the standards and principles for the planning and designing with the regional features.

If we ignore the geographical features of the planning and designing of the landscape architecture, the landscape architecture will show the situation of a thousand pieces of the same tune, and at the same time, it will reduce the practical significance of constructing the landscape architecture to a great extent.","[Wang, Jinxia] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Shenyang 110000, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Yan, Hongwei] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Shenyang 110000, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University; Shenyang Agricultural University,"Wang, JX (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Shenyang 110000, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",,"wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023",,,,,,5,0,0,1,9,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,696,700,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800133,0

The purpose of this article is to contribute in closing that gap by assessing five methods to address endogeneity in this context; the use of Proxys (PR); the two steps Control-Function (CF) method; the simultaneous estimation of the CF method via 'Maximum-Likelihood (ML); the Multiple Indicator Solution (MIS); and the integration of Latent-Variables (LV). The assessment is first made qualitatively, in terms of the formulation, normalization and data needs of each method. Then, the evaluation is made quantitatively, by means of a Monte Carlo experiment to study the finite sample properties under a unified data generation process, and to analyze the impact of common flaws. The methods studied differ notably in the range of problems that they can address; their underlying assumptions; the difficulty of gathering proper auxiliary variables needed to apply them; and their practicality, both in terms of the need for coding and their computational burden. The analysis developed in this article shows that PR is formally inappropriate for many cases, but it is easy to apply, and often corrects in the right direction. CF is also easy to apply with canned software, but requires instrumental variables which may be hard to collect in various contexts. Since CF is estimated in two stages, it may also compromise efficiency and difficult the estimation of standard errors. ML guarantees efficiency and direct estimation of the standard errors, but at the cost of larger computational burden required for the estimation of a multifold integral, with potential difficulties in identification, and retaining the difficulty of gathering proper instrumental variables. The MIS method appears relatively easy to apply and requiring indicators that may be easier to obtain in various cases. Finally, the LV approach appears as the more versatile method, but at a high cost in computational burden, problems of identification and limitations in the capability of writing proper structural equations for the latent variable.

This paper analyses the determinants of the economic performance of firms for a representative sample of hotels in Majorca, focusing on human capital aspects, and on-the-job training in particular. Several measures are used to capture different aspects of the hotels' performance. The results show that, while several human capital variables help to explain performance to a certain extent, training stands out, both by itself and in combination with the innovation and category variable. Interestingly, training and innovative investments behave as complementary or substituting factors depending on the nature of innovations. On the other hand, returns from training decrease with the rise of hotel category.","[Garcia, Dolores] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, GRIT, Reus 43204, Spain; [Tugores, Maria] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Crta Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Tugores, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Crta Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",loligar7@gmail.com; mtugores@uib.es,"Tugores, Maria/L-2792-2017","Tugores, Maria/0000-0001-7542-4420",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2010-18158]; Catalan Government Research Group [2009-SGR-907],Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Catalan Government Research Group,"Dolores Garcia acknowledges financial support from project ECO2010-18158 of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, and of the Catalan Government Research Group 2009-SGR-907.",,38,1,1,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, we compare the performance of a fully nonlinear multivariate specification (one-step approach) with the 'shortcut' of using a linear factor model to obtain a coincident indicator, which is then used to compute the Markov switching probabilities (two-step approach). Second, we examine the role of increasing the number of indicators. Our results suggest that one step is generally preferred to two steps, especially in the vicinity of turning points, although its gains diminish as the quality of the indicators increases. Additionally, we also obtain decreasing returns of adding more indicators with similar signal-to-noise ratios.

We estimate a threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) model on US quarterly data for the period 1984-2010. We employ the spread between BAA-rated corporate bond yield and 10-year treasury constant maturity rate as a proxy for credit conditions. We find that the response of output to fiscal policy shocks is stronger and more persistent when the economy is in the 'tight' credit regime. Fiscal multipliers are significantly different in the two regimes: they are abundantly and persistently higher than one when firms face increasing financing costs, whereas they are feebler and often lower than one in the 'normal' credit regime. The results appear to be robust to different model specifications, fiscal foresight, alternative threshold variables, different measure of variables and sample periods.

Given that there is no direct estimate for the counterfactual (simultaneously measuring the economic growth of a firm outside and inside of an incubator), the authors use a propensity score matching technique to control for the factors that are related to both firm growth and the probability that an incubator manager would accept that firm for incubation. The analysis indicates that incubators have a significant positive impact on firm job creation, and this impact is not reduced if a matched comparison group is used. Furthermore, this study finds that incubated firms receive five times as many business services (legal, financial, marketing, etc.) as their nonincubated cohort. This may account for the networking effect found in previous studies.","[Stokan, Eric] George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Thompson, Lyke; Mahu, Robert J.] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI USA",George Washington University; Wayne State University,"Stokan, E (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy, 805 21st St NW,Suite 601, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",ericjstokan@gmail.com,"Stokan, Eric/I-8007-2019","Stokan, Eric/0000-0001-8409-5016",Wayne State University Research Enhancement Program,Wayne State University Research Enhancement Program,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Wayne State University Research Enhancement Program.",,78,52,56,1,75,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The Nash equilibrium idea-based optimization method is proposed to solve the parameters of the model so as to obtain better modeling effects than that of the traditional model. The empirical results show that: (1) a spontaneous increasing mechanism of the clean energy consumption has not yet formed in China; (2) both GDP and effluent charge play a positive role in accelerating clean energy consumption in China, but effluent charge has a stronger effect than GDP; (3) clean energy consumption in China is expected to stably increase at an annual rate of 5.73 % averagely in 2012-2020. By 2020, clean energy consumption in China is expected to reach 454.55 million tons of standard coal.

Following the removal of GSP Plus by EU in 2010 on the basis of alleged human right violations by the Sri Lankan government during the last stage of the civil war in 2009 and after, it currently faces serious challenges in exporting to the EU, its major market. Given the important role of the ready-made garment industry in poverty alleviation through employment generation, the impact of removal of GSP plus on the poor is examined in this paper. The empirical results of this study demonstrate that poverty and income inequality are expected to be exacerbated in Sri Lanka as a result of the removal of GSP Plus by the EU using non-economic reasons such as human rights violation. The results are also relevant for the renewed emphasis on trade preferences as a potential instrument for the Millennium Development Goals and the debate on how trade preferences are to be designed to maximise their effectiveness in stimulating a manufacturing supply response.","[Bandara, Jayatilleke S.; Naranpanawa, Athula] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Bandara, JS (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Naranpanawa, Athula/AAD-2533-2021","Naranpanawa, Athula/0000-0003-4422-0868",,,,,51,4,4,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2015,38.0,9,,,SI,,1438,1461,,10.1111/twec.12182,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CR2GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361144400006,0

These carriers' future growth prospects, however, hinge on their ability to gain access to markets in Europe and America, for example. Existing bilateral agreements stifle the Gulf carriers' ambitious expansion plans in some instances, and incumbent carriers lobby to restrict further market access. To contribute to this debate, the objective of this research is to empirically examine the effects of Gulf carrier competition on U.S. carriers' passenger volumes and fares in international route markets. Based on data obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the empirical results suggest that greater competition by Gulf carriers in U.S. international markets is associated with (1) significant growth in U.S.-Middle East traffic volumes and (2) small but statistically significant traffic losses and fare reductions for U.S. carriers in route markets connecting the U.S. with Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe.

Features of sustainable urban development have been found to positively affect residential sales prices. We investigate whether the intangible labeling effects of LEED neighborhood certification add a premium to the sales prices of LEED and non-LEED-certified condos. Using a quasi-experiment, transaction data from Portland, Oregon, and a spatio-temporal autoregressive (STAR) model, we find no evidence that the intangible labeling effects of LEED neighborhood certification directly or indirectly affect sales prices. Our results suggest that, contrary to LEED building certification, which we find adds a premium to condo sales prices, the LEED neighborhood label by itself fails to add value for condo buyers.

A first objective is to examine the competitive disadvantages of local mountain olive oil systems, verifying that a great majority of the mountain oils have a negative private profitability. Another objective is to prove if mountain oils present characteristics of typicity, compared to lowland oils, which may generate marketing-mix attributes that enhance obtaining differentiation-related income.

Its trade policy autonomy is constrained by land-lockedness and open border with India. Despite opening up the economy, it has not fully benefited from openness, perhaps partly due to poor governance and partly due to transit and customs-related problems. Although these are crucial issues for trade competitive, The Trade Policy Review of Nepal 2012 (TPRN-2012) is either very polite or lacks a comprehensive analysis on most of these. Since transit-related costs faced by landlocked developing countries can be substantial, just evaluating the progress made in liberalising tariffs and nontariff barriers can provide a distorted picture of the overall business climate. The future WTO review reports on these countries should have a separate section on transit-related issues to contribute to policy debate on the problems of landlocked developing countries. Despite this, the publication of TPRN-2012 is very timely given the emphasis placed in the current policy debate in the WTO and other international forums on the problems of landlocked developing countries.","Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Sharma, K (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia.",,,"Sharma, Kishor/0000-0002-7967-0562",,,,,27,7,7,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2015,38.0,9,,,SI,,1335,1349,,10.1111/twec.12235,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CR2GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361144400001,0

Past academic studies have criticized rankings that are based on elusive criteria of state-level data. Breaking from such practice, the authors argue that state business climate is better conceived and measured at the individual firm level. The authors show how perceptions of business climate varies across business owners, depending on their firms' sectors and stages of development. Using a survey of more than 3,600 small business owners, mainly in the personal and business service sectors, the authors find that many of the popular state rankings either do not associate with individual perceptions of business climate or predict in the wrong direction. The findings warn against the use of state rankings in making policies that affect small business owners. The authors also suggest a need for further study measuring the perceptions of business owners covering different sectors.","[Motoyama, Yasuyuki] Ewing Marion Kauffman Fdn, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Hui, Iris] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Motoyama, Y (通讯作者)，Ewing Marion Kauffman Fdn, 4801 Rockhill Rd, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",ymotoyama@kauffman.org,,,,,,,27,4,6,3,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Case studies so far have, however, mainly focused on the Western industrialised countries and research seems to be biased towards cases in which new ideas caused lasting institutional change. The present paper addresses these two shortcomings by analysing the case of the Russian Stabilisation Fund (SF). This case is an example both of the impact of global ideas on a non-Western emerging country and of a 'near miss' in the sense that imported neoliberal ideas failed to assert themselves enduringly. Paradoxically, it can be shown how the neoliberally based idea of the SF even contributed to the return to Soviet patterns of industrial policy. The main reason for this, we argue, is that the Fund's implementation was not preceded by economic and political debates. Accordingly, the imported institution of the SF had to be filled with ideational content after its implementation.","[Dabrowska, Ewa] Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, D-58448 Witten, Germany; [Zweynert, Joachim] Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, Witten Inst Inst Change, Chair Int Polit Econ, D-58448 Witten, Germany",Witten Herdecke University; Witten Herdecke University,"Dabrowska, E (通讯作者)，Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, Alfred Herrhausen Str 50, D-58448 Witten, Germany.",ewa.a.dabrowska@hotmail.com; Joachim.zweynert@uni-wh.de,,,German Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF),German Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The present paper is the outcome of a multidisciplinary research network Institutions and Institutional Change in Post-Socialism (KomPost)' which is supported by the German Ministry of Science and Education (BMBF).

Hegemonic regimes are characterized by their nearly total lack of political competition. Despite the presence of opposition parties and regular elections, the incumbent in these cases is reelected with 70% or more of the vote. What does it take to sustain overwhelming margins of victory in regular elections in the face of institutionalized opposition? Previous studies have suggested that either violent repression or institutionalized co-optation of opposition groups is central to securing long-term hegemonic regime stability. These mechanisms explain how rulers forestall potential opposition. Upon coming to power in 1993, however, Heydar Aliyev - like many post-Soviet leaders - inherited a genuine, existing opposition in the Popular Front movement. I suggest that in the presence of an intractable opposition, Azerbaijan's rulers have taken a different approach with regard to regime maintenance. Drawing on over 50 original interviews conducted during 6 months of field research, I identify the mechanisms by which the government has hidden the opposition in plain sight by making it effectively difficult for existing opposition groups to function as credible political parties. Since the mid-1990s, the Aliyev regime has used informal measures to prevent these groups from aggregating and articulating the diverse interests present in society from visibly competing in elections and from serving effectively in government to craft and implement policy. These practices have rendered the opposition technically legal, but completely ineffective. Besides weakening the opposition, these measures produce a series of mutually reinforcing effects - including noncompetitive elections by default and a politically disengaged society - that sustain long-term regime stability. The paper concludes by examining this argument in comparative perspective. Hegemonic regimes have proliferated in the post-Soviet region, and I suggest that this strategy is an important factor in sustaining many of these regimes.","Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"LaPorte, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.",jody.laporte@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,International Dissertation Research Fellowship Program of the Social Science Research Council,International Dissertation Research Fellowship Program of the Social Science Research Council,"This work was supported by a fellowship from the International Dissertation Research Fellowship Program of the Social Science Research Council.

Peer effects are larger in Spain, Italy, and Cyprus - the more collectivist regions in our sample - while waist circumference generally gives rise to larger peer effects than BMI.

Because some of that deployment is expected to occur in relatively populous areas, concerns have arisen about the impact of turbines on nearby home values. Previous research on the effects of wind turbines on surrounding home values has been limited by small home-sale data samples and insufficient consideration of confounding home-value factors and spatial dependence. This study examines the largest set of turbine-proximal sales data to date: more than 50,000 home sales including 1,198 within 1 mile of a turbine (331 of which were within a half mile). The data span the periods well before announcement of the wind facilities to well after their construction. We use ordinary least squares and spatial-process difference-in-difference hedonic models to estimate the home-value impacts of the wind facilities, controlling for value factors existing prior to the wind facilities' announcements, the spatial dependence of home values, and value changes over time. A series of robustness models provide greater confidence in the results. We find no statistical evidence that home values near turbines were affected in the turbine post-construction or post-announcement/pre-construction periods.","[Hoen, Ben] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Milan, NY 12571 USA; [Brown, Jason P.] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA; [Jackson, Thomas] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Jackson, Thomas] Real Property Analyt Inc, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Thayer, Mark A.] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Wiser, Ryan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cappers, Peter] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Fayetteville, NY 13066 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; California State University System; San Diego State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Hoen, B (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 20 Sawmill Rd, Milan, NY 12571 USA.",bhoen@lbl.gov; Jason.Brown@kc.frb.org; tjackson@mays.tamu.edu; mthayer@mail.sdsu.edu; RHWiser@lbl.gov; PACappers@lbl.gov,"Cappers, Peter/AAH-2102-2019; Hoen, Ben/AAH-5725-2019","Cappers, Peter/0000-0003-0542-4358",Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Wind and Water Power Technologies Office) of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. DOE,Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Wind and Water Power Technologies Office) of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Wind and Water Power Technologies Office) of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

In order to face this situation, various structural reforms have been introduced which have increased the level of private sector involvement, strengthening the need of sound economic regulation. Starting from a desk survey, the paper reviews the resulting railways models for 20 countries. The main characteristics of each regulatory system have been collected and analyzed in order to provide an ex-ante overview of the current practices, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Results show how public subjects still play a dominant role as infrastructure managers and frequently also as service providers in vertically integrated structures.

Regional health inequalities are analysed through the lens of infant mortality. Socioeconomic correlates with infant mortality are investigated empirically. Panel regression estimates suggest that during the 1874-1919 period, improvements in real wages corresponded with falling infant deaths and thus better health outcomes, while increased housing density created unfavourable conditions for infant survival chances.","New Zealand Tertiary Educ Commiss, Wellington, New Zealand",,"Sadetskaya, K (通讯作者)，New Zealand Tertiary Educ Commiss, Wellington, New Zealand.",ksadetskaya@gmail.com,,,Marsden Fund [UoC807],Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),"I thank the members of my dissertation committee - Les Oxley (chair), Kris Inwood, and Evan Roberts.

We study a principal-agent model of real estate brokerage with multiple agents, where the entry of new agents imposes externalities on the other agents. We solve simultaneously for the equilibrium and socially efficient levels of agents' effort choices, the size of the MLS and the commission rate. Introducing an MLS reduces the number of agents, increases agents' effort levels and improves total surplus. Current commission rates of 5-7% appear much higher than the competitive commission rate, leading to too many agents, too much effort by agents and a lower overall surplus. We also find that giving a greater portion of the commission to the selling agent increases effort levels, reduces the number of agents and improves total surplus.","[Li, Lingxiao] Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Farmville, VA 23909 USA; [Yavas, Abdullah] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Longwood University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Li, LX (通讯作者)，Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",lil@longwood.edu; ayavas@bus.wisc.edu,"Yang, Fei/JLM-3367-2023",,,,,,26,8,9,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2015,43.0,2,,,,,471,506,,10.1111/1540-6229.12076,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,CI3JG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354643400007,0

With this aim, we use differences-in-differences techniques for a panel of Uruguayan manufacturing firms in the period 1997-2005. Our results seem to indicate that FDI causes higher productivity and increased demand for skilled labour. Furthermore, although average wages are higher in foreign-owned firms than in domestic ones, the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers is wider. It follows that promoting foreign investment enhances productivity. In addition, due to the greater demand for skilled workers, policies such as training schemes would be conducive to raising productivity still further, while other social policies could help to mitigate the wage inequality effects.","Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Sch Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Peluffo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Sch Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay.",,"Peluffo, Adriana/JXN-9083-2024; Peluffo, Adriana/AAF-5276-2020","Peluffo, Adriana/0000-0002-2291-8192",,,,,60,19,21,2,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2015,38.0,6,,,,,962,983,,10.1111/twec.12180,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CL1AV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356675500004,0

Urban branding and attractiveness may favour tourist destination loyalty. The complex decision web of motivation and satisfaction of tourists in Amsterdam is analysed with a structural equations model (SEM). The authors find that different tourist profiles, in terms of personal characteristics and motivations, can significantly impact the satisfaction received from tourism services. Furthermore, and most interestingly, the results suggest that satisfaction does not necessarily lead to improved destination loyalty, but is contingent on the source of satisfaction. In this case, satisfaction resulting from tangible or intangible cultural sources has clearly different implications for loyalty, with relevant managerial implications.","[Romao, Joao] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Faro, Portugal; [Neuts, Bart] AUT Univ, Sch Hospitality & Tourism, Auckland, New Zealand; [Nijkamp, Peter; van Leeuwen, Eveline] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Universidade do Algarve; Auckland University of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Romao, J (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Faro, Portugal.",joao_romao@me.com,"Romão, João/N-7520-2019; Neuts, Bart/E-4668-2017","Romão, João/0000-0001-6024-2624; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; Van Leeuwen, Eveline/0000-0002-3262-7030; Neuts, Bart/0000-0002-6518-650X",,,,,46,41,44,6,67,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Some VACS, however, have a direct impact on road efficiency as well and could therefore be exploited to relieve road networks from the significant congestion problems and their negative consequences for travel times, safety, fuel consumption, the environment and the quality of life in general. In other words, some of the available VACS could also be used as novel or innovative sensors, actuators and tools towards a new era of traffic management. This paper provides an overview of proposed and available VACS and discusses their perspectives from the motorway traffic management point of view. Classifications of the different systems in this respect are also provided, while SWOT (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats) analyses are used to identify specific exploitation ways. Current trends and future perspectives of VACS within a motorway traffic management context are finally summarised. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Family specific fertility culture is defined as systematic component in fertility preferences shared among family members. Using data from the NLSY79, we identify family culture by comparing preferences of siblings in early adulthood. Relating these preferences to completed fertility later in life, we find a significant influence of attitudes shared between siblings but almost no influence of preferences unrelated to family background. Our results suggest that fertility decisions are indeed affected by family culture which underlines the importance of family background in forming preferences and affecting socio-economic outcomes.","[Eschelbach, Martina] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Eschelbach, Martina] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",Deutsche Bank; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Eschelbach, M (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",martina.eschelbach@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,48,3,3,1,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In this paper, we first show that this condition may hold in certain situations and when it does the regular QML estimator can still be consistent. In cases where this condition is violated, we propose a simple modified QML estimation method robust against unknown heteroskedasticity. In both cases, asymptotic distributions of the estimators are derived, and methods for estimating robust variances are given, leading to robust inferences for the model. Extensive Monte Carlo results show that the modified QML estimator outperforms the GMM and QML estimators even when the latter is consistent The proposed methods are then extended to the more general SARAR models.

It draws upon analysis of an original monthly database of ministers in EU Member States from 2004 to 2012. After surveying the literature on the negative effects of high legislative turnover, descriptive statistics are presented that demonstrate high levels of turnover in the Council as a whole and high levels of turnover across all nine sectoral Council configurations. A statistical model is then proposed that tests whether variations in levels of Council turnover affect the institution's bargaining success vis-a-vis other EU institutions. The finding, consistent with the broader literature's predictions, is that high levels of turnover hurt the Council vis-a-vis the European Parliament and the European Commission. The article concludes with general remarks about the implications of turnover for the Council system and for the EU more broadly.","[Scherpereel, John A.] James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Perez, Lauren K.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",James Madison University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Scherpereel, JA (通讯作者)，James Madison Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 91 E Grace St,MSC 7705, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",scherpja@jmu.edu,,"Perez, Lauren/0000-0001-9222-2185; Scherpereel, John/0000-0002-3437-6917","Senator Harry F.

The data are unique in that they allow to directly measure in-migration and out-migration at the level of individual villages and towns. The results show that contrary to the powerful image of a push-driven rural exodus, it was not the villages hardest hit by the crisis that recorded the highest levels of migration. Rather, in-migration and out-migration rates often moved in tandem, and were determined primarily by existing migration traditions. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This analysis draws from the liquidity preference framework, an approach to interest rate determination, and uses wavelet multiscale analysis in the context of a standardised regression model. The modelling framework is similar to the one proposed by Cochrane (1989), however, instead of using a band-pass filter the model's variables are analyzed with a wavelet multiresolution analysis which enables a more accurate estimation of the liquidity effect. The results suggest that, in short-term cycles, interest rates are influenced primarily by changes in the money supply (i.e., the liquidity effect). In medium- and long-term cycles, the liquidity effect becomes less important and interest rates are found to be more sensitive to income and price effects.","Cent Bank Cyprus, CY-1076 Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Michis, AA (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Cyprus, POB 25529, CY-1076 Nicosia, Cyprus.",antonismichis@centralbank.gov.cy,,"Michis, Antonis/0000-0002-2610-8955",,,,,34,7,7,2,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It demonstrates the use of continuous accessibility - calculated continuously in time, rather than at a single of a few departure times - for the evaluation of transit systems. These accessibility calculations are accomplished using only publicly-available data sources. A binomial logic model is estimated which predicts the likelihood that a commuter will choose transit rather than auto for a commute trip based on aggregate characteristics of the surrounding area. Variables in this model include demographic factors as well as detailed accessibility calculations for both transit and auto. The mode achieves a rho(2) value of 0.597, and analysis of the results suggests that continuous accessibility of transit systems may be a valuable tool for use in modeling and forecasting.

A Growth Cycle. In Socialism, Capitalism, and Economic Growth, edited by Carl Feinstein, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.). Innovation is a costly, forward-looking process financed out of profits, and pursued by owners of capital stock (capitalists) in order to foster labor productivity and save on labor requirements. Our main findings are: (i) Goodwin-type distributive cycles arise even with dynamic optimization, but (ii) endogenous technical change has a dampening effect on economic fluctuations; (iii) steady state per capita growth, income distribution and employment rate are endogenous, and depend on the capitalists' discount rate, the institutional variables regulating the labor market, and policy variables such as subsidies to R& D activity. Implementing the model numerically to match long run data for the US, we show that: (iv) an increase in the capitalists' discount rate lowers per-capita growth, the employment rate and the labor share; (v) an increase in workers' bargaining strength moderately raises the labor share and moderately decreases per-capita growth, while sharply reducing employment: quarterly US fluctuations (1948-2006) in employment and the labor share seem to support this result; (vi) a balanced budget increase in the R& D subsidy also fosters per-capita growth at the expenses of the labor share, even though the corresponding variations might be small.","[Tavani, Daniele] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Zamparelli, Luca] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Social & Econ Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Colorado State University; Sapienza University Rome,"Tavani, D (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, 1771 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",daniele.tavani@colostate.edu,"Tavani, Daniele/HSE-9182-2023","Tavani, Daniele/0000-0002-2757-0439",,,,,18,24,25,2,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Moreover, in order to further analyze the differences of the land use effects of road pricing on traffic analysis zones (TAZs) with different urban form attributes, a quantitative classification method combining factor analysis and cluster analysis is then used to quantitatively classify TAZs. The results demonstrate that the effects of road pricing on the land use of a specific region depend on the urban form attributes of the region. The higher the densities of employments and population, and better street design (high densities of street and intersections) and public transportation condition, the less the region is negatively affected by road pricing, and vice versa. More importantly, rail transit can alleviate the negative impact of road pricing on commercial development and population concentration of the region. Therefore, before introducing a road pricing policy, it is necessary to develop public transport system, especially rail transit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Network preservation as a motive for protectionist responses to foreign takeovers,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Varieties of Capitalism; international trade; economic patriotism; Britain; globalization; capitalist development; corporate governance; France; cross-border mergers,OWNERSHIP; INVESTMENT; CADBURY,"International market integration reduces the overlap between economic and political borders, but what, exactly, does that imply? According to some rational choice accounts, it means that globalization will eventually undermine itself by triggering protectionist backlashes. Previous scholarship has highlighted flaws in the underlying assumption that elected politicians prioritize local stakeholders over anonymous shareholders. The present article adds that, regarding foreign takeovers, levels of protectionism would vary even if governments did prioritize local stakeholders, because stakeholder preferences vary across corporate governance regimes. Where, as in the UK, coordination relies more on market mechanisms than on networks, foreign acquisitions are less disruptive, and political mobilization against them is weaker. To the extent that the internationalization of corporate ownership spreads outsider governance by destroying networks, resistance therefore declines as the market expands. Quantitative correlational evidence is supplemented by case studies of bids for three British companies that provoked unusual levels of political mobilization.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Callaghan, H (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",,"Callaghan, Helen Jessica/ISU-5415-2023",,,,,,62,6,7,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Results from an experimental study,THEORY AND DECISION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Group; Unanimity; Majority; Preferences; Risk; Ambiguity,EXPECTED UTILITY; PREFERENCES; UNCERTAINTY; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR,"Most decision-making research in economics focuses on individual decisions. Yet, we know, from psychological research in particular, that individual preferences can be sensitive to social pressures. In this paper, we study the impact of a group environment on individual preferences for risky (i.e., known probabilities) and ambiguous (i.e., unknown probabilities) prospects. In our experiment, each participant was invited to make a series of lottery-choice decisions in two different conditions. In the Alone condition, individuals made private choices, whereas in the Group condition, individuals belonged to a three-person group and group members' choices were aggregated according to either a majority or unanimity rule. This design allows us to study the impact of a group environment on individuals' attitude towards both risky and ambiguous prospects, while controlling for the decision rule used in the group. Our experimental results show that when individuals are in the Group condition, they tend to be less risk averse and more ambiguity averse than when they are not part of a group (Alone condition). Our experiment also suggests that the decision rule matters as it shows that these two trends tend to be stronger when the group implements a unanimity rule. Specifically, we found that individuals who belong to a group implementing a unanimity rule are significantly less risk averse than individuals who belong to a group that relies on the majority rule. We obtained a similar-but non-significant-result under ambiguity.","[Brunette, Marielle] INRA, Nancy, France; [Cabantous, Laure] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Couture, Stephane] UK INRA, Castanet Tolosan, France",INRAE; University of Warwick; INRAE,"Brunette, M (通讯作者)，INRA, Nancy, France.",marielle.brunette@nancy.inra.fr,,"Brunette, Marielle/0000-0001-8192-4819",,,,,44,23,23,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2015,78.0,3,,,,,357,376,,10.1007/s11238-014-9432-5,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CB0ON,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349326000002,0

We study the behavior of U.S. Residential REITs over the past three decades and document their return characteristics. REITs have somewhat less market risk than equity; their betas against a broad market index average about 0.58. Decomposing their covariances into principal components reveals several strong factors. Residential REIT characteristics differ to some extent from those of the S&P/Case-Shiller (SCS) private real estate markets. This is partly attributable to methods of index construction. Our examination of REITs suggests that investment in residential real estate is far more risky than what might be inferred from the widely followed SCS series. Although the SCS and REITs indicate little support for being able to predict each other, there is strong evidence of self-predictability for the series.","[Cotter, John] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Business, Blackrock 4, County Dublin, Ireland; [Roll, Richard] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University College Dublin; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Cotter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Business, Blackrock 4, County Dublin, Ireland.",john.cotter@ucd.ie; rroll@anderson.ucla.edu,,"Cotter, John/0000-0001-7290-8606",Ziman Center for Real Estate at UCLA; Science Foundation Ireland [08/SRC/FM1389],Ziman Center for Real Estate at UCLA; Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland),"We have benefited greatly from comments from Brent Ambrose (The Editor), Shaun Bond, Douglas Breeden, Michael Brennan, Brad Case, Steve Cauley, Jerry Coakley, Joao Cocco, Thomas Conlon, Craig A.

The dataset on which our study is based was collected by the World Values Survey from 141,326 individuals in 78 countries surveyed during a period of 13 years. We propose that individual attitudes towards corruption and religion are associated given certain societal and institutional contexts. Our results show that although there is a negative and statistically significant effect of religiosity on the acceptance of corruption on the individual level, this effect is small. We find that there is a threshold value of religiosity below which corruption is more easily accepted by individuals. Our interpretation for this result is simple: individuals with minimal religiosity are generally less constrained by religious norms; specifically, religious norms that are opposed to corruption are less binding on these individuals, resulting in them having a greater propensity to accept corruption. Religiosity, therefore, does lower the acceptance of corruption only when it exceeds a certain threshold for a specific individual.","[Gouda, Moamen] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Seoul 130791, South Korea; [Park, Sang-Min] Univ Appl Sci, Tech Hsch Mittelhessen, Fachbereich Sozial & Kulturwissensch, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Gouda, M (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",moamengouda@yahoo.com; sang-min.park@suk.thm.de,"Gouda, Moamen/AAJ-5300-2021","Gouda, Moamen/0000-0002-6685-7264",Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,"The authors thank Gouda Abd Al-Khalek, Jerg Gutmann, Shima'a Hanafy, Bernd Hayo, Michael Kirk, Johann Graf Lambsdorff, Helmut Leipold, Marcus Marktanner, Mustapha K.

The asymmetric treatment of credit and debit nations reduces aggregate demand in the eurozone.

A broad interpretative hypothesis, based on the distinction between active and passive modernization, is proposed to account for the evolution of regional imbalances. In the lack of active modernization, Southern Italy converged thanks to passive modernization. However, this was more effective in life expectancy, less successful in education, expensive, and as a whole ineffective in GDP. As a consequence, convergence in the HDI occurred from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, but came to a sudden halt in the last decades of the twentieth century.","[Felice, Emanuele] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Vasta, Michelangelo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Italy",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Siena,"Felice, E (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Hist Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",claudioemanuele.felice@uab.cat; michelangelo.vasta@unisi.it,"vasta, michelangelo/ABC-5933-2021; Felice, Emanuele/G-9045-2013","vasta, michelangelo/0000-0002-8683-8095; Felice, Emanuele/0000-0002-1928-140X",Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation [HAR2013-47182-C2-01]; Istat [FP7-ICT-2011-3],Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Istat,"Emanuele Felice gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation, project HAR2013-47182-C2-01.

Enhanced state intervention and authoritarian modernisation were promoted as suitable options for Russia by opponents to neo-liberalism. Medvedev's liberal alternative was promptly discredited in the course of the political competition with Putin. Using ethnographic work, the present essay identifies three models of economic reform and investigates the way they have been considered by professionals in business and trade. The first model, the strategic model, contrary to conventional wisdom, is discussed in the discourse of business actors in terms of economic patriotism, public intervention and state strategic planning; second, the market model is viewed by others as a fully legitimate model; and a third model, the innovation model, combines narratives of efficiency and autonomy, which is attractive but fragile. Beyond their differences, these views have in common a concern to display the relationship of the business sector to the political sphere as a key variable for economic reform.","Sci Po, Bordeaux, France",,"Dufy, C (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Bordeaux, France.",c.dufy@sciencespobordeaux.fr,,,,,,,37,12,12,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 2,2015,67.0,1,,,SI,,84,101,,10.1080/09668136.2014.988998,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AZ9HU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348525400006,0

The study used cabbage as a model system and tracked product from the leading vegetable growing area in Cebu, Philippines to retailers 100 km away. Both wet markets (traditional chain) and supermarkets (modern chain) were studied. Traditional and modern retail chains had similar players: farmers, commission agents, wholesalers and retailers. The total losses for cabbages were estimated at 26 to 27% in both chains. However, farmers in the modern chain incurred higher losses (13%) than farmers in the traditional chain (10%) due to more stringent quality requirements. In contrast, retailers in the traditional chain incurred higher losses (10%) than in supermarkets (7%). Wholesalers in both chains had losses of 6 to 7%. Losses were mainly due to insect damage and rotting at the farm level, with weight loss and physical damage the major issues at the wholesale and retail level. Much of this loss was due to poor packaging and handling techniques. The total loss of edible material was calculated based on the sum of weight loss and trimming of damaged, wilted and/or rotten parts. This revealed much higher losses of 34% in the traditional chain. Nearly half of this (16%) occurred during retail, which could take 3 days at ambient temperatures. In contrast, only 9% loss occurred during retail in the modern chain. In both cases, transport resulted in 12% of total loss. Partly because of these losses, wholesale prices were about 40% higher than farm gate price in both chains, with retail prices about 60% and 190% higher than farm gate prices in the traditional and modern chain, respectively. Based on these results, technological improvements for testing and organizational interventions are recommended.","[Acedo, A.] AVRDC World Vegetable Ctr, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Gonzales, L.

However, although this premise, the extant literature has rather completely overlooked the 'who' question: which partners should be included in the different phases of the innovation funnel? How should they be selected? This paper, while focusing in the early phases of the innovation process, offers a list of possible criteria for partner evaluation and suggests a structured methodology for their selection. An empirical test of both the criteria and the methodology is presented with reference to a company operating in the Advanced Underwater Systems sector. Design/methodology/approach - In order to support a group of decision makers (DM) in the complex process of selecting partners at the beginning of OI process, we propose a peer-based modification of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) multi-criteria group decision making with TOPSIS method (peer IF-TOPSIS). The combination of IF set theory with TOPSIS, IF-TOPSIS allows coping with subjectivity, imprecision, and vagueness in group decision-making problem under multiple criteria. Originality/value - This work contributes to the extant literature in different ways. Firstly, it is one of the first papers in the OI literature to focus on the 'who' issue, giving firms indications on how selecting the external partners. Secondly, this paper advances the criteria that could be used in the selection process, avoiding focusing on single specific aspects of the collaboration phase or on specific types of partners (suppliers). Lastly, while providing an example of empirical application in a real context, it extends the application of IF-TOPSIS to a challenging decision problem - never considered before in the decision making literature. Practical implications - This work provides firms which are in the early stages of OI processes with a set of criteria for selecting partners and a structured methodology supporting the decision process.","[Aloini, Davide; Dulmin, Riccardo; Farina, Giulia; Mininno, Valeria; Pellegrini, Luisa] Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Aloini, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, Pisa, Italy.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,8,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2274,2288,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200179,0

This is reflected on inefficient business operations, high unemployment rate, lower standard of living of the inhabitants and high debt of Croatia. The paper points to: (a) the need to examine the issues in a longer time horizon and (b) the importance of five essential elements in respect to infrastructure development; These are: (1) the exponential growth of scientific knowledge in the world, (2) narrower specific areas of scientific disciplines and narrow specialization of experts, (3) processes of increasing community dependence on technical systems, (4) the increasing investments in infrastructure systems in EU and (5) the growing importance of electronic communication and supranational connectivity of network infrastructures. The analysis of practices shows that Croatia does not have a sufficient number of experts for development and management of infrastructure nor will it have them in the future - unless the process of education begins. The structure of the problems within infrastructure - planning, design, construction and maintenance of infrastructure and business management of infrastructure organizations requires amendments to the curriculum in the graduate program of technical and social sciences, with update of the existing courses and implementation of new ones. Also - in the time frame from 2020 to 2030 - there is a need to initiate a multidisciplinary postgraduate studies programme in the field of infrastructure, and a model of organization of this studies programme in J.

In the first one the authors have reviewed some of the most important studies relative to religion and marketing (in particular analysing the relationship between marketing and Islam principles) and those relative to Halal certification. In the second part, finally, this research shows the findings of a preliminary questionnaire administered to a sample of Muslim consumers in Bari, Italy: specifically this questionnaire explores the role and the knowledge of the Halal certification and how their religious principles influence their purchasing decisions. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence some important aspects to consider when the target group is represented by Muslim consumers. First of all a large percentage of the sample declared to consider the Islamic religious precepts during the purchasing process, showing that they are fundamental guidelines in their choices; moreover green is the colour they would prefer to identify Halal products. In reference to the Halal certification, data show that it is not much known by Muslims in Bari. The originality of this study lies in the fact that research on religion and marketing has been deepen only by a niche of scholars: religion represent an important cultural factor of peoples so it can have sociological implications also for marketing initiatives. In this perspective this study represents a contribution to understand better Muslims as consumers. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application show that it is essential to study the Islamic culture if marketers want to target Muslim consumers. This market, characterized by a large demand, represents an opportunity for companies in reference to Muslims who live in Western countries. From this point of view the Halal certification could represent an important marketing tool, on the condition that there is a marketing communication strategy, which has to become central to inform consumers, and a deeper survey on the profile of the Muslim consumer, in order to implement marketing initiatives more suitable for them.","[Baldassarre, Fabrizio; Campo, Raffaele] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Business & Law Studies, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Baldassarre, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Business & Law Studies, Univ Address Largo Abbazia Santa Scolastica 53, Bari, Italy.",,,"Baldassarre, Fabrizio Flavio/0000-0003-3210-9556",,,,,40,4,4,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1827,1836,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200141,0

The enormous success of Stack Exchange 1, a constantly growing network of Q&A sites, attests this increasing trend. The success of Q&A mainly depends on the will of their members to provide good quality answers to others' questions. We investigate the success factors of Q&A that is those factors that foster effective knowledge creation and sharing. In particular, we focus those factors that can be acted upon by contributors when writing a question. Design/methodology/approach - Based on literature in the domain, we build an empirical model of the factors that predict the chance of getting a useful answer when asking a question on a Q&A site. The actionable factors in our model are grouped into three categories of features: Presentation Quality, Time, and Affect. We use a multivariate logistic regression framework for estimating the probability of success of a question based on our set of predictors, that is the metrics that operationalize affect, time and presentation quality. Stack Exchange makes user-contributed content freely available 2 under Creative Commons license, which we use in our empirical studies. Originality/value - Previous research shows how the success of a question depends on its presentation quality (Treude et al. 2011, Asaduzzaman et al. 2013), on the day and time in which it is posted (Bosu et al. 2013), and on the asker's reputation (Althoff et al. 2014). The influence of affective factors is less evident. However, we argue that the path to effective question answering also involves consideration of emotions (Novielli et al., 2014). Our ongoing research aims at filling this gap in literature by further investigating the role of affect in Stack Exchange. Practical implications - The expected output of this ongoing research will be a user-driven netiquette for online Q&A sites. It will shed new light on how emotion expression facilitates or impairs effective knowledge sharing, leading to guidelines for fostering emotional awareness computer-mediated interactions. In details, we aim at defining new empirically driven guidelines in order to inform the design of emotional interface, provide new insights on how to successfully exploit social Q&A sites in professional knowledge sharing, develop tools for embedding emotional intelligence into online Q&A communities to support both novice users and community managers.","[Calefato, Fabio; Lanubile, Filippo; Merolla, Maria Raffaella; Novielli, Nicole] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Informat, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Calefato, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Informat, Via E Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",,"Novielli, Nicole/Y-9583-2019; Lanubile, Filippo/AAF-9132-2020; Calefato, Fabio/H-4177-2014","Novielli, Nicole/0000-0003-1160-2608; Lanubile, Filippo/0000-0003-3373-7589; Calefato, Fabio/0000-0003-2654-1588",,,,,19,2,2,0,21,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1431,1441,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200110,0

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a literature review on knowledge management systems in SMEs, which allows to identity two research questions that are addressed through a face-to-face survey carried out in a sample of SMEs operating in high-tech industries such as aerospace, engineering, ICT, management training and consulting. Originality/value - In the literature there is not a common definition of knowledge management system but a variety of definitions. The main value of the paper is to explore and systematise the existing literature on knowledge management systems and provides a novel definition that includes both the IT-based tools and the organisation practices. In addition, the paper provides empirical evidences on knowledge management tools and practices adopted in SMEs and highlights the level of alignment between tools and practices. Practical implications - From the practical point of view the paper shows the difficulties that SMEs have to be responsive to the rapid technological changes as well as the lack of support from ICT vendors in the decision making process for choosing adequate knowledge management tools. From the SMEs point of view, this paper has highlighted that small firms could further increase the impact of knowledge management by better exploiting the opportunity offered by the new ICTs (such as, cloud computing, crowdsourcing system collaborative filtering, wiki, etc.). From KMSs provider point of view, this paper has stressed that SMEs typically do not have dedicated resources to monitor the process of innovation in the field of knowledge management systems. Nevertheless, they could represent a significant market. To catch this opportunity, it is necessary create not only a new market segment dedicated to small and medium enterprises but also direct channels of communication even virtual between SMEs and KMSs providers.","[Cerchione, Roberto; Esposito, Emilio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Naples 80125, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Cerchione, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Piazzale Tecchio 80, Naples 80125, Italy.",,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,24,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1173,1192,,,,,,20,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200090,0

Education has always taken different forms in time and space, chasing and pursuing goals and objectives, crossing human societies. Structured around their actors the apprentice and the master; the student and the teacher; the trainee and the trainer education as a socially constructed product is influenced by social changes, while its embodiments can influence directly in those mutations. Those changes are thus a consequence of ideological, material and social conditions in which education is produced and the role that society commits it in the construction of the society itself, defining it and giving it its own rationality, structuring and justifying even their existence: education as a form of acquisition, development and transmission of knowledge changes individual and collective thinking and acting, to the service of the development of individuals and societies. In the current global and totalitarian society (Ramonet, 1997), characterized by mass production and mass-enjoyment of the results of productive activity, the function of school has changed. Today it is expected that the school not only contributes to the development of citizenship but most particularly that produces socially useful citizens, i.e. citizens that are able to enter into the labour market and respond to requests that it imposes. Education must produce individuals able to be in a constant state of employability. However, in Portugal, since the late 2010s the situation is the reverse and the country faces an increasing number of university graduates who do not get any recognition by the market and which thickens the ranks of unemployed in the country. Simultaneously, many thousands of higher education graduates, including doctoral ones, seek emigration in the achievement of its objectives: have adequate work to their academic qualification, leading to an exodus of highly skilled labour. Based on official data on unemployment of graduates, including by scientific areas and ages, and the highly skilled emigration, this article questions the employability of different scientific areas of higher education and discuss the educational and economic policies that generate a real brain drain in Portugal in the last decade. Purpose - In recent years, youth unemployment has increased very quickly and intensely in Portugal, namely regarding the higher education qualified workforce. This scenario, in addition to the existing poor statistics that reflects this phenomenon were the switch for this pioneering research in Portugal that aims to discuss and to understand the outlines of this highly qualified migration; and to test the comprehensive power of the theses on which brain drain has been analysed: the model of the Exodus vs the model of the Diaspora. Design/methodology/approach - The research strategy is suitable to the characteristics of an exploratory study that allows to enunciate questions and hypotheses that can be studied in later steps of the research. Articulating an extensive research with an in-depth analysis we seek to identify the subjectivity of the direct actors of emigration in some of its main working contexts. We use a mixed strategy which makes use of multilateral technical quantitative and qualitative data collection: questionnaire surveys; life stories; and interviews with focus groups. Originality/value - This is a pioneering study in Portugal with relevant information for higher education institutions and policy makers. The study puts in evidence the importance of higher education institutions and policy makers learn from the results and testimonies collected. Furthermore, this research will contribute to a better understanding of the brain drain, helping to fill a gap in migration studies. Practical implications - From a practical point of view, the findings from the questionnaire, applied to a sample of skilled Portuguese emigrants in Europe, will allow to know the socio-economic and cultural background of these graduates; the reasons that led them to emigrate: the reasons that would make or not make them to return to Portugal; its employment status, career and remuneration in the host country; among others. All these results are supplemented by interviews with a wide range of interviewed, drawing a set of life stories.","[Cerdeira, Luisa; Cabrito, Belmiro; Patrocinio, Tomas] Univ Lisbon, Inst Educ, P-1649013 Lisbon, Portugal; [Machado-Taylor, Maria de Lourdes] CIPES Ctr Policies Higher Educ Policies, P-4450227 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Brites, Rui] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Rui] Univ Coimbra, FCDEF, P-3040156 Coimbra, Portugal; [Magalhaes, Dulce] Univ Porto, Fac Arts, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Vaz, Henrique] Univ Porto, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, P-4200135 Oporto, Portugal; [Lopes, Joao Teixeira; Silva, Silvia] Univ Porto, Fac Arts, P-4150564 Oporto, Portugal; [Peixoto, Paulo] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Ganga, Rafaela] Univ Porto, ISFLUP, P-4150564 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Porto,"Cerdeira, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Educ, Alameda Univ, P-1649013 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"de Lourdes Machado, Maria/M-6743-2013; Peixoto, Paulo/M-2435-2014; Teixeira Lopes, João/IWE-4671-2023; Neiva Ganga, Rafaela/JDV-6278-2023","de Lourdes Machado, Maria/0000-0003-4774-2397; Peixoto, Paulo/0000-0003-2275-667X; Neiva Ganga, Rafaela/0000-0001-9163-0013; Cerdeira, Luisa/0000-0002-2217-7822",,,,,13,0,0,0,23,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2059,2070,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200161,0

In the case of certified non-GM soy protein this deficit is even broader. EU counts for 0.4% of worldwide soybeans acreage. Soybean imports - grain equivalent-represent 95% of the European annual consumption of 38 million tons. The EU accession of the countries from the Danube region and the association treaties signed by other Eastern European countries have created new opportunities to increase the acreage of soybeans, the region being known for very favorable conditions for this crop. Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova represent an important reservoir of conventional soy protein from the perspective of soybeans breeding capabilities and growth potential. In all three countries breeding and cropping soybeans have a history of 100 years. Today, Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova are following this long time tradition through breeding and registering new soybean varieties well adapted to local cropping conditions. The agriculture research communities from these three countries are continuously challenged to supply local farmers with high yield and new traits genetics, as well as to develop or improve the cropping technologies for soybeans. In the past 7 years the soybeans acreage stagnated or slightly decreased in these Danube region countries. Recently, a growing interest of the farmers in the region to increase the soybeans area can be observed. However, to maintain this trend, farmers should benefit from incentive schemes for soybeans as well as demonstration platforms, training and know-how transfer programs. Romania, Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova have a soybean cropping potential of 0.8-1 million hectares. This potential may generate a minimum of 2 million tons representing 5% of the EU annual consumption, respectively 30% of non-GM soybean annually used in the EU. (C) 2015 The Authors.

They receive low income mainly due to poor access to markets, microfinance and technological knowhow. Nonetheless, numerous studies reveal that forming small groups or clusters have resulted in increased profitability. Clustering has provided opportunities for smallholder farmers to access institutional markets, forge linkages with buyers, acquire finance and avail themselves of free or discounted inputs. Studies have also shown that clustering helps improve their negotiation, bargaining and entrepreneurial skills. This paper analyses the factors affecting the profitability of vegetable farmers who were involved in clustering. A survey of 61 farmers was conducted in Bukidnon, South Cotabato and Davao City. Pooling the data across provinces, the study utilized heteroscedasticity-corrected generalized least squares regression to account for non-constant variance with the aid of GRETL software. Results suggest that production cost, volume, price, South Cotabato farmers farming experience, ownership of land and clustering positively affected farm profit, while a negative effect was observed for marketing cost. This strengthens the claim that clustering is an effective means to improve yields, prices and to gain access to assured markets. This paper suggests that clustering be continued and ways found to take advantage of the factors that positively affect profits.","[Ebarle, E. J. N.; Sarmiento, J. M. P.; Aguinaldo, R.

We find a substantial positive impact of being first born on the probability of completing higher secondary education. Analyzing gender differences, we find stronger effects for boys.

Among other possibilities, attracting and conserving pest natural enemies in agricultural landscapes by providing them habitats is promising. Wildflower strips (WFS) sown at field margins are one of these potential habitats. They are known to attract and conserve a large diversity of insects, as they provide them food resources such as pollen and nectar, as well as shelter and overwintering sites. However, the risk of attracting insect pests at field margins may represent an obstacle to their adoption by farmers. Conversely, it would be interesting if such WFS could play the role of pest trap crops. In an experimental field sown with WFS intercropped with oilseed rape (OSR) (Brassica napus L.), its coleopteran pests were trapped in both WFS and OSR using yellow pan traps between April and June 2014. More than 130 000 Meligethes spp., Ceutorhynchus spp. and Psylliodes chrysocephalla (L.) adults were trapped. Meligethes spp., Ceutorhynchus spp. were significantly more abundant in the OSR compared with WFS when adults emerged and populations reached their abundance peak. Before and between these periods, the few adults trapped were significantly more abundant in the WFS compared with the OSR. Concerning P. chrysocephala, too few individuals were caught for analysis. Results showed that OSR was more attractive than WFS when coleopteran pests were abundant. In this study, WFS sown for insect conservation may neither favour insect pest conservation at field margin, nor be considered as trap crops.

Due to fast exchange of information, massages have become shorter and new communication signs have been developed (e.g. emoticons), thus making communication even faster. By designating the Glagolitic script as intangible cultural heritage (Decision of the Ministry of Culture dated 7 February 2014), it officially became the medium of other media, i.e. the source of creative ideas for both science and art. Based on the above, the authors of this paper examine the semiotic potential of the Glagolitic script categorising it: a) as the potential of the script which conveyed three messages (graphemic, numeric and symbolic) with a single sign, b) as the potential of the script, which, in itself, is the script with a message (of Christianity). The authors have proposed the hypothesis that the Glagolitic script holds a certain media potential that could be interesting to the modern media as a source of new cultural products (literature, music, movies, etc.) or a source of communication experiences for introducing new digital media communication trends. The aim of this paper is to identify the characteristics of the Glagolitic script, as intangible cultural heritage, on which the information age media (and thus communication) can rely as a source.","[Horvat, Jasna; Mijoc, Josipa] Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Tomasevic, Nives] Univ Zadar, Dept Informat Sci, Mihovila Pavlinovica Bb, Zadar 23000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Zadar,"Horvat, J (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jasna@efos.hr; jmijoc@efos.hr; ntomasev@unizd.hr,"Horvat, Jasna/AAC-5827-2022; Mijoč, Josipa/J-9969-2018","Horvat, Jasna/0000-0001-9665-1470;",,,,,20,0,0,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,325,340,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100032,0

We do believe that the discussion of the disposal of wealth is clearly general and involves various variables, yet this paper particularly focuses on the act of infaq since it is the most fundamental keyword within consumption decision. This can be observed once Al Quran presents the idea of the disposal of wealth for the cause of Allah which includes sadaqah, zakat, hibah, nafqah and waqaf. Disposing wealth in general is much broader than to consume, save, invest and pay tax, the way like we understood in conventional economics. It is a matter on how the disposal of wealth could get us closer to our God. Therefore, the connotation of disposing of wealth for the cause of Allah is explicitly being mentioned as frequent as it is a significant attribute of a true believer. In general, Al Quran highlights two main types of the disposal of wealth namely to spend for the family and to spend for the sake of Him. In which the latter takes place on a thoughtful-yet-voluntary approach. It would be necessary to denote since then that this paper will not go into deeper the obliged-way of disposing wealth like zakat and inheritance.","[Karim, Sa'diah Abdul] Int Islamic Univ Coll, Fac Management & Muamalah, Dept Econ, Selangor, Malaysia",,"Karim, SA (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Coll, Fac Management & Muamalah, Dept Econ, Selangor, Malaysia.",sadiah@kuis.edu.my,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-86-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,5.0,,,,,,246,249,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366326900036,0

Yet, in a text confronting Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law to the EAL, Posner evokes an eventual epistemological compatibility, arguing that Kelsen's perspective opens a space for economics in law. Discussing the divergences and continuities of the two frameworks in the light of Posner's original reading of Kelsen, this paper attempts to explore a series of epistemological facets of the EAL that are mostly overlooked in the literature. The point is to show that Posner's intriguing remark on Kelsen creates scope for unexpected interpretations as to the specific (largely implicit) assumptions in mainstream Law and Economics with respect to fundamental issues such as nature, form, scope or goal of law - making clear that when it comes to the methodology of this theory, nothing really is as it seems.","[Krecke, Elisabeth] Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Econ & Gest, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Krecke, E (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Econ & Gest, Marseille, France.",elisabeth.krecke@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Alternative to the prevailing paradigm, which considers innovation processes as moved by a systemic rationality, here a Situationist View of the Firm (SVF) is adopted. Our purpose is to contribute to the scientific debate on knowledge management and innovation management enriching it through different concepts - power, coalitional dynamics and institutional pressures - until now in shadow, if not absent at all. Design/methodology/approach - The paper compares two paradigms of the firm replacing in the foreground their epistemological roots. On one hand, the 'unified approach' - widely dominant in management studies - reifies the firm and interprets it as a collective entity, a pre-determined system with respect to the actors, which is divided into sub-systems at lower levels and is part of inclusive, higher-level systems. On the other hand, the 'situationist view' defines the firm as a concrete system built by the actors and qualifies it as a space of games, a space of interaction, negotiation and conflict among actors and their coalitions. Originality/value - The SVF can be seen as an element of originality, since it puts in evidence and focuses on the organisational power dynamics and the isomorphism processes aiming at gaining legitimation. Practical implications - First, the different insight into innovation processes allows to increase the number of managerial and decision-making patterns with schemes and models focused on negotiation-based strategies. Moreover, the link with some constructs of the neo-institutionalism framework, such as isomorphism and rationalizing myths, paves the way for a less naive approach on organisational dynamics that animates, in practice, the processes of innovation that may be the result of decisions aiming at legitimizing the organisation in relation to the institutions and other key players operating in an 'organisational field'.","[Mastroberardino, Piero; Calabrese, Giuseppe] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Calabrese, G (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via R Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",,"Mastroberardino, Piero/AAP-3087-2021; Calabrese, Giuseppe/AFR-7630-2022","Calabrese, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0409-8685; MASTROBERARDINO, PIERO/0000-0002-8032-7788",,,,,71,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,375,389,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200029,0

Their role in the food value chain is indisputable and they have come to control most of the market share in many products such as tobacco industry (100%), grape must (80%), olive oil (75%), wine (70%), rice production (60%) and a 45% in citrus, milk and nuts. To a lesser extent they are present in the production of table olives, fruits, sheep and goat meat, cereals, oilseeds and cotton in which they account for 35%. Additionally, cooperatives have emerged as the driving forces of the territory, allowing the adoption of technology, leading the internationalization and developing important management tasks. In recent decades, their role has been intensified by globalization, ongoing regulatory requirements and the need for diversification that has emerged in rural settings in order to keep the population. This paper develops a study of agrifood cooperatives in Spain and more specifically of citrus ones. Structural problems of holdings (small holdings in certain crops) have marked the need to group farmers in order to concentrate supply, internationalize, concentrate financial resources to promote joint R&D+i and ultimately to improve profitability. The strengths of these kinds of companies responsible for the preponderant place that these entities have achieved in the sector have been identified. Moreover, the challenges that cooperatives are facing to ensure continuity in the current economic context are also discussed.","[Melia Marti, Elena; Server Izquierdo, Ricardo J.; Lajara-Camilleri, Natalia] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Invest Gest Empresas CEGEA, E-46071 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Lajara-Camilleri, N (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Invest Gest Empresas CEGEA, E-46071 Valencia, Spain.",nalade@cegea.upv.es,"Server-Izquierdo, Ricardo J/HKE-1532-2023; Melia-Marti, Elena/K-5154-2016; Lajara-Camilleri, Natalia/K-5144-2016","Melia-Marti, Elena/0000-0002-0417-2139; Lajara-Camilleri, Natalia/0000-0002-1376-3133; Server-Izquierdo, Ricardo/0000-0003-1446-2276",,,,,11,1,1,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1871,1876,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600240,0

Thus the number of the studied irtdices was reduced to 4 factors, which explained 79.3% from the entire variation. The tirst one unified the color parameters, beta-carotene and the related with oxidative products - fluorescence peak about 520 mu. The second one was determined mainly by the chlorophyll content and related to it fluorescence peak about 670 nm. The third and the fourth factors were determined by the fatty-acid content of the samples. The third one unified the fatty-acids, which give us the opportunity to distinguish olive oil from the other plant oils oleic; linoleic and stearin acids. The fourth factor included fatty- acids with relatively much lower content in the studied samples. It is enquired the number of clusters to be determined preliminary in order to apply the K-Cluster analysis. The variant K = 3 was worked out because the types of the olive oil were three. The first cluster unified all salad and pomace olive oils, the second unified the samples of extra virgin oilstaken as controls from producers, which were bought from the trade network.

The method is based on a qualitative empiric research, which was conducted among 61 entities, coming from 6 distinctive areas of the Czech Republic. The method, used for this research, was a semi-structured interview that lasted for about 60 to 90 minutes. The main aim of the interview was to analyse how these entities approach CSR: (1) which areas or activities are being targeted and (2) also analyse the way they implement these activities. One of the key results was that they prefer one time activities over long term partnerships. Another interesting fact was that these entities are sometimes on the receiving end of other organization's CSR activities. It was also revealed that all these entities prioritize creative and non-restrictive approach, so any method, in order to be accepted by them, has to resemble these facts.

This increase resulted in a better control of T. urticae. Pollen availability and quality could be behind this result. Whereas multifloral cover offers a long-term source of a wide variety of pollen, F. arundinacea offers one single type of pollen in spring only. As a consequence, the generalist pollen feeder Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot), which is a superior intra-guild predator, is highly favored in multifloral covers.

In a number of cases, some decisions must be made as soon as possible, and the information's available for making the right decisions are not always sufficient. To the applicants, as available information's often stands various different sources from which it is possible, on many different ways to collect the needed information. An important role when making business decisions also have the conditions during which the sources of information's are selected and make business decisions. Important criteria for the selection of sources of information's and assessment of their quality are different, but they all have one common goal - to provide useful and timely information. In the modern business, computer and Internet usage, both in communication and as an inexhaustible source of all kinds of information becomes inevitable. Computerization and spreading of Internet greatly facilitates, but also accelerate business processes in general. Today it is one of the fastest, more convenient and simpler ways of collecting the necessary information's using the network interface, the Internet. The Internet has become accessible to even greater number consumers, both for the personal and business needs, and Internet access is mostly available to all the employees, regardless of the hierarchy. In order to verify the application of theoretical basis in practice, research was carried out in a number of major metal companies on the territory of Medimurje County. In the theoretical part of the paper are briefly presented the (theoretical) framework of business decision - making, and the final aim of the research that is presented in this paper is to examine what are the sources of information's on the different control levels when commonly used in the search for business information's, and to establish the place of the Internet as one of the newer source of information's. In addition, it will be explored which are the characteristics of the information's sources that are most important to the seekers.","[Sercer, Mario; Kavic, Zlatica] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Sercer, M (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",bioplam@gmail.com; zlatica.kavic@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,490,499,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100048,0

In the digital and knowledge age digital libraries can be used in knowledge management to handle intellectual assets and support knowledge creation. A multilingual digital library either stores content in more than one language or provides multilingual query access to monolingual content. In Serbia 18 of 308 scientific journals regularly published are bilingual, with papers simultaneously being in English and Serbian. Bilingual publication of results of international projects is also an increasingly frequent practice. In this paper we present a publicly available multilingual digital library named Biblisa, developed for management, search and the browsing of aligned bilingual text collections. Design/methodology/approach - The approach to the development of the presented digital library was to store its content in a NoSQL-database, with a web tool to enable the use of rich information in the stored text collections. The library content originates from various bilingual sources, with all documents aligned at the sentence level and provided with metadata. In designing Biblisa special attention was given to its component that offers language support, based on bilingual lexical resources and tools, to various multilingual aspects of this library. Originality/value - Users have a high level of flexibility in searching the library content: they can search the library using metadata, or perform full-text search by keywords of their choice. Furthermore, the user's original query, issued in Serbian or English, can be expanded to the other language, both morphologically and semantically. Thus it offers a novel access to digital content to its users. In addition to that, Biblisa presents an original approach to successful combining of several components: Lexical resources, Library content, Web services and Web interface. Practical implications-Digital library users often need to transform information access into knowledge creation. To that end, Biblisa offers numerous documents from several scientific journals and projects covering various domains. Metadata and full-text search are available within a user-friendly platform, with the possibility for a very high level of search refinement. Biblisa also supports the analysis of concepts and concept structures, identifying terms assigned to concepts, and establishing relations between terms in English and Serbian, which makes it a valuable tool for terminological research.","[Stankovic, Ranka; Lazic, Biljana; Vorkapic, Dalibor] Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Krstev, Cvetana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philol, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Stankovic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Dusina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",,"Rujević, Biljana/GXH-0272-2022","Rujević, Biljana/0000-0002-9103-3902",,,,,14,4,4,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1764,1777,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200136,0

The outcome of the research led to our recognition that employees working in less extensive locations are significantly more satisfied than those who work in large locations. The primary reason for such results arises from the equality of the pay in the framework of individual job positions within the given territory regarding the fact that the cost of living is higher in larger locations.

Using a sample of Australian cruisers, the reputation of a cruise line and indulging in interesting and different ship activities are found to be weakly influential, while satisfaction from past cruises and educational cruises are important factors in the choice to cruise again in the short-term. But variety in ports of call and cruise destinations, recent frequent past trips and recommended cruises influence cruising again in the medium-term. While first-time cruisers are not likely to cruise again in the short-term, neither are those looking for a sense of exoticism and adventure, and wanting to go to places not accessible by land.

We assess the effectiveness of this support public policy to reduce the risk and show that the quality of health control systems plays an important role in this field. The work suggests a reflection on the institutional logic prevailing during i) the elaboration of upgrading programs of producers and ii) the establishment of public standardization programs and control systems.

To address this open issue empirically, I analyse data on more than 50 developing countries throughout the period 1980-2008 using robust dynamic panel data methods. The results show that FDI had an economically relevant and statistically significant positive impact on developing countries' net barter terms of trade.

Currently, a scientific method for determining the monetary fine based on the safety impacts associated with such violations does not exist, thereby causing disparities in fine structures. This study develops a novel fine structure for RLR traffic violations based upon the estimated economic impact of potential crashes by RLR violations and estimated delays caused by providing all-red intervals to prevent potential conflicts. A physical model is developed to determine the crash probability at a discrete time after the traffic signal turns red. The Highway Capacity Software is also employed to estimate additional delay incurred by road users. Considering that the use of red-light cameras is increasing in the nation, while it is often criticized as a revenue instrument, policymakers need to develop an objective fine structure that closely reflects the risk a RLR vehicle poses to other drivers.

We consider a two-stage social choice procedure in which some alternatives are first nominated by aggregating the opinions of nominators, and then the society makes a collective choice from the nominated alternatives by aggregating the preferences of voters. Each nominator's opinion is a positive, negative, or neutral view as to whether each alternative deserves to be eligible for collective decision making. If a voter is a nominator, his preference space is restricted by his opinion as follows: he always prefers positive alternatives to neutral ones and neutral alternatives to negative ones, according to his opinion. When each nominating voter has such a preference space, we first characterize Arrow-consistent preference domains at the second stage of the social choice framework. Second, we find a resolution of Arrow's impossibility theorem when at least one nominating voter exists.","[Iwata, Yukinori] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Iwata, Yukinori] Nishogakusha Univ, Fac Int Polit & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 6-16 Sanbancho, Tokyo 1028336, Japan",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Iwata, Y (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.;Iwata, Y (通讯作者)，Nishogakusha Univ, Fac Int Polit & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 6-16 Sanbancho, Tokyo 1028336, Japan.",y-iwata@nishogakusha-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [22730163]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730163, 26780125] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author thanks Takumi Kongo, Shin Sato, Naoki Yoshihara, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

It draws attention to the constraints that newly empowered actors have faced in the wake of introducing the co-decision procedure. If the key principles of a given AFSJ sub-policy - its 'policy core' - were defined before institutional change occurred, the Council (as the dominant actor of the early intergovernmental co-operation) has found it easier to prevail in the altered structural environment and to co-opt or sideline actors with competing rationales. The article compares the importance of the new decision-making procedure with two alternative pathways potentially leading to policy change, namely, the power of litigation and the impact of unexpected external events.","[Trauner, Florian] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Servent, Ariadna Ripoll] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Trauner, F (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",florian.trauner@vub.ac.be,"RIPOLL SERVENT, Ariadna/H-6542-2019","RIPOLL SERVENT, Ariadna/0000-0002-1399-6535; Trauner, Florian/0000-0001-5044-6818",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 23341-G11],Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The article is informed by the insights of the book Policy Change in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice: How EU Institutions Matter (Routledge, 2015).

Against the background of the growing casualization of the workforce it demonstrates the impact on the health and well-being of these workers, focusing on the intersection between psychosocial working conditions and health. In particular it focuses on the detrimental impact on workers' sense of self-efficacy and self-esteem. It emphasizes how the job insecurity characteristic of non-standard work extends beyond the fear of job loss to involve uncertainty over the scheduling of work, with debilitating consequences for workers' autonomy, self-efficacy and control over their lives. Additionally, it is argued that the exclusion of these workers from paid leave and other entitlements in the workplace confers a lower social status on these workers that is corrosive of their self-esteem. It is these key socio-psychological mechanisms that provide the link between insecure work and workers' health.","[McGann, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [White, Kevin] Australian Natl Univ, Sociol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Moss, Jeremy] Univ New South Wales, Polit Philosophy, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Melbourne; Australian National University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"White, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Haydon Allen Bldg,Univ Ave, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Kevin.White@anu.edu.au,,"Moss, Jeremy/0000-0002-3496-7928",Australian Research Council; VicHealth; University of Melbourne; Australian National University,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); VicHealth; University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne); Australian National University(Australian National University),"This study was funded through an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant, between VicHealth, the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University.",,44,28,31,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We study the game-theoretic foundations of this law in a spatial model of party formation and electoral competition. The standard spatial model assumes a linear agenda space. However, when voters vote sincerely, electoral competition on the line under plurality rule gravitates towards a single party located at the median. We therefore depart from the linear space and instead adopt the unit circle as the space of agendas. We characterize pure-strategy (subgame-perfect) Nash equilibria under both sincere and strategic voting. Under both voting behaviors, multiple configurations of parties are possible in equilibrium. We refine our predictions using a new notion called defection-proof (subgame-perfect) Nash equilibrium. Under sincere voting, either two or three parties are effective in defection-proof Nash equilibria, whereas under strategic voting, either one or two parties are effective in defection-proof subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. These results are partially consistent with Duverger's Law.","[Peeters, Ronald; Yuksel, Ayse Muge] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Saran, Rene] Yale NUS Coll, Div Social Sci, 16 Coll Ave West 02-221, Singapore 138527, Singapore",Maastricht University; Yale NUS College,"Peeters, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.peeters@maastrichtuniversity.nl; rene.saran@yale-nus.edu.sg; a.yuksel@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Peeters, Ronald/H-4070-2015","Peeters, Ronald/0000-0001-5261-1119",,,,,32,4,5,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2016,47.0,3,,,,,729,759,,10.1007/s00355-016-0990-z,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EA6UU,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386765300012,0

Other indicators of nutritional and health status, such as infant mortality, showed continuous improvement, whereas per capita calorie and protein availability improved in the twentieth century.

In response to an investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office, the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) was agreed to by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Using unique data sets that contain both approved and nonapproved mortgage applications, this study provides an empirical examination of the impact of the HVCC on appraisal and mortgage outcomes. The results suggest that the HVCC has led to a reduction in the probability of inflated valuations, although valuations remained on average inflated, and induced a significant increase in the incidence of low appraisals. The well-intentioned HVCC rule made it more difficult to obtain mortgages to purchase homes during the housing price crash, possibly exacerbating the fall in prices.","[Ding, Lei; Nakamura, Leonard] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Ding, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",lei.ding@phil.frb.org; leonard.nakamura@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,24,18,20,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2016,44.0,3,,,,,658,690,,10.1111/1540-6229.12120,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DR8FO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380134000005,0

Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, a variant of the mover-stayer model is developed in which hourly wages are either taken from a stationary distribution (movers) or closely related to the hourly wage one year earlier (stayers). Mover-stayer status is not observed, and we therefore model wages using an endogenous switching regression, estimated by maximum likelihood. Methodologically, the results support the mover-stayer characterisation since the restrictions required for the simpler specifications popular in the literature are rejected. Substantively, simulation of the estimated model shows some statistically significant effects from acquiring qualifications of a higher level than those previously held, but not from acquiring qualifications of the same level.","[Dorsett, Richard; Lui, Silvia; Weale, Martin] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St, London SW1P 3HE, England; [Lui, Silvia] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Weale, Martin] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",University of Groningen; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Weale, M (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St, London SW1P 3HE, England.;Weale, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.",mweale@niesr.ac.uk,,"Weale, Martin Robert/0000-0002-2016-0437; Dorsett, Richard/0000-0002-4180-8685",Economic and Social Research Councils through the LLAKES research centre at the Institute of Education; National Institute of Economic and Social Research; Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC [ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Councils through the LLAKES research centre at the Institute of Education; National Institute of Economic and Social Research; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Councils for supporting this research through the LLAKES research centre at the Institute of Education and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

By contrast, the European Commission may approach the FRA should the Commission require its assistance with respect to the application of the framework it adopted in 2014. The Council and the Parliament could similarly require the FRA's assistance.

We show that information asymmetry about the quality of real estate asset will lead to slower rent adjustments in response to external shocks. Information asymmetry makes it more difficult for the landlord and prospective tenant to agree on a new equilibrium rent, which also leads to temporary deviation of the vacancy rate form the natural vacancy rate. Compared to a low-end office unit, information asymmetry is less serious for a high-end office unit since a larger proportion of its rental value is derived from its location attributes which are easily observable by both the landlord and prospective tenant. One empirical implication is that high-end office rents adjust faster when there is a short-term disequilibrium. The other side of the coin is that the vacancy rates of high-end offices are less responsive to external shocks assuming that the natural vacancy rates are relatively stable over time. Empirical data from the Hong Kong office sub-markets are consistent with these implications.","[Chau, K. W.; Wong, S.

This paper contributes to the debate about the effectiveness of IIAs using an original database that differentiates between investment agreements according to the quality of investor protection, and which covers a wide variety of trade and investment agreements signed and ratified in the Americas. We find evidence that in the least likely case of south-south FDI flows, high-quality international investment treaties have a demonstrable effect on foreign direct investment inflows. Moreover, international investment agreements appear to be most effective in a context of deeper economic integration. That is, they work better when they provide higher quality protection to investors and when they are combined with other preferential economic integration agreements, such as trade agreements.","[Dixon, Jay] Ind Canada, Econ Res & Policy Anal, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Haslam, Paul Alexander] Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Dixon, J (通讯作者)，Ind Canada, Econ Res & Policy Anal, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,"Haslam, Paul/0000-0003-3336-425X",University of Ottawa's Initiation of Research/ New Directions (IRND) fund,University of Ottawa's Initiation of Research/ New Directions (IRND) fund,"Research for this paper was partially funded by the University of Ottawa's Initiation of Research/ New Directions (IRND) fund.

Even financially healthy shipping firms felt strong negative effects on their financing activities during the recent crisis. These firms were nevertheless able to increase long-term debt. Banks internalized the impact of foreclosure decisions on vessel prices and avoided an industry-wide collateral channel effect. Even during benign economic conditions, financially weak shipping firms underinvest because of their inability to raise sufficient external capital. The substitution between long- and short-term debt during the pre-2008 crisis periods shows that the composition of financing sources is more indicative of whether firms face financial constraints than the pure size of the financing-cash flow sensitivities. An analysis of firms' excess cash holdings confirms the importance of financial flexibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We suggest an expansion of Cohen's existing framework of international monetary power to include the implications of valuation changes in these external balance sheets, focusing on sources of valuation, sensitivity and vulnerability of the US economy to these changes and implications for US ability to use monetary statecraft. By focusing on developments since 2007 and on events over the financial crisis period, we show that the increased size and nature of the US's external balance sheet has reduced US autonomy and monetary power.

We model the determinants of observed debt for Chilean households while accounting for selection bias and the endogeneity of their income and specific household assets.

We find substantial differences in the nature of these relationships across the types of debt. For example, we find that the income elasticity for consumer debt is greater than 1 whereas for mortgage debt it is not. The results suggest the increased availability of credit, combined with the aging of the Chilean population, is likely to drastically change the distribution and level of Chilean debt.

While the first two approaches have been dominant, this paper further develops the third, addressing questions as to whether and why certain activities are inherently more difficult to switch away from the car. At the theoretical level, it builds on theories of social practice to put forward the notion of 'car dependent practices'. At the empirical level, it demonstrates that the application of sequence pattern mining techniques to time use data allows the identification of car and mobility intensive activities, arguably representing the trace of car dependent practices. Overall, the findings of this mining exercise suggest that the emphasis of existing literature on escorting children, shopping and carrying heavy goods as car dependent trip purposes is not misplaced. Our analysis adds to this knowledge by contextualising the information by providing detailed quantitative analysis of a larger, richer set of activities hitherto overlooked in transport policy. The article concludes by illustrating the policy implications of the approach adopted and the findings generated, discussing possible strategies to steer practices in a more sustainable direction by creating material alternatives to the 'cargo function' of car travel.

Following the literature on competitive authoritarianism, it argues that the survival strategies of hybrid regime incumbents compel them to dodge conditionality in those policy areas that are crucial for maintaining the uneven political playing field. On the other hand, specific self-preservation tactics dictate that they should embrace neighbourhood Europeanisation in policy domains capable of generating votes. Taken together, these hypotheses alert us to the possibility that hybrid regime governments in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries are cherry picking conditionality.","[Bolkvadze, Ketevan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Sprangkullsgatan 19, S-41123 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Bolkvadze, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, Sprangkullsgatan 19, S-41123 Gothenburg, Sweden.",ketevan.bolkvadze@gu.se,"Bolkvadze, Ketevan/AAI-5866-2021","Bolkvadze, Ketevan/0000-0002-8984-8598",,,,,114,7,8,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,MAY,2016,68.0,3,,,,,409,440,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1154138,0.0,,,32,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DN4OV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377048000003,0

For the developed countries, however, model specification matters: If a linear specification is a priori chosen, then we find support of Wagner's Law, while a nonlinear specification implies on the contrary the opposite result. Hence, model misspecification could have led to incorrectly accept Wagner's law for the developed countries.","[Paleologou, Suzanna-Maria] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Paleologou, SM (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",smp@econ.auth.gr,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

I provide an example of a two-party model in which parties offer substantially different equilibrium platforms even though no exogenous differences between parties are assumed. In this example, some voters' preferences over the 2-dimensional issue space exhibit non-convexities and parties evaluate their actions with respect to a set of beliefs on the electorate.","[Bade, Sophie] Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham, Surrey, England; [Bade, Sophie] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Max Planck Society,"Bade, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham, Surrey, England.;Bade, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.",sophie.bade@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2016,80.0,4,,,,,561,580,,10.1007/s11238-015-9515-y,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DI1CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373232800003,0

These methods reduce the complete correlation coefficient matrix to a simpler network structure consisting only of the most relevant edges. The chosen network structures include the minimum spanning tree, asset graph and the planar maximally filtered graph. The resulting networks and the extracted information are analysed and compared, looking at the clusters, cliques and connectivity. Finally, we consider some specific time periods (a) a period of crisis (October-December 2008) and (b) a period of recovery (May-August 2010) where we discuss the possible underlying economic reasoning for some aspects of the network structures produced.

The travel, energy and carbon impacts of highly automated vehicles",TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vehicle automation; Energy demand; Travel demand; Carbon emission; Self-driving vehicle; Autonomous cars,OPTIMIZATION,"Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5-10 years, and under most conditions within 10-20 years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half - or nearly double them - depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The psychological hedonism in Bentham is of a rather weak form - net pleasure motivates behaviour, but we are not always capable of its maximisation. Thus, the outcome of our choices is not necessarily in our best interest and the aggregation of our revealed preferences is not necessarily a good indicator of general happiness. The bottom line is that the underpinnings of Bentham's utilitarianism are better aligned with contemporary psychological theory than previously thought, which puts his ethical thinking on firmer ground.","[Danchev, Svetoslav] IOBE Fdn Econ & Ind Res, 11 Tsami Karatasou Str, Athens 11742, Greece",,"Danchev, S (通讯作者)，IOBE Fdn Econ & Ind Res, 11 Tsami Karatasou Str, Athens 11742, Greece.",danchev@iobe.gr,"Danchev, Svetoslav/AAJ-4624-2020","Danchev, Svetoslav/0000-0003-0449-387X",Greek State Scholarship Foundation (IKY) [1043/2006],Greek State Scholarship Foundation (IKY),I would also like to acknowledge the financial support during my PhD studies from the Greek State Scholarship Foundation (IKY) [grant number 1043/2006].,,28,0,1,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The results show (1) a great deal of heterogeneity in terms of which firm- or regional-level characteristics are important in the evaluation of a specific location factor, (2) that the model's explanatory power is, overall, low and thus neither location characteristics nor internal factors are fully reflected in the perceptions of location quality, (3) that a firm's business situation and whether a location factor is considered important have explanatory power for perception.

In this type of auction, bidders submit bids for packages of items of interest together with a specific number of items they want. All items in a package are equally acceptable, but each bidder wants only the specified number of items in their package and not necessarily all. This type of auction is particularly relevant in cases where bidders are interested in items in close proximity to one another and view items as largely substitutable. We show that WDP-SC is NP-hard. We then develop an integer programming (IP) formulation and two approximation algorithms for solving WDP-SC: one based on simulated annealing (SA) and one based on the Metaheuristic for Randomized Priority Search (Meta-RaPS). We assess the performance of these three methods through computational tests performed on sets of large benchmark problems (ranging from 1000 to 10,000 bids) generated from four different distributions: two developed specifically to simulate proximity concerns, and two others previously used in the literature. IP produced the best solutions for 1000-bid problems, but in many cases SA and Meta-RaPS produced better solutions than IP on larger problems. Both IP and Meta-RaPS appear to be robust solution methods for this problem and consistently produced high-quality solutions across all problem sizes and distributions.","[Garcia, Christopher] Univ Mary Washington, Coll Business, Fredericksburg, VA 22401 USA",,"Garcia, C (通讯作者)，Univ Mary Washington, Coll Business, Fredericksburg, VA 22401 USA.",cgarcia@umw.edu,,,,,,,36,2,2,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

A change in Catholic doctrine led to the development of modern banks in cities hosting Jewish communities. Using Jewish demography in 1500 as an instrument, I provide evidence of extraordinary persistence in the level of banking development across Italian cities and substantial effects of local banks on per capita income.

The literature suggests that open innovation that may arise at various levels of the production process such as idea generation, development and commercialization might be influenced by the stakeholders and might significantly affect the firm productivity which is measured with innovative and economic performance. This study is based on tests of various hypotheses related to the effects of open innovation strategies and levels. Data set used in the econometric analyses is obtained through the field survey carried out in 146 food firms. One of the main empirical findings suggests that firms' open innovation strategy is not the sole determining factor on open innovation level. Another finding is that open innovation that arises during idea generation has a positive impact on innovative performance of the firm.","[Seyfettinoglu, Umir K.] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, Dumlupmar Blvd, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Seyfettinoglu, ÜK (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, Dumlupmar Blvd, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",,,,,,,,39,16,16,2,25,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2016,15.0,1,,,,,42,52,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DK0QM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374617300006,0

Drawing on the example of Luxembourg, an EU Member State with a long history of international migrations, the article examines the relationship between free movement of labour and the unionization of migrant workers before analysing the degree to which migrant workers' access to social rights is accompanied by their access to effective decision-making rights in trade unions. Trade unions have used European regulations on the free movement of labour as a legal infrastructure to develop services for migrant workers. At the same time, the free movement of labour and equality of treatment have come to permeate trade union strategies and rhetoric. However, with regard to the inclusion of migrant workers in decision-making processes and access to leadership positions, numerous obstacles to effective participation by migrant workers persist.","[Thomas, Adrien] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, 3 Ave Fonte, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",,"Thomas, A (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, 3 Ave Fonte, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",adrien.thomas@liser.lu,,"Thomas, Adrien/0000-0001-7943-2049","National Research Fund, Luxembourg","National Research Fund, Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund)","For comments on previous versions of this article, the author would like to thank Chris Bickerton, Josip Glaurdic, Anne-Catherine Wagner and the JCMS referees.

Also, suburbs attract families with children, while poor households and small households with young heads select sites close to the commercial core. These empirical observations and others are predicted by this standard model of a monocentric city with three major modifications. Time at work is controlled by employers, not employees. Households with more members at home consume in the same house more housing services. Finally, lot prices need not be proportional to area. In the resulting equilibrium, households are mixed by income and separated by family size. This contrasts with classic urban models where households are separated only by their workers' wage rates.","[Williams, Joseph] Prof Capital, Solana Beach, CA 92075 USA",,"Williams, J (通讯作者)，Prof Capital, Solana Beach, CA 92075 USA.",Williams@ProfessorsCapital.com,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2016,44.0,1,,,,,155,197,,10.1111/1540-6229.12091,0.0,,,43,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DJ3ZC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374144200004,0

Specifically, the study utilizes both parametric and non-parametric event study measures to investigate abnormal stock returns and volume activity during the periods surrounding the announcement of CEO transitions at lodging firms. The study finds significant negative abnormal returns in the periods before and after the announcement of a CEO transition. This suggests that the market did not perceive CEO transitions at lodging firms as value-enhancing events. Regarding trading volume, the study finds a decline in trading activity thirty days prior to announcement, but high trading activity during the immediate period surrounding announcements (5 days before the announcement date and 5 days after). This suggests investor uncertainty regarding the direction and value of the stocks of sampled firms. To minimize the negative impact on stock price and trading volume, it is important that lodging firms plan CEO transitions carefully and provide sufficient and timely information to stakeholders about new CEOs, their background and the value they will add to the firm. Such actions could assuage the negative impact of CEO transition announcement on firm value.","[Bloom, Barry A.

We have collected secondary market data on 278,117 individual ticket sales at different points in the season for 171 home games played by Southeastern Conference (SEC) member football teams over a 2-year period. Our rich data set allows us to control for the quality of the seats and the effects of on-field successes or failures during the season. Since we use data from 2 successive years, we are also able to normalize the level effect on prices of certain stadiums.

An algorithm in this setting is allowed to make queries to edges in E in order to determine whether or not they are realized. We design an adaptive algorithm for this problem that, for any graph G, computes a (1 - epsilon)-approximate maximum matching in the realized graph G(p) with high probability, while making O(log (1/epsilon(p))/epsilon p) queries per vertex, where the edges to query are chosen adaptively in O(log (1/epsilon(p))/epsilon p) rounds. We further present a non-adaptive algorithm that makes O(log (1/epsilon(p))/epsilon p) queries per vertex and computes a (1/2 - epsilon)-approximate maximum matching in G(p) with high probability. Both our adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms achieve the same approximation factor as the previous best algorithms of Blum et al. (EC 2015) for this problem, while requiring exponentially smaller number of per-vertex queries (and rounds of adaptive queries for the adaptive algorithm). Our results settle an open problem raised by Blum et al. by achieving only a polynomial dependency on both epsilon and p. Moreover, the approximation guarantee of our algorithms is instance-wise as opposed to only being competitive in expectation as is the case for Blum et al.. This is of particular relevance to the key application of stochastic matching in kidney exchange. We obtain our results via two main techniques, namely matching-covers and vertex sparsification that may be of independent interest.","[Assadi, Sepehr; Khanna, Sanjeev; Li, Yang] Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Assadi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sassadi@cis.upenn.edu; sanjeev@cis.upenn.edu; yangli2@cis.upenn.edu,,,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1116961] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,22,16,21,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,43,60,,10.1145/2940716.2940769,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300006,0

For lenders, collateral's benefits refer to diminishing agency costs and informational asymmetries, limiting the potential legal complaints and shaping the debtors' future behavior. For SMEs, the insufficient collaterals are probably the most claimed cause of the difficulties in accessing a credit, and a clear way to evaluate the depth and severity of financial gap. Starting from our previous studies concerning the role of collateral in relationship lending, we extended the research to determine the banks' perspective and found out that the most effective variables determining the bank's perspective on the collaterals required in loan contracts are the length of the banking relationship and the prompt repayments. On the other side, the trust in managers/ owners of the companies has little influence on the collaterals required in loan contracts. The results are similar to our prior researches showing that companies with long-term relationship with a bank are available to provide more guarantees than those firms that count on trust relationship. Our findings, in line with other researches, allow us to conclude on the importance of the banks' role in SMEs financing.","[Badulescu, Daniel; Simut, Ramona; Filip, Florin] Univ Oradea, 1 Univ Str, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Badulescu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, 1 Univ Str, Oradea, Romania.",dbadulescu@uoradea.ro; simut.ramona@yahoo.com; ffe17@yahoo.com,"Simut, Ramona/AAN-4689-2020; Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017","Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149",,,,,21,0,0,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,52,61,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100006,0

It should provide better and more professional protection of interests of its customers. Legal relations and international traffic are becoming more and more complex as it is not reasonable to suppose that the users of transport can deal with the mentioned challenges alone. That is why they use the services of professionals. On the other hand, the process of integration of different means of transport may lead to subordinate economic position of the customers so we need a person who has special knowledge and experience in this area: a forwarding agent. The forwarding agent has a better position towards the carriers since he disposes with large quantities of cargo and can negotiate lower prices of transport and other connected services. The user of this service alone does not have such negotiation power. These advantages are expressed not only in cheaper transport, but often in a faster and safer form of transport for cargo customers. It becomes clear that economic benefits lead to the more frequent engagement of forwarding agents. Services of forwarding agents are extremely diverse and heterogeneous at first glance, but ultimately they represent a unity of interests of users in the field of transport. Forwarding agent primarily protects the economic and legal interests of the customers and employs the methods and means of transport that are the best and of the highest quality. The basic purpose of the forwarding contract is the organization of transportation and not a direct implementation of particular services during its realization. For the purpose of carrying out certain services and forwarding agent enters into contracts with a number of specialized organizations. In the first instance it is a contract of carriage with a carrier, but it can be a number of other contracts with other forwarding agents, contract of storage, contracts with brokers, control of cargo, insurance etc. In principle, forwarding agent must perform these tasks with the care of an expert / professional as it is the case of the enhanced professional liability. Forwarding agent could sometimes ignore the interests of his customer and therefore the Law provide for special conditions to be met by forwarding agent to be able to operate. The aim of this article is to explain legal positions of all the parties and to provide answers about some open issues on liability of the forwarding agents.","[Brnabic, Ratko; Ivancev, Mario] Fac Law, Split, Croatia",,"Brnabic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Law, Split, Croatia.",rbrnabic@pravst.hr; mario.ivancev@gmail.com,"Brnabić, Ratko/H-2819-2017",,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,131,141,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400013,0

This article argues that shadow banking is important for another set of reasons. It has been well established that shadow banking permits the transformation of assets and financial claims. It has also been established that fiscal and regulatory arbitrage occurs through shadow banking, and associated offshore financial activities. The article develops the argument that together these are transforming the times and spaces of modern finance, and directly challenging earlier spatio-temporal concepts of finance, and the regulatory/jurisdictional order built on them. The article suggests that the longer term significance of shadow banking may not just be its role in financial crisis, or even tax and regulatory arbitrage, but that it was here that innovative forms of capital were produced and generalised which transcended the spaces and times of earlier institutional, transactional and jurisdictional concepts of capital and wealth.","[Bryan, Dick] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rafferty, Michael] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wigan, Duncan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; Copenhagen Business School,"Wigan, D (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark.",dw.dbp@cbs.dk,,,"Systems of Tax Evasion and Laundering: Locating Global Wealth Chains in the International Political Economy (STEAL) - Research Council of Norway's TaxCapDev [212210/H30]; STEAL [212210/H30]; Australian Research Council [FF110100043, DP120101437]",Systems of Tax Evasion and Laundering: Locating Global Wealth Chains in the International Political Economy (STEAL) - Research Council of Norway's TaxCapDev; STEAL; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Duncan Wigan's research was supported by the Systems of Tax Evasion and Laundering: Locating Global Wealth Chains in the International Political Economy (STEAL 2012-15) project funded by the Research Council of Norway's TaxCapDev [program no. 212210/H30].

By contrast, investments in natural resource sectors and non-tradable activities appear insensitive to such shocks.

It provides the conceptual framework for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Now, more than a decade after the adoption thereof, the world has changed dramatically. The European Council therefore decided to assess the challenges that come with these global challenges. In June 2015 the High Representative was asked to prepare a new EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy (EUGS) that would be presented to the European Council by June 2016. Prior to analysing the opportunities that the new Global Strategy presents it is important that the paper determine the competences of and control mechanisms for the post that is in charge of strategic planning: the post of the High Representative (the HR). The Treaty of Lisbon brought substantial changes to the post of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy that was created under the Treaty of Amsterdam. The High Representative was empowered with a number of new competences. Today, the High Representative is: Vice-President of the European Commission; President of the Foreign Affairs Council; Head of the European Defence Agency; Head of the European External Action Service; responsible for the European Union Special Representatives and participant in the meetings of the European Council when foreign affairs issues are discussed. The HR is appointed by the European Council and given a managing role within two other important EU institutions. Although the European Council can end the HR term of office acting by a qualified majority, the EU legislation does not define the legal requirements that can lead to this situation. Moreover, the Treaty does not provide for legal mechanisms that control the work of the High Representative. This leads to the question of who or what can control the person creating the Global Strategy of EU foreign policy This paper shall analyse the current legal regulation of the post of HR and propose possible solutions for the post of HR that can benefit EU legal order and EU as a global actor.","[Duic, Dunja] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Duic, D (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia.",dduic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,289,298,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400030,0

Seven (7) recursive-digital-filters (RDF) and two (2) graphical methods are used for this study. Discharge data from 8 watersheds in the administrative area of UPT PSDA Bondowoso in East Java were used to test the methods. Firstly, each method was calibrated using daily discharge data for each year (annually) to separate baseflow. Then, optimal parameter values are obtained by averaging the annual values. Calibration process produced optimal parameters value for each watershed. Furthermore, validation was performed using optimal parameter values from watershed having complete discharge data to other watersheds.

Principally, all methods can be used to separate base flow on this region, however three methods (EWMA, Line-Hollick and Local Minimum) perform better than others 6 methods. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Applying three commonly used distance functions to China's provincial data from 2001 to 2010, we show that the variability can be partially explained by the difference in the input/output coverage and whether the estimated marginal abatement cost (MAC) is conditional on the abatement of other correlated pollutants. We also argue that the substantial heterogeneity in abatement cost estimates could be related to an economic interpretation that radial measures reflect the short-run MACs while non-radial measures reflect the long run MACs. Our mean short-run MAC for carbon is 20 US$ per tonne, an amount that is very close to the carbon prices observed in China's recently launched pilot markets.","[Ma, Chunbo; Hailu, Atakelty] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Ma, CB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",chunbo.ma@uwa.edu.au,"Hailu, Atakelty/AAB-7606-2020; Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011","Hailu, Atakelty/0000-0002-1024-7520; Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943",University of Western Australia,University of Western Australia,"Chunbo Ma thanks the University of Western Australia for funding through Research Collaboration Award.

The most significant changes relate to the following issues: contributory contracts of service, reduction in concluding fixed-term contracts and changes in parental rights. It is worth noting, that the regulations apply to both employers and employees. The limits of employment with contracts concluded on a fixed period is one of the most important and probably the most anticipated changes in the labour law. After changes, the Labour Code distinguishes three types of employment contracts: a contract for an indefinite term, fixed-term contract and the contract for a trial period.

Some even consider it a new paradigm of private international law, a, parallel word of private transnational ordering., since in private international law realm due to party autonomy it is the state law that is subordinate to the contract. In order to strike the balance between the party autonomy and state regulatory interests there are also some limitations to party autonomy, one of them being overriding mandatory rules. Overriding mandatory rules are dealt with in Art. 9 of the Rome I Regulation and with respect to earlier Art. 7 of the Rome Convention entail a number of modifications, some of which are either unclear or disputed.

The factorial block randomized design was used for this experiment which consisting of two factors. The first factor is the kind of vermicompost material which consists of three levels (the mixture of mushrooms media waste, cow manure, and vegetable wastes (V1), mushrooms media waste, cow manure and leaf litter (V2), mushrooms media waste, cow manure, vegetable wastes and leaf litter (V3). The second factor is the population of P. corethrurus consisted of five levels (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 indiv.m(-2)) and one control treatment (inorganic treatment). The results showed that the application of various vermicompost had significantly (p < 0.05) higher yields than the inorganic treatment. Interaction between the kind of vermicompost and P.coretrurus population affected sigbificantly (p < 0.05) yield and quality of cabbage. Vermicompost V1 and V2 gave a high yield with population by 025 and 50 indiv. m(-2), respectively. Vermicompost V3 gave a high yield without inoculation of earthworm P. corethrurus. Based on the quality parameters, the vermicompost V1 and V2 with population by 0-50 indiv. m(-2) and V3 with population by 25 indiv. m(-2) gave the best quality of cabbage. Cabbage treated with those three kinds of vermicompost increased contents of sugar and vitamin C by average 12% and 57%, respectively. Storage loss (% of initial mass) showed decrease average value by 23% under the treatment of 7 days storage at room temperature (25 degrees C) and 8% under the treatment of 14 days storage at cold temperature (5 degrees C) compared with the inorganic treatment by 85% and 18%, respectively.

There are two important species of hymenoptera parasitoid in lefminer population Hemiptarsenus varicornis (idiobiont ectoparasitoid) and Digliphus isaeae. idiobiont ectoparasitoid). The research objective was to determine whether multiple releasing of two parasitoid in leafminer population had significant control of leafminer fly compared than single release. The results showed that multiple release caused competition between two different behaviors of Hymenoptera parasitoid. Mortality of leafminer fly was caused by H. varicornis higher than Opius sp.

In theory it could be established that the civil protection of the environment in Croatia is well functioning and provides effective legal protection. However, in practice, the realization of that protection showed to the plaintiffs difficult to realize because the high procedural costs made them difficult to access to the court. Thus allegations have occurred that the current system does not provide effective protection in regard of damages suffered by the plaintiffs since litigation costs such as those for the expertise that they need to pay in advance are huge. Significant interpretation gave the EU Court of Justice in the Edwards case in which held that potential applicants should not be prevented from pursuing judicial proceedings by reason of the financial burden that might arise. National laws and courts need to safeguard rights which individuals derive from EU law, and must not make it in practice excessively difficult or impossible to exercise this rights. Therefore, the basic reason why individual citizens, natural persons, rarely decide for the filing of this lawsuits is based on the fact that these procedures are costly and long lasting and on the other hand, always with uncertain outcome. Moreover, such procedures are generally conducted against more powerful oppponents that have their own legal services and resources to finance the procedure more easily. The aim of this paper is to point out the problems faced by ordinary citizens and NGOs when they are seeking for the protection of their environment and to propose possible solutions.","[Radoja, Katarina Knol] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Radoja, KK (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia.",kknol@pravos.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,64,72,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400007,0

Lawyers take up a unique position when it comes to the legal regime for free movement applicable to them in the EU. Their profession is covered by a separate system of Directives: the Lawyers' Services Directive and the Lawyers' Establishment Directive. Both Directives have largely been implemented correctly in the Member States. As far as irregularities are concerned, these are most notably encountered with regard to the administrative requirements for registration under the home title and to a lesser extent to the introduction of limitations on professional activity. Both Directives offer some discretionary room to the Member States in the implementation in national law, such as whether or not to use requirements of working in conjunction with local lawyers, and introduction to the court and Bar president. The requirement to work in conjunction with a local lawyer in court proceedings is implemented in almost all Member States including Croatia. The main problems encountered in cross - border practice of law in the EU seem to be more associated with the exercise of the right to establishment, which gives it a character of permanency. Paper analyzes some problems, first of all two legal systems existing within the territory of the EU, the continental civil law and the common law. Also, lawyers wishing to practice law in a Member State outside their language speaking area are facing potential language barriers. The third problem could lie in insufficiently good knowledge of the national law of the host Member State in which one plans to set up an establishment.","[Sago, Dinka] Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Sago, D (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split, Croatia.",dsago@pravst.hr,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,319,328,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400033,0

Phytase is a biocatalytic enzyme widely used in the animal feed industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the growth of A. niger and its production of phytase in two systems: 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks (EF) and a 600 L rotating drum bioreactor (RDB). The highest phytase activity found was about 1,200 unit/g substrate dry weight in EF and 580 unit/g substrate dry weight in RDB. In solid-state fermentation it is necessary to control temperature and substrate moisture content to optimize A. niger growth and its production of phytase. This study confirmed that temperature and moisture content of substrate could be controlled to optimize the result during fermentation in a 600 L RDB. In this study, inlet air velocity was controlled at 1.5 m/s and the rotational speed at 1.0 rpm in solid-state fermentation. The crude enzyme produced by A. niger in solid-state fermentation was achieved in a 600 RDB after 36 h of fermentation. This crude enzyme was dried in a hot air oven at 50 degrees C for 3 d prior to use in animal feed. Phytase activity was found to be 1.5-fold lower than the activity obtained before drying the crude enzyme.

Smith's general account of fashion is grounded on the transmission of fashion from the rich to the poor. However, when it comes to accounting for the generation of fashion amongst the wealthy class, Smith's account moves away from wealth distinctions and focuses instead on more sophisticated forms of social judgement. This paper examines Smith's general account of fashion between the classes and then identifies the refinements to the account that he provides when he considers the operation of fashion amongst the rich. The paper suggests that the operative distinction among the wealthy is not relative wealth, but rather reputation for taste, and concludes with a discussion of the man of taste in Smith's account of fashion.","[Smith, Craig] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Bldg,40 Bute Gardens, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Smith, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Bldg,40 Bute Gardens, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Craig.Smith@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,5,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

However, in coalitional games one problem remains if the players have different weights: We cannot simplify the vector payoff function to a scalar payoff function. We can analyze the contribution of each player, but it is difficult to analyze the contribution of coalitions. We use the known formulation of linear model that split the gain of the coalition by use of bargaining theory - egalitarian solution. Then we generalize the model for the case when players and coalitions have possibility to choose from more payoffs. We use the binary variables and formulate a mixed integer programming problem.

The approach is based on a conditional probability that a random variable is lower than a given quantile while another random variable is also lower than its corresponding quantile. Time-varying conditional quantiles are modeled by the regression quantiles. In addition to the univariate conditional autoregressive models, the vector autoregressive extension is considered. In the second step, the conditional probability is estimated through the OLS regression.

A key aspect is how drivers' behave towards uncertainties towards associated search times and finding a vacant parking spot. This study presents the results from a stated preference experiment on the choice behaviour of drivers, in light of these uncertainties. The attribute set was selected based on a literature review, and appended with the probabilities of finding a vacant parking spot upon arrival and after 8 min (and initially also after 4 min, but later dropped to reduce the survey complexity). Efficient Designs were used to create the survey design, where two rounds of pilot studies were conducted to estimate prior coefficients. Data was successfully collected from 397 respondents. Various random utility maximisation (RUM) choice models were estimated, including multinomial logit, nested logit, and mixed logit, as well as models accounting for panel effects. These model analyses show how drivers appear to accept spending time on searching for a vacant parking spot, where parking availability after 8 min ranks second most important factor in determining drivers' parking decisions, whilst parking availability upon arrival ranks fourth. Furthermore, the inclusion of heterogeneity in preferences and inter-driver differences is found to increase the predictive power of the parking location choice model. The study concludes with an outlook of how these insights into drivers' parking behaviour can be incorporated into traffic assignment models and used to support parking systems.

Using a unique dataset with trader-specific limit and market order histories for more than 10,000 traders, we detect transaction behavior consistent with the informed trading hypothesis, where traders consistently make money. We then work within the theoretical framework of a high-frequency version of a structural microstructure trade model, which directly measures the market maker's beliefs. Both the estimates of the trade model parameters and our model-free analysis of the data suggest that the time-varying pattern of the probability of informed trading is rooted in the strategic arrival of informed traders on a particular day-of-week, hour-of-day, or geographic location (market).","[Gencay, Ramazan] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Gencay, Ramazan; Gradojevic, Nikola] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy; [Gradojevic, Nikola] Lille Catholic Univ, IESEG Sch Management LEM CNRS, F-59000 Lille, France; [Olsen, Richard] Olsen Ltd, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Olsen, Richard] Univ Essex, CCFEA, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Selcuk, Faruk] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Simon Fraser University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IESEG School of Management; University of Essex; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Gradojevic, N (通讯作者)，Lille Catholic Univ, IESEG Sch Management LEM CNRS, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.",rgencay@sfu.ca; ngradojevic@ieseg.fr; richardo@olsen.ch,"Gencay, Ramazan/A-1905-2008","Gradojevic, Nikola/0000-0003-4001-3159",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Ramazan Gencay and Nikola Gradojevic gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,48,7,7,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Asymmetric influence and regulatory capture in setting such standards can undermine the regulation of economic activity, with negative externalities for the society. Scholars of International Political Economy, and of global finance in particular, are in the process of revealing the mechanisms underlying such regulatory capture and failure. I contribute to this analysis with an empirical evaluation of the mechanisms underlying influence in setting such standards. I assess the influence of nine different national, transnational, and international actors in the case of global banking regulation (the Basel II framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision). On the basis of a quantitative-qualitative assessment, I develop integration and rejection rates to measure influence in global regulation. My findings reveal that the key dynamic in setting global standards is the simultaneous influence of national (competition state) coalitions of politicians and firms as well as transnational harmonization coalitions of transnationally active firms and regulators. The results provide a basis for a new argument to understand regulatory capture and failure.","[Goldbach, Roman] Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Banking & Financial Supervis, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Goldbach, R (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Banking & Financial Supervis, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,46,27,28,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The conditionally parametric quantile model accounts for local spatial effects by allowing coefficients to vary smoothly over space. The approach is illustrated using a new data set with land values for over 30,000 blocks in Chicago for 1913. Kernel density functions summarize the effects of discrete changes in the explanatory variables. The CPAR quantile results suggest that the distribution of land values shifts markedly to the right for locations near the CBD, close to Lake Michigan, near elevated train lines, and along major streets. The variance of the land value distribution is higher in locations farther from the CBD and farther from the train lines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Temporary agency workers, among whom migrant workers are over-represented, are taken as a test case of outsiders'. The findings from a comparison of Belgian and German multinational plants show that collective agreements have allowed a protection gap between permanent and agency workers to emerge in Germany, but not in Belgium. However, the weaker protection in Germany depends less on an explicit union choice for insiders than on the weakening of the institutional environment for union representation and collective bargaining. The conclusion suggests that European unions are increasingly trying to defend the outsiders, but meet institutional obstacles that vary by country.","[Pulignano, Valeria] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Labour Sociol & Ind Relat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Meardi, Guglielmo] Univ Warwick, Ind Relat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Meardi, Guglielmo] Univ Warwick, Ind Relat Res Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Doerflinger, Nadja] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Warwick; University of Warwick; KU Leuven,"Pulignano, V (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res, Parkstr 45 Bus 3601, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",valeria.pulignano@soc.kuleuven.be,"Meardi, Guglielmo/AAB-7874-2020","Meardi, Guglielmo/0000-0001-9132-3179; Doerflinger, Nadja/0000-0003-2894-6132",Bijzonder Onderzoeksfond Onderzoekstoelage [OT/10/015]; FWO [ZKC2575/G.0773.11]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-070-27-0025]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H024085/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H024085/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Bijzonder Onderzoeksfond Onderzoekstoelage; FWO(FWO); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research was funded by 'Bijzonder Onderzoeksfond Onderzoekstoelage OT/10/015' and 'FWO ZKC2575/G.0773.11' research grants on 'Multinationals in Europe between flexibility and security: A comparative company level study'.

However, despite research into their survival strategies which identified antecedents of competitiveness including hard factors such as facilities, available cargo and cargo processing ability, softer factors spanning human resource management, networks and strategic alliances with universities and government agencies in industry-university-government (I-U-G) networks have been overlooked. This study aims to examine both hard and softer antecedents of competitiveness as perceived by 152 professionals in South Korean CTOCs; empirical relationships among these antecedents, I-U-G networks, and competitiveness itself; and the significance of the I-U-G network in establishing and improving competitiveness. Posited antecedents of competitiveness included human resources, facilities, service quality, customer orientation, reputation, and government support policy as independent variables; the I-U-G network as a moderating variable; and competitiveness as a dependent variable. Empirical structural relationships revealed that excepting government support policy, each variable significantly affected CTOC competitiveness. Further, the I-U-G network moderated the relationships between the antecedents of competitiveness and competitiveness. Because an effective I-U-G network was pivotal in controlling CTOC competitiveness, improved competitiveness requires not only differentiation of human resources, facilities, service quality, customer orientation, and reputation factors but also I-U-G network developments.

Our modeling approach is motivated by evidence suggesting the existence of breaks in the behavior of the US yield curve that depend, for example, on whether the economy is in a recession or a boom, or on the stance of monetary policy. Our model is parsimonious, relatively easy to estimate and flexible enough to match the changing shapes of the yield curve over time. We also derive the discrete time non-arbitrage restrictions for the Markov switching model. We compare the forecasting performance of these models with that of the standard dynamic Nelson and Siegel model and an extension that allows the decay rate parameter to be time varying. We show that some parametrizations of our model with regime shifts outperform the single-regime Nelson and Siegel model and other standard empirical models of the yield curve.

The article analyses the content of an original dataset consisting of 515 critical remarks and 113 follow-up inquiries issued by the EO. The study shows that concerns about transparency and accountability dominate citizens' complaints to the Ombudsman. Further, the analysis concludes that, when EU institutions were subject to critical remarks, in the majority of instances they adopted the EO's recommendation to increase the transparency and/or accountability of their practices. The EO's impact is observable both during the inquiry process and after it issues critical remarks.

In this paper we present an analysis based on interviews with stakeholders whose involvement was grounded in a complementary model of public participation, one in which an organized community used collective action (instead of only individual expression), and worked both within and outside of the formal public involvement process to influence the design of an arterial highway in their neighborhood. This case reflects a commonplace context for public participation: residents opposing a highway expansion and the negative effects of heavy traffic in neighborhoods. The problem presented in this case is that the process for citizen involvement was not designed to fully utilize the community's collective capacity. Three aspects of collective action representation, the ability to shape a policy agenda, and methods of engagement were contested in the public participation process. We argue that these conflicts around collective action in the public participation process exposed its one-way communication, and enabled a different kind of political process in which neighbors' organizing was powerful and influenced decisions.

Apart from their opinion leader status, few previous research details the motivations which turn early adopters into advocates for innovation who approach the non-adopters among their family and friends, or casual acquaintances. Drawing on a survey among 1398 e-bike and 133 e-scooter early adopters in Austria, personal drivers of engagement in interpersonal diffusion are investigated. Longitudinal data one year later for 157 e-bike users allows tests of causal relations. A complementary sample of 33 network peers illustrates the early adopters' social impact. Early adopters engage actively in discussing product features, instigating trial behavior and recommending purchase. Analyses by structural equation modeling show that efforts at interpersonal diffusion are driven by opinion leadership, experienced product performance, and perceived normative expectations of others toward pro-environmental technologies. Mediator and moderator analyses underline that opinion leadership is conveyed upon early adopters because personal norms and technophilia qualify them as credible and competent for the specific topic of e-vehicles. Social norm interrelations point to dynamic interactions and discourse between early adopters and their addressees. Evidence from the peer sample suggests though that the persuasive impact of early adopters is small. To accelerate market entry of electric vehicles, public or private agencies should foremost approach early adopters scoring high in the identified drivers, and empower them in their role as multiplicators by providing pre-prepared product information and encouraging them to continuously address peers.

We focus on the case of Spain during the period 1995-2007. The empirical strategy compares the variation in the amount of developable land before-after the construction of the highway in treated municipalities and in control municipalities with similar pre-treatment traits. Our results show that, following the construction of a highway, municipalities converted a huge amount of land from rural to urban uses. The amount of new land declared to be developable was larger in places with low construction costs or high demand, suggesting that zoning follows market forces. However, the impact of the highway was lower in places where residents were less favorable to development or where developers had more influence over zoning policies. Local political factors thus impede the full adaptation of zoning to economic changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A discrete latent factor model for smoking and health outcomes, allowing for these to be commonly affected by unobserved factors, is jointly estimated, using the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS) dataset. Post-estimation predictions suggest the reduction in time-to-cancer to be 5.7 years for those with an exposure of 30 pack-years, compared to never-smokers. Estimation of posterior probabilities for class membership shows that individuals in certain classes exhibit similar observables but highly divergent health outcomes, suggesting that unobserved factors influence outcomes. The use of a joint model changes the results substantially. The results show that failure to account for unobserved heterogeneity leads to differences in survival times between those with different smoking exposures to be overestimated by more than 50% (males, with 30 pack-years of exposure).

In the absence of net-output data, previous research has estimated output change using proxy variables. Various proxy-based output series are available that imply either a 25% German labor-productivity lead over Britain or a parity of performance in 1907. The conventional strategy to deal with this conundrum involves a choice between the series. With the correlation between the different proxies and output unknown, such a choice is inappropriate because it results in the loss of information provided by the rejected proxies. Instead, this study makes full and efficient use of all information by estimating a common component in the various output series. The new estimate of output change implies a German lead over Britain in manufacturing labor productivity of 4.4% in 1907. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper contributes to the literature on trade liberalisation and the agricultural sector by analysing the effects of FTAs on the competitiveness of the dairy sector across 76 countries and over a 20-year period from 1990 to 2009. With a longitudinal econometric model, the results demonstrate that when a country has a revealed comparative advantage in the dairy sector, FTAs positively influence several indicators of competitiveness in the dairy sector, such as production, market share and trade balance. The results also indicate that multilateral FTAs are more beneficial than bilateral FTAs. There is strong empirical evidence that FTAs are more beneficial to developed countries than to developing countries. There is no statistical evidence to support the hypothesis about a relationship between FTAs and farm-gate price.","[Couillard, Catherine; Turkina, Ekaterina] HEC Montreal, Int Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Couillard, C (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Int Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,20,10,10,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2015,38.0,6,,,,,1015,1033,,10.1111/twec.12181,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CL1AV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356675500007,0

The results provide ample support for a strong positive relationship between per capita domestic tourism nights and per capita internal migration stock. This evidence extends the migration-tourism nexus, already established at the international level, to the intra-national scale and reinforces the idea that host regions should not overlook the role of migration when designing their tourism policies.","[Massidda, Carla; Piras, Romano] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Massidda, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Viale St Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",massidda@unica.it; pirasr@unica.it,"Piras, Romano/AAF-1499-2020","PIRAS, ROMANO/0000-0002-0809-5732; MASSIDDA, CARLA/0000-0003-3295-8240",,,,,46,11,12,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

By pushing upward the yields on the government debts of member states standing in the eurozone's periphery, investors caused, in a self-fulfilling way, the crisis that ultimately threatened the eurozone's integrity and the euro's survival. So how do we explain the behaviour of market investors before, during and after the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis? Why did investors not discriminate in their pricing of eurozone sovereign bonds before the crisis? Why did they abruptly change their minds in 2010? And why have they gradually felt reassured enough from mid-2011, depending on the country, to ask for significantly lower yields on sovereign bonds? To answer these questions, the paper argues that investors' confidence rests to a large extent on the expectation of the eurozone's solidarity, which is why large-scale multilateral solutions coming from the euro area were more successful in resolving the crisis than unilateral ones coming primarily from the debtor countries. As a result, this paper improves our understanding of the international political economy of financial (currency, bank and debt) crises by looking at the particular case of a monetary union with a single currency.","[Chang, Michele] Coll Europe, Dept European Polit & Adm Studies, BE-8000 Brugge, Belgium; [Leblond, Patrick] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Chang, M (通讯作者)，Coll Europe, Dept European Polit & Adm Studies, Dijver 11, BE-8000 Brugge, Belgium.",,"Chang, Michele/T-8335-2019","Chang, Michele/0000-0002-8275-8119; Leblond, Patrick/0000-0002-9889-7498",,,,,77,27,28,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

From 2008 a different crisis, one of public legitimacy, engulfed academic economics as critics railed against its failure to predict the onset of unprecedented global economic turmoil. But despite the public focus upon the failings of mainstream economics, the rise of alternative disciplinary and epistemological perspectives has been muted. Scholars of international political economy (IPE), unconstrained by the debilitating equilibrium assumptions of neoclassical economics and keenly aware of the intimate connectivity between politics and economics, might justifiably have expected to make gains during the economics profession's darkest hour. That they have not managed, thus far, to substantially unsettle the intellectual and institutional predominance of economics should not, however, be a source of dismay. Political economy scholars possess the analytical tools to produce a much-needed counterpoint to prevailing academic economics. It is with demonstrating that capacity, and restating the holistic merits of political economy scholarship, that this Special Issue is concerned. Bringing together a number of diverse theoretical perspectives and employing a wide range of conceptual categories, this Special Issue showcases the rich variety of IPE scholarship and its collective capacity to generate much deeper and more holistic analyses of the global economic crisis than those provided by the reigning economics orthodoxy, and in doing so, to get what went wrong right.","[Green, Jeremy] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Hay, Colin] Sci Po, Ctr European Studies, F-75337 Paris 07, France",University of Bristol,"Green, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",jeremy.green@bristol.ac.uk; colin.hay@sciencespo.fr,,"Hay, Colin/0000-0001-6327-6547",,,,,20,42,42,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The results reveal multiple structural breaks and differential break points across regions. The regional break points do not coincide with the national break suggesting a spatial pattern of the underlying determinants of regional housing prices. We find long memory in regional housing prices using the entire sample period, but the results are generally reversed in sub-samples (regimes) that incorporate structural breaks. Our evidence suggests that failure to account for structural breaks when testing for long memory can lead to incorrect inferences. The results, which proved robust to model specifications, have important implications for policy prescriptions, for market efficiency, and for the integration of regional housing markets.","[Ngene, Geoffrey M.; Lambert, Charles A.] Mercer Univ, Stetson Sch Business & Econ, Macon, GA 31207 USA; [Darrat, Ali F.] Louisiana Tech Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Ruston, LA 71272 USA",Mercer University; University of Louisiana System; Louisiana Technical University,"Ngene, GM (通讯作者)，Mercer Univ, Stetson Sch Business & Econ, 1400 Coleman Ave, Macon, GA 31207 USA.",ngene_gm@mercer.edu; asa.lambert@gmail.com; yarab@latech.edu,,,,,,,46,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Theoretically, a real depreciation has an ambiguous effect on foreign technology adoption. On the one hand, a real depreciation makes exports more competitive, and as exporters tend to adopt and use more advanced technologies, we should observe a higher propensity to import technologies among them. On the other hand, a real depreciation can also make imports of technology relatively more expensive. Thus, this question must be examined empirically. The empirical analysis shows that a real depreciation significantly increases the probability of using foreign technology licences for plants that export and for plants in the intermediate range of the size and productivity distribution.","[Alvarez, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ricardo A.] Brandeis Univ, Int Business Sch, Waltham, MA USA",Universidad de Chile; Brandeis University,"Alvarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",,,,Millennium Science Initiative [NS 100017],Millennium Science Initiative,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees and participants at the 7th Workshop of the International Study Group on Exports and Productivity (ISGEP) held at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, on 27-28 September 2012 for helpful comments and suggestions.

The econometric evidence shows two distinct results. First, persistent innovators benefit significantly more than other exporters from access to a rich spectrum of nearby knowledge.

A dataset of Iowa farmland prices for three grades of quality over the last 60 years is examined to address the question whether the conditions for a rational expectations bubble are evident. An abnormal component in the change in farmland prices is found during the most recent sub-period of the sample. A novel valuation model that measures the speculative component of farmland value as a function of cash rents shows no speculative component is present. An additional test of the time series characteristics of the data provides no evidence of negative duration dependence. However, analysis of transition probabilities shows asymmetry exists most notably in the low quality farmland data series. Finally, time irreversibility is shown to be present at different lags for only the lowest farmland quality grade. Overall, the results imply that the low quality grade farmland is the most likely candidate to exhibit the conditions necessary to support a rational expectations bubble. In general, however, the data offer weak support of a bubble in farmland prices.","[Olsen, Brett C.; Stokes, Jeffrey R.] Univ No Iowa, Dept Finance, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA",University of Northern Iowa,"Olsen, BC (通讯作者)，Univ No Iowa, Dept Finance, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA.",brett.olsen@uni.edu,,,,,,,32,7,8,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This correlation is affected by a team's expected surplus from contracting with their draftees. Comparing to the other teams, teams with more empty seats and fewer wins in the previous season invested more in early draftees, but less in later draftees.

Due to varying degrees of financial responsibilities and commitments to provide public goods and services, US state governments serve as a perfectly natural laboratory to test the electoral significance of fiscal policies. We adopt a probit model, with several specifications, to determine significant impacts of fiscal consolidation and increases in welfare spending on US gubernatorial elections from 1978 to 2006. The analyses show that voters are more concerned about the increase in debt than current budget deficits. An increase in welfare spending is negatively associated with reelection. Moreover, the impact of taxation on gubernatorial elections turns out to be insignificant. In particular, findings suggest that the political business cycle model does not hold true in US gubernatorial elections. Expansionary fiscal policy right before the election may not have crucial impacts on the chances of an incumbent winning the election.","[Kim, Hyungon] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Kwon, Chang] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; George Mason University,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",hyungonk@iadb.org; ckwon3@gmu.edu,,,,,,,59,1,2,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

First, the case study reveals the growing influence of the power of the European local' on the decision of whether or not to deploy normative power. Second, it underscores the fact that local power relations in the target country often determine the reaction to NPE, while the reaction often produces the visibility of the normative edicts and thus helps empower NPE. And third, NPE's visibility has an impact on the EU's self-identification, but not necessarily on the policies it criticizes. These observations underscore the importance of analyzing the various levels of the local' and their relation to NPE in order to understand the latter's political impact.","[Gordon, Neve; Pardo, Sharon] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Pardo, S (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ctr Study European Polit & Soc, Dept Polit & Government, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",pardos@bgu.ac.il,"GORDON, NEVE/F-2044-2012","Gordon, Neve/0000-0002-9502-3998",,,,,55,32,33,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Consumers might not realize that, in the long-run, the financial benefits from reduced energy consumption offset much or all of the initial price premium. One strategy to address consumer misconception of this advantage is to supply information on the total cost of ownership, a metric which accounts for the purchase price, the cost of the fuel, and other costs over the ownership period. In this article, we investigate how providing information on five-year fuel cost savings and total cost of ownership affects the stated preferences of consumers to purchase a gasoline, conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid, Or battery electric vehicle. Through an online survey with an embedded experimental design using distinct labels, we find that respondent rankings of vehicles are unaffected by information on five-year fuel cost savings. However, adding information about total cost of ownership increases the probability that small/mid-sized car consumers express a preference to acquire a conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or a battery-electric vehicle. No such effect is found for consumers of small sport utility vehicles. Our results are consistent with other findings in the behavioral economics literature and suggest that further evaluation of the effects of providing consumers with information on the total cost of vehicle ownership is warranted.

In this paper, I use global value chain analysis to examine the characteristics of North Korean trade networks engaged in drug trafficking in two time periods during which state hostility toward drug trafficking varied markedly (from the early 1990s until 2005, when the central state encouraged production and trafficking, and since 2005, when North Korea cracked down on drugs). Access to a favourable institutional environment and state resources was associated with a spatial distribution of drug trafficking activities that was both territorially concentrated and territorially dispersed while the North Korean state sought to control as much of the value chain as possible. In the second period, the North Korean central state deprived many drug trafficking networks of state support, leading to networks with territorial distributions of production, distribution, and retail concentrated within both North Korea and adjacent countries, and more complex business relationships with various levels of the North Korean state, leading to a more distributed capture of value along the value chain.","Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Hastings, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,"Hastings, Justin/0000-0003-4947-1535",,,,,88,7,9,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In response, there has been a proliferation in the number of multilateral bodies addressing energy issues in recent years, and a wide range of organisations now claim a role in facilitating intergovernmental energy cooperation. However, the practical achievements of these organisations have been very poor, with all suffering difficulties that have limited their ability to promote shared energy interests between states. This article examines the dynamics of multilateral energy organisations, arguing that the political economy features of energy - securitisation and attendant patterns of economic nationalism - explain why they have failed to develop more robust cooperative mechanisms. Ten global-level organisations are evaluated and found to suffer from membership, design or commitment issues that limit their effectiveness in global energy governance. These challenges are linked to the securitisation of energy, which has led governments to favour low-cost soft-law approaches over potentially more effective hard-law institutional designs. Moreover, the securitisation of energy poses limits for how far multilateral energy cooperation can proceed and means that contemporary efforts to strengthen these organisations are unlikely to succeed in coming years.","Murdoch Univ, Asia Res Ctr, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Murdoch University,"Wilson, JD (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Asia Res Ctr, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",j.wilson@murdoch.edu.au,,"Wilson, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4100-8626",,,,,52,26,29,2,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Specifically, according to Mazzuccato (2013, 2015), we believe that a confident and patient entrepreneurial regional authority is needed to take on the early, capital-intensive stages of the value chains characterized by higher risks and uncertainty (R&D, creativity, etc.). This renewed role for the public authorities - that goes beyond the steady state assumption of fixing market failures - is particularly needed in those areas where unfavorable wage gaps actually hamper agglomeration and private firms are reluctant in promoting long-run investments. Operationally, we present some case studies of the ongoing process concerning the development of Environmental and Cultural Systems (ECS) in the Apulia Region. A preliminary set of policy recommendations are depicted in the conclusions. Design/methodology/approach - Firstly, after a brief introduction of the notion of smile curve, we propose a new conceptual framework to assess the complex links between culture/creativity and LSED overcoming the standard approach of simple marshallian externalities (e.g., cultural districts). Then, we focus on the Apulian SAC case studies to assess the actual degree of coherence of the on-going process with the above framework as well as its preliminary achievements on the local territories (e.g., social and cultural capital, entrepreneurship, management, etc.). Lastly, we propose a first set of recommendations to be considered in defining the Apulia Region 2014-2020 policies for the development of Environmental and Cultural Systems (ECS) and creative industry Originality/value - The added value of this paper stands in proposing a new conceptual framework able to link culture/creativity and local development as well as an empirical applications by assessing some case studies of the Apulian Environmental and Cultural Systems (ECS) in the framework of 2007-13 regional planning process. Practical implications - The outcomes of the paper will be the following: a new conceptual framework for a cultural-based LSED; an empirical assessment of one of the pillar of the Apulian regional planning process in the framework of the ERDF 2007-13; a set of policy recommendations for the new 2014-20 EU regional planning process.","[Montalbano, Pierluigi] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Montalbano, Pierluigi] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Palumbo, Francesco] Puglia Reg, Policies Area Promot Terr Knowledge & Talents, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Sussex,,,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,649,660,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200050,0

The literature on both ecosystem and practices is flourishing in recent years and a combination among these two topics can be useful to understand through an empirical context the ways in which firms address their approach in different ways and towards several actors. The focus on communication depends on its relation to the 'micro-macro' relationships (Schatzki et al., 2001) and it can lead to give evidence to the actors surrounding a firm in an innovation ecosystem context. Design/methodology/approach - We propose a qualitative research design as the most appropriate when dealing with new phenomenon. We adopt a content-analysis approach based on the study of different sources (Bazeley and Jackson, 2013), to give evidence to the actors highlighted by firms and to understand which are the ties emerging among the elements of communication practices (quantitative cluster analysis), with a specific focus on consumers (proximity query). Functional food industry is suitable as in line with the innovation ecosystem literature; the firms considered in this investigation have been selected through Euromonitor Passport platform in the European leading market, namely United Kingdom. Originality/value - This investigation tries to shed some more light on the emerging issue of ecosystem in order to understand how firms are perceiving the context around them and how they interact with actors around them when communicating. By considering firms' approaches in the way described above, the results can be more reliable, as the analysis is based on what firms do in an innovation-based ecosystem instead of what they perceive in such a context. Practical implications - The first insights from the research approach underline the key role played by communication practices in depicting the ecosystem emerging around innovative firms (Kowalkowski et al., 2012). Scholars can benefit from this approach to deepen the topic of emerging ecosystem and to define practices useful to improve the knowledge about how ecosystems arise (Du Plessis, 2007); while firms can assess the way they approach to their surrounding context if they compare the evidences with their perceptions. Customers play a relevant role in the generation of knowledge and the creation of collaboration practices within innovation ecosystems.","[Amitrano, Cristina C.; Coppola, Mariarosaria; Tregua, Marco; Bifulco, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management Inst, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Amitrano, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management Inst, Campus Monte St Angelo Via Cintia 26, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",,"TREGUA, Marco/J-6726-2018; Bifulco, Francesco/N-9585-2019; Amitrano, Cristina Caterina/ISB-1339-2023","TREGUA, Marco/0000-0003-1579-7676; Bifulco, Francesco/0000-0002-4324-5679; Amitrano, Cristina Caterina/0000-0003-3127-1658",,,,,66,0,0,0,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1871,1885,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200145,0

Previously citrus cultivars were primarily described according to their morphological or horticultural traits, but trueness-to-type can now be confirmed using molecular markers, thereby limiting inadvertent cultivar misidentification. Following routine testing the reported parentage of two mandarin hybrids is now questioned. 'Orri' mandarin is derived from 'Orah' mandarin by induced mutation, and was reportedly bred by crossing 'Temple' tangor and 'Dancy' mandarin. 'Orri' has excellent organoleptic qualities, and other favorable traits. With 'Dancy' as the pollen parent, at least some degree of susceptibility of 'Orri' to Alternaria brown spot (ABS) might be expected, but it is more likely to have inherited a high degree of susceptibility; yet 'Orri' appears to be immune to ABS. SSR analysis provided evidence that excludes 'Dancy' as the pollen parent of 'Orah'. Further testing revealed the likely pollen parent candidate as 'Kinnow' mandarin. 'Fortune' mandarin was a popular late-maturing mandarin cultivar until the high incidence of ABS rendered the cultivar uneconomical to produce in certain citrus production regions. This exceptionally late, high quality, attractive cultivar is reported to have originated from a 'Clementine' mandarin x 'Dancy' cross. However, two independent molecular marker studies revealed that the pollen parent of 'Fortune' is possibly 'Orlando' tangelo and not 'Dancy'. In both cases, the pollen parent of 'Orri' and 'Fortune' mandarin hybrids appears not to be 'Dancy' as published. This information will assist geneticists and breeders to reinterpret heritability studies on ABS susceptibility of mandarins and their hybrids.","[Barry, Graham H.] XLnT Citrus Co, Cape Town, South Africa; [Gmitter, Frederick G., Jr.; Chen, Chunxian] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; [Roose, Mikeal L.; Federici, Claire T.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [McCollum, Gregory T.] USDA ARS, United States Hort Res Lab, Ft Pierce, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of California System; University of California Riverside; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Barry, GH (通讯作者)，XLnT Citrus Co, Cape Town, South Africa.",ghbarry@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,14,15,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,449,456,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.55,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600055,0

The pathogen affects leaves and fruit of susceptible mandarin cultivars such as 'Fortune', 'Nova', 'Minneola', and 'Murcott'. The epidemiology of ABS was studied mainly in humid areas in Florida but, due to climatic differences, this information cannot be extrapolated to semi-arid regions like Spain. Field studies were conducted in 2011 in the experimental orchards at IVIA, Valencia. Dynamics of the airborne Alternaria conidia were monitored weekly by a spore trap, and the percentage of pathogenic isolates was determined periodically using the selective medium, ARSA, and pathogenicity tests. The presence of inoculum on affected leaves, shoots, leaf litter, and weeds was also determined. Infection periods were monitored weekly by exposing trap or indicator plants of 'Fortune' and 'Nova' mandarins. Environmental variables were recorded by an automated meteorological station. Although Alternaria conidia were detected through the experimental period, only 5% of all the isolates were pathogenic. As affected leaves and shoots were determined to be the main source of inoculum, the survival of the fungus in the leaf litter was higher than previously reported in Florida. Pathogenic isolates were detected also in weeds, but only at very low levels. Infections in trap plants occurred mainly in May-June and September-October. A significant positive correlation was detected between disease incidence and rainfall.","[Bassimba, Daniel D.

Findings indicate that irradiation altered aspects other than seedlessness, such as pollen germination, and some of the clones presented fruits with different weight, size, acidity and maturity index. Fruit quality and nutritional bio-components also were affected. Our results indicated high contents in natural antioxidants as vitamin C and phenolic compounds in these citrus varieties, and provide a qualitative and quantitative survey of the fruit taste and organoleptic quality. High-performance liquid chromatographic methods were used to identify and quantify these bioactive compounds. These aspects are important for the consumer that demands the prevention of health problems through nutrition and certain fruit quality traits, including fruit size, internal quality, good rind colour and easy peeling. All irradiated clones studied presented lower seed numbers and reduced pollen germination compared to the corresponding controls, and some of these clones, which ripen late in the season and whose fruit quality is maintained or improved, are in the process of protection.

Even if statistical data on training in Romania for the last decade - obtained from previous surveys and studies - is not continuous and heterogeneous, we may conclude that the level of training accession is considerably low (compared to the European average); besides, training public funds are disproportionate to the number of SMEs in Romania. The accessing obstacles may be explained by three relevant factors: 1) the weak level of public policy adapting to SMEs specificities, 2) the low priority addressed to SMEs learning by structural funds in Romania and the weak cohesion between these funds (e.g., the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, the Sectoral Operational Programme for Increase of Economic Competitiveness), 3) the employers' perception of the shared responsibility of learning culture (between employee and employer in a SME).

The study highlights the importance of location, competition in the sector (external factors), educational level, new approaches to problem solutions and management's commitment to support new product development both financially and emotionally (internal factors) in order to meet the aim of new product introduction. Design/methodology/approach - Taking the purpose of our study, our research was based on a quantitative research strategy. We collected data from 692 Turkish companies from Turkey and used binary logistic regression analysis to predict the introduction of new products using different predictors. Originality/value - This study provides fresh insights into external and internal factors that influence whether or not new products are introduced. The findings were obtained from Turkish companies, thus we expand our understanding of the topic in different parts of the world and at different levels of economic development respectively. Practical implications - Based on the study's findings we propose a number of measures to better manage the process of new product introduction. These measures may be useful for companies operating in other industries and countries as well.","[Durst, Susanne] Univ Skovde, Sch Business, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden; [Temel, Serdal] Ege Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Yesilay, R.

Australia's two bike share programs have been in operation since 2010 and have significantly lower usage rates compared to Europe, North America and China. This study sets out to understand and quantify the factors influencing bike share membership in Australia's two bike share programs located in Melbourne and Brisbane. An online survey was administered to members of both programs as well as a group with no known association with bike share. A logistic regression model revealed several significant predictors of membership including reactions to mandatory helmet legislation, riding activity over the previous month, and the degree to which convenience motivated private bike riding. In addition, respondents aged 18-34 and having docking station within 250 m of their workplace were found to be statistically significant predictors of bike share membership. Finally, those with relatively high incomes increased the odds of membership. These results provide insight as to the relative influence of various factors impacting on bike share membership in Australia. The findings may assist bike share operators to maximize membership potential and help achieve the primary goal of bike share - to increase the sustainability of the transport system.

Abiotic and biotic challenges including pests and diseases, low production, climate shocks, poor marketing and market linkages are key challenges to banana production in Kenya. In 2012, a study was conducted in the Maragua division, a transitional banana growing area of Murang'a South District, in Murang'a County to assess the farmers' knowledge and perceptions on banana crop management. Data was collected from interviews with 102 (66.7% men and 33.3% women) randomly selected households and key informants using semi-structured questionnaires and check lists. Data was analyzed using SPSS (statistical package for social scientists) and Microsoft Excel. Farmers ranked banana first in terms of food security and income generation. In all the agro-ecological zones, the crop was allocated the largest (1.1 ha) portion of household land compared to other crops. Lack of adequate information on banana production and management practices (34.5%), high cost of clean planting materials (25.5%), organic fertilizers (17.5%), inaccessibility of manure (18.3%), inadequate quantities of manure (9.1%), high labour in terms of watering and manure application (4.0%) and lack of capital (3.0%) were identified as major reasons for non-adoption of recommended crop production technologies with 7.3% having no tangible results while 1% did not believe in using inorganic fertilizers on their farms. Capacity building addressing all segments of the banana crop value chain including marketing and market linkages is recommended together with government intervention of fertilizer prices for improved crop productivity and crops' benefits to the farmers and the country.","[Gathaara, V.; Mwaniki, S.

However, it did not give rise to the rampant protectionism that followed the Great Crash. The idea that the rise in the fragmentation of production across global value chains - vertical specialization - may be a deterrent against protectionism is underappreciated in the literature. Institutions also played a role in limiting the extent of protectionist responses. World Trade Organization discipline raises the cost of using trade policies for member countries and has proved to be a stable foundation for the open multilateral trading system that has been built over the past 50 years. Using trade and protection data for seven large emerging market countries that have a history of active use of trade policy, the influence of these and other factors on trade policy responses to the 2008 crisis are empirically examined. An instrumental variables strategy is used to identify their impact. Participation in global value chains is found to be a powerful economic factor determining trade policy responses.","[Gawande, Kishore] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, Econ & Govt, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Hoekman, Bernard] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Global Econ Program, Fiesole, Italy; [Cui, Yue] Ernst & Young LLP, London, England",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service; European University Institute,"Gawande, K (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, Econ & Govt, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",kgawande@tamu.edu; bernard.hoekman@eui.eu; yue.cui@ey.com,"Gawande, Kishore/IAQ-7871-2023",,,,,,44,41,44,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This strategy is very simple, the market is entered in the beginning of the period and left at the end. This is not sufficient and does not proof the efficiency of MOGP. We propose a set of different strategies to compare our implementation of MOGP with. It includes random strategy, strategies based on both technical and fundamental approaches and also buy and hold strategy. Such comparison could be done with all MOGP implementations in financial investing. Our implementation of MOGP is generating stock evaluation rules. Those rules are used in an investment strategy, which creates stock portfolios. Not only historical prices and indicators, but also different internet activity data are used as data source for training and evaluation. It's shown that MOGP is able to compete with the selected strategies and outperforms them in most of the cases.","[Jakubeci, Martin; Gregus, Michal] Comenius Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Fac Management, Fac Management CU, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Jakubéci, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Fac Management, Fac Management CU, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia.",Martin.jakubeci@fm.uniba.sk; Michal.gregus@fm.uniba.sk,"GREGUŠ, Michal/JXW-8133-2024","GREGUŠ, Michal/0000-0002-8156-8962",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,644,654,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000062,0

Hemiptera represents the largest group of pest species, which include armored scales, soft scales, whiteflies, aphids, mealybugs and leafhoppers. The remaining pest species are represented by Dipteran, Lepidoptera and mite species. The key pests around which control strategies pivot are Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae), California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii Maskell (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), citrus red mite, Panonychus citri McGregor (Acari: Tetranychidae), and the citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: Gracilariidae). The outbreak of some secondary pests during last years could be interpreted as effects of some pesticides used against these key pests on the natural enemies. In addition, the recent invasion of a new mite species Eutetranychus orientalis Klein (Acari: Tetranychidae), recorded for the first time in 2008, has become a major concern because of rapid spread and huge numbers of generations that often necessitate frequent sprays. The most effective products used are mineral oils and sulphur. Pest management in Moroccan orchards relies primarily on chemical control. However, the implementation of Integrated Pest Management is slowly taking place. Some alternative methods have been developed already by means of research, in order to meet the new requirements of the market regarding fruit quality, environment and health. In this sense, biological control is in progress and alternative methods to chemical control such SIT against Mediterranean fruit fly are underway.","Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Dept Plant Protect, Agadir, Morocco",,"Mazih, A (通讯作者)，Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Dept Plant Protect, Agadir, Morocco.",ahmedmazih@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,15,17,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1097,1103,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600138,0

Compared to the large amplitude of the cycles, the growth rate of the long-term trend is small. The out-of-sample forecasting performance of various competing models is compared to that of a no change random walk forecast. While the random walk forecast tends to be the most accurate at shorter horizons, it is outperformed by the trend-cycle models at horizons longer than one year.

Many crops, including citrus, are bred to a higher level of ploidy in search of desirable traits. In previous works of our group synthetic clementines with different levels of ploidy, specifically haploid, dihaploid and autotetraploid, were generated. This plant material represents a valuable tool for studying the effects of polyploidization at the molecular level since important traits are expressed in different manners. By using a microarray approach, we have accomplished a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome divergence among the newly created clementine lineages with different genome dosage. Differences in expression in the bark tissue of the four lineages were found significant for 89 (haploid-dihaploid comparison) or 93 genes (diploid-tetrapolid comparison).

Information technology (IT) offers tools and resources for providing a knowledge acquisition continuum between them. Academic knowledge can be improved with best practice examples from enterprises, while entrepreneurial staff can keep pace with new academic knowledge within the lifelong learning paradigm. Open knowledge resources publicly available on the web play a pivotal role in this approach. In addition to that, Human language technology (HLT) has developed electronic tools and resources for supporting multilingualism in knowledge acquisition. The purpose of this paper is to offer an approach to quality assurance within a multilingual IT supported learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - Following the 'Case study' methodology, we used an ongoing project, BAEKTEL (Blending academic and entrepreneurial knowledge in technology enhanced learning) as a 'polar type' for the research. The project is aimed at developing a network, and its technology infrastructure, for collecting and sharing open access knowledge assets among various types of institutions, both academic and entrepreneurial, in different countries. For quality assessment of these knowledge assets metrics are needed, often obtained by a set of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), which express the periodic achievement of operational goals of particular activities in quantitative form. Originality/value - We propose a set of KPIs developed within BAEKTEL that can be used for quality assessment of multilingual open knowledge resources development, publishing and use. These KPIs can be modified and reused by other similar projects according to their specific needs. To make this adjustment easier we grouped the KPIs into several categories and discussed briefly each of them. In addition to that, we offer a template to be used as a guideline for KPI representation, including specific rules for their calculation. Practical implications - KPIs offer a framework for efficient and structured assessment and subsequent improvement of open knowledge resources. Using IT to support acquisition of knowledge assets can result in significant overhead cost related to technology infrastructure, staff time and expertise. While being a large cost driver, the latter is also of key importance for quality of IT supported knowledge acquisition. KPIs can be helpful in preventing inadequate resourcing and financial management, which can compromise the quality of knowledge assets within the knowledge acquisition process. They allow for precise assessment of cost drivers to the management as a means for their minimization.","[Obradovic, Ivan; Stankovic, Ranka; Radojicic, Marija] Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Linzalone, Roberto] Univ Basilicata, Dipartimento Matemat Informat & Econ, DIMIE, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Linzalone, Roberto] IKAM Ctr Studi & Ric, Inst Knowledge Asset Management, I-75100 Matera, Italy",University of Belgrade; University of Basilicata,"Obradovic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Dusina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1778,1788,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200137,0

Compared to cultural heritage, the arts fall a grade below in terms of the volume of financial support they receive, particularly from state sources. In this paper I focus on the branch of the arts that encompasses the performing arts, visual arts and crafts, publishing and the periodic press, and that consists of subjects that do not operate for the purpose of profit. This includes both the non-governmental non-profit sector and state and public institutions, most of which operate as contributory organisations. The public budget cuts that have been introduced since 2008 first impacted the non-governmental non-profit sector and then also the sector of contributory organisations. My paper concentrates on the changes to funding in the creative arts affecting this sector and these organisations since 2008, that is, during the period of public sector cuts, which is often linked to crises in the political sphere. These two factors have had an impact on the arts sector and have influenced the search for potential new sources of funding, including the greater role of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, but also foreign sources of financial support. The Czech Statistical Office (CSO), in cooperation with other institutions, has instituted changes since 2008 relating to the collection of data on the culture sector. Therefore, in addition to other available data on funding expenditures on the arts, this paper also analyses the results of the CSO's Culture Account, for which the first data were published for the year 2009 and most recently for the year 2012.","[Petrova, Pavla] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Art Management, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Petrová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Art Management, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",petp01@isis.vse.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,2,13,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1270,1280,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000121,0

Previous studies showed that these companies, though characterized by a higher level of innovation, continue to struggle to survive and grow (Lindholm 1997; Lejpras and Stephan 2009; Balderi et al. 2011). Only recently, the survival of enterprises and their performance have increased qualitatively and quantitatively. Main objective of the present contribution is to identify all possible factors positively influencing performance, and to draw the directions of the performance development. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology used for the analysis of the existing literature is based on the Systematic Review (Cook et al., 1997; Staples and Mahmood; 2007; Abatecola et al. 2011). This approach uses a revision process that allows the analysis of what has been studied and produced in literature so far, introducing a rigorous critical methodology (Tranfield et al., 2003). We use here the database EBSCOhost, and we reviewed a dataset of 108 articles to judge the respect of relevance and quality parameters, using the approach fit for purpose (Boaz et al., 2003). Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on spin-off performance reviews, in particular the capacity of intellectual capital to maximize the value for the enterprise (Kujansivu 2009) and resulting in positive performance. The analysis has led to the identification of 9 variables:(a) Incubation phase and support; (b) Knowledge and competencies; (c) Funding; (d) Geographical location; (e) Network e Partnership; (f) Size; (g) Responsibility and trust; (h) Innovation and novelty; (i) Motivation. Practical implications - This study encourages further investigation on intellectual capital on academic or university spin-off. Also, it provides some guidelines for researchers, organizations and institutions that are willing to invest on or manage innovation and intellectual capital within the enterprise.","[Poponi, Stefano; Ruggieri, Alessandro] Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management DEIM, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University,"Poponi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management DEIM, Via Paradiso 47, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",,"POPONI, Stefano/A-7406-2016","POPONI, Stefano/0000-0001-7574-5320",,,,,63,0,0,1,39,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2121,2131,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200167,0

Technical innovations can reduce yield gaps and increase the productivity of traditional vegetable crops. This paper measures the technical efficiency of farm households that produce traditional vegetables in Tanzania using the Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production function. Data was obtained through a survey of 181 households that cultivated traditional vegetables in five regions (Arusha, Tanga, Morogoro, Dodoma and Dar es Salaam). The results show considerable levels of technical inefficiency in the production of traditional vegetables. Technical efficiency among farm households could be increased by 33% through the better use of available production resources. The test for equality of technical efficiency indicated that there were statistically significant differences in technical efficiency across farm size, with larger landholdings having higher observed values than smallholdings. Strengthening farmer associations to encourage knowledge sharing and enhancing the existing cluster approach to farming may help to improve technical efficiency.","[Rajendran, S.; Afari-Sefa, V.; Kessy, R.

In Tunisia, citrus contributes significantly to the national economy, and increases in the citrus production area are favored by natural conditions and economic considerations. Sour orange, the most widespread rootstock of the Mediterranean area, is also the main one in Tunisia. In addition to sour orange, other citrus rootstocks well adapted to local environmental conditions are traditionally used and should be important genetic resources for breeding. Prior to initiating any breeding program, determining the genetic diversity of Tunisian citrus rootstocks was a priority. Two hundred and one local accessions belonging to four facultative apomictic species (C. aurantium, sour orange; C. sinensis, sweet orange; C. limon, lemon; and C. aurantifolia, lime) were collected and genotyped using 20 nuclear SSR markers and four indel mitochondrial markers. Sixteen distinct multi-locus genotypes (MLGs) were identified and compared to reference genotypes from French and Spanish collections. The differentiation of the four varietal groups was well-marked. Each group displayed a relatively high allelic diversity, primarily due to very high heterozygosity. The Tunisian citrus rootstock genetic diversity is predominantly due to high heterozygosity and differentiation between the four varietal groups. The phenotypic diversity within the varietal groups has resulted from multiple introductions, somatic mutations and rare sexual recombination events. This diversity study enabled the identification of a core sample of accessions for further physiological and agronomical evaluations. These core accessions will be integrated into citrus rootstock breeding programs for the Mediterranean Basin.","[Snoussi-Trifa, Hager] Tunisian Natl Agron Res Inst INRAT, Hort Lab, Tunis, Tunisia; [Duval, Marie France; Perrier, Xavier; Jacquemoud-Collet, Jean Pierre; Ollitrault, Patrick] Int Ctr Agr Res Dev CIRAD, AGAP, TGU, Dept BIOS, Montpellier, France; [Garcia-Lor, Andres; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain",Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Snoussi-Trifa, H (通讯作者)，Tunisian Natl Agron Res Inst INRAT, Hort Lab, Tunis, Tunisia.",hagersnoussi@gmail.com,"Lor, Andres García/B-1246-2016; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023","Lor, Andres García/0000-0002-5625-5470; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517; JACQUEMOUD-COLLET, Jean-Pierre/0000-0001-8754-565X",,,,,24,2,2,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,147,154,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600014,0

The project aim is the development and modernization of agricultural activities in area of eastern Slavonia according to EU standards, and stimulation of development of area through horticultural production. Garden center, apart from production, provides services of planting and decorating the garden, maintains training seminars for potential producers and has an exhibit space. It is expected that the project of garden center would contribute to the development of awareness of the dynamic agriculture and thus improve the standard of production on agricultural holdings by using modern technology in glasshouse production. The center is intended as a place where would be consolidated the expertise of the academic community, led by the Faculty of Agronomy and Agricultural Institute in Osijek on the one hand, and on the other hand the Agricultural Land Agency and the Agricultural Extension Service of the Brod-Posavina County, which would allow center to become a key location for technical and business support for agricultural producers in the broader region.

As it follows from the theory of Maslow, human needs in intangible goods (services) are represented at all levels of the hierarchy of needs: from physiological to spiritual ones. Therefore, the level of the provision of necessary services should be considered as one of the most important indicators of life quality. The results obtained on the basis of this method can be used in the planning of financial obligations of the state to ensure the minimum necessary set of services for certain categories of people.

Reducing aggregate risk is a strict Pareto improvement if relationships in the status quo are assumed to remain constant, but is shown to be particularly harmful for the most risk-averse individuals and to exacerbate inequality when the endogenous network response is taken into account: the least risk-averse individuals abandon their roles as informal insurers in favor of entrepreneurial partnerships.","Duke Univ, Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Wang, XY (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",xy.wang@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank Abhijit Banerjee, Dan Bennett, Arun Chandrasekhar, Esther Duflo, Ben Golub, Rachel Kranton, Rob Townsend, Juan Pablo Xandri, and participants of the World Bank ABCDE and a variety of conferences and seminars for helpful comments.

Biomass production, like any other production processes, involves a number of necessary processes that facilitate subsequent production steps. Those subsidiary processes (e.g. tillage or logistic operations) are connected with consumption of energy. It is therefore important to assure that the sum of energy inputs into those technological steps does not exceed the energy output from the system. Obviously, large energy gain is desired. The paper is devoted to the estimation of energy inputs made into the subsidiary processes occurring in the agricultural subsystems in which various topological structures of plantations as well as for various technologies of tillage, and different requirements for transportation are allowed. Mathematical model describing above mentioned dependencies is derived, and appropriate algorithm elaborated for numerical computations, that have been performed for rapeseed plantations.

When applying comparative valuation techniques analysts usually deem firms from the same industry to be similar and comparable. However, one of the alternative and more objective approaches to selecting comparables is based on a statistical multi-criteria analysis, where those firms are considered comparable which share similar operating and financial features, regardless of their industrial classifications. In our paper we empirically examine the usefulness of taxonomy-based approach in identifying peers for comparative valuation, on the basis of data from the Polish stock market for 2003-2013. We found that in our sample peer-based stock portfolios were unable to beat the portfolios formed on the ground of raw multiples (where no any inter-company differences in fundamentals are taken into consideration).","[Welc, Jacek; Sobczak, Elzbieta] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Welc, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",jacek.welc@ue.wroc.pl; elzbieta.sobczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Sobczak, Elzbieta/K-3590-2018","Sobczak, Elzbieta/0000-0003-1912-7493",,,,,13,0,0,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1784,1793,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000171,0

The result of this search is the implementation of the Cause Related Marketing (CRM) concept, which is associated with the implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR). On the one hand, companies are increasingly aware that the creation of social values significantly contributes to the development of a brand, on the other hand, consumers' interest in corporate social commitment is growing. This article aims at answering the question concerning the factors that determine consumers' attitudes and behaviours towards the CRM. Methods: The research was exploratory in nature. The survey was carried out over the direct method among 342 students from the Rzeszow University of Technology on January 05-31, 2015. Results: Research results show that respondents have a positive perception of companies with the CRM programs. They are aware, however, that companies take such actions based on marketing motives. Consumers are driven by the desire to help others, regardless of their income. They believe that such actions reflect their personality, give them joy, satisfaction and the feeling of pride. The Internet is the primary source of information about such programs. They expect accurate and detailed information about the effects of the implementation of the program. They are not willing to pay higher prices for products associated with the public case, they transfer additional costs to companies. They have a critical attitude towards a brand's failures, disagreeing that a brand can have a good and bad time. Conclusion: The results of the research allow companies to take a critical look at the consequences of the current practice and the development of solutions in the range of the CRM effectiveness. Companies that acquire the skills of reliable and effective communication of their actions for society will gain a competitive advantage in the long term. The survey takes into account a new approach based on a more in-depth analysis of the aspects of consumer perception towards the CRM that facilitates the development of its effectiveness.","[Witek, Lucyna] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Mkt, Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Witek, L (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Mkt, Rzeszow, Poland.",,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,139,145,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400018,0

In vitro studies indicated a direct activity of these salts against Penicillium attacking citrus, however, differences in their effectiveness on various citrus species were observed in in vivo trials, suggesting other modes of action. In this study, changes in enzymatic activity and gene expression level of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in 'Valencia late' sweet oranges treated with Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 (3% w/v) were investigated. Both salts proved to increase PAL activity in orange tissues, upregulation being confirmed by transcriptomic analyses, particularly at 12 h after treatment. Thus, although other pathways cannot be excluded, the defense response induced by Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 in citrus fruit seems to be associated with the phenylpropanoid pathway, which has a role in the adaptation process to various stresses. This response could enhance the citrus natural reaction to wounding and pathogen attack, improving its protective effect. Thus induced resistance should be considered as one of the possible mechanisms of salts in controlling postharvest citrus decay.","[Youssef, Khamis] Plant Pathol Res Inst, Agr Res Ctr, Giza, Egypt; [Sanzani, Simona M.; Ligorio, Angela; Fallanaj, Frida; Nigro, Franco; Ippolito, Antonio] Univ Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Suolo Pianta & Alimenti, Bari, Italy",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Agricultural Research Center - Egypt; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Youssef, K (通讯作者)，Plant Pathol Res Inst, Agr Res Ctr, Giza, Egypt.",youssefeladawy@agr.uniba.it; simonamarianna.anzani@uniba.it,"Sanzani, Simona Marianna/B-9233-2019; Youssef, Khamis/D-8693-2013; SANZANI, Simona Marianna/AAE-2175-2022; Nigro, Franco/J-1499-2012","Youssef, Khamis/0000-0002-0089-1750; SANZANI, Simona Marianna/0000-0002-1631-638X; Nigro, Franco/0000-0002-8273-0052",,,,,18,3,3,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1627,1632,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600208,0

The aim of the study was to detect and quantify colonization by molds in samples of grain and grain dust collected during combine threshing, as well as in soil samples from organic and conventional cultivation systems in south - east Poland. The following were used for the study: 20 samples of rye, wheat and barley grain, 20 samples of every grain dust collected during combine threshing and 20 samples of soil for every cereal were collected from an organic cultivation system. The same number of corresponding samples from a conventional system of farming was also obtained. The concentrations (CFU/g) of molds were determined applying the method of plate dilution on two media, and the species composition of molds was determined using taxonomic keys and atlases. The results show a potential risk for people engaged in agriculture. The presence of allergenic and toxigenic molds in the work environment of this working group creates serious occupational exposure.

We first show that average height varies significantly according to location, from 148.3 cm in Guatemala to 158.8 cm in Haiti. The evolution of heights over these decades behaves like indicators of human development, showing a steady increase of 2.6 cm from the 1950s to the 1990s. Such gains compare favorably to other developing regions of the world, but not so much with recently developed countries. Height gains were not evenly distributed in the region, however. Countries that achieved.higher levels of income, such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, gained on average 0.9 cm per decade, while countries with shrinking economies, such as Haiti and Guatemala, only gained 0.25 cm per decade.

We employ a macro-based asset pricing model to compare HPP method and value function iteration (VFI) method based on the same reasonable calibrations. This DSGE asset pricing model in the paper incorporates nonlinearities in both household preferences and firm production technologies. Additionally, the market for debt introduces its own type of nonlinearity; leverage can force a nonlinear wedge between asset rates. In the paper, we first show how to apply the HPP method and then assess its accuracy and speed compared with the old VFI method. Accuracy of solutions is demonstrated by comparing standard deviations of the logged values of first order conditions errors of important financial assets. Speed of the solution methods is shown by comparing the computational time. By comparing the results from applying the same DSGE asset pricing model to the competing methods, we find that the HPP method is not only feasible but also robust to the extreme nonlinearities in the asset pricing model.","[Chen, Yuanyuan] Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, One John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV 25755 USA; [Fowler, Stuart] Econ & Finance Dept, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",Marshall University,"Chen, YY (通讯作者)，Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, One John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV 25755 USA.",chenyu@marshall.edu; stuart.fowler@mtsu.edu,"Chen, Yuanyuan/GXG-2130-2022",,,,,,20,0,0,3,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Empirical results show that due to high level of concentration, large banks hold the capacity to impose higher prices, particularly on advances, and enjoy significant market power. Indian banks, particularly Indian private and foreign banks, are operating below their efficient scale and cost savings can be obtained by increasing their size of operations. The impact of financial deregulation led to a decline in average markup of banks initially, but this trend got reversed in 2002. The increasing trend of market power is mostly determined by bank size. Large banks enjoy greater market power due to either cost advantages or to their capacity to impose higher prices. Lower marginal cost and higher return of the so-called efficient structure have helped the large banks to maintain higher efficiency level. Finally, higher market power was also reflected in higher profit.","[Das, Abhiman] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13901 USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Das, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",abhiman@iimahd.ernet.in; kkar@binghamton.edu,,,,,,,45,15,16,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The 2050 Swiss energy strategy envisages 30-75% introduction of electric cars by 2050, which is designed to support the goal of decarbonising the energy sector. While the Swiss government has decided to phase out nuclear electricity, deployment of electric cars can affect electricity supply and emission trajectories. Therefore, potential interactions between the electricity and transport sectors must be considered in assessing the future role of electric mobility. We analyse a set of scenarios using the Swiss TIMES energy system model with high temporal resolution. We generate insights into cross-sectoral trade-offs between electricity supply and electrification/decarbonisa tion of car fleets. E-mobility supports decarbonisation of car fleet even if electricity is supplied from large gas power plants or relatively low cost sources of imported electricity. However, domestic renewable based electricity generation is expected to be too limited to support e-mobility. Stringent abatement targets without centralised gas power plants render e-mobility less attractive, with natural gas hybrids becoming cost effective. Thus the cost effectiveness of electric mobility depends on policy decisions in the electricity sector. The substitution of fossil fuels with electricity in transport has the potential to reduce revenues from fuel taxation. Therefore it is necessary to ensure consistency between electricity sector and transport energy policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years their popularity has soared. This study examined Brisbane's CityCycle scheme, the largest PBSP in Australia, and investigated the role of (natural and built) environmental features on usage. The study addressed four research questions: (1) What are the dynamics of PBSP use in terms of travel time, speed, and distance? (2) What is the relationship between PBSP participation and cycling infrastructure? (3) How does land-use affect PBSP usage? (4) How does topography affect PBSP usage? To answer these four questions, the authors analysed large existing datasets on CityCycle usage, land-use, topography, and cycling infrastructure, which were each obtained through multiple sources. Correlation and regression analysis were employed to establish significant relationships amongst variables. It was found that: most users take short trips within the free initial period provided under the CityCycle scheme and do not incur any charges other than for membership; PBSP use is strongly correlated with the length of off-road bikeways near each CityCycle station; CityCycle is more frequently used on weekends for recreational purposes; loop journeys, which are also associated with leisure trips, are popular in Brisbane, especially on weekends; leisure trips are taken at a relatively slower pace than utilitarian trips; during weekdays, a trimodal peak is clearly evident, with PBSP commute trips in the morning and evening peaks and a smaller but significant peak around lunchtime; and users avoid returning CityCycle bicycles to stations located on hilltops. These findings can collectively enhance both the siting and design of PBSP, thereby optimizing investments in sustainable mobility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to including many of the well-recognized endogenous factors mentioned in the literature as obesity determinants, we also model the individual's residential location as a choice variable, which is the main contribution of this paper to the literature. This allows us to control for an individual's self-selection into communities that possess the types of amenities in the built environment, which in turn affect their obesity-related behaviors such as physical activity (PA) and fast food consumption. We specify reduced form equations for a set of endogenous demand decisions, together with an obesity structural equation. The whole system of equations is jointly estimated by a semi-parametric full information log-likelihood method that allows for a general pattern of correlation in the errors across equations. Our model predicts a reduction in adult obesity of 7 percentage points as a result of a continued high level PA from adolescence into adulthood; a reduction of 0.7 (3) percentage points in adult obesity as a result of one standard deviation reduction in weeldy fast food consumption for women (men); and a reduction of 0.02 (0.05) in adult obesity as a result of one standard deviation change in several neighborhood amenities for women (men). Another key finding is that controlling for residential self-selection has substantive implications. To our knowledge, this has not been yet documented within a full information maximum likelihood framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I consider the success of weight loss efforts among a group of highly motivated people: those required to lose weight in order to qualify for a life-saving kidney transplantation. Out of 246 transplantation centers, I identified 156 (63%) with explicit body mass index (BMI) requirements for transplantation, ranging from 30 to 50 kg/m(2). Using the United States national registry of transplant candidates, I examine outcomes for 29,608 obese deceased-donor transplant recipients between 1990 and 2010. I use valueadded models to deal with potential endogeneity of center choice, in addition to correcting for sample selection bias arising from focusing on transplant recipients. Outcome variables measure BMI level and weight change (in BMI) between initial listing and transplantation. I hypothesize that those requiring weight loss to qualify for kidney transplantation will be most likely to lose weight. I find that the probability of severe and morbid obesity (BMI >= 35 kg/m(2)) decreases by 4 percentage points and the probability of patients achieving any weight loss increases by 22 percentage points at centers with explicit BMI eligibility criteria. Patients are also 13 percentage points more likely to accomplish clinically relevant weight loss of at least 5% of baseline BMI by transplantation at these centers. Nonetheless, I estimate an average decrease in BMI of only 1.7 kg/m(2) for those registered at centers with BMI requirements. Further analyses suggest stronger intervention effects for patients whose BMI at listing exceeds thresholds as the distance from their BMI to the thresholds increases. Even under circumstances with great potential returns for weight loss, transplant candidates exhibit modest weight-loss. This suggests that, even in high-stakes environments, weight loss remains a challenge for the obese, and altering individual incentives may not be sufficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of field research in eight European countries and with reference to theories of liberalization and dualization, the factors that drive precarious work in discrete European labour markets are thus investigated. It is discovered that, while a structural-demographic factor such as non-compliance with labour law is a notable progenitor of precarious work, the deregulatory strategies of public authorities are particularly significant drivers. In conclusion it is asserted that although the theory of dualization helps explain developments in conservative-corporatist countries, in Anglophone and Mediterranean countries liberalization theory is generally more apposite.

Our objective is to show that time series and structural approaches are not irreconcilable. Specifically, we show that time series properties can be informative for modeling habits in a structural demand system model. Using non-alcoholic beverage expenditure data from the UK, we empirically show that unit roots results can help to model habits in a structural demand system. Habits are a relevant determinant to understanding food expenditure and to quantifying the impact of interventions from the private (e.g., advertising campaigns) and public (e.g., food taxes) sectors. We find that the seasonal-habit QUAIDS outperforms the static and myopic-habit specifications. We also show that taking seasonal habits into account helps to control for autocorrelation in error terms. Therefore, time series properties such as unit roots can help to understand the underlying patterns in the residuals beyond correcting for autocorrelation.","[Silva, Andres] French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, UR Food & Social Sci Res Unit ALISS 1303, 65 Blvd Brandebourg, F-94205 Ivry, France; [Dharmasena, Senarath] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Silva, Andres] Univ Cent Chile, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Lord Cochrane 417,Torre A,Third Floor, Santiago, Chile",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Universidad Central de Chile,"Silva, A (通讯作者)，French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, UR Food & Social Sci Res Unit ALISS 1303, 65 Blvd Brandebourg, F-94205 Ivry, France.;Silva, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Chile, Dept Econ & Management Sci, Lord Cochrane 417,Torre A,Third Floor, Santiago, Chile.",asilvam@uc.cl; sdharmasena@tamu.edu,,"Silva Montes, Andres/0000-0002-4816-2821",,,,,60,0,0,0,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It is however unknown to which extent the share of the existing transport modes will change as result of AVs introduction as another public transport option. This study is the first where detailed traveller preferences for AVs are explored and compared to existing modes. Its main objective is to position AVs in the transportation market and understand the sensitivity of travellers towards some of their attributes, focusing particularly on the use of these vehicles as egress mode of train trips. Because fully-automated vehicles are not yet a reality and they entail a potentially high disruptive way on how we use automobiles today, we apply a stated preference experiment where the role of attitudes in perceiving the utility of AVs is particularly explored in addition to the classical instrumental variables and several socio-economic variables. The estimated discrete choice model shows that first class train travellers on average prefer the use of AVs as egress mode, compared to the use of bicycle or bus/tram/metro as egress. We therefore conclude that AVs as last mile transport between the train station and the final destination have most potential for first class train travellers. Results show that in-vehicle time in AVs is experienced more negatively than in-vehicle time in manually driven cars. This suggests that travellers do not perceive the theoretical advantage of being able to perform other tasks during the trip in an automated vehicle, at least not yet. Results also show that travellers' attitudes regarding trust and sustainability of AVs are playing an important role in AVs attractiveness, which leads to uncertainty on how people will react when AVs are introduced in practice. We therefore state the importance of paying sufficient attention to these psychological factors, next to classic instrumental attributes like travel time and costs, before and during the implementation process of AVs as a public transport alternative. We recommend the extension of this research to revealed preference studies, thereby using the results of field studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Applying for the first time a recently developed stochastic meta-frontier framework to the banking sector, this study finds that Indian banks are the most cost-efficient, followed by Chinese banks and Vietnamese banks. Indian banks are also more innovative in reducing the operating costs compared to Chinese and Vietnamese banks. Using the Lerner index, the banking markets of India and Vietnam are found to be more competitive than that of China. The relationship between competition and cost-reducing innovation follows an inverse U-shape curve, which is consistent with the literature. This study also finds that the optimal Lerner index to achieve the greatest innovation in reducing operating costs is 55 %. Based on the results of the Lerner index, this study recommends that to improve cost-reducing innovation, policy makers should promote bank competition in all the three countries, but to a greater extent in China than in Vietnam and India.","[Thanh Pham Thien Nguyen] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Son Hong Nghiem] Queensland Univ Technol, IHBI, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia; [Thanh Pham Thien Nguyen; Roca, Eduardo; Sharma, Parmendra] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Griffith University,"Nguyen, TPT (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Nguyen, TPT (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",thanh.nguyen8@griffithuni.edu.au; h.nghiem@uq.edu.au; e.roca@griffith.edu.au; p.sharma@griffith.edu.au,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Nguyen, Thanh/W-1463-2019; Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/C-7405-2015; Nghiem, Hong Son/F-6263-2010","Nguyen, Thanh/0000-0002-7348-1381; Nguyen, Thanh Pham Thien/0000-0002-5228-1866; Nghiem, Hong Son/0000-0002-2451-5290",,,,,53,17,18,1,56,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The effects of such devices need to be examined in terms of capacity and safety. This paper examines the case study. of the Italian motorway A22, which is supposed to be equipped with an HSR system implemented along 128 km in order to reduce congestion with consequent improvement in levels of service (LOS). We studied the traffic processes (capacity, flow distribution between lanes, reliability, etc.) and estimated the expected capacity and safety conditions. These latter were studied with the method provided by the Highway Safety Manual (HSM), as well as by undertaking sensitivity analyses to quantify the expected changes in crash frequency at varying HSR activation hours (from 30 to 200 h) in a year. It has been observed that HSR activation does not involve significant variations in the general safety conditions in the presence of a considerable capacity increase up to 35%. Moreover, have been identified the cases which require speed limit implementation (with VSLs system) in function of the values of reliability phi and velocity process (V) over bar, and also suggested a speed limit sign system.

Consequently its aviation industry, which is dominated by the national carrier SriLankan Airlines, faced growing and difficult challenges. However, since 2009 the country has witnessed a boom in tourism, while an unprofitable SriLankan Airlines changed its financial and strategic circumstances by becoming a member of the Oneworld alliance in mid-2014, driven by its regional geography and proximity to India which had strict bilateral traffic rights for international incumbents from the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. This study analyses tourism, economic and passenger data combined with results from a passenger survey and expert interviews in order to identify the critical issues and future prospects of aviation and tourism in Sri Lanka. The authors conclude that its ageing long-haul fleet, together with an inferior economy-class product along with high fuel prices, capacity constraints and poor management practices are the major issues faced by SriLankan Airlines. On the tourism side, uncompetitive hotel rates, unnecessarily high government taxes, visa charges and the lack of international promotion were seen as the principle drawbacks. A survey at Colombo airport revealed that fare is the principle rhetoric for passengers taking SriLankan Airlines, but when they want a wider range of additional and superior attributes they choose foreign carriers.","[Nagahawatte, Lasitha] Saffron Aviat Pvt Ltd, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [O'Connell, John F.] Ctr Air Transport Management, Martell House, Cranfield MK43 OTR, Beds, England",,"O'Connell, JF (通讯作者)，Ctr Air Transport Management, Martell House, Cranfield MK43 OTR, Beds, England.",frankie.oconnell@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,17,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A key objective of this work was to advance the discussion about the theoretical constructs that are most applicable in the study of behaviour change associated with disruptive events, which was done through the application and critical evaluation of the Transtheoretical Model. The insights from the stages of change element of the model were relatively limited but the analysis shows significant differences in the underlying factors explaining change according to the type of change made (reduce, re-time, re-mode and re-route). Whilst the-long-term behavioural impacts of events like the Games appear small, the study has uncovered a need to consider these behavioural choices as distinct rather than under the collective term of travel behaviour change, as is current practice.

We use a large scale survey from 2005 to 2011 to analyze the association between changes in local economic conditions and drug consumption among individuals aged 15-64. Although Spain was one of the countries hardest hit by the economic downturn, the crisis was unevenly felt across the country. Therefore, we exploit this difference in unemployment rates across provinces to identify the effects of business cycle variations on the consumption of legal and illegal drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to find a relation between the deterioration of local economic conditions and a strong increase in the consumption of marihuana and cocaine. We also report a decrease in alcohol consumption but a significant escalation in abusive smoking behavior (smoking every day). We believe that these findings are important not only for the potential negative implications at the individual level but also for the costs to society as a whole. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our method highlights the crucial importance of non-price competitiveness in assessing emerging countries' performance on external markets, as well as notable differences in non-price competitiveness dynamics across exporters. China shows a huge gain in international competitiveness due to non-price factors, while the role of the exchange rate in explaining China's competitive position may have been overstressed. Similarly, Brazil, India and Turkey show discernible improvements in their competitive position when accounting for non-price factors. Oil exports account for strong improvement in Russia's non-price competitiveness, as well as losses of competitiveness for Indonesia.

Recently, urban road pricing and regional distance charging have gained momentum, increasing opportunities for future decentralized decision-making. However, whether leaving road pricing decisions to regional authorities is a good idea is not a priori clear. Previous political economy models have suggested that in the large majority of cases decentralization yields higher welfare than federal pricing decisions. In this paper, we extend a political economy model of a two-region federation to show that this conclusion does not hold once we allow for commonly observed institutional constraints on federal decision making. We show that requiring user prices to be uniform across regions greatly improves the efficiency of centralized decision making. The same holds when federal decisions are the result of a legislative bargaining process among elected regional representatives. Under these institutional constraints, federal decisions may easily outperform decentralization, even when the opposite would hold in the absence of the constraints. The model also explains under what conditions such constraints will automatically be embedded in the federal constitution. Specifically, if regions are symmetric and drivers have a majority in both regions, they will voluntarily transfer power to the federal level, provided the relevant policy restrictions (uniform pricing or legislative bargaining) are constitutionally imposed. However, if drivers have a majority in one region only, the region where non-users have a majority will never agree to transfer decision power to the federal level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It relaxes the assumption of symmetric bidders. The land values have common value and private value components. We find that the sealed-bid first price auction introduces competition in the real estate development market. The open English auction leads a monopoly market.

Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.

This highly persistent, infinite variance, but still mean reverting, behavior is commonly found with nonparametric estimates of the fractional differencing parameter, d, for financial volatility. In this paper, a fully parametric Bayesian estimator, robust to nonstationarity, is designed for the fractionally integrated, autoregressive, stochastic volatility (SV-FIAR) model. Joint estimates of the autoregressive and fractional differencing parameters of volatility are found via a Bayesian, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. Like [Jensen, M. J. 2004. Semiparametric Bayesian Inference of Long-memory Stochastic Volatility. Journal of Time Series Analysis 25: 895-922.], this MCMC algorithm relies on the wavelet representation of the log-squared return series. Unlike the Fourier transform, where a time series must be a stationary process to have a spectral density function, wavelets can represent both stationary and nonstationary processes. As long as the wavelet has a sufficient number of vanishing moments, this paper's MCMC sampler will be robust to nonstationary volatility and capable of generating the posterior distribution of the autoregressive and long-memory parameters of the SV-FIAR model regardless of the value of d. Using simulated and empirical stock market return data, we find our Bayesian estimator producing reliable point estimates of the autoregressive and fractional differencing parameters with reasonable Bayesian confidence intervals for either stationary or nonstationary SV-FIAR models.","[Jensen, Mark J.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Jensen, MJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",mark.jensen@atl.frb.org,"Jensen, Mark/N-7285-2018",,,,,,57,3,3,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Short-term stress is a powerful motivator of smoking, and the decision to smoke could trigger biological feedback that immediately reduces short-term stress. We use data on self-reported smoking and stress from 240,388 current and former smokers. We instrument short-term stress with temporal distance from September 11, 2001 (using date of interview). We instrument smoking with cigarette accessibility measures of cigarette price changes and distance to state borders. In the absence of accounting for endogeneity, we find that smoking is associated with increases in short-term stress.

Regulation is considered because a monopolistic operator is assumed. A social welfare maximization model is proposed, subject to individual rationality and vehicle capacity constraints. Optimality conditions are provided and a key formula is derived about CF's role in balancing the need to cover the fixed operation cost through fares on the operator's side and the effort to maintain the user surplus on the passengers' side. Major findings from this model's formulation include: (1) CF determines the extent to which the passengers' surplus is compromised in order to cover the fixed part of the operating cost, and (2) subsidy is unjustified when CF exceeds the critical shadow price of the financial constraint.

The article outlines and utilizes the concept of the competition state' to help frame and comprehend the UK Government's approach to negotiating and shaping the Directive. Using archival, secondary and primary research, the article shows how the state continues to exercise important choices nationally and internationally which, in turn, have profound implications for the operation of labour markets. The article shows how, despite a veneer of fairness, the state has developed a regulatory instrument which provides uneven protection for workers, favours the actions of employers, promotes further flexibility in the use of temporary labour contracts and, by taking advantage of compromises at the European level, creates further market-making opportunities for well-established large agencies in the sector.","[Forde, Chris] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, CERIC, Employment Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Slater, Gary] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Forde, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, CERIC, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",cjf@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,"Slater, Gary/ACB-1161-2022; Slater, Gary/Y-4239-2019","Slater, Gary/0000-0003-0895-7117; Slater, Gary/0000-0003-0895-7117; Forde, Chris/0000-0001-9518-7151",ACAS,ACAS,"The primary research for this project was funded by two small grants by ACAS in 2009 and 2012, under their research partnership scheme.",,37,23,25,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The optimization model assumes that there is a homogenous collection of users whose behavior can be described as utility maximizers and for which their utility function is driven by monetary costs. These monetary costs are assumed to be the tolls in place, the per mile cost to drive, and the value of their time. We assume that there is a system owner who sets the toll prices, collects the proceeds from the tolls, and invests those funds in transit system improvements in the form of headway reductions. This yields a bi-level optimization model which we solve using an iterative procedure that is an integration of a genetic algorithm and the Frank-Wolfe method. The method and solution procedure is applied to an illustrative example.

As a result, the legislature is far more constrained in its activities than is the case in other constitutional orders. Yet the Treaties are indeterminate, and it is the Court of Justice which interprets and delimits them, and instructs the legislature on how and to what extent it may pursue them. There is, in substance, a principal-agent relationship between the Court and the EU legislature, enforceable by the Court's capacity to annul legislation contrary to its preferences. An examination of internal market legislation shows that indeed it consists of codification of prior case law. The judicial constraints on the EU legislature are sufficiently tight that the legislature is more akin to a subordinate implementing regulator than to an autonomous political policy-maker.","[Davies, Gareth] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Davies, G (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",g.t.davies@vu.nl,,"davies, gareth/0000-0002-9907-7758",,,,,62,34,35,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

They seek to secure concessions both formally by scrutinizing transatlantic international agreements, such as TTIP, as well as informally by exposing injustices and diplomatic misconduct through human rights advocacy and institutional pressure, such as in the cases of the NSA surveillance and CIA renditions.

In line with the research aim and the underlying dynamism of organizational learning theory, these hypotheses are tested using a dynamic Bayesian model.

This result is robust to strong persistence in debt ratio, which may cause finite sample bias in estimation and inference. In the nonlinear framework, we find only weak support for piece-wise linear models that explicitly incorporate the idea of a debt tipping point. The threshold estimates from such models are subject to a high level of uncertainty and are sensitive to assumptions on minimum number of observations in each regime. However, using a flexible semiparametric model we uncover that the predictive function is highly complex and behaves quite differently at low, intermediate and high levels of debt. Of particular interest to the recent debate on effects of higher public indebtedness on growth, we find that average annual GDP growth gradually declines by about 0.5% as debt ratio climbs from about 75% to 100%, with most of the effect taking place over the 85-95% range.","[Yoldas, Emre] Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Baglan, Deniz] Howard Univ, Dept Econ, 2400 Sixth St NW, Washington, DC 20059 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Howard University,"Yoldas, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, 20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",Emre.Yoldas@frb.gov,,"Yoldas, Emre/0000-0002-9924-7905",,,,,22,5,5,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The results show that Zipf's law captures key characteristics of the rank-size distribution of tourist flows to China's cities. There are large differences between the inbound and domestic tourist flows not only for the top 100 but also for all cities. Three types of Zipf's law are found to apply to China's subregions. At the individual city level, most rank changes of the top 100 inbound and domestic tourist arrival cities appear in the lower part of the rank. The average rank shift distances of the top 100 inbound and domestic tourist arrival cities are 6.122 and 6.006, respectively. The dynamics of the rank-size distribution of domestic tourist flows to the top 100 cities are more stable than those of inbound tourist flows.","[Guo, Yongrui] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Honglei] Nanjing Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangsu Normal University; Nanjing University,"Guo, YR (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Hist Culture & Tourism, 101 Shanghai Rd, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",guoyongrui58@163.com,"Zhang, Honglei/AAT-3879-2021","Zhang, Honglei/0000-0003-0609-6050","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41501147, 41171121, 41301134]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41501147, 41171121, 41301134).",,38,6,8,3,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Beck et al. (J Financ Stab 10:50-64, 2014) criticize this literature for only focusing on intermediation activities of financial systems, even though financial sectors in advanced countries have extended their scope beyond traditional tasks. In line with this argument, Beck et al. find for a panel of high-income countries that financial sector size and non-intermediation activity stimulate growth, while intermediation activity has no effect. However, they focus only on OLS regressions with a very limited number of control variables. We test for the robustness of these results. Our findings show that they depend on outliers and are not robust against alternative specifications or estimation approaches. Further, a big financial sector and too many non-intermediation activities are found to reduce growth in some specifications. Our results suggest that Beck et al.'s criticism of the too much finance literature is grounded on thin empirical evidence.","[Sturn, Simon] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Sturn, Simon; Zwickl, Klara] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Inst Ecol Econ, Vienna, Austria",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Sturn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Sturn, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Inst Ecol Econ, Vienna, Austria.",s.sturn@econs.umass.edu; klara.zwickl@wu.ac.at,"Sturn, Simon/IVV-7268-2023","Zwickl, Klara/0000-0002-2936-695X",Oesterreichische Nationalbank Anniversary Fund [15330],Oesterreichische Nationalbank Anniversary Fund,"We thank Jesus Crespo Cuaresma for very helpful econometric suggestions, and Thorsten Beck for generously sharing his data.

In one-on-one matching, core allocations are stable in the sense that no pair of unmatched or otherwise matched players can improve their incomes by forming a match. Because of incomplete information and bounded rationality, it is difficult to adopt a core allocation immediately. Theoretical investigations cope with the problem of whether core allocations can be adopted in a stochastic process with repeated re-matching. In this paper, we investigate sequences of matching with data from an experimental 2x2 labor market with wage negotiations. This market has seven possible matching structures (states) and is additionally characterized by the negotiated wages and profits. First, we describe the stochastic process of transitions from one state to another including the average transition times. Second, we identify different influences on the process parameters as, for example, the difference of incomes in a match. Third, allocations in the core should be completely durable or at least more durable than comparable out-of-core allocations, but they are not. Final bargaining results (induced by a time limit) appear as snapshots of a stochastic process without absorbing states and with only weak systematic influences.","[Bolle, Friedel; Otto, Philipp E.] European Univ Viadrina, Microecon Dept, Grosse Scharrnstr 59, D-15230 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Otto, PE (通讯作者)，European Univ Viadrina, Microecon Dept, Grosse Scharrnstr 59, D-15230 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany.",otto@europa-uni.de,"Otto, Philipp/AAA-8453-2020","Otto, Philipp/0000-0001-8630-108X",German Science Foundation [DFG: BO 747/11],German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Wolfgang Schmid for helpful advice concerning methodological issues.

I adopted a difference-in-differences approach and found the following: (1) for the cohort aged 5-7 years in 2010, the BMI z-score and obesity rates in disaster-affected areas were higher than in other areas, although this was not observed for the other cohorts; (2) for the cohort aged 5-7 years in 2010, the influence of the accident persisted even after 3 years; and (3) the differences in the BMI z-score and obesity rate before and after the accident were greater for Fukushima Prefecture than for the other affected areas (Iwate and Miyagi prefectures). I infer that health conscious parents, whose children had lower BMIs, may have moved from Fukushima, thereby increasing the BMI z-score of the child population living in Fukushima by around 0.05 for the cohort aged 5-7 years. The enforced reduction in physical activity increased the BMI z-score of children living in Fukushima by around 0.19 for that cohort. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By better anticipating future conditions, online predictions can reduce perceived and actual passenger travel times as well as facilitate more proactive decision making by service providers. Even though considerable research efforts were devoted to the development of computationally expensive bus arrival prediction schemes, real-world real-time information (RTI) systems are typically based on very simple prediction rules. This paper narrows down the gap between the state-of-the-art and the state-of the -practice in generating RTI for public transport systems by evaluating the added-value of schemes that integrate instantaneous data and dwell time predictions. The evaluation considers static information and a commonly deployed scheme as a benchmark. The RTI generation algorithms were applied and analyzed for a trunk bus network in Stockholm, Sweden. The schemes are assessed and compared based on their accuracy, reliability, robustness and potential waiting time savings. The impact of RTI on passengers waiting times are compared with those attained by service frequency and regularity improvements. A method which incorporates information on downstream travel conditions outperforms the commonly deployed scheme, leading to a 25% reduction in the mean absolute error. Furthermore, the incorporation of instantaneous travel times improves the prediction accuracy and reliability, and contributes to more robust predictions. The potential waiting time gains associated with the prediction scheme are equivalent to the gains expected when introducing a 60% increase in service frequency, and are not attainable by service regularity improvements.

The influence of a cognitive analysis on the zero-price effect is also analyzed. The data used for the analysis stem from a stated preference survey with a sample of approximately 670 respondents that was conducted in Flanders, Belgium. The data are analyzed using a mixed logit model. The modeling results yield findings that confirm the existence of a zero-price effect in transport, which is in line with the literature. This zero-price effect is increased by the forced cognitive analysis for shopping trips, although not for work/school or recreational trips. The results also demonstrate the importance of the current mode choice in hypothetical mode choices and the importance of car availability. The influence of changing relative prices on the modal shift is found to be insignificant. This might be partially because the price differences were too small to matter. Hence, an increase in public transport use can be facilitated by the introduction of free public transport, particularly when individuals evaluate the different alternatives in a more cognitive manner. These findings should be useful to policy makers evaluating free public transport and considering how best to target and promote relevant policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
