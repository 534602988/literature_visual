Block A - normal precipitation mode, Block B - reduced precipitation mode consisting in roofing of 50% of the experimental area coverage by a special film with a minimum reduction of light conditions in order to drain a half of rainfall out of the area. In the crop year 2011 the annual total Rainfall was relatively lower by 14.0% (632.8 mm) than the long-term average, i.e. 736 mm. The species with the highest ability to create fodder of Dactylis glomerata significantly decreased fodder production and formation of above-ground shoots due to reduced precipitation in meadow utilization.

Parents, friends and society do not affect young Vietnamese consumer's purchase intention. There are some limitations in this research: the sample was limited in Vietnam and may not represent the whole population of ecological fashion consumers. The Vietnamese consumers become more and more concerned about environment, especially young people. Therefore, the green consumption will continue to grow. Nowadays, the young Vietnamese generation are free to make decision on shopping. Therefore, the enterprises need to design the products to attract young consumers as well as plan more effective business plan targeting at young consumers.

Here, we draw from positive organizational behavior to investigate the processes by which authentic leaders exert their influence on followers' knowledge sharing intention, especially the mediating effect of employees' psychological capital. In this article, we conducted an empirical test through 179 questionnaires from each industry employees. The results showed that: authentic leadership is positively correlated to employees' psychological capital and willingness to share knowledge. Moreover, psychological capital is found fully mediating the relationship between authentic leadership and employees' willingness of knowledge sharing. Limitations, theoretical and practical implications conclude the article.","[Zhu Qing-song; Feng Yu-meng] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Zhu, QS (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71072065],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(71072065),,38,0,0,0,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1099,1106,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600146,0

Recent policy factors have resulted in narrower provider networks. We provide plausibly causal evidence on the effect of narrow network plans offered by a large national health insurance carrier in a major metropolitan market. Our econometric design exploits the fact that some firms offer a narrow network plan to their employees and some do not. Our results show that narrow network health plans lead to reductions in health care utilization and spending. We find evidence that narrow networks save money by selecting lower cost providers into the network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper indicates that the possibility of advantageous redistribution strongly depends on the three countries' taste patterns, endowment distributions, and the elasticity of substitution. In particular, we will show with specific examples that greater difference between the donor and recipient's taste patterns and a lower elasticity of substitution can increase the chance of advantageous redistribution.

This construction is used to (i) show Rader's and Debreu's theorems in a fast and transparent way, (ii) refine these results for Cauchy and uniformly continuous preferences on a metric space X, (iii) extend such preferences from X to any larger metric domain Y superset of X, while preserving Cauchy and uniform continuity respectively. By contrast, regular continuity does not guarantee that continuous preference extensions should exist even in standard decision theoretic frameworks. For example, continuous preferences over simple lotteries or finite menus need not have continuous extensions to Borel distributions or compact menus respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, however, I show that the expectation of the maximum can be decomposed as a linear combination of multivariate normal CDFs. For related distributions, such as the multivariate t-distribution, this expectation has a similar decomposition. My computational results show speed benefits of my proposed method for models with a low number of choices, although the speed gains are contingent on the use of analytical derivatives as opposed to numerical derivatives.

Although physicians play a central role in determining the performance of a healthcare system, identifying their impacts are difficult because physician supply is endogenously determined. We circumvent the problem by exploiting an exogenous shock to physician supply created by the introduction of a new residency program - our natural experiment. Based on panel data covering all physicians in Japan, we find that the introduction of a new residency program substantially decreased the supply of physicians in some rural markets where local hospitals had relied on university hospitals for filling physician positions. We also find that physician market wages increased in the affected markets relative to less affected markets. Finally, we find that this change in physician market wages forced hospitals to exit affected markets and negatively affected patient health outcomes in those markets. These effects may be exacerbated by the fact that the healthcare market was rigidly price-regulated.

Several interferon free regimens are awaiting regulatory approval. These innovations promise substantial reductions in the burden of disease and side effects as well as a decrease in treatment duration. Objectives: The aim of this quantitaitive study was to elicit patient preferences for attributes of innovative antiviral therapies for hepatitis C. Methods: A systematic literature search and 14 semi-structured interviews were performed, resulting in eight patient-relevant characteristics. For the discrete choice experiment, an experimental design (3x3 + 5x6) was generated using Ngene software. The survey was conducted in August 2014 through computer-assisted personal interviews. The data were effects-coded in a random parameter logit estimation. Results: Participants were patients with HCV (N = 561; 58.1% men) in different treatment states. The analysis revealed a predominance of the attribute reaching sustained virological response. When considering confidence intervals, the results showed three different preference ranks. At first place was sustained virological response (level difference [LD] 3.98), second was anemia (LD 1.10), followed by number of interferon injections (LD 0.92), rash (LD 0.82), nausea and/or diarrhea (LD 0.79), and duration of antiviral therapy (LD 0.78). The last position was occupied by both tiredness/fatigue (LD 0.31) and headache (LD 0.34). Conclusions: From the patients' point of view, sustained virological response is the most essential criterion for choosing an HCV therapy. It was ranked at the highest, dominating all side effects and modes of administration. Furthermore, this study proved that patients consider both the probability of occurrence and the severity of treatment-induced side effects. Results clearly point to valuation of probabilities that is separate from that of severity.","[Muehlbacher, Axel; Bethge, Susanne] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany",,"Mühlbacher, A (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211",AbbVie Deutschland GmbH Co.

Depending on the choice of medication and duration of therapy, the costs of using a smoking cessation aid can be high. Additionally, these costs are not covered by health insurance in Germany. Information on willingness to use (WTU) and willingness to pay (WTP) for smoking cessation aids is valuable for developing different smoking cessation strategies. Objectives The study analyses WTU and WTP for three pharmacological smoking cessation aids (nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline) among young and middle-aged adults in Germany and attempts to determine their major driving factors. Methods Two cross-sectional internet-based surveys of smokers over 18 years of age were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Germany. Respondents were asked about smoking-related issues and WTU and WTP for each therapy. The contingent valuation method with payment cards was used to measure WTP. Descriptive statistics, logistical regression and accelerated failure-time regression models were performed. Results The total sample size is 505. Half of the respondents are willing to use NRT and one-third are willing to use bupropion and/or varenicline. WTU induces positive WTP; however, the magnitude of WTP is beneath the market price. WTU significantly increases with a higher addiction level and if smokers have previously heard about the therapy. Conclusion This study indicates different points to be considered for policy development. Promotion information and improving awareness about medication aids might increase WTU, and development of monetary incentives for young smokers could create a better chance for successful smoking cessation.","[Aumann, I.; Treskova, M.; Hagemann, N.; von der Schulenburg, J. -M.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Aumann, I.; von der Schulenburg, J. -M.] German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Biomed Res Endstage & Obstruct Lung Dis Hanover B, Hannover, NH, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Aumann, I (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.;Aumann, I (通讯作者)，German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Biomed Res Endstage & Obstruct Lung Dis Hanover B, Hannover, NH, Germany.",ia@cherh.de,,"Treskova, Marina/0000-0002-3641-7225",,,,,34,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

For continuously updating generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, we show that the results for the two-step GMM estimator in Sun (2014a) continue to hold under suitable assumptions. For continuous updating estimator obtained through solving a saddle point problem (Newey and Smith, 2004) and the maximum blockwise empirical likelihood estimator (Kitamura, 1997), we show that their fixed-smoothing asymptotic distributions (up to an unknown linear transformation) are mixed normal. Based on these results, we derive the asymptotic distributions of the specification tests (including the over-identification testing and testing on parameters) under the fixed-smoothing asymptotics, where the corresponding limiting distributions are nonstandard yet pivotal. Simulation studies show that (i) the fixed-smoothing asymptotics provides better approximation to the sampling distributions of the continuous updating estimator and the maximum blockwise empirical likelihood estimator as compared to the standard normal approximation. The testing procedures based on the fixed-smoothing critical values are more accurate in size than the conventional chi-square based tests; (ii) the continuously updating GMM estimator is asymptotically more efficient and the corresponding specification tests are generally more powerful than the other two competitors. Finite sample results from an empirical data analysis are also reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In early 2011, 1037 unenrolled IPP-eligible families in 179 randomly selected intervention municipalities were given an information kit and offered a 50% premium subsidy valid until the end of 2011; 383 IPP-eligible families in 64 control municipalities were not. In February 2012, the 787 families in the intervention sites who were still IPP-eligible but had not enrolled had their vouchers extended, were resent the enrollment kits and received SMS reminders. Half the group also received a handholding' intervention: in the endline interview, the enumerator offered to help complete the enrollment form, deliver it to the insurer's office in the provincial capital, and mail the membership cards. The main intervention raised the enrollment rate by 3 percentage points (ppts) (p=0.11), with an 8ppt larger effect (p<0.01) among city-dwellers, consistent with travel time to the insurance office affecting enrollment. The handholding intervention raised enrollment by 29 ppts (p<0.01), with a smaller effect (p<0.01) among city-dwellers, likely because of shorter travel times, and higher education levels facilitating unaided completion of the enrollment form.

As a result, the health system in Germany is subject to continuous adaption as well as public and political discussions about its design. Objective This paper analyzes the key challenges for the German health-care system and the underlying factors driving these challenges. We aim to identify possible solutions to put the German health-care system in a better position to face these challenges. Methods We utilize a broad array of methods to answer these questions, including a review of the published and grey literature on health-care planning in Germany, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the system, and an online questionnaire. Results We find that the most urgent (and manageable) aspects that merit attention are holistic hospital planning, initiatives to increase (administrative) innovation in the health-care system, incentives to increase prevention, and approaches to increase analytical quality assurance. Conclusion We found that hospital planning, innovation, quality control, and prevention, are considered to be the topics most in need of attention in the German health system.","[Pelster, Matthias] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Banking Finance & Accounting, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Hagemann, Vera] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Work & Org Psychol, Fac Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Uribe, Franziska Laporte] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis eV DZNE, DZNE Site Witten,Stockumer Str 12, D-58453 Witten, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Ruhr University Bochum; Helmholtz Association; German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE),"Pelster, M (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Inst Banking Finance & Accounting, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",pelster@leuphana.de; vera.hagemann@rub.de; franziska.laporte-uribe@dzne.de,"Hagemann, Vera/ABH-1965-2021","Hagemann, Vera/0000-0002-0939-2659; Laporte Uribe, Franziska/0000-0002-5850-7782; Pelster, Matthias/0000-0001-5740-2420",Mercator Research Center Ruhr,Mercator Research Center Ruhr,Financial support by the Mercator Research Center Ruhr is gratefully acknowledged.,,76,2,2,1,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

PBF is estimated to raise the proportion of births occurring in incentivized public health facilities by 7.5 percentage points (25%). A substantial part of this effect arises from switching the location of institutional births from private to public facilities; there is no significant impact on deliveries supervised by a skilled birth attendant, nor is there any significant effect on neonatal mortality, antenatal care and vaccination rates. The impact on births in public facilities is much greater if PBF is accompanied by maternity vouchers that cover user fees, but there is no significant effect among the poorest women. Heterogeneous effects across schemes differing in design suggest that maintaining management authority within a health district while giving explicit service targets to facilities is more effective in raising utilization than contracting management to a non-governmental organization while denying it full autonomy and leaving financial penalties vague.

When older spouses become eligible for Medicare, however, many of them can no longer provide their younger spouses with coverage. In this paper, we study how spousal eligibility for Medicare affects the health insurance and health care access of younger spouses. We find that spousal eligibility for Medicare results in younger spouses no longer having employers pay for their insurance and being less likely to have employer-sponsored coverage. Instead, younger spouses switch to privately purchased coverage, which tends to be worse than what they had before their spouses became eligible for Medicare. We also find suggestive evidence that younger spouses are less likely to use health care services after their older spouses become eligible for Medicare.

It is shown that if the political costs of a bailout' are relatively small, then the public hospital exhausts the welfare-maximising budget before the end of the budget period and a bailout' occurs. In anticipation, the government offers a budget to the public hospital that may be greater than or less than the welfare-maximising budget. In either case, the public hospital treats too many' elective patients before the bailout' and too few' after. The introduction of a private hospital reduces the size of any bailout' and increases welfare.

Guidelines recommend a minimum 5-day course of intravenous (IV) thiamine in at-risk patients unless WE can be excluded. Objective To estimate the cost impact on the UK public sector (NHS and social services) of a 5-day course of IV thiamine, vs a 2-and 10-day course, in harmful or dependent drinkers presenting to EDs. Methods A Markov chain model compared expected prognosis of patients under alternative admission strategies over 35 years. Model inputs were derived from a prospective cohort study, expert opinion via structured elicitation and NHS costing databases. Costs (2012/2013 price year) were discounted at 3.5 %. Results Increasing treatment from 2 to 5 days increased acute care costs but reduced the probability of disease progression and thus reduced the expected net costs by GBP87,000 per patient (95 % confidence interval GBP19,300 to GBP172,300) over 35 years. Conclusions Increasing length of stay to optimize IV thiamine replacement will place additional strain on acute care but has potential UK public sector cost savings. Social services and the NHS should explore collaborations to realise both the health benefits to patients and savings to the public purse.","[Wilson, Edward C.

Using alcohol advertisements to instrument for alcohol, we show that problem drinking has a large detrimental effect on psychological distress, with problem drinkers exhibiting a 42% increase in the number of mental health problems reported and a 15% higher chance of reporting very poor mental health. Ignoring endogeneity leads to an underestimation of the damaging effect of excessive drinking. Findings suggest that more effective alcohol polices and treatment services in the former Soviet Union may have added benefits in terms of reducing poor mental health.

We present findings regarding the sensitivity, specificity, and added value of searches in the different databases. We examine the distribution of publications between countries, regions, and health areas studied and compare the relative volume of research with disease burden. We analyse authors' country and institutional affiliations, journals and journal type, language, and type of economic evaluation conducted. More than 1200 economic evaluations were published annually, of which 4% addressed low-income countries, 4% lower-middle-income countries, 14% upper-middle-income countries, and 83% high-income countries. Across country income levels, 53, 54, 86, and 100% of articles, respectively, included an author based in a country within the income level studied. Biomedical journals published 74% of economic evaluations. The volume of research across health areas correlates more closely with disease burden in high-income than in low-income and middle-income countries.

The optimal evaluation of such interventions, however, calls for a practical and credible patient-reported outcome measure. Objectives: To describe the refinement of the Dementia Quality-of life Instrument (DQI) and present its revised version. Methods: A prototype of the DQI was adapted to cover a broader range of health related quality of life (HRQOL) and to improve consistency in the descriptions of its domains. A valuation study was then conducted to assign meaningful numbers to all DQI health states. Pairs of DQI states were presented to a sample of professionals working with people with dementia and a representative sample of the Dutch population. They had to repeatedly select the best DQI state, and their responses were statistically modeled to obtain values for each health state. Results: In total, 207 professionals working with people with dementia and 631 members of the general population completed the paired comparison tasks. Statistically significant differences between the two samples were found for the domains of social functioning, mood, and memory. Severe problems with physical health and severe memory problems were deemed most important by the general population. In contrast, severe mood problems were considered most important by professionals working with people with dementia. Discussion: The DQI is a simple and feasible measurement instrument that expresses the overall HRQOL of people suffering from dementia in a single meaningful number. Current results suggest that revisiting the discussion of using values from the general population might be warranted in the dementia context.

We discuss such games, together with a basic introduction to evolutionary game theory, in Sect. 5.1. Realistic populations, however, will generally not have these nice properties, and the payoffs will be nonlinear. In Sect. 5.2 we discuss various ways in which nonlinearity can appear in evolutionary games, including pairwise games with strategy-dependent interaction rates, and playing the field games, where payoffs depend upon the entire population composition, and not on individual games. In Sect. 5.3 we consider multiplayer games, where payoffs are the result of interactions between groups of size greater than two, which again leads to nonlinearity, and a breakdown of some of the classical results of Sect. 5.1.

With the ultimate aim of achieving a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this benefit, we have investigated the role of certain wine-derived phenolic metabolites and aroma compounds in the MAPK cascade (including ERK1/2, p38), one of the routes directly related to inflammation in neuronal cells. Some of the tested phenolic compounds, especially in the case of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, showed a significant neuroprotective effect against SIN-1-induced neuronal death. Regarding their effect overMAPK phosphorylation, inmunoblotting technique revealed a beneficial and significant decrease on the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 kinases after incubation with wine constituents. In addition, activity of caspase3-like protease, an executor of neuronal apoptosis and a downstream signal of MAPK, was significantly diminished by 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and linalool, counterbalancing the increase produced by SIN-1. Altogether, these results suggest that wine aroma, phenolic compounds and their gut metabolites could exert neuroprotective actions by modulating MAPK signalling and caspase-3 proteases activation, which are known to play a key role in oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced response.","[Esteban-Fernandez, A.; Gigorro del Coso, D.; Gonzalez de Llano, D.; Bartolome, B.; Moreno-Arribas, M.

We show how to shrink maximum likelihood estimators towards parameter subspaces defined by general nonlinear restrictions. We derive the asymptotic distribution and risk of our shrinkage estimator using a local asymptotic framework. We show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risk of the shrinkage estimator is strictly less than that of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). This reduction holds globally in the parameter space. We show that the reduction in asymptotic risk is substantial, even for moderately large values of the parameters. We also provide a new high-dimensional large sample local minimax efficiency bound. The bound is the lowest possible asymptotic risk, uniformly in a local region of the parameter space. Local minimax bounds are a stronger efficiency characterization than global minimax bounds. We show that our shrinkage estimator asymptotically achieves this local asymptotic minimax bound, while the MLE does not. Thus the shrinkage estimator, unlike the MLE, is locally minimax efficient. This theory is a combination and extension of standard asymptotic efficiency theory (Hajek, 1972) and local minimax efficiency theory for Gaussian models (Pinsker, 1980). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of retirement on physical activity among mature Americans,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Physical activity; Retirement; Instrument variable,,"Physical activity is crucial for maintaining and improving health, especially at advanced ages. While retirement increases the amount of time available for physical activity, there is only limited evidence regarding the causal effect of retirement on recommended levels of physical activity. Addressing this gap in the literature, we use data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to estimate the causal impact of retirement on meeting the federal government's 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Using official early and normal retirement ages as instruments for retirement, our causal IV analyses suggest significant positive effects of retirement on meeting the Guidelines. These effects are robust with regard to the treatment of unobserved individual-specific heterogeneity, the measurement of guideline compliance, the definition of retirement and respondents' health insurance status. We also show that the effects of retirement on physical activity are larger for persons with higher levels of education and wealth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, any progress in cognitive antecedents of behavior change may be seen as a beneficial outcome of an intervention. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility and validity of incorporating cognitive parameters of behavior change in CEAs. The CEA from a randomized controlled trial on smoking cessation was reanalyzed. First, relevant cognitive antecedents of behavior change in this dataset were identified. Then, transition probabilities between combined states of smoking and cognitions at 6 weeks and corresponding 6 months smoking status were obtained from the dataset. These rates were extrapolated to the period from 6 to 12 months in a decision analytic model. Simulated results were compared with the 12 months' observed cost-effectiveness results. Self-efficacy was the strongest time-varying predictor of smoking cessation. Twelve months' observed CEA results for the multiple tailoring intervention versus usual care showed (sic) 3188 had to be paid for each additional quitter versus (sic) 10,600 in the simulated model. The simulated CEA showed largely similar but somewhat more conservative results. Using self-efficacy to enhance the estimation of the true behavioral outcome seems a feasible and valid way to estimate future cost-effectiveness.

Many successful models can be viewed as special cases or variations of the generalized autoregressive moving average (GARMA) models of Benjamin et al. (2003), where a link function similar to that used in generalized linear models is introduced and the conditional mean, under the link function, assumes an ARMA structure. Under such a model, the 'transformed' time series, under the same link function, assumes an ARMA form as well. Unfortunately, unless the link function is an identity function, the error sequence defined in the transformed ARMA model is usually not a martingale difference sequence. In this paper we extend the GARMA model in such a way that the resulting ARMA model in the transformed space has a martingale difference sequence as its error sequence. The benefit of such an extension are four-folds. It has easily verifiable conditions for stationarity and ergodicity; its Gaussian pseudo-likelihood estimator is consistent; standard time series model building tools are ready to use; and its MLE's asymptotic distribution can be established. We also proposes two new classes of non-Gaussian time series models under the new framework. The performance of the proposed models is demonstrated with simulated and real examples.

We use German cross-sectional survey data for the years 2002 and 2006, and measure small area deprivation via the German Index of Multiple Deprivation. We test the differences between concentration indices of income-related and small area deprivation related inequalities in obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Our results suggest that small area deprivation and individual income both yield inequalities in health favoring the better-off, where individual income-related inequalities are significantly more pronounced than those related to small area deprivation. We then apply a semiparametric extension of Wagstaff's corrected concentration index to explore how individual-level health inequalities vary with the degree of regional deprivation. We find that the concentration of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes among lower income groups also exists at the small area level. The degree of deprivation-specific income-related inequalities in the three health outcomes exhibits only little variations across different levels of multiple deprivation for both sexes.

We show that the CCE mean group estimator continues to be valid but the following two conditions must be satisfied to deal with the dynamics: a sufficient number of lags of cross section averages must be included in individual equations of the panel, and the number of cross section averages must be at least as large as the number of unobserved common factors. We establish consistency rates, derive the asymptotic distribution, suggest using covariates to deal with the effects of multiple unobserved common factors, and consider jackknife and recursive de-meaning bias correction procedures to mitigate the small sample time series bias. Theoretical findings are accompanied by extensive Monte Carlo experiments, which show that the proposed estimators perform well so long as the time series dimension of the panel is sufficiently large.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure based on the gradient of an unknown quantile regression function. Our method delivers the bandwidth with the oracle property in the sense that it is asymptotically equivalent to the optimal bandwidth if the true gradient were known. The results of Monte Carlo simulations are reported, and the finite sample performance of our proposed method confirms our theoretical analysis.

Although much research to date has focused on the prediction of the conditional mean cost, this can potentially miss important features of the full distribution such as tail probabilities. We conduct a quasi-Monte Carlo experiment using the English National Health Service inpatient data to compare 14 approaches in modelling the distribution of healthcare costs: nine of which are parametric and have commonly been used to fit healthcare costs, and five others are designed specifically to construct a counterfactual distribution. Our results indicate that no one method is clearly dominant and that there is a trade-off between bias and precision of tail probability forecasts. We find that distributional methods demonstrate significant potential, particularly with larger sample sizes where the variability of predictions is reduced. Parametric distributions such as log-normal, generalised gamma and generalised beta of the second kind are found to estimate tail probabilities with high precision but with varying bias depending upon the cost threshold being considered.

They are ignored in the Black & Scholes framework, but have a relevant impact on the pricing of options written on financial assets. Using a recent model for market dynamics which adequately captures the above stylized facts, we derive closed form equations for option pricing, obtaining the Black & Scholes as a special case. By applying our pricing equations to a major equity index option dataset, we show that inclusion of stylized features in financial modelling moves derivative prices about 30% closer to the market values without the need of calibrating models parameters on available derivative prices.

We also provide analytical formulae for the unconditional moments of this augmented vector. Our new Quadratic Kalman Filter (QKF) exploits these properties to formulate fast and simple filtering and smoothing algorithms. A simulation study first emphasizes that the QKF outperforms the extended and unscented approaches in the filtering exercise showing up to 70% RMSEs improvement of filtered values. Second, it provides evidence that QKF-based maximum-likelihood estimates of model parameters always possess lower bias or lower RMSEs than the alternative estimators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ten Case Studies,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,case studies; competent and reliable scientific evidence; FDAMA Section 114; health economics; United States,,"Background: Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 regulates the promotion of health economic information by pharmaceutical companies to US health plans. Greater clarity is important given demands by payers and other stakeholders for evidence of value. Objectives: To develop hypothetical case studies of health economic promotions to examine legal and policy implications. Methods: We constructed for pedagogical purposes 10 categories of potential health economic promotions. We generated hypothetical case studies for each category, including questions about whether each might be allowable under Section 114. The case studies were developed around the following categories: 1) costing out on label clinical end points; 2) promotion of a costing exercise to physicians working in an accountable care organization setting; 3) burden-of-illness claims; 4) economic analysis of a formulary restriction policy; 5) extrapolations to doses, populations, or settings not covered in trials; 6) adherence claims; 7) utilization of care as a secondary end point in randomized clinical trials; 8) costing out a competitor drug's adverse event; 9) economic analysis of comparative effectiveness claims using an indirect treatment comparison; and 10) extrapolating from surrogate to long-term outcomes in an economic model. Discussion: Most cases seem to fall into a gray zone given haziness around what constitutes competent and reliable evidence and directly relate[d] to an approved indication in practice, it is difficult to know what the section allows given the imprecision of the statute and lack of guidance about its scope. Conclusion: ideally, future guidance will provide clarity and flexibility. Copyright (C) 2015, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

A number of studies have found that highly educated women are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Breast cancer is therefore often labeled as a welfare disease. However, it has not been established whether the strong positive correlation holds up when education is exogenously determined. We estimate the causal effect of education on the probability of being diagnosed with breast cancer by exploiting an education reform that extended compulsory schooling and was implemented as a social experiment.

Motivated by these findings, we consider a problem of demand for insurance indemnity schedules, where the insurer has ambiguous beliefs about the realizations of the insurable loss, whereas the insured is an expected-utility maximizer. We show that if the ambiguous beliefs of the insurer satisfy a property of compatibility with the non-ambiguous beliefs of the insured, then optimal indemnity schedules exist and are monotonic. By virtue of monotonicity, no ex-post moral hazard issues arise at our solutions (e.g., Huberman et al., 1983). In addition, in the case where the insurer is either ambiguity-seeking or ambiguity-averse, we show that the problem of determining the optimal indemnity schedule reduces to that of solving an auxiliary problem that is simpler than the original one in that it does not involve ambiguity. Finally, under additional assumptions, we give an explicit characterization of the optimal indemnity schedule for the insured, and we show how our results naturally extend the classical result of Arrow (1971) on the optimality of the deductible indemnity schedule.

We show that verifying these revealed preference conditions is Np-hard. We also present an integer programming approach, which is particularly attractive in view of empirical analysis. We demonstrate the versatility of this integer programming approach by showing that it allows for testing homothetic separability and weak separability of the indirect utility function.

We find that enacting a mental health mandate decreases the count of organ donors from suicides and results are driven by female donors. Using a number of empirical specifications, we calculate that the mental health parity laws are responsible for an approximately 0.52% decrease in cadaveric donors. Additional regression results show that the mandates are not related to other types of organ donations, ruling out the possibility that the mandates are related to an overall trend in the supply of organ donations. The findings suggest that future policies aimed at reducing suicide in a large and significant way can potentially increase the inefficiency that currently exists in the organ donor market.

The hierarchical relationship between the health care delivery system, providers, patients, and other stakeholders exhibits a level of complexity that ought to be captured using dynamic simulation modeling methods. As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods system dynamics, discreteevent simulation, and agent based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing volume, velocity and variety' and availability of big data to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems. The report directs readers to other resources for further education on these individual modeling methods for system interventions in the emerging field of health care delivery science and implementation.","[Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Cumming Sch Med, Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Burgos-Liz, Lina] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Uzerman, Maarten J.] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Crown, William] Optum Labs, Boston, MA USA; [Padula, William V.] Univ Chicago, Sect Hosp Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wong, Peter K.] Hosp Sisters Hlth Syst, HSHS Illinois Div, Belleville, IL USA; [Wong, Peter K.] Hosp Sisters Hlth Syst, Med Grp, Belleville, IL USA; [Pasupathy, Kalyan S.] Mayo Clin, Robert D & Patricia E Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Deli, Hlth Care Syst Engn Program, Rochester, MN USA; [Higashi, Mitchell K.] GE Healthcare, Barrington, IL USA; [Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Dept Community Hlth, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Epidemiol & Bioengn Div, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Twente; Optum; University of Chicago; Mayo Clinic; General Electric; University of Saskatchewan,"Marshall, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Community Hlth Sci, 3280 Hosp Dr NW,Rm 3C56 Hlth Res Innovat Ctr, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",damarsha@ucalgary.ca,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; IJzerman, Maarten J/Q-8963-2016; Osgood, Nathaniel/L-1805-2016; Padula, Bill/AGB-4625-2022; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","IJzerman, Maarten J/0000-0001-5788-5805; Pasupathy, Kalyan/0000-0002-4760-2805; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Osgood, Nathaniel/0000-0002-3994-3298",AHRQ HHS [F32 HS023710] Funding Source: Medline,AHRQ HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),,,80,88,104,4,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2,,,,,147,160,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.006,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773550.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300005,0

Many methods have been proposed to promote transparent and rigorous benefit-risk analysis (BRA). Objective: To propose a framework for classifying BRA methods on the basis of key factors that matter most for patients by using a common mathematical notation and compare their results using a hypothetical example. Methods: We classified the available BRA methods into three categories: 1) unweighted metrics, which use only probabilities of benefits and risks; 2) metrics that incorporate preference weights and that account for the impact and duration of benefits and risks; and 3) metrics that incorporate weights based on decision makers' opinions. We used two hypothetical antiplatelet drugs (a and b) to compare the BRA methods within our proposed framework. Results: Unweighted metrics include the number needed to treat and the number needed to harm. Metrics that incorporate preference weights include those that use maximum acceptable risk, those that use relative-valueadjusted life years, and those that use quality adjusted life years. Metrics that use decision makers' weights include the multicriteria decision analysis, the benefit-less-risk analysis, Boers' 3 by 3 table, the Gail/NCI method, and the transparent uniform risk benefit overview. Most BRA methods can be derived as a special case of a generalized formula in which some are mathematically identical. Numerical comparison of methods highlights potential differences in BRA results and their interpretation. Conclusions: The proposed framework provides a unified, patient-centered approach to BRA methods classification based on the types of weights that are used across existing methods, a key differentiating feature.","[Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Schneeweiss, Sebastian; Choudhry, Niteesh; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Gagne, Joshua J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Najafzadeh, Mehdi; Schneeweiss, Sebastian; Choudhry, Niteesh; Bykov, Katsiaryna; Gagne, Joshua J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Kohler, Kristijan H.; Martin, Diane P.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA",Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Novartis,"Najafzadeh, M (通讯作者)，Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mnajafzadeh@partners.org,"Bykov, Katsiaryna/JRZ-1072-2023","Bykov, Katsiaryna/0000-0003-3336-5412; Schneeweiss, Sebastian/0000-0003-2575-467X",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This project was funded by an unrestricted research grant from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation to the Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Despite their large cost, few studies have investigated the effects of Medicaid expansions for disabled individuals on insurance coverage and crowd-out of private insurance. Using an eligibility expansion that allowed states to provide Medicaid to disabled individuals with incomes less than 100% of the federal poverty level, I address these issues. Crowd-out estimates range from 49% using an ordinary least squares procedure to 100% using two-stage least-squares analysis. This potentially large degree of crowd-out could have fiscal implications for the Affordable Care Act which has greatly expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2014. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The initial chapter deals with crude oil contamination and bacterial metabolism which is able to remove this contamination. A container trial was executed in the experimental part of the thesis. The plants were planted into different types of modified soil (crude oil application, sterilization etc.). The production of biomass was compared and several conclusions from the results were drawn. The basic fact is that the soil microorganisms which occur in oil soil can design a life strategy in this environment and can also prosper, which is reflected in the production of biomass. The container trial was determined as the most exact method of soil activity valuation because it most approximates the real soil proportion. Analyses of storage soil were performed after finishing the container trial. These results brought similar conclusions; however the cultivation in the culture medium and cultivation in the soil as such are incomparable. The storage soil underwent a watercress trial. This trial confirmed toxic effects of crude oil but it also showed the fact that crude oil is a natural substance and microorganisms can adapt to it. The mineralization of soil was measured with help of ionic measurements.","[Dvorackova, Helena; Mikajlo, Irina; Zahora, Jaroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Dvorackova, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdvorac8@node.mendelu.cz,"Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018; Dvořáčková, Helena/I-8479-2018","Dvořáčková, Helena/0000-0003-4087-4303; Zahora, Jaroslav/0000-0003-1935-0193",,,,,18,0,0,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,206,211,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100039,0

Focusing on the case of Ta Lai Commune, a qualitative exploratory study was conducted by adopting in-depth interviews with the different member of the local community. The core barriers to local community participation identified in this research include: (1) community capacity, (2) conflicts (resource use conflict, power disparities, benefit sharing) and (3) gender issue. The strategy to tackle with these barriers should be based on understanding of the mechanisms and structures of resource relationships and the dynamic linkages between and within livelihoods; promoting dialogue between managers and local communities; enhancing community capacity by delivering training modules; and improving women's participation in decision-making process.","[Thi Minh Phuong Duong] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"Duong, TMP (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",duongthiminhphuong@tdt.edu.vn,"Duong, Minh-Phuong Thi/IZE-6450-2023; Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022","Duong, Minh-Phuong Thi/0000-0003-2487-9905;",,,,,42,0,0,0,25,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,778,791,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900055,0

The random walk hypothesis is tested with two variance ratio tests Wright's rank and sign tests, a kind of nonparametric finite sample variance ratio test, as well as the conventional Lo-MacKinlay test. And the daily closing prices and settlement prices data over the period 2010-2013 are both investigated. We find that for closing prices, the random walk hypothesis is rejected by all futures except for sugar; while for settlement prices, the random walk hypothesis is rejected by all futures except for canola oil. So overall, it can be concluded that during the sample periods, the five agricultural futures markets all show significant evidence against the random walk hypothesis, and therefore are still not weak-form efficient. At last, this paper analyses the reasons that may lead to the inefficiency and also presents some suggestions and measures that may help to improve the efficiency of Chinese agricultural futures markets.","[Zhou Bei] Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China; [Wu Chong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin University of Science & Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Zhou, B (通讯作者)，Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,403,410,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600055,0

The system supports several experiments with different connections of water tanks to simulate several industrial processes. In industry, basins are widely used for storage of substances, both for processing slow in cases of continuous filling emptying and for preservation. For example, in water treatment centers pools play a leading role at each step of the technological process as temporary storage areas (in order of filtration, settling, chlorination etc.). Therefore, it is very useful to test algorithms and controllers on these kinds of processes at a smaller scale, before attempting large-scale implementation.","[Alexandru, Dumitrascu] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Alexandru, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Dumitrascu, Alexandru/IAO-6372-2023",,,,,,3,3,3,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,817,824,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200104,0

On the other hand, regarding wooden biomass usage Croatia is still at the beginning, and most of this important energy source is exported. Wood pellet is an environmentally acceptable product and its production significantly contributes to rural development and sustainable approach to the management of timber resources, but at the same time this important energy source is neglected in strategic planning and energy policies. Croatian wood pellets producers with a potential production of 260,000 tonnes so far have been forced to export. In 2014, 92% of total Croatian wood pellet production was export to foreign markets. The main reason for this market situation is that Croatian market (public institutions and private persons) is not yet enough informed about scope of wood pellet usage and it advances in the contacts of ecology and green economy.

Experiments have been fulfilled using the solar imitator whose energy irradiance on the surface of the solar collector at the constant ambient conditions is 800 W/m(2). Energy characteristics of the solar collector system with different flow-rates of the heat-transfer agent have been investigated using various flow-rate speeds of the heat-transfer agent. It has been stated that the increase of the flow-rate of the heat-transfer agent in the system from 0.01 to 0.12 kg/s would minimize the average collector efficiency from 0.81 to 0.55. When the reduced flow-rate of the heat-transfer agent has been used in the system, the higher temperature of the hot water is reached in the storage tank and at the same time the temperature of the heat-transfer agent in the system is increased. Thus, more energy has been lost in the pipeline and hot water storage tank, but less energy is used for the circulation of the heat-transfer agent energy.

It takes into consideration average estimates and also particular types. The estimates come from financial reports from The Regional Chamber of Audit. LSG budgets need relatively stable revenues to sustain their responsibilities. Their revenues should be also rather resistant from crisis and not to overreact to economic fluctuations. As it can be observed shares of own revenues in total revenues between 2006 and 2014 were changing from average 59% in 2006 down to 56% in 2010, finally reaching about 60% in 2012-2014. The average growth of own revenues was slower than average growth of total revenues in 2008-2010. One of main sources of revenues are shares in central government PIT and CIT taxes. Share of those revenues in total revenues sharply dropped in 2010. This suggests that shares income taxes are not stable and efficient source of own revenues during crisis (2010). Differences between minimal and maximal share of local taxes and charges were rising - from 24 p.p.(2006) to 36 p.p.(2014). In case of real estate tax we can also observe steady growth of average of it (about 7 to 10 p.p.) each year. Revenues from their property are important source of revenue and that were very varied over the years. The main reason of it, is inclusion of revenues from selling municipal property - what is occasional.","Wroclaw Univ Econ, Econ Sci Fac, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Econ Sci Fac, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,5,3,3,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,440,446,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-59,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300059,0

Purple-leaf 'Dark Opal' and green-leaf 'Sweet Genovese' basils were grown in greenhouse (14 days, 22/18 +/- 2 degrees C day/night temperature, 40 +/- 5 % a relative air humidity) during winter season. The main lighting system (HPS lamps and natural daylight) was supplemented with similar to 13.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) flux of UV-A 390 nm, and a total PPFD was similar to 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (16 h photoperiod) for 1 or 7 days before harvest, or entire growth period -14 days. The results revealed that the influence of UV-A on growth and antioxidant properties depended on basil variety and duration of irradiation. Generally, UV-A irradiation for 7 days significantly (P <= 0.05) inhibited growth and hypocotyl elongation of green-leaf basils, and for 14 days of both basil varieties. No significant differences on leaf chlorophyll index were determined. However, leaf flavonol index significantly increased in green-leaf basils after 7 and 14 days UV-A irradiation. The total phenols ant anthocyanin contents significantly decreased after 1 day UV-A irradiation in purple-leaf basils, and the continuous decrease following UV-A irradiation for 7 or 14 days was determined. In addition, UV-A irradiation had negative effects on ABTS radical activity in purple-leaf basils; however, the significantly higher ABTS radical scavenging activity after UV-A irradiation for 1 or 7 days in green-leaf basils were determined. UV-A influenced higher ascorbic acid synthesis in purple-leaf basils after 7 days irradiation, or after 14 days irradiation in both basil varieties. In summary, the supplemental UV-A LED lighting allows to protect basil microgreens from hypocotyl elongation, and enhances antioxidant properties in green-leaf basils. Purple-leaf basils showed to be more sensitive to UV-A irradiation, and less positive effects on antioxidant properties were determined.","[Vastakaite, Viktorija; Virsile, Akvile; Brazaityte, Ausra; Samuoliene, Giedre; Sirtautas, Ramunas; Duchovskis, Pavelas] Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Lab Plant Physiol, Inst Hort, Kauno G 30, LT-54333 Babtai, Kauno Raj, Lithuania; [Samuoliene, Giedre] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Agron, Inst Biol & Plant Biotechnol, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania; [Jankauskiene, Jule] Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Inst Hort, Sect Vegetables Growing Technol, LT-54333 Babtai, Kauno Raj, Lithuania; [Duchovskis, Pavelas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Agron, Inst Agr & Food Sci, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture & Forestry; Vytautas Magnus University; Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture & Forestry; Vytautas Magnus University,"Vastakaite, V (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Lab Plant Physiol, Inst Hort, Kauno G 30, LT-54333 Babtai, Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",v.vastakaite@lsdi.lt; a.virsile@lsdi.lt; a.brazaityte@lsdi.lt; g.samuoliene@lsdi.lt; j.jankauskiene@lsdi.lt; r.sirtautas@lsdi.lt; p.duchovskis@lsdi.lt,"Vaštakaitė-Kairienė, Viktorija/AAH-8477-2019; Brazaityte, Ausra/AAB-3836-2020; Duchovskis, Pavelas/AAH-6209-2019; Samuolienė, Giedrė/AAB-3884-2020; Viršilė, Akvilė/AAB-3892-2020","Vaštakaitė-Kairienė, Viktorija/0000-0002-4724-6644; Brazaityte, Ausra/0000-0001-6503-6352; Viršilė, Akvilė/0000-0001-5981-7494",,,,,48,11,12,0,28,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.031,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800050,0

Related to this concept we remark multiple and various interest and, also, its use in all economic areas, in civil society, in quotidian life, in politics and strategies for development customized for each country. In essence, the sustainability concept was generated by awareness of need to solve economic, social and environmental problems occurred mainly in the last 30 years, as a direct consequence of the economic and social rapid progress achieved in almost all world's countries and in the European countries, too. We observed that in the East-European countries the policies and strategies of sustainable development are not similar to these of other European developed countries. Although the principles of sustainable development functioning are well known, disseminated and assimilated by corporate and administrative entities, it can be noticed that exist certain factors which disturb the implementation process and performance of sustainable development perceived as a comprehensive and complex concept. The present paper aims to identify the limitative factors and barriers for a real sustainable development achievement, through a critical analysis based on specific data as well as on causal explanations; we are interested to discover how is possible to eliminate the disruptive evidence and to highlight the recovery solutions. We propose to focus on East European countries from point related to sustainability implementation in real economic life of societies.

That in turn causes the development of the locally based economic model of agriculture and food distribution. This model is based on creating closer ties with the local market responsible for food trade between individual buyers and producers. It was established that the owners of medium and small sized (organic as well as traditional) farms have issues with finding loyal customers. The aim of this study is to find alternative ways of organizing farmers or optionally farmers and their customers into organizations similar to the ones already existent in other Western European countries. Their basic goal is to simplify the relationship between the producer and customer and at the same time to reduce the logistical chain which takes place while the produce is being transported to its' recipients. Shortening of this chain has also a key effect on traceability. Another important role of organizations working on behalf of the eco-friendly farms is spreading the knowledge about the role and importance of such endeavours.,"[Dziuba, Szymon T.; Piekara, Agnieszka] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland; [Ingaldi, Manuela] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Czestochowa, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Technical University Czestochowa,"Dziuba, ST (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Piekara, Agnieszka/T-7566-2018; Ingaldi, Manuela/AAF-4688-2021; Dziuba, Szymon T./B-7722-2018","Ingaldi, Manuela/0000-0002-9793-6299; Dziuba, Szymon T./0000-0002-6509-5843",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,421,426,,,,,,6,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200054,0

This study explores the long-run interdependence among environment and economic growth in the Arctic regions of Russia. The modern theoretical justification of the existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is deeply reviewed. Based on panel data for the period of 20002013, the constructed model is used to investigate the existence of environmental Kuznets curve. Various panel data unit root and co-integration tests are also applied. Emissions of harmful pollutants in the air and gross regional product (GRP) series per capita are integrated of order one and co-integrated. We examine the stationary properties of individual series in panel datasets using different panel unit root tests. The long-run relationship using FM-OLS and DOLS panel long-run estimates proposed by Pedroni is developed. According to the concept of the Kuznets curve all regions of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation are on the increasing branch of the curve. The economic growth is found to have no beneficial effect on the environment in the Arctic.

This region has long been among the top ten districts with the highest unemployment rate within the Czech Republic. The basic research question is how can multinational industry companies help to solve problems in the labour market in this structural afflicted region. Based on the comparative analysis of information from companies 'annual reports and statistics from the Czech Statistical Office and the CzechInvest association, the research results presented in the paper point at the fact, to what extent multinational industry companies could reduce the unemployment rate in this particular district. The contribution of these investments is illustrated by hypothetical unemployment rate, in other words, what would be the situation on the regional labour market in the case of the absence of these investments. Based on the comparative analysis of data from the period 2000 - 2013, foreign direct investment from the industrial zones Alpka and Triangle could reduce regional unemployment rate by 2,6 p. p. per year on average. This paper demonstrates the dependence of the existence of the industrial zones to reduce regional unemployment rate by the means of correlation analysis. Divergences in the development of the real unemployment rate in the region can be based on conducted research mainly attributable to specific situations in industrial zones.","Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 41617, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Kotíková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1492-2, Liberec 41617, Czech Republic.",sylvie.kotikova@tul.cz,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,115,121,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-14,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300014,0

The study was developed on the basis of empirical unit data of the Polish FADN regarding commercial farms classified as the Fieldcrops group. The results were presented in comparison with the farms pursuing mixed production, which in the FADN are referred to as Mixed. The study used the Cobb-Douglass production function method. Based on the flexibility ratios, reflecting the degree of proportionality of revenue in relation to the analysed factors, it can be inferred that the farms in question displayed a growing efficiency of total inputs in the reference years. However, the analysis of the substitution of labour for capital in the surveyed farms oriented towards crop production revealed less favourable results, in terms of the achievement of the economic objective in 2009-2011. The results indicate that the substitution of labour for capital in the analysed period was effective in both types of farms. The comparative analysis of the marginal rates of substitution reveals that the substitution of labour for capital was more favourable in the Fieldcrops group than in the Mixed type farms in 2011. In order to substitute one man-hour, an average Fieldcrops farm had to increase its capital by PLN 5.98 in 2009, by PLN 6.88 in 2010 and by PLN 2.55 in 2011 whereas in the Mixed type farm it was PLN 2.12, PLN 2.91 and PLN 2.89, respectively.","[Kubik, Renata; Wojcik, Ewa; Kobialka, Anna; Kolodziej, Elzbieta] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Ul Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Kubik, R (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Ul Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",renata.kubik@up.lublin.pl; ewa.wojcik@up.lublin.pl; anna.kobialka@up.lublin.pl; elzbieta.kolodzei@uplublin.pl,"Kolodziej, Elzbieta/U-6015-2018; Kubik, Renata/D-5020-2019","Kolodziej, Elzbieta/0000-0002-4431-463X; Kubik, Renata/0000-0002-8227-945X",,,,,20,2,2,1,7,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.021,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800085,0

From database, which contained more than six thousand projects implemented under the Cohesion Policy in Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodship, 222 projects related to the revitalization have been analyzed. In the paper we have demonstrated that the cohesion policy realized by the EU, has significantly affected the process of the revitalization in Polish cities. This impact can be considered in two ways. On the one hand, the cohesion policy caused the necessity of long-term and integrated planning of all actions required for the activation of problem areas in a city. On the other hand, it initiated instruments by which Polish cities had a real opportunity to start the thorough revitalization.","[Rogatka, Krzysztof; Bieganska, Jadwiga; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta; Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Justyna; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Urban Studies & Reg Dev, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Cieslik, Ewa] Poznan Univ Econ, Fac Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Econ, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Rogatka, K (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Urban Studies & Reg Dev, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",krogatka@umk.pl; jadwigab@umk.pl; grzelak@umk.pl; ewa.cieslik@ue.poznan.pl,"Biegańska, Jadwiga/M-8547-2019; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta/G-5180-2014; Cieslik, Ewa/JLL-5396-2023; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania/JAC-7698-2023; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania/A-6842-2019; Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Justyna M./E-6019-2015; Rogatka, Krzysztof/G-7299-2019","Biegańska, Jadwiga/0000-0002-0586-089X; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-5797-9366; Cieslik, Ewa/0000-0002-7230-8480; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania/0000-0002-2357-2613; Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Justyna M./0000-0002-4436-475X;",,,,,7,2,2,1,15,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,293,299,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-39,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300039,0

Calculations of the economic efficiency of the associated petroleum gas utilization production technology application were carried out on the basis of the information provided by one of the enterprises of Russia (Tomsk region). The open exchange of economic information on the implementation of certain technologies and the determination of economic feasibility of the associated petroleum gas usage under the conditions of the particular field will contribute to the development of the best experience of rational subsurface usage by oil producing enterprises. Results of calculation of economic efficiency of carbon black production from soot for the deposits with the recoverable reserves of about 5 million and the average distance from the nearest pipeline - 40 km, showed that at an average cost of carbon black of 1300 $ per tone, the payback period will be 5.4 years. Calculations of economic efficiency of GTL-technologies application on an example of Tomsk region deposits showed that the payback period for deposits with similar characteristics and at an oil price of 30 $ per barrel will be 3-4 years. In addition, the implementation of GTL-technologies in the process of associated petroleum gas utilization on the field will allow to get transportable products with high added value, to improve the ecological environment in areas of oil and gas production, as well as to minimize the payment of fines for excessive APG flaring.

The results show that the current growth is not enough to overcome the first half of the top EU countries and requires an acceleration of this process of transformation into organic.","[Banes, Adrian; Otiman, Paun Ion] Romanian Acad, Timisoara Branch, 24 Bv Mihai Viteazu, Timisoara, Timis County, Romania; [Iancu, Tiberiu; Orboi, Manuela Dora] Banats Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med King Michael I Timi, Timisoara, Timis County, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Polytechnic University of Timisoara; Banat University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine,"Banes, A (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Timisoara Branch, 24 Bv Mihai Viteazu, Timisoara, Timis County, Romania.",abanes@gmail.com; otiman@acad.ro; tibi_iancu@gmx.de; orboi@usab-tm.ro,"Banes, Adrian/JQI-5878-2023; Iancu, Tiberiu/AAX-4855-2020",,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.091,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800107,0

Assessment accounted for agroecological indicators (share of cereals in crops, stock density) and economic indicators (profitableness of land and labour). Analysis was conducted according to a classification into agricultural holding types: dairy cattle and granivores. In both countries, average stocking density in dairy holdings did not pose a threat to the natural environment. In the case of granivores holdings, such threats were present because standards specified in the code of good agricultural practice were violated significantly. From the perspective of economic equilibrium, holdings from this group achieved a better result than dairy cattle holdings. In Poland during the years 2006-2012, the average income of a family-owned agricultural holding per full-time worker in the family was 56 % greater than in dairy cattle holdings. In the case of Lithuanian holdings, the difference was still greater and amounted to 73 % to the benefit of granivores holdings.","[Koloszko-Chomentowska, Zofia] Bialystok Tech Univ, Ul Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland; [Zukovskis, Jan; Gargasas, Audrius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania",Bialystok University of Technology; Vytautas Magnus University,"Koloszko-Chomentowska, Z (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Ul Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",z.koloszko@pb.edu.pl; jan.zukovskis@asu.lt; audrius.gargasas@asu.lt,"Zukovskis, Jan/X-6528-2019",,,,,,17,2,2,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.130,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800084,0

This paper assesses the changes in some mechanical properties of the hoof as a result of changes in their stabling environment. Moreover, the hardness, the wear resistance and the impact resistance of the hoof horn was evaluated. The results of the experiment showed a statistically significant difference between the studied mechanical properties of the hoof horn and the compared stabling conditions. Conducting the experiment led to a new methodology for evaluating the mechanical properties of biological materials coming from polymeric testing. The experiment describes a possible methodology for testing biological materials based on the evaluation of the mechanical properties of inorganic polymers. An effect of the influence stabling environment has to the hardness and the impact strength of the hoof horn was confirmed.

The mineral extraction tax (MET) and the customs duty on oil export are basic elements of the fiscal policy for the oil-extracting companies operating in Russia. The volume of these payments is strictly connected with the average level of exchange prices of Urals brand oil during the corresponding month. In the conditions of intensive oil prices reduction this circumstance led to essential losses of the federal budget incomes. The aim of this work consists in the characterization of the oil-extracting companies taxation system existed before 2015; in the assessment of the fiscal policy changes that have come into force since 2015; in the search of ways for the taxation system optimization taking into account interests both of the state and the oil-extracting branch. The paper describes the changes in the government fiscal policy mechanisms in relation to oil-producing companies: the expansion of the list of tax and customs benefits, the transition to differential taxation, coordination of the fiscal burden level with the economics of specific projects, the introduction of the oil tax maneuver. Positive and negative consequences of these changes for the oil industry and the Russian economy as a whole are identified. It is shown in this work that for implementation of the projects focused on domestic market, the effect of tax maneuver is negative. On the basis of the conducted research the conclusion is drawn that in the existing macroeconomic conditions the evolutional transition from the tax system based on quantitative indices to the system which is based on financial result is expedient.

In the Russian Federation industrial and municipal waste management system is one of the key components of a country's overall environmental and resource efficiency framework. This study is aimed at evaluating the generation, characteristics, and management of waste in Russia based on published information. A brief history of waste management in Russia from 1994 to 2014 is presented. Till 2007 total generation of industrial waste in Russia growth at a rate of several percent a year. Since then in 2008-2009 a moderate decrease of total industrial waste generation was registered. From 2010 till present total generation of industrial waste in Russia growth stably. But hazardous waste generation by industry dropped drastically in 2008 at almost half level as compared with 2007 and remains at the same level till now. Another tendency is relevant for municipal solid waste. The total annual volume of municipal solid waste produced in Russia increased steadily without any reaction to changes in economic activity in the country. The waste management in Russia faces many substantial problems caused by increasing per capita production of waste materials, lack of sufficient investment into infrastructure, institutional, a wide range of stakeholders and a dynamic and controversial legal arena. The waste stream itself varies in composition over time and space with seasonal and longer term changes in quantities and amounts of various materials; the market for 'recycled' materials is characterized by uncertain demand and fluctuating prices. Last decade the waste management system in Russia experienced significant development and changes caused by adaptation to new national environmental policy declaring formation of effective and environment friendly economy, conservation and recovery of natural environment, prevention of ecological catastrophes and adaption to the climate change. The current crisis is unfavorable to developing the waste sector. Nevertheless some future prospects for waste management in Russia are discussed.","[Korobitsyn] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Korobitsyn] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Ind Ecol, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Industrial Ecology UB RAS,"Korobitsyn (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.;Korobitsyn (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Ind Ecol, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,715,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200091,0

The research was carried out during 2011-2013 in the vineyard of the BUASVM Didactic Station from Timisoara and focusing exclusively on several variants of soil maintenance in order to replace the need for manual labor. Leaf area was estimated by concentric circles method and sugar concentration was evaluated by refractometry. Total acidity in must and wine was determined by titration. Grape yield was estimated by bunches counting and weighing, for each variety and productive potential (kg ha(-1)) was appreciated by multiplying the average yield per vine with the number of vines per hectare. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Performance of Burgundy variety for superior red wines group and Silvania table grape variety - with a medium ripening, were analyzed in the experiment. For both Burgundy and Silvania varieties the sixth variant (V6-bare soil by tillage middles row (tractor and rotary hoe)/rotary hoe undervine (tractor and adjustable offset rotary tiller) registered the highest grape yield during the research. The lowest grape yield fulfils to the seventh variant of vineyard floor management.

The impact of multinational companies that localized their subsidiaries into selected region was quantified from comparative analysis of companies annual reports and statistics of the Czech statistical office and CzechInvest. Real benefit of primary created job positions is reduced by inflow of foreign workers that are connected to the examined economic subjects. Correlative analysis displays the relation of foreign direct investment and regional unemployment rate. The impact of foreign investment is illustrated by share of new jobs in these subjects in total number of job positions in the region. Based on the comparative analysis of data from 2002 - 2013, there is clear evidence that foreign direct investment has had share 5 % in average and created average of 20,000 job positions that have been filled from 97 % by local inhabitants.","[Kotikova, Sylvie] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 41617, Czech Republic; [Cuhlova, Renata] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Business, Liberec 41617, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; Technical University Liberec,"Kotíková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1492-2, Liberec 41617, Czech Republic.",sylvie.kotikova@tul.cz; renata.cuhlova@tul.cz,"Cuhlova, Renata/ABH-3653-2020","Cuhlova, Renata/0000-0002-5109-6693",,,,,12,3,3,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,129,135,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-16,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300016,0

Using the math in environmental economics helps to determine and describe the most important connections. There are three main phases of mathematical modeling: 1. Defining goals and objectives of the research, describing of the object in the form of economic model. 2. Formulating the mathematical model of the studied object. 3. Data processing and analyzing. Modern methods of optimization are often treated with the help of high-level mathematics. At the same time, there are quite simple algorithms for finding the minimum (maximum) of the function. A description of the sequence of actions in the algorithmic language with elements of mathematics provides a big degree of freedom for the programmer, leaving behind him an opportunity of independent choice of programming language. For solving optimization problems programmer mathematician must consider the real opportunities of computer taking into account specifies of the algorithm. In optimization theory, there are three main classes of problems: unconstrained optimization; constrained optimization problem; optimization problems with incomplete data. Depending on the type of function, which will be optimized isolated linear programming problem and a convex programming problems (in these tasks f and X are convex). The most effective algorithms for non-convex multi-extermal and discrete optimization problems have not found yet. Practical examples of nonlinear programming problems are widespread in economic activity. Gradient projection method is not devoid of features and the specific application. Nevertheless, using of this algorithm is effective respect to a convex programming problem, where the system of conditions appears as a rather simple convex set. Among the many modern programming languages, one of the most convenient for scientific computing is a scripting language Python. Language is similar to MATLAB and good for programming mathematical calculations. And Python is able to work with languages such as Fortran, C and C ++ which are already widely used in scientific calculations. There are a large number of modules written in Python, which simplify the process of calculating (NumPy, SymPy and others).","[Vasilev, Julian] Varna Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria; [Turygina, Victoria F.; Kosarev, Andrew I.; Nazarova, Yuliia Y.] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Sverdlovskaya O, Russia",University of Economics Varna; Ural Federal University,"Vasilev, J (通讯作者)，Varna Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria.",,"Vasilev, Julian A/E-1244-2017; Turygina, Victoria/ABA-1487-2021","Vasilev, Julian A/0000-0002-6146-746X; Turygina, Victoria/0000-0001-5357-6589; Petrova, Desislava/0000-0001-8007-2490",,,,,1,6,6,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,349,355,,,,,,7,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200045,0

It has left as a result massive forced displacements, destruction of the social capital and indiscriminate logging of forests in regions affected by illicit crops and a strong presence of illegal armed groups supported by drug trafficking. In spite of a number of national policies and programs against illicit crops, the issue still persists, along with all the social implications it carries with. This paper presents a model for planning rural development projects in regions with illicit crops. The methodology applied is based on the model Working With People (WWP) and integrates the knowledge and experience gathered throughout the implementation of various projects in the region of La Macarena, Colombia. It takes into account eight years of continuous work with the communities, in one of the areas of greatest social unrest in Colombia, due to illicit crops, on-going criminal activity and violence by illegal armed groups and a weak presence of State institutions. Some of the factors hindering successful advancement of rural development policies include the breakdown of the social fabric, deterioration of moral values, family disintegration and lack of confidence. The conceptual framework applied integrates elements from policy analysis and social learning (Friedmann, 1991; Cazorla et al., 2015), proposed as a reaction from traditional and ineffective social reform models (Friedmann, 1991) developed in this type of scenarios. Following a thorough review of rural development planning theories regarding illicit crops areas, we carried out an analysis of the experience in the Macarena region under the WWP model. The results show the effects of the WWP model and the necessity to develop a strategy for the eradication of illicit crops in a post-conflict scenario, taking into account various social variables. Findings denote a greater relevance of the ethical-social and political-contextual dimensions in terms of sustainable rural development. Trust building, the enhancement of social relationships and direct interaction with target communities are the basic factors to the reconstruction of the social fabric and value systems, fostering sustainable rural development and stabilization.","[Ceron, Carlos Alberto Avila; Rivera, Maria] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Agroforestry Dept, Sustainable Rural Dev, Escuela Super Ingn Agonomos, Ave Complutense S-N, Madrid, Spain; [De Los Rios-Carmenado, Ignacio] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Agroforestry Dept, Rural Dev, Escuela Super Ingn Agonomos, Madrid, Spain; [Martin, Susana] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Acad & Fac Planning, Escuela Super Ingn Montes, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Rivera, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Agroforestry Dept, Sustainable Rural Dev, Escuela Super Ingn Agonomos, Ave Complutense S-N, Madrid, Spain.",carlosalberto.avila.ceron@alumnos.upm.es; ignacio.delosrios@upm.es; maria.rivera@upm.es; susana.martin@upm.es,"Rivera, Maria/GYU-2150-2022; Martin, Susana/E-9200-2016; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/AAR-5700-2020; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/HGD-4203-2022; Rivera, María/AAF-1530-2020","Martin, Susana/0000-0002-7240-1650; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2015-8983; DE LOS RIOS CARMENADO, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2015-8983; Rivera, María/0000-0003-0642-0818",,,,,24,0,0,1,7,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.085,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800088,0

The fundament of this work was a creation of a multi period balance model and formation of ten variants of the individual projects which differ in production volume and mean of financing. The main evaluation criterion of the deterministic calculations was a net present value which takes into consideration the time factor and belongs among the dynamic methods. By means of sensitivity and simulation analysis is possible to identify an appropriate investment strategy under the risk conditions. The risk factors, which were identified by sensitivity analysis, are defined as random variables with certain probability distribution. Critical values of target criterion give information value which we can expect with willingness to tolerate given risk quantification. The comparison of distribution functions of investment alternatives allows the identification of the optimal strategy. On the basis of the gained results we came to the conclusion that the purchase of the pelletisation line is a profitable investment which can increase the value of the company itself.","[Repisky, Jozef; Gracova, Maria] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Repisky, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra, Slovakia.",jozef.repisky@uniag.sk; maria.gracova@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.087,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800090,0

Consequently there were formed many different types of landscape according to the degree human use, from a completely natural landscape, to completely transformed human. The intensity of human influence has been given by the historical development of a specific territory and largely confined just by its natural conditions. The main reason for examining the historical development of the landscape is the fact that understanding the past, we can better understand the future development. The theme of land use and landscape structure is extremely wide as well as very important and it is the basic issue in all scientific disciplines related to the landscape. Changes in the use of agricultural land brought about the end of the 20th century led to the transformation of EU Common Agricultural Policy. Land managers can benefit from financial support for the implementation of measures to increase the stability of the agricultural landscape.

Due to aggressive environment this occurrence is frequent in concrete articles used for tiding surroundings: concrete paving blocks, slabs, curbs used for streets, parking places and pavements. Frequently, the main reason of deterioration is that concrete products are produced from the different concrete composition like samples, which have been used for certification. There are standard methods to estimate the amount of cement in concrete and to do a determination of air void characteristics in hardened concrete, but there are no methods how to estimate the amount and type of aggregates in concrete. For this reason, a new method was created. For the testing, the deteriorating paving zone, which had been built three years ago, was selected. The types of aggregates used in the production of concrete paving blocks have been estimated analyzing the cuts of the blocks. The test results show that the main aggregate, used for concrete paving block production, is gravel and it was used in higher amount as declared, while the granite breakstone and crushed gravel was used for production in lesser amount. In this case, the producer applying different amounts of aggregates reduced cost price as well as worsened the properties of concrete.","[Gurskis, Vincas; Sadzevicius, Raimondas; Ramukevicius, Dainius] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Hydraul Engn, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania; [Skominas, Rytis] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Hydraul Construct Engn, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Gurskis, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Hydraul Engn, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania.",vincas.gurskis@asu.lt; rytis.skominas@asu.lt; raimondas.sadzevicius@asu.lt; dainius.ramukevicius@asu.lt,"Šadzevičius, Raimondas/AAH-5896-2019; Skominas, Rytis/AAD-8352-2022","Skominas, Rytis/0000-0002-6754-9458",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.009,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800109,0

Based on these characteristics, clusters are then created, incorporating the most and least similar characteristics of regions into individual clusters. In successive steps of the method, clusters of regions with the most similar characteristics are thus created, reflecting simultaneous and mutual interactions of the different characteristics of the investigated group. A comparison was made based on the relative values of the indicators in each group of indicators after recalculating per the population number in each region in order to assess the economic and social level of regions in 2000 and in 2012. According to the findings of the evaluation, regions were divided into different groups: regions of high performance, stabilized, lagging and underdeveloped. Within that division, the regions with the highest similarity, but also with the same or very similar problems were then included in individual clusters. This classification subsequently allows applying similar techniques to individual regions within clusters, especially when it comes to the allocation of funds from the state budget or the budget of the European funds within the state regional policy.","[Mertlova, Libuse] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Econ Studies, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic; [Prokop, Martin] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Math, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava; College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Mertlová, L (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Econ Studies, Tolsteho 16, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic.",mertlova@vspj.cz; Martin.Prokop@vspj.cz,,,,,,,8,6,6,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,56,63,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-6,0.0,,,8,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300006,0

In total there were 1024 questionnaires distributed out of which 418 were analysed for the research purposes along with 224 filled on the Internet. Different services of riparian forest ecosystems were used by 88 % of respondents, mostly walking along rivers and swimming were mentioned. Respondents evaluated three different scenarios of forest management and 96% of them gave preference to the scenario which required implementation of sustainability criteria resulted in high diversity of species and an increase of esthetical values. Large part (61 %) of respondents accepted the idea of voluntary work to improve the condition of rivers and riparian forests and in average there were ready to work 3.8 days per year. Willingness to pay (WTP) to improve the situation of riparian forests and rivers close to a residence place of a respondents was expressed by 62 % of respondents, in the average 28.50 Euro per year was mentioned. The current research is a starting point for evaluation of riparian forest ecosystems and provides valuable information for further analyses.

The energy efficiency is an important indicator of sustainability of agricultural processes. The energy-saving agriculture is a priority of the new Rural Development Programme in 2014-2020. Even though the analysis counts with main direct energy inputs into the crop production (fertilizers, fuels and pesticides), the methodology of the energy efficiency for commodities and farms uses all indirect non-renewable energy inputs spent on production of buildings and machinery. The analysis covered 24 EU countries. The change in the energy efficiency in time was calculated through the Malmquist index. Clustering using medoids revealed groups of countries with similar energy efficiency. The Malmquist index identified the United Kingdom, Portugal and Sweden as countries with the most dynamic positive change in energy efficiency of the crop production in time. On the contrary, Baltic States and Poland experienced the most dynamic decline of energy efficiency. However, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland significantly increased the Malmquist index in recent years, partly as a consequence of effective investments from the Rural Development Programme (RDP). The energy efficiency indicator that includes direct and indirect energy inputs is supposed as suitable indicator for RDP's ex-post evaluation.","[Spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Dept Strategy, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Praha, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Strategy, Fac Business Adm, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Praha, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague, project Financial reporting systems analysis and identification of the impact on the company's financial indicators [F3/34/2015]","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague, project Financial reporting systems analysis and identification of the impact on the company's financial indicators","The paper was supported by the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague, project Financial reporting systems analysis and identification of the impact on the company's financial indicators, No. F3/34/2015.",,20,5,5,1,5,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.099,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800126,0

The accuracy of ARBOTOM r 3-D tree tomograph in detecting decay was evaluated for 703 standing trees in 27 Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. Trees were measured at three different heights, 0 m, 1 m, and 2 m above the ground. Sections were later inspected for the presence of decay by increment borings and wood croscuts. A system of stochastic differential equations and multivariate normal copula density function were used to develop decay detecting rule. In the present study, the Vasicek stochastic process was employed to analyze propagation velocity data of the stress wave that diffuses through the wood of damaged and healthy tree stems in standing trees. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck family stochastic processes offer a possibility of capturing important distributional differences between damaged and healthy trees stress wave velocity datasets and make the model flexible to internal decay of a tree stem. The study reveals that the Vasicek type stochastic process is a possible candidate for statistical classification of waveforms. After the conditional probability density functions to ratio of difference maximal and minimal propagation velocities to minimal and maximal propagation velocity were established, a bivariate normal copula distribution model was constructed. The results are implemented in the symbolic computational language MAPLE.","[Visalga, Gintaras; Petrauskas, Edmundas; Rupsys, Petras] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Forest Management & Wood Sci, Fac Forestry & Ecol, Studenu G 13, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Visalga, G (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Forest Management & Wood Sci, Fac Forestry & Ecol, Studenu G 13, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania.",gintaras.visalga@gmu.lt; edmundas.petrauskas@asu.lt; petras.rupsys@asu.lt,"Rupšys, Petras/AAB-9429-2019; Rupšys, Petras/I-5255-2019","Rupšys, Petras/0000-0002-1738-2039;",,,,,11,1,1,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.057,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800017,0

The paper analyses basic socio-economic conditions of the development of cross-border cooperation between the Slovak Republic and Ukraine, and addresses a possible scenario of development of cross-border cooperation, also discussing the strategic objective of cross-border cooperation. Methodology of the paper is similar to that of the strategy, and both these involve elements of system analysis and comparative approach. We also used statistical and normative methods, and in the final part we used a method of vision. A very important method for developing an overall summary of our assumptions was the SWOT analysis method, which clearly pointed to the problem areas but also opportunities of their development. In the final part we pay attention to the possible impact of the strategy on everyday life of citizens and how to increase their quality of life. We evaluate the development strategy as a very important document, which can help to develop not only the border areas but also the wider area far beyond national borders.

Today sustainable development strategies are under reconstruction by global governance bodies together with stakeholders from around the world, concerning the main issue of durable future. Agriculture as main provider of public goods, recently had experienced pressure from public society and entered the debates for an essential review of the underlying support principles, based on multifunctionality, which hardly meet the goals of sustainable development. Recently some evidence appeared that the gap between multifunctionality and sustainability might be closed with help of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The paper aims to disclose the challenges and incentives which accelerated the origination of CSR concept and related discussions in an agrarian discourse through the provision of public goods. Systemic analysis and synthesis of theoretical insights of foreign and local scientific literature and the methods of induction and deduction were applied to investigate the theoretical aspect and characteristics of CSR and public goods in agrarian discourse. Theoretical research results propose that the concept of CSR does provide a basis for further analysis and discussion concerning the role of agriculture as a subject of government support from a broader systems perspective, which means a shift in paradigms, emphasized by movement from the sectoral policy and agricultural support to a more inclusive place-based development.","[Vilke, Rita; Pareigiene, Lina; Stalgiene, Aldona] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos G 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Vilke, R (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos G 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania.",laei@laei.lt; lina.pareigiene@laei.lt; aldona.stalgiene@laei.lt,,"Stalgiene, Aldona/0000-0002-9791-7864",Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-098/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-098/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,45,1,1,0,4,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.120,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800065,0

Taking into consideration the fact that our country has a large number of different minerals, but they are being mined in limited capacities, then their impact is low in reducing unemployment and in general to impact the economic development of our country. Various analysis have confirmed the fact that mineral resources of the country should be utilized according to the laws and best practices and consequently their use creates the possibility of establishing new enterprises and recovery of the existing ones, and in this way will result in reducing unemployment through the employment of a certain number of personnel in these enterprises.

In conclusion, the author made a comparison of obtained research results with the method of evaluation of development in the regions - the so-called dispersion of regional GDP per capita in PPS. The methods used have both proven, that within the Czech and Slovak regions regional disparities can be identified, which are in the Czech Republic (unlike in SR) gradually eliminated.

Chi square criteria (chi(2)), significance level p < 0.05 are applied for comparison of results. 76 people unready for labor market in Sakiai region participate in this research: 32 of them are young people under 25 years of age, 18 - returnees from imprisonment, 26 - disabled persons; 36 men and 40 women. Majority of respondents have secondary education, however, only 11.1 % of all returnees from imprisonment are in this group. The researched of all the three groups give preference to the second - modern definition of career. Labor Exchange Office or their own decisions have impact on the respondents mostly. It is worth pointing out that Labor Exchange Office has stronger impact on the disabled (57.7 %) while the youth under 25 tend to decide themselves (53.1 %). Other factors do not have significant influence. The first four learning motives are the most significant to all the three groups of the researched, the least attractive motives are, I am studying for prestige and, Random circumstances determined intention to study. It is unexpected that the motive, I intend to go to further education is of little importance for the young people. People with disabilities and former prisoners have stronger motivation to learn than unemployed young people under 25 do.

The research demonstrated serious territorial differences in the amount and structure of European funds acquired by agricultural holdings in poviats located in the WarminskoMazurskie voivodeship. Two indices were used in the study: poviat activity (comparison of the number of applications submitted) and absorption of funds in agricultural holdings (comparison of the number of payments made) which were considered together as a composite index of EU fund utilisation, whereby the funds acquired in the periods of 2004-2006 and 2007-2010 were treated separately. A holistic analysis was also carried out and it included the entirety of European Programme Measures, with special attention paid to the differences between spatial patterns observed between 2004 and 2010 per 1 ha of forest. Additionally, a co-relation between poviat activity, payments made and forest land area was analysed. The study included also the relationship between the absorption index and the forest land area. It has been shown that the Common Agricultural Policy [Polish: WPR] instruments dedicated for pro-ecological agricultural activities in poviats of the Warminsko-Mazurskie voivodship - mostly with regard to afforestation - contribute to spatial changes in the land use structure.","[Ogryzek, Marek] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Geodesy Geospatial & Civil Engn, Dept Planning & Spatial Engn, Prawochenskiego Str 15, PL-10720 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Ogryzek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Geodesy Geospatial & Civil Engn, Dept Planning & Spatial Engn, Prawochenskiego Str 15, PL-10720 Olsztyn, Poland.",marek.ogryzek@uwm.edu.pl,"Ogryzek, Marek/A-5785-2016","Ogryzek, Marek/0000-0002-7493-5488",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.048,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800122,0

The objective of the research was to identify the potato coverage differences spraying the biological product biokal1 with specific equipment Lechler Dropleg(UL) for spraying the biological product under the leaves and various nozzles. In earlier stages of potato growth, the specific equipment Lechler Dropleg(UL) and deflection nozzles Lechler FT 1.0 for spraying the product under the leaves of cultural plants better covers potato stems and the underside of upper leaves. In the control group, where the ultimate slit flat flow nozzles Hardi ISO F/LD-05-110 were used, droplets of the biological product covered 4.8 +/- 1.7 % of potato stem area only, the Dropleg(UL) and three nozzles (LU-120-02 from the top and two deflection nozzles Lechler FT 1.0 from the bottom) covered even 55.8 +/- 39.1 %. Accordingly, plants of the control group had only 0.1 +/- 0.1 % of the underside area of the upper leaves covered with the product, while using Dropleg(UL) and three nozzles such area reached 1.5 +/- 1.1 %. In later stages of potato growth, specific equipment Lechler Dropleg(UL) with deflection nozzles Lechler FT 1.0 for spaying under the leaves of cultural plants better covered the underside of upper leaves of potatoes only. The usage of double flow nozzles Lechler DF-120-02 on Dropleg(UL) and ultimate slit flat flow nozzles LU-120-02 on a spraying boom gave rather small differences in coverage of the surface compared the control group, where the ultimate slit flat flow nozzles Hardi ISO F/LD-05-110 were used.","[Sniauka, Povilas; Zinkevicius, Remigijus] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Agr Engn, Inst Agr Engn & Safety, Studentu G 15, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Zinkevicius, R (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Agr Engn, Inst Agr Engn & Safety, Studentu G 15, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania.",povilas.sniauka@asu.lt; remigijus.zinkevicius@asu.lt,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800078,0

That is the preferences of the entrants do not depend on their zodiac symbol, and hence date of birth. However, the presence of some detected dependences between the preferences of entrants and date of birth is interesting.

The forest is seen as a remedy in this struggle as a cure medicine to influence the CO2 circuit, or other substances having a screening effect, in order to reflect solar radiation, which is why it should be preserve, enhance and extend it as far as possible. Current interest is no longer a priority for forest economics, but for the environment. At the global scale, forests are heavily cut down and will be destroyed further, because mankind is unable or is not prepared to resolve the crisis of industrial wood by retrofitting and replacing it with other materials. In addition, the LDCs countries from hot areas of the globe turn to the forest as their only means of subsistence.

For the sake of comparison, countries with one, two, or three levels of territorial self-government have been selected. Fiscal decentralization plays a significant role in procuring local public services because the expenditures are more adjusted to local priorities and preferences.

These findings have been confirmed by matrix, where European regions have been classified by increase/decrease figures of whole population, and by the relationships between regional disposable income of households and EU average. Hence, the disposable income of households can be considered as one of the relevant factors which influence the attractiveness of the region.","Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Mateja, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",Zdenek.Mateja@upce.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,238,244,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-32,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300032,0

Russia is one of the world's leading producers of oil and natural gas and is also a top exporter of metals such as steel and primary aluminum. Russia's commodity based economy is vulnerable to endogenous and exogenous economic shocks and crisis. It is demonstrated that extraction of fuel and non-fuel mineral resources in 1995-2015 follows economic booms and downturns, although not strictly in the same way. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and general decrease of Russia's economy, an extraction, domestic usage and export of mineral resources decreased too. After the beginning of the restoration of economy in the midst 1990-ties, the production of the majority of mineral resources began to grow. Russia's economy had averaged 7% growth during 1998-2008 as oil prices rose rapidly. Since then a moderate decrease in mineral production was registered because of the world financial crisis. The period of stagnation was short and in 2009-2010 the revival of the mineral industry of Russia began again. A combination of falling oil prices, international sanctions, and structural limitations pushed Russia into a new long recession from 2012 to 2015. Consequences of this downturn for the mineral industry are examined in the article. Commodity-based economy is characterized by significant environmental impact that follows boom and bust economic cycles. Such key features of Russia's economy as the efficient use of natural resources, reduction of pollution, and low carbon emissions are considered. To study the existence of decoupling effect, changes in resources consumption and environmental pressure are compared with the rate of GDP growth.","[Korobitsyn; Kuklin] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Korobitsyn] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Ind Ecol, Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Kuklin] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Sverdlovskaya O, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Industrial Ecology UB RAS; Ural Federal University,"Korobitsyn (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.;Korobitsyn (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Ind Ecol, Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,453,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200058,0

The reason for this interpretation was a different approach by the entities in accounting for costs associated with the removal of the overlying rock in the production phase of surface mines. Some entities accounted for such costs as expenses related to the production, while other entities considered these expenses for the cost elements of a surface mines value, which is gradually charged with the life cycle of the mine. Costs associated with the removal of the overlying rock is that part of the production, with which will be removed a layer of soil covering natural resources -ore, coal. This layer of soil may not be a waste in any case, as it may contain a portion of the natural resource. This natural source may or may not reach the desired economic quality. In both cases, however, it may be involved in the formation of inventory or contributing to the release of deposit with higher content of natural resources that will be mined in future periods. The costs will be accounted for as noncurrent assets, as they contribute to the release of deposit and it is probable that the economic benefit of mining will flow to the entity and the entity can identify the extraction element on which was the access improved. Interpretation IFRIC 20 is primarily focused on reporting of the costs associated with the removal of the overlying rock layers during the production phase of the property and on the initial and subsequent valuation of such assets. Slovak accounting legislation does not distinguish between the specific costs associated with the removal of the overlying rock layers during the production phase. Two methods are used in the paper -the analysis of the present state and the, comparison of these two approaches of accounting. In conclusion, recommendations are formulated to Slovak accounting legislation to ensure that the accounting will give a true and fair view of the facts constituting its matter.","[Tusan, Radoslav] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Tusan, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",,"Tusan, Radoslav/C-3024-2016",,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,107,114,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200014,0

For these reasons, research studies on the efficient operation of logistics systems, including the role of transport packaging in it, become increasingly important. However, if establishing new or enhancing existing food logistics systems and supply chains, one has to deal with a number of factors that hinder the fast introduction and operation of a logistics system for reusable transport packaging. Inability to agree, a lack of cooperation at all stages of the logistics chain as well as the different retail trade systems for a number of food products are among the most important factors hindering the fast and simultaneous introduction of this system in the largest regional territories. The research aim is to examine the logistics systems for reusable transport packaging and to identify opportunities for their development in the Baltic States. Specific research tasks: to summarise and examine the experience built up in establishing logistics systems for reusable transport packaging; to stress the need to establish a pool system and to introduce reverse logistics; to identify opportunities for the development of logistics for reusable transport packaging in the Baltic States.

An 8 year research (2006-2013) was conducted to evaluate the relationships between differently fertilized cultivated plant rotations. The research was conducted in Lipliunai (Lithuania) in the agroecosystem with nitrogen metabolism in fields with deeper carbonaceous soil, i.e. Endocalcari Endohypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-n-w-can). The research area covered three drained plots where crop rotation of differently fertilized cereals and perennial grasses was applied. Samples of soil, water and plants were investigated in the Chemical Analysis Laboratory of the Aleksandras Stulginskis University certified by the Environment Ministry of the Republic of Lithuania. The greatest productivity was found in a crop rotation with higher fertilization (N32-140). In crop rotation with lower fertilization (N24-90) productivity of cereals and perennial grasses (N0-80) was 11-35 % lower. The highest amount of mineral soil nitrogen was found in cereal crop rotation with higher fertilization. It was influenced by fertilization and crop productivity. The lowest N-min and N-total concentrations in drainage water were found in grasses crop rotation. Crop rotations of differently fertilized cereals increased nitrogen concentration in drainage water. N-min concentration in water depended on crop productivity, quantity of mineral soil nitrogen, fertilization, and nitrogen balance. The lowest nitrogen leaching was found in the crop rotation of grasses. Cereal crop rotation increased nitrogen leaching by 12-42 %. The usage of all crop rotations resulted in a negative nitrogen balance, which essentially depended on fertilization with nitrogen fertilizer.","[Guzys, Saulius; Miseviciene, Stefanija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Water Resources Engn, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Miseviciene, S (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Water Resources Engn, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania.",saulius.guzys@asu.lt; stefanija.miseviciene@asu.lt,,,,,,,24,0,0,4,9,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.058,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800019,0

Field experiments were conducted in 2011-2013 at the Experimental Station of Aleksandras Stulginskis University in carbonate shallow gleyic leached soil, (Calc(ar) i-Epihypogleyic Luvisol). The object of the investigation was winter wheat cultivars 'Zentos' and 'Ada'. In sowing time the wheat was treated with granular superphosphate (P-60) and potassium chloride (K-60), and in spring, after the vegetative growth had resumed, in tillering time (BBCH 23-15) with ammonium nitrate (N-60). Additionally, foliar fertilizer urea solution was used: N-30, N-40 at booting stage (BBCH 34-36) and N-15, N-30 at milk ripening stage (BBCH 71-74). It has been established that application of nitrogen fertilizer at booting and milk ripening stages increased the yield of wheat cultivars 'Zentos' and 'Ada' (0.06-1.74 and 0.41-1.74 t ha(-1)). The correlation and regression analysis confirmed that wheat grain yield statistically significantly correlated with nitrogen fertilizer application rates. The correlative relationships were very strong (r = 0.983 and r = 0.987).

From the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Greeks, the Serbs and the Romanians gradually liberated themselves from the Turkish yoke. At the same time the independent Churches of Free Greece, Serbia and the Romanian principalities arose. Now by the 1870s the Bulgarians were the only Orthodox nation in the Balkans that had not achieved some measure of political independence through revolution. By the same token, however, they were the only nation that had not been divided by revolution. Of the Balkan Christian nations in 1871, only the Bulgarians had no independent State or stateless. Almost all Bulgarians were all living within the borders of one State - the Ottoman Empire. Parallel to the movement for political independence was a movement for ecclesiastical independence. On 1867 the Constantinopolitan Patriarch Gregory VI proposed a project for the creation of a separate Bulgarian exarchate, but no meeting of minds was achieved on this project. On May 11, 1872, after the Gospel during the Liturgy, which was celebrated in Constantinople by the exarch, together with the other Bulgarian bishops and many clergy, an act signed by the Council of seven Bulgarian bishops was proclaimed, the Bulgarian Church was independent. On September 16, in its third session, the Constantinopolitan Council confirmed the decision according to which all the Bulgarian hierarchs with their clergy and laity were declared schismatics, and the whole of the Bulgarian Church was declared schismatic. Due to of ethnic identity, Archdiocese of Athens condemned irrevocably Bulgarian Church; other churches have proceeded with caution. Churches: Romanian, Russian and Serbian although, looking with sympathy Bulgarian cause, point of view formal-canonical, could not fail to comply with the decision of the Synod in Constantinople, an independent initiative being equivalent to unlawful interference in the internal life of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Therefore, the fate of the Bulgarian Church remained for decades, uncertain. Romanians proved to be every time, those closest supporters of the Bulgarian cause. If the political and cultural Romanian state was the one who leaned more on addressing the Bulgarian people in the plane of spiritual life, the Romanian Orthodox Church was, throughout the Bulgarian - Constantinople ecclesiastical conflict, who supported the wishes of his sister south of the Danube. Precedents existed until then, but not the magnitude of the nineteenth century. For example, taking of typographic activity, now they were printed in the Romanian Principalities, the main religious books and intended to illuminate the people. A more eloquent proof and Romanian-Bulgarian ties, during the period Exarchate, is the alternative gift - along with the Serbian Church - the Holy and Great Myrrh, between 1923 and 1945 (until then, it had made Moscow).","[Vlad, Maxim Marian] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Theol, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Vlad, MM (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Theol, Constanta, Romania.",,"Vlad, Marian Maxim/HSI-3572-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,1039,1046,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200134,0

Having examined humidity of pellets, it was found that maximum moisture content was in pellets of elephant grass and nettle - from 13.1 to 13.2%, while the smallest - in orchard grass pellets 10.0%. The largest density of non-conventional energetic pellet density was orchard - 983.8 kg m(-3) DM (dry matter) and common mugwort - 926.7 kg m(-3) DM, and density of elephant grass pellets was the lowest - 619.3 kg m(-3) DM. Results on resistance to deformability of non-conventional energetic crops granules indicate that the highest resistance against external forces is a pellet made of common mugwort: they decompose to 110.03 N force. Pellets of other plants disintegrate to smaller external force: fibrous nettle granules - to 90.6 N, orchard - to 67.3 N force. Elephant grass pellets have the smallest resistance to deformation and decompose more quickly (at 20 N). The research results show that pellets made of elephant grass are of the lowest quality; due to this, it is not recommended to use these plants in the form of pellets.","[Jasinskas, Algirdas; Sarauskis, Egidijus; Gutautaite, Asta] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Agr Engn & Safety, Fac Agr Engn, Studentu G 15, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania; [Masek, Jiri] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, CZ-16521 Prague 6, Czech Republic",Vytautas Magnus University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Jasinskas, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Agr Engn & Safety, Fac Agr Engn, Studentu G 15, LT-53362 Akademija, Kaunas Raj, Lithuania.",algirdas.jasinskas@asu.lt; egidijus.sarauskis@asu.lt; asta.gutautaite@gmail.com; masekj@tf.czu.cz,"Sarauskis, Egidijus/AAD-8552-2019; Jasinskas, Algirdas/ABB-9269-2020","Sarauskis, Egidijus/0000-0001-9339-769X; Jasinskas, Algirdas/0000-0002-2757-0236",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.008,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800108,0

One of the most common technologies for identification of forest tree species and monitoring of forest growth conditions is the hyperspectral remote sensing. This technology gives an opportunity to economize human resources and time for data collecting and processing. The spectral behaviour of plant leaves depends on number of factors, including environmental background. The aim of this study was to assess the tree reflectance spectra in relation to the growth conditions to take into account potential differences for increasing precision of species identification in Latvian forests and for estimating of forest growth conditions. Remote sensing data were obtained using a specialized aircraft (Pilatus PC-6), which is equipped with a high-performance airborne VNIR pushbroom hyperspectral system (AisaEAGLE). The study area was flown at 1000 m altitude. Data was recorded in the 400-970 nm spectral range, spectral resolution was 3.3 nm, ground resolution 0.5 m. Data processing consisted of manually selecting trees with a recognizable tree crowns in the airborne images. Tree centres were adjusted by putting them in the accurate position according to the situation in aerial photography. All trees with a diameter at breast height DBH of more than 5 cm were measured and for each tree coordinates, its species, height, DBH, crown width and length were recorded. Differentially corrected Global Positioning System measurements were used to determine the position of each plot centre. Data from different hyperspectral bands were compared using ANOVA at confidence level 95 %. Four species: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), and European aspen (Populus tremula L.) - were examined in distinct forest site types. The spectral response of studied species was 1) different between species and 2) different between site types within each species, correlating with soil fertility gradient and soil moisture gradient. Differences between species occurred most in the intensity of reflected electromagnetic radiation rather than distinctive locations of maximums or minimums in spectrum curve, and near infrared (NIR) region of spectrum showed more differences between species than visible light zone. Most informative wavebands for distinguishing differences between site types were 805 nm and 644 nm.","[Karlovska, Amanda; Alsina, Ina] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Agr, Liela St 2, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia; [Grinfelde, Inga] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Rural Engn, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia; [Prieditis, Gints] Latvia Univ Agr, Forest Fac, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia; [Roze, Daina] Natl Bot Garden Latvia, LV-2169 Salaspils, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Karlovska, A (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Agr, Liela St 2, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia.",amanda.karlovska@llu.lv; inga.grinfelde@llu.lv; ina.alsina@llu.lv; gints.prieditis@llu.lv; nbd@nbd.gov.lv,"Grīnfelde, Inga/AAL-4332-2020","Grīnfelde, Inga/0000-0002-3220-1777",European Regional Development Fund [2014/0050/2DP/2.1.1.1.0/14/APIA/VIAA/048],European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)),"This research was part of the project Technology for remote forest inventory using hyper spectral and LiDAR data (State Education Development Agency, Latvia University of Agriculture, contract number: 2014/0050/2DP/2.1.1.1.0/14/APIA/VIAA/048), funded by the European Regional Development Fund.",,44,1,1,0,8,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.045,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800115,0

However model experiments have shown that the role of the Okhotsk Sea ecosystem in the absorption of carbon dioxide is comparable to the absorption capacity of the overland boreal ecosystem of corresponding area.","[Shirkova, Elena E.; Shirkov, Eduard I.] Russian Acad Sci, Kamchatka Branch, Pacific Geog Inst, Far Eastern Branch, Moscow 117901, Russia","Pacific Geographical Institute of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences","Shirkova, EE (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Kamchatka Branch, Pacific Geog Inst, Far Eastern Branch, Moscow 117901, Russia.",,"Shirkova, Elena/E-9423-2016; Shirkov, Eduard/J-5882-2018","Shirkova, Elena/0000-0002-2206-8351; Shirkov, Eduard/0000-0003-0556-2152",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,531,537,,,,,,7,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200068,0

In recent years in Romania, religious tourism gets an outstanding spreading, being thus targeted specific geographical areas which possess a cultural-religious heritage with particular historical value. One can speak of such a religious tourism as a background, represented by the places of worship - on the first hand, and - on the other hand, by tourists, by the tourist flows which develop them, within certain periods of the year. The research has been based on economic data on data obtained from the consultation of some representative samples: tourists and resident population, analyzed by specific statistical methods. The partial results obtained underline the important impact of this idea of development, which may contribute to the increase of the complexity of these territorial functional systems, where this type of tourism might be implemented. Cultural tourism based on cultural-religious heritage and traditional values contribute to the appearance of the economic multiplication effects. The development of the tourist and cultural tourism can mean creating jobs within a period of economic crisis and relative social crisis. It can also be considered a factor in the popularization of cultural identity, which plays an important role in promoting cultural diversity.","[Teodorescu, Camelia; Pintilii, Radu-Daniel; Peptenatu, Daniel] Univ Bucharest, Fac Geog, CAIMT Res Ctr Integrated Anal & Terr Management, Bucharest, Romania; [Teodorescu, Octavian] Ion Mincu Univ Architecture & Urbanism, Bucharest, Romania; [Toma, George Sorin] Univ Bucharest, Fac Business & Adm, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Ion Mincu University of Architecture & Urbanism; University of Bucharest,"Teodorescu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Fac Geog, CAIMT Res Ctr Integrated Anal & Terr Management, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Peptenatu, Peptenatu Daniel/AFY-7834-2022; Daniel, Peptenatu/I-8237-2012; Pintilii, Radu-Daniel/F-3155-2012","Peptenatu, Peptenatu Daniel/0000-0002-4473-8969; Daniel, Peptenatu/0000-0002-4473-8969; Pintilii, Radu-Daniel/0000-0003-4514-9581",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,947,954,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200121,0

The main reason for this situation is the focus of neo-liberal concepts on the destruction of the agent economic environment: both natural and social. The accumulated experience of mankind shows that this problem can be solved by the usage of so-called complementary currencies (or community currencies). One of the main results of complementary currencies usage is stimulation of cooperation in society that lead to a social ecosystem formation. The other result is changing of the society relation to natural resources: it becomes economically viable to develop a less amount of non-renewable natural resources under a negative interest rate conditions. Thus, the use of complementary currencies in local communities changes the priorities of social and economic behavior of people, creating conditions for the formation of the natural eco-thinking. In order to promote such idea of thinking all over the place it is necessary to integrate it into the educational process. This paper is devoted to the development and application of training payment system, which solves the problem of eco-thinking education. Structure and functioning of educational payment system are described.

The MOBEE (MOBile Earthquake Exhibition) Project tackles a very problematic topic in regard to the present and future of Romania: the key role of education, in the perspective of a future major earthquake. The project is the only initiative of this kind in Romania, a country where the lessons of previous destructive earthquakes (of 1940 and 1977) seem to be neglected. One of the main goals of the exhibition is to provide a reliable, attractive and up-to-date source of information regarding earthquakes, leading to mitigation by education. The initiative translates modem approaches into science, arts and computer science into end-products with a direct impact in forming (awakening) and developing the interest for earth science. We provide an insight on how and why new technologies and concepts like large scale 3D printed maps and models, digital animations and app development, hands-on experiments or flexible content were put to use.

Originally the sacrament of penance was understood and practiced as reconciliation of those excommunicated, i.e., banished from the ecclesia the assembly of the People of God and its fulfillment in the Eucharist which is the Koinonia of the Body and Blood of Christ. The excommunicated is the one who cannot offer and, therefore, cannot receive. This reconciliation was a long process and the absolution its final seal, the signor image of repentance, i.e., of the rejection and condemnation by the penitent of his sin and alienation from God, of its real confession (manifestation, recognition) as sin.","[Vlad, Maxim Marian] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Theol, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Vlad, MM (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Theol, Constanta, Romania.",,"Vlad, Marian Maxim/HSI-3572-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,825,833,,,,,,9,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200105,0

Soil conditions: calcaric Leptosols soil type, loamy soil, slope of 2.0 to 4.2 degrees. Therefore the benefits of controlled crossings system to protect the soil from excessive compaction have been confirmed. Concentration of wheel tracks into permanent lines improved conditions for the movement of machinery on the field. Bearing capacity of soil increased in the areas of wheel tracks - penetration resistance of the surface soil layer in summer was 2.7 to 4.4 times higher in the parts of wheel tracks than in areas outside of tracks. In the parts of the area with random traffic penetration resistance was measured 1.9 times higher than in the parts without wheel tracks. Concentration of wheel tracks also contributed to improve the quality of soil tillage - the area without wheel tracks accounted for 68% of the land area when the working width of 6 m module was used. When measuring surface water runoff by rain simulator the water runoff occurred at 10.0 minutes, respectively at 11.6 minutes in the parts with wheel tracks, while in areas without wheel tracks the surface water runoff occurred after 29.6 minutes and the rate of water runoff was significantly lower in the parts without traffic than in the wheel tracks. Concentration of wheel tracks into permanent traffic lines may be one of the ways to increase the soil ability to absorb water during intense rainfall.","[Hula, Josef; Gutu, Dumitru] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Kovaricek, Pavel] Res Inst Agr Engn Pri, Prague 16101 6, Czech Republic; [Kroulik, Milan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Research Institute of Agricultural Engineering; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hula, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",hula@tf.czu.cz; gutu@zaspodchotuci.cz; pavel.kovaricek@vuzt.czz; kroulik@tf.czu.czz,,,"Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [QJ1520028, RO0614]","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)",Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic - Project no.

Other conflict lies in the ambivalence between the bearer of noise burden (municipalities and population) and relevant road administrator (regions).,"Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Paril, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",vilem@mail.muni.cz,"Pařil, Vilém/AAT-6280-2021; Pařil, Vilém/JKJ-2883-2023; Paril, Vilem/A-5681-2018","Pařil, Vilém/0000-0001-9623-1935; Paril, Vilem/0000-0001-9623-1935",,,,,33,3,3,1,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,596,602,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-80,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300080,0

The problem lies within this strict distinction between topics mentioned even though a municipality (being it a small village or larger town) is the heart of an economy and municipal office holds most of the power related to land development (ranging from urban planning, granting building permits to setting real estate tax). Because of a lack of holistic approach in my country we almost forgot about the role municipality has. In this presentation we try to combine several fields of study and summarize theoretical background via short review of literature that could help our cities adapt methods of urban economics with regards to real estate tax reform.

Beverages fortified with various functional ingredients are an important product category within the functional food segment. In this study tomato juice with various proportions of apple, carrot and sweet corn juice together with isomerised lycopene extract were used for formulation of functional beverages. Chemical composition and physicochemical properties of prepared juice blends was evaluated and a sensory analysis was conducted in order to identify the most acceptable blends. The addition of concentrated isomerised lycopene extract with beta-carotene to tomato juice as well as juice blends significantly increased the levels of lycopene and especially the levels of cis-lycopene in the final products. The content of total lycopene in the juice blends varied from 16.21 mg/100 g to 25.65 mg/100 g, whereas the content of cis-lycopene - from 9.16 to 14.46 mg/100 g. The juice blends containing apple juice had the lowest pH and the highest titratable acidity. Higher percentage of apple, sweet corn or carrot juice in the blends resulted in higher contents of TSS in the functional beverage. The addition of apple, carrot, and sweet corn juice significantly changed the initial color of the tomato juice. The lowest colour difference (Delta E) values had tomato-carrot juice blends (6.8-7.3), whereas the highest Delta E had tomato juice with 25 and 35 % of sweet corn juice (10.6 and 14.3, respectively). Sensory evaluation revealed that the most acceptable taste had tomato-apple juice blend with 35 % apple juice and tomato-carrot juice blend with 40 % carrot juice.","[Urbonaviciene, Dalia; Bobinaite, Ramune; Viskelis, Jonas; Viskelis, Pranas; Bobinas, Ceslovas] Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Inst Hort, Lab Biochem & Technol, Kauno G 30, LT-54333 Babtai, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture & Forestry,"Urbonaviciene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Inst Hort, Lab Biochem & Technol, Kauno G 30, LT-54333 Babtai, Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",d.urbonav@gmail.com; r.bobinaite@lsdi.lt; j.viskelis@lsdi.lt; biochem@lsdi.lt; c.bobinas@lsdi.lt,"Bobinas, Ceslovas/P-9909-2015; Bobinaite, Ramune/P-9851-2015; Viškelis, Jonas/AAV-5455-2020","Viškelis, Jonas/0000-0002-1074-8384",Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-62/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),"This work was supported by the grant from the Research Council of Lithuania, No. MIP-62/2015.",,16,0,0,0,0,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.029,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800042,0

Winter wheat grain yield significantly increased (0.27-0.4 t ha(-1)) under the effect of amino acids. The highest yield increases were obtained having applied amino acids at booting and heading growth stages. The statistical data analysis (x(extr).) evidenced that the highest yield and its quality would be attained with foliar feeding of winter wheat with amino acids fertilizers: at booting stage with 2.4 %, at heading stage with 1.47 %, and milk maturity stage with 1.39 % amino acids solution.","[Dromantiene, Ruta; Pranckietiene, Irena; Sidlauskas, Gvidas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Agroecosyst & Soil Sci, Fac Agron, Studentu G 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Dromantiene, R (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Agroecosyst & Soil Sci, Fac Agron, Studentu G 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania.",ruta.dromantiene@asu.lt; irena.pranckietiene@asu.lt; sgvidas@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.028,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800031,0

However, it is limited by several factors, e.g. a treatment of bonded surface. Structural adhesives are chemicals. It follows that there are significant differences in the mechanical properties among particular types. The aim of the research was to evaluate the mechanical properties of single-component epoxy adhesives used in the transportation industry. The effect of a surface treatment of the steel surface on bond strength was also evaluated. The tested sets were mutually compared using Anova F-test from the point of view of the influence on mechanical properties (the tensile strength of adhesives, the elongation of adhesives, the adhesive bond tensile lap-shear strength, the elongation of the adhesive bond, the impact strength and hardness). The results confirm the assumption about the different behaviour of one-component epoxy. An important part of the experiment was to evaluate the influence of the surface treatment on the bond strength. From the result of experiments it can be concluded that the adhesive SP492 (p = 0.1898) and B5103-3 (p = 0.4263) are resistant to different types of tested treatment of the bonding surface.","[Muller, Miroslav] Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Mat Sci & Mfg Technol, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Müller, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Dept Mat Sci & Mfg Technol, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",muller@tf.czu.cz,"Muller, Miroslav/Y-5127-2018","Muller, Miroslav/0000-0002-3460-4254",,,,,27,0,0,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.007,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800106,0

At the same time Poland's share in the EU agricultural production was only 5.79 %. In order to evaluate the differentiation level of agricultural productive potential as well as the effectiveness of its use a synthetic measurement was employed that used the TOPSIS method. The research was based on the statistical data obtained form the Main Statistical Office for the year 2011. Based on the synthetic measure 4 typological groups of regions were singled out due to their productive potential. The measure used ranged from 0.27 to 0.63 and for the majority of voivodships it did not exceed the average value for Poland. The research shows that Poland is also a country that is extremely diverse as regards the effectiveness of use of production capacity of agriculture. The synthetic measures showed here a strong differentiation ranging from 0 to 0.86.

The paper is determining especially the level of beet sugar production quota holder system concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. The paper provides the following findings. The European quota holder system is extremely concentrated and it is becoming more and more dominated by fewer players. Sugar quota is distributed among 19 EU-Member States. In this regard, the quota is generous, especially in relation to France, Germany, Poland and United Kingdom. In Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United Kingdom controlled by two or even one subject (companies, alliances). There is a large discrepancy between political efforts to distribute equitable R 1308/2013-sugar quotas among states and the actual reality of those distributions. While the EU-quota holder system does not indicate an extreme concentration, an analysis according to the headquarters' location and allocated quotas to owners of production capacities provides the evidence of extreme concentration.","[Smutka, Lubos; Rezbova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Rovny, Patrik] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Mkt & Trade, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz; rezbova@pef.czu.cz; patrik.rovny@gmail.com,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Rezbova, Helena/H-6979-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Rezbova, Helena/0000-0001-8306-7259","Grant Agency at the Faculty Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analysis of the sugar sector after abolition of the Common Market Organization [20141045]","Grant Agency at the Faculty Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analysis of the sugar sector after abolition of the Common Market Organization","This paper was supported by the Grant Agency at the Faculty Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analysis of the sugar sector after abolition of the Common Market Organization (nr. 20141045).",,18,1,1,0,5,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.110,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800036,0

There are only single scientific works devoted to the determination of an optimal number of students or postgraduates, depending on the needs of local labor-markets, but mainly oriented on the Russian specificity. In the article the purposes of predicting the number of students at universities are noted in general (viz. planning of profit from the sale of educational services, improving the quality of admission, change of staff, change of university positions in the rankings) and at Russian educational organizations in particular (viz. optimization of budgetary funds revenue, increase of efficiency of the university activity according to the results of internal monitoring of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, planning of results of activity of separate structural departments). We have analyzed statistics obtained during the enrollment campaigns of Southwest State University from 2005 till 2015. The problem of planning is presented as a multi-objective optimization task, since in planning it is necessary to take into account such confounding factors as, for example, the average score of applicants in the entrance tests, the popularity of educational program in society, the need of graduates in the labour-marker. The dependent variables were identified and eliminated from the accounting by using the methods of correlation analysis. By using the methods of cluster analysis educational programmes were divided into clusters, interpreted as separate groups with successful, intermediate and unsuccessful admission. The optimal variant of clustering is chosen by the method of expert evaluations. Thus we offer a tool for a decision-maker, which can make decision about continuation or discontinuance of admission for particular educational programm, based on the results of cluster analysis or obtained neural network.","[Zarubina, Natalia; Pykhtin, Aleksei; Ovchinkin, Oleg] Southwest State Univ, Kursk, Kurskaya Oblast, Russia",Southwest State University - Russia,"Zarubina, N (通讯作者)，Southwest State Univ, Kursk, Kurskaya Oblast, Russia.",,"Пыхтин, Алексей/ABG-4253-2021; Ovchinkin, Oleg/E-5036-2017; Pykhtin, Alexey/D-8761-2015","Ovchinkin, Oleg/0000-0002-9837-8604; Pykhtin, Alexey/0000-0002-8395-4517",,,,,12,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,931,937,,,,,,7,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200119,0

Water erosion destroys or damages a vast expanse of usable agricultural land every year. Conditions in the Czech Republic are characterized by high average slope of the land. It is reported that approximately half of land in the Czech Republic is threatened by water erosion. Water erosion is a natural process that cannot be fully prevented. In case of agricultural land an important option is suitable tillage, which may reduce symptoms of water erosion. The problem of water erosion of agricultural land is growing in the Czech Republic, which is mainly caused by the growth of wide areas of crops (maize). This is due to expansion of biogas power plants using parts of maize silage. The aim of paper is to evaluate and assess the crop stand establishment in conditions of resistance to water erosion. For this purpose, a field experiment was set up. This experiment affects the most widely used methods of maize cultivation in Central Bohemia region. It consists of six variants of crops and technologies stand establishment and control treatment without vegetation. To determine the surface runoff and erosive wash was used measurement by runoff microplots. From processed measurement the positive impact of reduced tillage on soil resistance to water erosion results can be confirmed. The consequence is a reduction of surface runoff and especially erosive washes of soil. Impact of ground cover with organic matter is favorable, even in case of conventional tillage. The results of the experiment are directly applicable to agricultural practices. Results of the experiment were used for the legislative recommendations of appropriate technology (wide-row crops on slopes).","[Novak, Petr] Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Masek, Jiri; Hula, Josef; Benes, Lukas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Kumhalova, Jitka] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Novák, P (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",novakpetr@tf.czu.cz; masekj@tf.czu.cz; hula@tf.czu.cz; benes@tf.czu.cz; kumhalova@fzp.czu.cz,"Novak, Petr/ABH-7442-2020; Kumhalova, Jitka/W-7869-2018","Kumhalova, Jitka/0000-0002-0867-411X",Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [QJ1520028],"Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic)",Supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic - Project no.

As a result, the wrong choice leads to the fact that the quality of the program is reduced in connection with the forced adjustment of its volume, depth and content. The decision-making process of the Master program choice is analyzed basing on the conceptual and methodological framework of Behavioral Economics. In the article students of technical and non-technical specialties are compared. Testable hypothesis implies the existence of wrong decisions when choosing specialties in both samples. The survey reveals the difference between the assessment of expected (decision) and actual (experience) utility of the chosen field of study both among technical and non-technical students. A modified version of The Career Decision-making Difficulties Questionnaire is used to identify the obstacles arising from the Master program choice. As a result, it can be highlighted that one of the tasks for universities is preparation of undergraduate students for choosing the Master program and programs of postgraduate education. Furthermore, particular attention should be paid directly to the decision-making process in order to give students the necessary tools for removing cognitive illusions.

Nowadays the humanity is confronting itself with a series of global problems, not only environmental ones. A lot of discussions on political, scientific and social levels did worldwide start some time ago in order to find solutions, which could be applicable to the developed as well as to the developing countries by taking into consideration regional differences. In the Brundtland Report 1987 for the first time the concept of sustainable development has been defined and then accepted as a possible solution for the global complex ecological, economical and social problems. In this regard Technology Assessment tries to give an answer to the question of which are the technologies that we need, and how do they integrate into environment and society. Technology Assessment brings together almost all scientific disciplines with the common goal of finding the best ways for sustainability operationalization, what actually means analysing the complex dynamic environmental, economic and social systems in order to discover developments which could lead to instabilities, putting in this way under question the world sustainability. Technology Assessment actually points out that there are new evaluation criteria for technological applications, that include not only technical and economic aspects, but also environmental and social ones. All these evaluation criteria should be considered in sustainability decision making processes, for which new pretty complex assessment methods would be necessary to be developed.","[Tulbure, Ildiko] Univ 1 December 1918, Alba Iulia, Romania; [Tulbure, Ildiko] Tech Univ Clausthal, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany",1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia; TU Clausthal,"Tulbure, I (通讯作者)，Univ 1 December 1918, Alba Iulia, Romania.;Tulbure, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Clausthal, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",,"Tulbure, Prof. Dr. Ildiko/AAN-5284-2021","Tulbure, Prof. Dr. Ildiko/0000-0003-0258-6108; Tulbure, Ildiko/0000-0003-4350-034X",,,,,14,0,0,1,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,577,584,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200074,0

It can be removed from wastewater by the use of flocculants. Phosphorus removal efficiency was estimated by treating wastewater with ferric sulphate flocculant, containing 11.5 percent of the active ingredient Fe3+ by weight. The research was conducted with wastewater pretreated in an aeration tank. Wastewater, containing 41.0 +/- 3.5 mg l(-1) of total phosphorus (TP), was dispensed into calibrated 1.0 liter containers with the following concentrations of flocculating agent: 0, 30, 75, 120, 150, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900 and 1,050 mg/l. The study showed that TP removal efficiency depends on the flocculant dose used for treatment. Increasing the flocculant dose decreases the efficiency of TP removal. One gram of Fe3+, given the flocculant dose of 40 gFe(3+)/m(3), removed 0.5 g/m(3) of TP, while 120 g/m(3) of the flocculant removed around 40 percent less. According to the dependence of total P removed on the flocculant dose calculated by its active ingredient Fe3+, ferric sulphate flocculant is the most effective at doses of up to 60-80 g/m(3) of Fe3+. The use of ferric sulphate may be limited by its impact on pH and sulphate concentrations in the effluent wastewater. If pH is not additionally adjusted, a maximum concentration of 70 g Fe3+/m(3) can be used in order to maintain the pH of wastewater above 6.5 and to keep final sulphate concentration below 300 mg/l. In summary, a maximum of 70 g Fe3+/m(3) can be used based on the total P removal efficiency and limiting factors. Such dose could remove 28 g total P/m(3) from the wastewater. Since the permissible total P concentration in effluent wastewater is 4.0 mg/l, it is reasonable to use the ferric sulphate flocculant, containing 11.5 % of Fe3+ as an active ingredient, for treating wastewater with an initial total P concentration of up to 32 mg/l.","[Gasiunas, Valerijus] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Pk G 6, LT-58102 Vilainiai, Kedainiai, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Gasiunas, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Pk G 6, LT-58102 Vilainiai, Kedainiai, Lithuania.",valerijus.gasiunas@asu.lt,,,"Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA) [VP2-1.3-UM-05-K-03-387]","Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA)","This material is based upon work supported by the Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA) under Grant No. VP2-1.3-UM-05-K-03-387.",,5,0,0,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.077,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800059,0

In Estonia, at the moment the AKIS structure is under discussion, because the linkages between AKIS actors are still weak. In Latvia the question is the influence inside AKIS system of three policies - for agriculture, for education and for science - giving as a result the weak cooperation between AKIS actors.

Based on sustainable agricultural production systems, organic farming proves that holding is economically viable, meets the exigent demands for healthy food and higher quality, guarantees the protection and enhancement of natural resources in the long run and forwards them unspoiled to future generations. Organic farms use crops and varieties that are well adapted to the environment, with a program of balanced fertilization, in order to maintain fertile soils with high biological activity, rotations of crops adapted to local conditions, associated cultures, green manures and other acknowledged organic practices. This paper addresses the issue of establishing the breakeven point in this type of farms, making a comparative analysis of organic vegetable farms of different economic dimensions in the South Region Muntenia. This analysis is based on data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and on data from the Ministry of Public Finances as operators for 2014. The methods of analysis used in this study are: comparison, indexes method, the method for determining the economic size of holdings. Breakeven analysis as a method of forecasting profit for changes in activity and production levels was also used. The indicators used for this study were: the balance point value (Critical Turnover), the safety range, the safety dynamic index, the coverage factor and the sampling index. After calculations it can be seen that the semi -subsistence farm has a critical turnover far above the obtained turnover, most of the turnover being used to cover fixed costs. Regarding small and medium commercial farms, they are in the safe range, managing to cover fixed costs and achieve profit. It can be noted that they can reduce their sales volume by 7.87% and 4.22% to reach the critical threshold. In conclusion, the agricultural holding that obtains the best level of achievement for the specific breakeven indicators is the small commercial farm.","[Costaiche, Georgiana Melania; Chihaia, Anisoara; Buzatu, Cristiana Silvia; Niculae, Ioana] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Costaiche, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",,"NICULAE, IOANA/HWQ-4562-2023; Chihaia, Anisoara/HZL-2908-2023","NICULAE, IOANA/0009-0002-2976-5587; Chihaia, Anisoara/0009-0001-7485-010X",,,,,8,0,0,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,99,106,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200013,0

During many years of discussion about how to deal with the huge architectural, ecological and social-cultural heritage of the Industrial age they have concluded that unconcerned destruction of former enterprises would lead to the loss of the entire historical layer. A way out has been found in re-use of buildings, museumification of the selected mining industrial territories, underground space, using them for recreation. The society's interest in such examples of the industrial past is related to their uncommon anthropogenic landscape, cultural value and educative resource. Despite many examples of re-use of mining-industrial heritage immovable items, consistent theoretical approaches to the estimation of cultural value and economic capacity of such objects have not been developed by now. Consequently, they try to convert every plant that ceased its industrial activity into a monument thus multiplying their total quantity and devaluing the very concept of heritage. The authors of the article generalize practical experience on studying historical-geological resources in Russia and Finland, suggest general methodical basis for the prospective assessment of these objects' commercialization to be developed. An integrated cross-disciplinary character of works on introducing the sites of mining-industrial heritage into tourist turnover and the need in scientific support of works should be noted. Science opinion is to be made for every object of mining-industrial heritage that is potentially considered as a tourist site. The analysis includes assessment of its unique character, visual performances, degree of it preservation (what to show) and information richness (what to tell), convenience of geographic location, ecological performance and safety requirements.

This increase quite usually is related with biofuels development. However, the prices of commodities are influenced by the set of different variables, i.e. supply and demand factors. In order to provide appropriate policy recommendations for agro-culture there is a need to evaluate the factors and their impact on agro-food commodities. This paper uses the multi regression model in order to analyze long-term drivers of annual world wheat and maize commodities prices. Analysis involves both demand (direct: biofuels production, commodities stock in the end of the period; indirect: the exchange rate, the interest rate, gross domestic product) and supply (price of crude oil) factors. The empirical results indicate that the main price drivers of wheat are crude oil prices, exchange rate and stock of wheat lagged one period. While the main maize price drivers are crude oil price and stock of maize lagged one period.","[Alekneviciene, Vilija] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania; [Bendoraityte, Asta] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Alekneviciene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",vilija.alekneviciene@asu.lt; asta.bendoraityte@asu.lt,,"Alekneviciene, Vilija/0000-0002-6501-8792; Bendoraityte, Asta/0000-0002-5761-6450",,,,,16,0,0,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800083,0

This paper describes the scientific discussion surrounding the topic of economy in rural places, with the objective of exploring who is setting the agenda and which themes are prevalent. We examine 102 journal papers published during the last decade and design a methodological frame based on Nvivo10 software which combines quantitative analysis of geographical attributes (geographical location; journal's precedence; author's institution) and qualitative content analysis of the selected articles. Our results put forward that rural economy is conceptually linked to different societal spheres in areas such as development and progress, society and community, resources and sustainability. However, it is authors coming from developed countries the ones that mainly treat this issue and base their studies mainly on developing countries. Therefore it can be concluded that scientific discourse around rural economy deals with issues of interest to developed countries, but that it has, however, started to get linked to social and environmental aspects, and it is through achieving a balance between them that rural prosperity will be achieved.","[Rivera, Maria] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Sustainable Rural Dev, Agroforestry Dept, Escuela Super Ingenieros Agonomos, Av Complutense S-N, Madrid, Spain; [Seebacher, Alina; Diaz Puente, Jose Maria] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Agroforestry Dept, Escuela Super Ingenieros Agonomos, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Rivera, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Sustainable Rural Dev, Agroforestry Dept, Escuela Super Ingenieros Agonomos, Av Complutense S-N, Madrid, Spain.",maria.rivera@upm.es; alina.seebacher@.gmail.com; jm.diazpuente@upm.es,"Rivera, María/AAF-1530-2020; Rivera, Maria/GYU-2150-2022; Díaz-Puente, José M/Q-4428-2018","Rivera, María/0000-0003-0642-0818; Díaz-Puente, José M/0000-0002-8073-560X",,,,,38,0,0,1,6,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.083,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800029,0

Each parameter assessed was evaluated for minor, notable, high, and very high likelihood of constant and temporary exposure. Subordinate elements, such as aesthetics, fishing, and river practicability were determined to be the greatest possible use of hydrokinetic energy schemes in the world rather than river ecosystem elements. The researchers carried out an approximate assessment of the economic indicators because Lithuania does not operate hydrokinetic power plants.

The following objectives have been solved: analysed theoretically the factors determining the development of the rural social infrastructure; analysed the condition of RSI and the factors influencing upon its development in Lithuanian rural regions. The research methods are the survey and the analysis of the scientific literature, scientific literature systemization, matching and comparison, multiple-criteria statistical data analyses and syntheses, expert evaluation. Integrated RSI condition indicators were calculated for each municipality and compared with indicators established for other municipalities in order to determine the RSI development level of each region. Analysis' results showed that the sector of communications and telecommunications is valued best, while the sector of protection of persons and property is assessed worst. Bad RSI situation is observed in 35.29 percent Lithuanian municipalities. There is no rural territory, showing perfect level of RSI development. This permits to draw a conclusion about the differences of the situation of the whole infrastructure system and socialeconomic problems. Problems of territorial and social cohesion are formed due to the uneven RSI development in individual regions/ municipalities. Regions/ municipalities with poor RSI lags behind the needs of local population are less attractive for investments, settling down, living, resting, such areas show higher unemployment rate, lower disposable incomes of households, residents are forced into a corner, limited sustainable development, and weak local economy.","[Atkociuniene, Vilma; Kiausiene, Ilona] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Business & Rural Dev Management Inst, Univ G 10, LT-64324 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Kiausiene, I (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Business & Rural Dev Management Inst, Univ G 10, LT-64324 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",vilma.atkociuniene@gmail.com; ilona.kiausiene@asu.lt,"Atkočiūnienė, Vilma/AGE-2435-2022",,,,,,25,0,0,1,6,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.118,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800063,0

The CAF model is one of the good tools for continuous improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of local governments. Based on research conducted in selected local governments in Slovakia we came to the conclusion that the fundamental obstacles to wider implementation of CAF model in practice are the uncertainty of the results of system changes and initial resistance from the employees to the new procedures and methods. With the implementation of the CAF comes the need for additional training, increasing demands on time and finances, despite the fact model is free. Subsequent implementation implies a need for enhanced internal communication, increases the time burden on staff. Users of the model would appreciate revision of manual for the implementation and its improvement with more comprehensible examples and by better interpretation of certain parts for better understandability for a wider range of users with respect to their level of knowledge. A significant barrier to higher CAF implementation can be considered a lack of promotion of this free access model. The paper presentsan example of how to increase the motivation of local governments to implement CAF model. In the future it will be necessary to take measures to eliminate the barriers identified in the article, which can improve the implementation process and increase number of CAF users.","[Flaska, Filip; Kolosta, Stanislav; Sotak, Martin] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Flaska, F (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",filip.flaska@umb.sk; stanislav.kolosta@umb.sk; martin.sotak@zoznam.sk,"Flaška, Filip/AAN-9696-2021","Flaška, Filip/0000-0003-2434-4783",,,,,10,1,1,2,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,427,433,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-57,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300057,0

The methodology is based on the analysis of the changes in the number of inhabitants and the population density of fifteen districts (SO ORP) within the period between 1869-2011 and its partial phases as follows 1869-1910, 1910-1950, 1950-1991, 1991-2011. For the purpose of quantification and comparison of the dynamics of the micro-regional development the so called index of change and the relative index of change were used. Based on the results from the analysis the micro-regions were divided, according to the prevailing tendency of their long-term population development, into four types: growth, stable, new peripheries and classic peripheries. In general, it can be said that within the observed period between 1869-2011 the biggest growth was mainly in the micro-regions with big industrial districts situated in the Moravian part of its area.","[Novacek, Ales] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Educ, Dept Geog, Ceske Budejovice 37115, Czech Republic; [Semian, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Soc Geog & Reg Dev, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Charles University Prague,"Novácek, A (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Educ, Dept Geog, Jeronymova 10, Ceske Budejovice 37115, Czech Republic.",anovacek@pf.jcu.cz; semian@natur.cuni.cz,"Semian, Michal/C-2404-2015",,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,566,572,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-76,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300076,0

The Common Market Organisation for sugar has been a subject of considerable debate since its establishment in 1968. The European agricultural market has been criticized for its heavy regulations and subsidization. The sugar market is one of the most regulated ones; however, this will change radically in 2017 when the current system of production quotas will end. The current EU sugar market changed is structure during the last several decades. The significant number of companies left the market and EU internal sugar market became more concentrated. The aim of this paper is presentation characteristics of sugar market with respect to the supposed market failure - reduction in competition. The analysis also identifies the main drivers and determinants of the EU especially quota sugar market. In relation to paper's aim the following results are important. The present conditions of the European sugar market have led to market failure when nearly 75 % (10 million tonnes) of the quota is controlled by five multinational companies only. These multinational alliances (especially German and French one) are also taking control over the production capacities of their subsidiaries. In most countries, this causes serious problems as the given quota is controlled by one or two producers only. This is a significant indicator of market imperfection. The quota system cannot overcome the problem of production quotas on the one hand and the demand on the other; furthermore, it also leads to economic inefficiency. The current EU sugar market is under the control of only Sudzucker, Nordzucker, Pfeifer and Langen, Tereos and ABF.","[Smutka, Lubos; Benesova, Irena] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Rovny, Patrik] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Mkt & Trade, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Matysik-Pejas, Renata] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Enterprises Management, Dept Agr & Econ, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Agricultural University Krakow,"Rovny, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Mkt & Trade, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",smutka@pef.czu.cz; benesova@pef.czu.cz; patrik.rovny@gmail.com; rrmatysi@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Benesova, Irena/B-3942-2011; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Matysik-Pejas, Renata/0000-0003-3485-0970","Grant Agency at the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analysis of the sugar sector after abolition of the Common Market Organization [20141045]","Grant Agency at the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analysis of the sugar sector after abolition of the Common Market Organization","This paper was supported by the Grant Agency at the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analysis of the sugar sector after abolition of the Common Market Organization [nr. 20141045].",,19,2,2,0,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.111,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800037,0

European leather sector recovers the hides and skins (renewable resources resulting from the production of meat for human consumption) and transform them into an appealing, high added value material that finds applications into a number of other value chains, notably in the fashion, furniture and automotive sectors. Tanneries thus prevent a difficult waste disposal problem, generate wealth, employment and contribute to circular economy. Environmental concerns in a nowadays tannery include the prevention and control of emissions to water, air and soil. The environmental effects that have to be taken into account in any tannery comprise not merely the load and concentration of the classic pollutants, but also the use of certain chemicals. The paper presents some innovative tools and technological solutions, developed and experimentally applied in Romanian leather sector, for pollutant impact monitoring and minimization. The intelligent integrated solutions adopted facilitate: (i) pollutant emissions permanent monitoring and improving the quality of the working environment; (ii) decreasing/ replacement of potentially dangerous chemical auxiliaries; (iii) environmental performance monitoring and the environmental management systems (EMS) implementation in the Romanian leather sector, contributing directly to its competitiveness and sustainability.","[Albul, Luminita; Macovescu, Gabriela; Hanchevici, Adrian-Bogdan; Deselnicu, Viorica] INCDTP Div Leather & Footwear Res Inst, Bucharest, Romania; [Hanchevici, Adrian-Bogdan] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania; [Albu, Eugen] SC PIELOREX SA, Jilava, Ilfov, Romania",National Research & Development Institute Textiles & Leather INCDTP; National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Albul, L (通讯作者)，INCDTP Div Leather & Footwear Res Inst, Bucharest, Romania.",,"DESELNICU, VIORICA/B-3054-2016","DESELNICU, VIORICA/0000-0001-6213-2103",,,,,9,1,1,0,15,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,305,312,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200039,0

Because the reference area of environmental projects analysis is very wide, by present paper we propose to conduct an ex-post analysis of the situation related to environmental projects implemented in Romania, especially after 2007, the debut year of financing from European funds. The analysis will be performed starting from the objectives proposed in the financing programs and we will make an analysis based on comparison between achievements and proposals. The main programs designed to financing the environmental projects in Romania are: Sectorial Operational Programme Environment, Life+, financial mechanisms EEA, PHARE etc. The main topics for the financing proposals are: assessment of the environmental conditions, the natural resources conservation, the water quality improvement, the development of systems for a sustainable waste management, reducing the number of contaminated sites, biodiversity and natural heritage conservation, supporting the management of protected areas, implementation of the Nature 2000 network, reducing the risk of natural disasters affecting the population, rehabilitation of green spaces, environmental education activities etc. We consider that the investments in environmental projects is a relevant subject especially for the future. Our main premise is that an efficient environmental policy depends decisively on the ability to attract and manage the funds allocated for this purpose. The methodological approach is integrative and analyses the financial support for the environment. It also focuses on aspects of efficiency and responsibility.

In the past decades, the focus has been mainly on economic indicators, leaving the social or environmental dimension out of it. Different territorial evaluation indexes are used by the local or national government in the EU to determine a development level and evaluate the results of regional and rural policies. At the moment, the main tool used by the Latvian government in order to evaluate a territorial development level is the territorial development index (TDI). The TDI describes mostly the economic and social dimensions, including such indicators as unemployment rate, personal income tax revenue, number of criminal offenses, entrepreneurship activity etc.; therefore, it is essential to determine the impact and significance of natural resources in a territorial development evaluation. The aim of the research is to determine the main role and significance of natural resources (forest, land, minerals) in the rural development evaluation system in Latvia. The methods used in the research are as follows: monographic, analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, statistical analysis methods, factor analysis and cluster analysis. The research showed that there were significant differences comparing TDI values and the amounts and availability of natural resources in municipalities. The highest TDI values were for those municipalities which are located close to the capital city of Riga, although they did not have any natural resources and the main economic sector was services (wholesale in particular). On the other hand municipalities with a larger amount of natural resources were showing lower TDI values. The capacity to use natural resources effectively in order to foster the development of a municipality is insufficient and has to be increased. It may be achieved by introducing the environmental dimension in the rural development evaluation system and by making changes in regional policy guidelines and expected results.","[Bulderberga, Zane; Rivza, Baiba] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Bulderberga, Z (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",,"Vitolina, Zane/AAF-4767-2019","Vitolina, Zane/0000-0002-7416-023X",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,373,380,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200048,0

For Romania tourism represents the economic sector which has a significant development potential, unfortunately insufficient capitalized and can become a source of attraction both for investors and for foreign tourists. In terms of natural resources and anthropogenic tourism resources, Romania is well represented, the main tourist attractions are represented by ethnography, folklore, folk art, nature reserves and spas, having at the same time a varied hunting found. Regarding the reception structures, Romania has a pretty good image for the future, but still had room for more, so it is taken into consideration the construction of new structures, but also the modernization of the existing ones. Although Romania has a relatively high tourism potential, this is not sufficiently capitalized. By capitalizing, country would gain an important source of income, through development of the material tourism base and infrastructure of access roads.

As the little exception there is a deeper basin, which stretches from the Curonian Spit until it reaches the approaches of the Southern Gotland Deep. The long-term investigations of spatial seasonal distribution of inorganic nutrients ( nitrite, nitrate and orthophosphate) resulted to some regularities depending on prevailing wind scale duration and force. The results obtained during the experiment showed the complicacy of field structure. Extremely heterogeneous patterns of nutrients are formed when northern or eastern winds or breezes are prevailing. After the other wind directions significant decrease of heterogeneity was observed.

The paper deals with the development and current state of the migration of Vietnamese to the Czech Republic. The main subject of investigation is the status of these migrants on the labor market OF the Czech Republic. This paper summarizes current knowledge regarding the historical development of the migration of Vietnamese to the Czech Republic. It deals with the reasons for the emergence of Vietnamese migration, early arrival of the Vietnamese to the Czech Republic and the periods of their migration, which are defined in three seasons - to year 1989, 1990-2008, 2009 to present. Furthermore, the paper analyses the current state of the Vietnamese in the Czech Republic, according to official statistics and their [without two regionals, no word here] differentiation at the regional level. The final section is devoted to the situation of Vietnamese on the Czech labour market. The aim of this paper is to analyse the development of Vietnamese migration to the Czech Republic and the position of migrants on the Czech labour market.

With its large landmass and forests North America has led rest of the world in access to biomass for energy production. Wood based biomass is collected from sources like primary and secondary mill residues, forest residues, logging and short rotation woody crops. Afterwards, collected biomass is converted into energy or fuel through processes like gasification, pyrolysis, cogeneration and pellet creation. In the U.S. woody biomass is primarily used for industrial and commercial applications. Major part of woody biomass is devoted towards electricity generation followed by pellet production. In recent years the EU biomass policy has been a major driver for North American pellet industry's growth. Climate change issues and urgency for development of clean energy has brought renewable resources like wood energy in spotlight. However, wood biomass based energy faces major infrastructure and policy challenges in coming years to sustain the current growth rate.

From a general point of view, it could be said that also the possible future use of the land has a significant impact on its price, so it is strongly reflected in the valuation of land price. In the first part of the paper authors dealt with the issue of emplacing buildings in terms of the current legislation, not only in the Czech Republic but also in other selected European Union countries. As stated above, the possibility of emplacement of a certain type of a structures on land is very important for a deciding on the type of building (family house, multifunctional building, production building, road, etc.), which is decisive for determining of the value of the land itself. The authors studied possibilities, how to take into account this attribute of the land in the process of determining its value, in terms of simpler method of the class position, or more complicated method best and highest use. Following the above, the authors also discussed the issue of pricing of land just depending on the future type of building.

When the public space and public life are not supported in the community, there is no one to communicate with, people become isolated, less inclined to help or support each other. Public space is the scene of public life that promotes a sense of community, sense of place, human connection and communication as well as dependence sensation. High-quality and well-managed public space is a benefit to the city's economy, creating shelter from the car-centred life and move to a more natural environment as well as significant urban land use. Therefore, in recent times, in order to establish the right conditions in cities for different human needs, great attention is paid not only to the development of physical infrastructure, but also to other aspects that will help to create sustainable balance of social, economic and environmental aspects. One of the quality of life in the city return ways is the release of urban spaces for pedestrians. Until these days the pedestrian zones are extended little by little, resulting in disposal of the car parking-lots and improved cycling and other transport facilities. Sustainable use of urban pedestrian zones would provide economic, social, environmental and cultural benefits only if these aspects are combined with each other.

This study presents a research to determine the content of heavy metals in the soils of the Ryazan region (Russia) and analyzed the level of their pollution. In the experiments organic, organomineral and mineral fertilizers systems were studied. From 2002 to 2008 were conducted lysimetric experiments on detoxification of elevated pollution of sod-podzol sandy loam soil, and from 2006 to 2008 of podzolized black soil. The participation of the non-ferrous metals plant emissions was detected in the pollution of sod-podzol light in granulometric composition soils with copper of up to 80 mg.kg(-1), when the average concentration of Cu in the soil was 38.8 +/- 6 mg.kg(-1). Humification plays a significant role in the formation of soil, its most important properties and characteristics. The saturation of 1 hectare of sown area with organic was slightly different in the experiments, but the intensity of accumulation of humus from the various agrochemical means did not almost differ. The problem of adaptation of plants in the conditions of technogenic environment is of primary importance. Plants have three biobarera against the admission of toxicants, these are the soil - the root - the stem - the reproductive organs. Grain in contaminated soil is environmentally hazardous as the content of Pb is indicated at the level of 0.68, 1.17 mg.kg(-1) (MPC 0.5), Cd - 0.27, 0.11 mg.kg(-1) (MPC 0.1), Zn - 76 mg.kg(-1) (50 MPC).

The objective was to evaluate the citizens' attitude towards ecological problems in Novi Sad and to check their links with socio-demographic characteristics. A total of 126 completed questionnaires were collected. The results indicate that respondents first recognized directly observable ecological problems such as the lack of recycling containers and illegal landfills. Five of each10 respondents acknowledge that personally take care very much of the environment (55.6 %) and almost 8 of each 10 consider that their fellow citizens in the municipality need higher environmental education (89.7 %). Results also indicate that 72 % of younger respondents (24 years and less) would cultivate the city's urban gardens in the occasion that the municipality grants the use of their unused land area. The findings of the study show that there exists willingness to change behaviours, and the emphasis should be given to bottom-up and participatory voluntary actions.

In addition to forest management, most certification schemes also provide chain-of-custody certification (COC) along with their regular forest certification process. The main purpose of COC's is to ensure that certified product is being processed in accordance with the guidelines and rules of specific certification program throughout the supply chain, from forests to the final consumer, by tracking and monitoring the material as it is formed into a predecided end item such as upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets or wood flooring materials. This study examines COC as used by furniture and other value-added wood product manufacturers in the U.S. over three periods: 2001, 2007, and 2014.

It was based on the data of the Central Statistical Office of Poland refereeing to the numbers of employees in three sectors: (a) agriculture, forestry and fishing like services; (b) industry and construction; (c) services. A new European Union typology of: predominantly rural, intermediate, and predominantly urban regions, based on a variation of the OECD methodology, was applied. Graphical presentation of the sectoral employment structures across NUTS 3 regions was used. Generally in Poland, very similar proportions of rural inhabitants work in agriculture, forestry and fishing like in the sector of services (third sector). In 2013, in predominantly rural regions, 37 % of inhabitants worked in agriculture, forestry and fishing (respectively 38 % of males, 37 % of females), 25 % of inhabitants worked in industry and construction (respectively 36 % of males, 15 % of females), and 37 % of inhabitants worked in services. Industry and construction is a sector important for employment of male rural inhabitants whereas services were typical for female employment. Agriculture, forestry and fishing is a very important sector of employment in the south-eastern part of Poland whereas the second and third sectors are more popular in the north-western part of Poland. Identification of these spatial patterns contributes to spatial characteristics of rural economies across Poland as well as it proves existence of a functional region, exceeding regional administrative boundaries, of high important of agriculture in the economy.","[Drejerska, Nina] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Drejerska, N (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",nina_drejerska@sggw.pl,"Drejerska, Nina/Y-6350-2019","Drejerska, Nina/0000-0001-7591-8121",,,,,21,2,2,0,2,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.122,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800069,0

Survey data show that Kosovo households are consuming 2.05 million cubic meters on average, when sustainable harvests are closer to 1.3 million cubic meters(1,2). Survey data from rural household's that are in the low-payment and low-service quality areas of Kosovo suggest that the importance of wood fuels in these areas is even more critical, with households consuming 10.46 m(3), more than the 8.2m(3) average for rural households. This very high demand for wood fuel places an unsustainable burden on Kosovo's forest resources. This paper estimates the elasticity of demand for wood fuels in Kosovo and to determine how a change in price might alter the demand from households for wood fuels.

We found out that municipalities can give to process of SEDP mainly to external suppliers, at a significantly lesser extent they made it themselves. In the internal structure of the program part of SEDP had almost 90% of surveyed municipalities defined the vision with a perspective of 20 years. All the surveyed municipalities have defined development strategy for the next 5-7 years. Differences among documents were found mainly in the number and way of defining priority objectives. The results showed that the municipalities most often specify their development strategy in 4-5 priority objectives, the most attention is drawn to the development of tourism and the environment. Small municipalities up to 1,000 inhabitants focus their activities primarily on the development of human resources and marginalized groups. We assumed that the choice of processor, as well as define the different components of the program document also affects the size of the village.

Overall impacts of immigration can very broad and should be considered within wider economic and socio-cultural context.

So the problem was how to establish a lifelong teaching programme for people with different background. Another issue was about what to teach, what abilities are essentials and how to continue this training after someone receive a diploma. CNRI decided to introduce a new profession: lighting specialist in the list of the Romanian Occupation Classification with two levels: basic and advanced. The minimum level of study is a BA with a total of 120 training hours, from which there are 40 hours of courses for the basic level in two periods separated by two weeks in order to enhance the individual study. One conclusion is the lack of basic lighting knowledge we found in some cases and another is the need to enhance the practical abilities. Another important issue is how to update the lighting knowledge; one solution is the Ingineria Iluminatului - Journal of Lighting Engineering with state-of-the-art papers and another one is a workshop with two invited speakers with an overview of a specific topic.

The scientific community of physicists of Siberia played an important role in the process of rapid development of the country, especially during the period of industrialization. The need of the USSR to go to the new technological frontier in the 1920-s have been required the active involvement of the scientific community of the country in solving practical problems of industrial upgrading and intensification of production. The Siberian Physical-Technical Institute (SPhTI), which was opened in 1928, became the first scientific research institute in the university system of the country, as well as the first and the only one Research Institute in the field of exact sciences and engineering to the east of the Ural mountains line. SPhTI has become a center for the consolidation of the scientific community of physicists of Siberia. The Institute has been accessed from many Siberian cities for resolution of various issues (problems of plasticity and strength of solids, flaw detection, spectral analysis application in metallurgy and geology, the state of the ionosphere and radio communications, the properties of insulators, etc.). SPhTI's research has been holding influenced by requirements from the industry. It has allowed reducing the time of implementation of scientific research results into production. The Institute has gradually turned into a scientific center of physics and physical research center for training of highly qualified personnel and the promotion of physics knowledge. The significance of SPhTI as one of the leading academic institutions, which had successfully integrated science, education and production, has been especially obvious during the period of the Great Patriotic War.

The electronic course (EC) is understood as set of the connected electronic education resources (training, controlling, reference, etc.), placed in the electronic environment for the organization and maintenance of education process on separate discipline. In the Russian higher education institutions two approaches to development of EC are traditionally provided, first of which covers all types of a statement of material: text, hypertext, help nature and game. The second campaign to development of EC considers nature of interaction of the trainee and content: information, the question-answer information controlling with the return information communication, with threshold levels of control. In TPU the emphasis on development of hypertext EC, EC with the return information communication (the interactive EC providing a fixed assessment of knowledge of the trainee and issue of recommendations about further forming of a trajectory of training) and with threshold levels of control is placed (when transition to the next section is possible after overcoming of monitoring tests at the previous stage). Such EC in TPU in 2014/2015 academic year developed more than 250 units as they are the most demanded from the point of view of the effective organization of educational process in the Electronic information and education environment (EIEE). The modern electronic course is part of system approach to creation of educational process on discipline; allows building single system from the purposes of training, a training material and tools. Efficiency of EIEE is provided with single requirements to content of an electronic course, its style and structure (to sequence of a statement and methods of representation of material). In the Russian higher education institutions, as a rule, the basic structure of an electronic rate is universal; requirements imposed to it are minimum. In TPU experience of foreign universities which in case of development of EC precede from the principles of communicativeness, interactivity, didactic feasibility, etc. is assumed as a basis. Such approach allowed to create structure of EC which meets all requirements of modern educational process and is actual for all implementable forms (internal, intramural and extramural, correspondence) and training models (the training with web support mixed and remote).","[Vorobjev, Ludmila V.; Isaeva, Eugenia V.; Serebrenninkova, Anna N.] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia",Tomsk Polytechnic University,"Vorobjev, LV (通讯作者)，Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia.",,"Vorobjeva, Ludmila/F-6432-2016","Vorobjeva, Ludmila/0000-0002-1417-6838",,,,,4,1,1,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,755,763,,,,,,9,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200096,0

As a result farmers and managers of agricultural companies are only a slightly motivated to produce added value and high quality food products, to use short food supply chains addressing constantly changing consumer needs, or to pay much attention on issues related to climate change. The paper findings are based on the Lithuanian case study carried out as a part of the international research project Rethinking the links between farm modernization, rural development and resilience in a world of increasing demands and finite resources (RETHINK). The Lithuanian case study was determining farmers' behaviour and causal factors in decision-making. The research based on the positive research paradigm, case study, content and descriptive analysis, empirical study methods (answers of two groups of experts experts-professionals and experts-farmers), logical and systematical reasoning, graphic presentation, abstracts and other methods. The present paper is examining the impact of political factors on prosperity and resilience on farms and agricultural companies. The political factors have the highest impact for prosperity of the farms and agricultural companies in Lithuania (as compared to the technical - entrepreneurial, ethical - social factors, and intangible values). The support from the EU and the national funds is not fully in line with the current concept of farms' modernization and agricultural innovation. The public policy influence on the competitiveness of the agricultural sector is more strengthening than weakening. The results show the main elements that farmers believe should be included in the new concept of rural prosperity, as well as the main strategies adopted to reach prosperity divided into the five sub dimensions: development of the rural social infrastructure and implementation of information technologies; strong self-governance, social awareness and partnership; high culture of life and communication; rural employment and job creation in rural areas, population welfare; economic and social viability, ecology and environmental security of the countryside.","[Atkociuniene, Vilma; Aleksandravicius, Alvydas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania; [Zemeckis, Romualdas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Environm & Ecol, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Atkociuniene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Univ G 10, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania.",vilma.atkociuniene@gmail.com; aleksandravicius@gmail.com; romualdas.zemeckis@asu.lt,"Atkočiūnienė, Vilma/AGE-2435-2022",,Lithuanian Ministry of Agriculture,Lithuanian Ministry of Agriculture,This research was possible to implement due to financial support from Lithuanian Ministry of Agriculture.,,17,0,0,0,9,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800082,0

These cases are linked to agricultural workers where noise related problems are primary. Therefore, this study includes noise level analysis in most common agricultural activities where self-propelled machinery is used. As more than 50 percent of all agricultural self-propelled machinery, namely tractors, under use in Lithuania are older than 20 years the purpose was to investigate acoustic climate in cabs. This study is based on the field data, collected from 50 agricultural tractors, manufactured since 1981. Results show that the noise lower exposure action value LEX, 8h of 80 dB(A) is expected to be exceeded for the tractors manufactured before 1991 and mostly depends on construction of tractor cab but not on working hours.

The objective of this study is to quantify the share of all wood and wood-based product imports into the EU to which the EUTR applies. We defined the scope of the wood-based products based on the definition of the forest-based sector and aggregated them to twelve product groups. We then calculated EUTR coverage ratios for three different reference units: import value (Euro), roundwood eq. and wood fibre eq. Our results show that approximately 90% of total imported wood quantities are covered by the EUTR. This means that 6 million m(3) wood fibre eq. (17 million m(3) roundwood-eq.) not covered by the EUTR were imported into the EU in 2013. Coverage ratios for product groups differ. Typically raw materials have a higher coverage ratio and finished products a lower coverage ratio. The wood not covered by EUTR is highly concentrated on a few commodities like wood charcoal, articles of wood, n.e.s. and printed books and brochures. The regional import structure of the EU differs between total imports and imports that are not covered by the EUTR.

Granular superphosphate (P-60) and potassium chloride (K-60) fertilisers were spread during sowing, while amonium nitrate (N-60) was used in tillering time (BBCH 23-25), after the vegetative growth had resumed. Additionally, the plants were treated with foliar fertiliser urea solution: N-30, N-40 at booting stage (BBCH 34-36) and N-15, N-30 at milk ripening stage (BBCH 71-74). After the analysis of the data, it was established that additional fertilization with N-30 and N-40 fertiliser application rates at later stages of plant development stimulated the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and prolonged the period of active photosynthesis. Irrespective of treatment with nitrogen fertilisers, genetic properties of the cultivar also had influence on the accumulation of the pigments. Wheat cultivar 'Zentos' tended to accumulate larger amounts of pigments. The highest amounts of pigments were found at the beginning of milk ripening stage before additional treatment with N-15, N-30 fertiliser application rates.","[Juchneviciene, Aiste; Vaguseviciene, Ilona] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Agr & Food Sci, Studentu G 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Juchneviciene, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Agr & Food Sci, Studentu G 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",aiste.zuzaviciute@inbox.lt; i.vaguseviciene@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,0,0,2,13,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.033,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800068,0

For the determination of changes of winter oilseed rape root neck thickness during autumnal development the effect of planting date, seedbed nitrogen application, stand population density, number of calendar days after emergence, accumulated by plants growing degree days and interaction among these factors was tested. For the description of the root neck growth pattern Boltzmann's growth function performing a nonlinear fitting of estimating parameters was used. Results collected in the experiments indicate that the effect of sowing date including accumulated by plants growing degree days and the number of calendar days after emergence showed much greater effect on winter oilseed rape root diameter than seeding rate or pre-plant nitrogen application.

It is based on the actual legislation, latest research and experiences on the field of regional development with a special emphasis on the levels of public administration in relation to regional development. Other debated issues are the challenges in practising regional development and the influencing key factors. Despite of its essential function, current management of regional development faces several issues that concerned authorities need to deal with. As to the legislation, there is a significant gap between existing, never optimal, statutory regulations of organizational relationships and the absence of processing statutory regulations. Today, it is essential to create fully functional system of regional development and implementation of controlling mechanisms without any kind of official incompetence of competent officers, often buggering and insisting on details without liability. In the previous programming period, we have witnessed sometimes senseless requirements of all the relevant bodies including controlling ones. Additional buggering in the requirements that has never been claimed is the typical Czech phenomenon accompanying the use of the EU financial resources. Despite the above statement, it can be stated that assistance from the European Communities contributed significantly to the formation of modern management within the Czech regional policy. At the same time, however, a considerable inflow of EU funds led to a significant deepening of corruption.","Coll Reg Dev, Prague 16300, Czech Republic",AMBIS University,"Wokoun, R (通讯作者)，Coll Reg Dev, Zalanskeho 68-54, Prague 16300, Czech Republic.",rene.wokoun@vsrr.cz,,,,,,,3,1,1,5,12,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,261,267,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-35,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300035,0

Common oak forests (Quercus robur L.) occupy an area of 246,445 ha in Galicia, 18 % of the total forest area. The current location of a lot of oak stands in steep zones indicates that they have remained in such areas from immemorial times because it was not possible the harvesting and these stands are now very important in ecological and landscape terms. The best sites for Quercus robur correspond to zones where the climatic characteristics combine optimally higher minimum temperature, lower thermal amplitude and higher precipitation.

The energy production sector has the potential to ensure sales of these assortments in competitive prices. In Slovakia the demand for these assortments will increase. This is based on installation and reconstruction of energy plants to enable wood chips firing. Based on the output capacity of these new or reconstructed plants, we calculated the consumption of wood chips in 2016 at about 600 000 tons per year, in comparison with 240 000 tons per year in 2012.

The project aims to summarize the findings of the German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany and Switzerland) with various forms of cooperation between municipalities and the attempt on their typology. It is based on the seven case studies of these organizations inter-municipal cooperation: Region Waldviertel (A), EU Regionalmanagement Oststeiermark (A), Region Oberfranken (Oberfranken Offensive, Forum Zukunft Oberfranken (D), Metropolregion Nurnberg (D), Wirtschaftsband A9 Frankische Schweiz (D), Pro Engiadina Bassa (CH), Regionalplanung Oberland (CH). It concludes that summary and evaluation of international experience with municipal cooperation and their typology is a very difficult and complex issue. Individual models are significantly different, both in terms of initiating, funding and organizational structure, the objectives and tasks. They vary significantly with a legislative possibility of such organizations. Most of our studied examples of inter-municipal cooperation match only one criterion, while at other it shows considerable variability. In terms of practical applications, according to the authors of the contribution, the key factors are: how to initiate, spatial scope, role of the State and ways of funding.","Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ctr Reg Dev Res, Dept Geog, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Jezek, J (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Ctr Reg Dev Res, Dept Geog, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",jezekji@kge.zcu.cz,,,,,,,7,3,3,0,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,463,469,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-62,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300062,0

Expectations have been fulfilled only for achievement status, indicating that achievement (the highest identity status) is positively related with general and all components of mental health. Moreover, foreclosure identity status also was positively related with general and three components of mental health. In addition, the results indicated that diffusion identity status was negatively related with real evaluation of subjectively perceived mental health. Clustering analysis proposed two profiles: first of students with better mental health and higher achievement and foreclosure statuses, and second cluster for students with poorer mental health and higher diffusion and higher moratorium statuses.

The oscillation of motivation for sharing depended on the strength of net activities. The differences in sharing nature were observed: professors and instructors protected their data and purposively managed the networked time, while students expressed openness and knowledge grab from various channels with low selection.

Fruits stored for 8 weeks in controlled atmosphere chambers with different air parameters (No. 1-21 % O-2, No. 2-0.5 % O-2, No. 3-1 % O-2, No. 4-1 % O-2 and 1 % CO2). Dry matter, soluble solids and texture analysis were done biweekly. The amount of dry matter was determined by drying the samples to the constant mass at the temperature of 105 degrees C. Soluble solids content was determined by the refractometric method. Fruit texture parameters were analysed by Texture analyser. The results of chemical analysis at harvest time showed that the biggest amount of dry matter and the highest value of flesh firmness were in 'Laiba' fruits, soluble solids in 'Lande' fruits. The highest value of bio-yield point was established in ` Paukstes Sakarva' fruits. Results of analysis showed that dry matter content as well as soluble solids content of A. kolomikta fruits increases during storage in controlled atmosphere chambers. The highest increase in soluble solids content was in chamber No. 4 and the highest increase in dry matter content was in chamber No. 2 compared with fruits at harvest time.

The authors interpret fee development as an approach denying the speculative nature of business operations. It is a modern complex tool involving the initiation of customized (unconventional and variable) competitive projects for improving urban improvement and attracting external, often incidental, investments for their implementation. Development of megaprojects (William F. Sharpe, Gordon J. Alexander) is one of the techniques of building the urban environment. This technique is aimed at qualitative transformation of the territory. Such projects require large capital investment and are characterized by long life cycle time spans, large number of participants, and the complexity of their implementation. The paper provides data on the use of the development approach for the megaproject called Reconstruction of the unfinished TV tower in Ekaterinburg. This megaproject allows to consistently solve the issues of building the high-quality environment in the central part of the capital of the Urals.

Annual growth of average prices of flats by 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 exceed 6%, which the European Commission determined as the threshold value for a warning against potential risk of macroeconomic imbalance due to stronger annual growth in housing prices. From this perspective, the future development of apartment prices in Slovak conditions deserves more attention in several regions. Significantly increasing demand for housing and its dynamically growing prices are perceived by some observers as a possible signal of inflating a new real estate bubble.

Therefore, more intensive environmental use should be reflected in the increase of environmental tax revenues. In addition, tax specialists have also come to a conclusion that the Baltic States should transfer tax burden more from labour and capital to property and environmental taxes. The research aim is to analyse environmental tax revenue and environmental tax burden trends in the Baltic States. The situation significantly differs among the Baltic States. Within ten years (20052014), Estonia has produced the most rapid increase of environmental tax revenues (+108%), followed by Latvia (+82%), while Lithuania has shown the smallest growth (+29%). However, the three Baltic States outpace the average EU-28 indicator (+19%). The increase of energy taxes basically ensures the growth of total environmental tax revenues. In turn, the comparison of environmental tax burden or tax revenues of GDP shows varied trends: in Estonia, the environmental tax burden has significantly grown within ten years and it exceeds the average EU level; no essential changes have been observed in Latvia, while it has decreased in Lithuania; moreover the decrease is both due to the decrease in transport fuel taxes and taxes from pollution and resources. In general, environmental tax revenues have relatively small share in tax revenues of the Baltic States. Yet, if the total tax burden in the Baltic States is below the EU average level, then environmental tax revenues have higher share in total tax revenues - Lithuania stays on the EU level, while Latvia and Estonia exceed it. During the pre-crisis period (2005-2008) the share of environmental taxes essentially decreased in the Baltic States, especially in Lithuania and Latvia, which may be explained by the increase of population purchasing power and thus, the growth of consumption tax burden. Though, during the economic crisis, the share of environmental taxes in Estonia and Latvia significantly grew and has stabilised presently. The research results indicate that the total tax burden has slightly increased in Estonia during the last decade, including environmental tax burden and share of environmental taxes in total tax revenues. In Latvia and Lithuania, the total tax burden has slightly declined and it is one of the lowest in the EU Member States. Nevertheless, the share of environmental taxes remains stable in Latvia, while in Lithuania, both the environmental tax burden and the share of environmental taxes in total tax revenues have decreased despite recommendations of tax specialists.

Lack of proper training generated by the educational systems, at individual level, which could lead to solving the difficulties identified in the social and human level, outlines an overview of the education crisis. This is characterized by the inability of education to support the development of positive attributes of individuals, which could underpin a social environment continuously changing, by some discrepancies between the system of values and aims of education, between strategic advanced educational planning and the effective opportunity to apply them, by the incompatibilities existing today between educational demand and supply. Within the context of accentuated rhythm of the changes produced at the society level, the rethinking of the form and content of education becomes imperative in the spirit of the educational ideal accomplishment. Thus the concept of educational ideal captures the assembly of requirements alleged by the social environment to the individual, desirable values and norms common to the majority of individuals. The educational ideal is designed based on the aims of education which act as vectors to achieve the degree of individual and social development of a person by developing imperative skills and abilities in terms of educational ideal. It is necessary to redefine the educational ideal today in the context of the impact of the education crisis, but also taking into consideration the social changes which characterize the contemporary society.","[Popescu, Alexandra] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania; [Popescu, Luminita Georgeta; Cilibiu, Andreea-Mihaela] Constantin Brancusi Univ Targu Jiu, Targu Jiu, Romania",University of Craiova; Constantin Brancusi University,"Popescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",,,"Popescu, Luminita Georgeta/0000-0003-0423-1968",,,,,4,1,1,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,1009,1012,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200129,0

In the present paper we present a study on the viability of the incorporation of biofuels in the energy mix of the Spanish ceramic industry with the objective of (1) identifying the potential use of biomass resources, with a special focus of forest and agricultural biomass, in the manufacturing process of ceramic tile products; (2) identify in what part of the production process it can be introduced; and (3) calculate the reduced environmental impact from the manufacture of ceramic materials through a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. In order to proceed we firstly present the relevant state of the art for the study of the use of biomass for the ceramic manu facturing process. We continue with the methodology for biomass resources evaluation and present relevant data on forest and agricultural biomass for the ceramic tile industry. We then present data on the evolution and actual energy demand of the ceramic tile industry to characterize its energy demand. And then we identify an opportunity for biomass use in a specific phase of the manufacture of ceramic products, estimating the savings of fossil fuels and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and therefore assessing the environmental impact reduction through the introduction of biomass in the manufacturing process of ceramic tile products.","[Alfonso, David] Inst Energy Engn, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Mezquita, Ana] Inst Ceram Technol, Castellon de La Plana 12006, Spain; [Monfort, Eliseo] Univ Jaume I Castellon, Dept Chem Engn, Castellon de La Plana 12006, Spain; [Gabaldon-Estevan, Daniel] Univ Valencia, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, pAv Tarongers 4-B, Valencia 46021, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia,"Gabaldón-Estevan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, pAv Tarongers 4-B, Valencia 46021, Spain.",daalso@iie.upv.es; ana.mezquita@itc.uji.es; eliseo.monfort@itc.uji.es; daniel.gabaldon@uv.es,"Gabaldón-Estevan, Daniel/B-5195-2011; Monfort, Eliseo/L-7260-2014; Alfonso-Solar, David/H-3107-2016","Gabaldón-Estevan, Daniel/0000-0003-2086-5012; Monfort, Eliseo/0000-0003-3995-2378;",,,,,18,0,0,1,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.073,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800052,0

The study was based on data from telephone interviews with representatives of 25 local self-governments and on data from the Information System for Monitoring and Control, which includes data sets on all projects carried out under national and regional Operational Programmes 2007-2013 and is disseminated by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development. The verifying datasets were obtained from Poland's Central Statistical Office, the National Court Register, and the Ministry of Economy. The findings showed that the commune-unions and limited liability companies set up by the rural and urban local self-governments (LAU2) in Poland have had the characteristics of rural-urban partnerships. These entities were beneficiaries of Operational Programmes 2007-2013. This proves that in practise EU structural funds have been supporting rural-urban partnerships in Poland, although they have not been addressed specifically to them. Despite the ongoing theoretical discussion on the definition of rural-urban partnership and the fact that it was purposely not explained to the interviewed the representatives of local self-governments, this form of collaboration was well-recognised by them.","[Rakowska, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Rakowska, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",joanna_rakowska@sggw.pl,"Rakowska, Joanna/D-3647-2015","Rakowska, Joanna/0000-0001-5135-6996",,,,,43,0,0,2,5,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.121,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800066,0

For these reasons, the development of lifelong education is a significant tool for economic growth in Latvia. Correlation and linear regression analyses showed that lifelong education made the strongest and most positive effects on a country's competitiveness at two stages of economic development: at the innovation-driven stage and during a country's transition to it from the efficiency-driven stage (the case of Latvia). Calculations were preformed based on the data for 2008 and 2013, and the results were similar, which indicated the stability of this global causal relationship. So the authors conclude that a country's stage of economic development plays a crucial role in the extent the factor of lifelong education can affect the country's global competitiveness. In the countries being at lower stages of economic development, even well-developed lifelong education is not objectively capable of increasing their competiveness as effectively as it takes place, for example, at the innovation-driven stage. Proving a causal relationship - the capability of lifelong education to increase a country's competitiveness is determined by the existing economic background and rules of game, which are different at different stages of economic development - based on research of the economic aspects of lifelong education may be regarded as the key gain of the present research.","[Sannikova, Aija; Dobele, Aina; Dobele, Madara] Latvia Univ Agr, Inst Business & Management Sci, Svetes St 18, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Dobele, A (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Inst Business & Management Sci, Svetes St 18, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia.",aija.sannikova@inbox.lv; Aina.Dobele@llu.lv; Madara.Dobele@llu.lv,"Dobele, Aina/AAG-6002-2019","Dobele, Aina/0000-0003-2264-909X",,,,,17,1,1,0,1,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.105,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800012,0

Storage temperature had significant influence on spinach colour, but the influence of packaging was not so strong. The content of soluble solids, ascorbic acid and nitrates decreased during storage. The highest amount of ascorbic acid was retained when baby spinach were stored in 40 mu m PE bags at 0 +/- 1 degrees C. When baby spinach was stored at higher temperatures (4 degrees C, 8 degrees C & 16 degrees C), the decrease in the amount of ascorbic acid ranged from 55 % to 69 %.

In this situation, it is appropriate to focus on the evaluation of the EU endowment draw in the last years, i.e. in the programming period 2007-2013 (or more precisely in 2007-2015), in the terms of the total amount of allocated resources and their efficiency of use. The aim of this paper is to analyze the endowment draw at three different selected regional authorities in the Czech Republic, specifically in the North-East Cohesion Region. In this comparison, there are Hradec Kralove Region, Liberec Region and Pardubice Region. In terms of regional support for its region, the focus is on the projects promoting unemployment, human resources and education or research. The goal of this paper is to evaluate this support by identifying and comparing the total amount of financial support, which the selected regions received for their projects. As a basic research method was used the financial analysis of the European endowment draws and the total number of allocated projects in selected years following with their mutual statistical comparison. The outcomes of this research have shown that among selected regions, there are significant differences. The most successful region in comparison was Pardubice Region, which allocated 3.720 billion CZK.

When structure fails, the subsequent consequences can be severe, resulting in loss of life, damage to environmental quality and economic losses to society.","[Hernea, Silvia] Univ Politehn Timisoara, Fac Civil Engn, Timisoara, Romania; [Feier, Anamaria] INCD URBAN INCERC Timisoara Branch, Timisoara, Romania; [Filimon, Marioara Nicoleta] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania; [Ioan, Ciortea] Univ Politehn Timisoara, Fac Civil Engn, Timisoara, Romania; [Buzdugan, Monica] ISIM Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara; West University of Timisoara; Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Hernea, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Timisoara, Fac Civil Engn, Timisoara, Romania.",,"Feier, Anamaria Ioana/AAJ-4109-2021; Marioara Nicoleta, Filimon/C-1904-2012","Feier, Anamaria Ioana/0000-0003-4174-8608; Marioara Nicoleta, Filimon/0000-0002-3392-9858",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,509,514,,,,,,6,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200065,0

Whether largest urban areas and big cities face accelerated spatial transformation, small and medium-sized municipalities encountered a slow -go pace in their urban restructuring, with different results at the local scale. This paper briefly introduces some recent evidences of these processes using two different case studies to notice the new changes of spatial restructuring in a medium-sized Romanian municipality. The first perspective emphasizes new pathways of progressive functional translation and spatial conversion through tertiarization as a main process. The second unveils eclectic spatial emergence of a formerly agricultural and industrial site through residential growth. The research bases mainly on empirical data gathered through ethnographic in -field observation, and personal conversations in the study area conducted from 2014 to spring 2016 in order to portray the most recent spatial shifts at the local scale. Furthermore, sketching out the spatial changes was useful in gaining an understanding on the recent process of spatial restructuring. The findings demonstrate some similar evolutional paths with those specific for the largest Romanian cities but with reduced intensities, low impacts on local communities and mild paces in local urban restructuring.","[Jucu, Ioan Sebastian] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Geog, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Jucu, IS (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Dept Geog, Timisoara, Romania.",,"SEBASTIAN, JUCU IOAN/AAV-6312-2020",,,,,,15,8,8,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,493,+,,,,,,2,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200063,0

The method is based on annual changes in the net present value by postponing final felling. Forest inventory data and forestry modelling system was used for calculation of changes in net present value for pine, spruce, birch, aspen and black alder stands. And changes in net present value were described by regression function with factors from stand parameters. The regression function allows calculating annual changes in net present value for each stand. And stands with higher decrease in net present value have higher cutting priority. Stands selected for the final felling in strategic plan were compared with the stands selected in tactical plan with two methods, first, by using annual changes in the net present value, second, by traditional planning principles.

The experiment was carried out in the Middle Lithuanian Lowland in Kedainiai district. The groundwater quality research was conducted during 2008-2012 in a manure fertilised field of a livestock enterprise. There were higher N-total and NO3-N concentrations (2.4 and 2.8 times respectively) determined in the borehole, which was situated in a manure fertilised field. As groundwater level rises in the boreholes, the N-total and NO3-N concentrations increase: in the manure fertilised field - r=0.46 and r=0.53, and in the sheds territory - r=0.41 and r=0.48, respectively. NH4-N concentrations in the boreholes have a tendency to fall as the water level rises - r=0.10 and r=0.28 respectively. Air temperature, rather than the precipitation level and N-min reserves in the soil, had a bigger impact on the increase of NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations in the borehole, while the mentioned factors had no effect on N-total and NO2-N concentrations.

The methods of statistical analysis, graphic representation and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) were used in the research. The analysed period was 2004 through 2014. The comparison between outbound tourism and domestic tourism consumption shows, that outbound tourists' consumption is considerably high compared to domestic tourists' consumption. However domestic tourism is much less sensitive to crises; it is quite stable and important segment in Lithuanian tourism industry. If to compare tourism consumption, two products show significant upward trend: Sport and other entertainment services since 2010 and Cultural services since 2011. After 2008 year recession domestic tourism sector revives, tourists expenditure reached pre-crisis level, although the increase of same-day visitors' expenditure is slightly. In the regions of Lithuania same-day tourism opportunities are well-exploited; however, overnight tourism possibilities are not well developed.

Economic resilience of regions can be determined by applying different approaches and also different indicators. Under this assessment, the size of the resilience of the regional economy can be monitored to some external negative effects. It is also possible to assess the influence of potential determinants to the economic resilience. In any case, it is necessary to determine the appropriate length of the analysed period, at the end of which the situation of regions is assessed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of different lengths of the analysed period. The effect of different time horizon is investigated first by classifying types of regions in terms of economic resilience and second also by the assessment of differences in strength of the relationship between potential determinants of economic resilience and a selected indicator of resilience. The analytical part of this paper is based on a dataset NUTS level 2 regions in connection with the economic crisis starting in 2008. The main research method used is a correlation analysis. The results show that the different length of a time horizon significantly influences both the classification of regions in terms of their resilience and also the strength of links between determinants and the indicator used for measuring economic resilience.","[Svoboda, Ondrej; Cicha, Veronika] Univ Pardubice, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Svoboda, O (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",ondrej.svoboda@upce.cz; veronika.cicha@student.upce.cz,"Svoboda, Ondřej/A-8878-2013; Svoboda, Ondřej/T-4467-2018","Svoboda, Ondřej/0000-0001-6456-7098; Svoboda, Ondřej/0000-0001-6456-7098",,,,,16,1,1,1,19,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7861-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,49,55,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-7861-2015-5,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD1ZW,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358536300005,0

The term mineral deposits protection is generally understood as the protection of area over mineral deposits from the work, which would make impossible or significantly restricted.its future exploitation (e.g. sustainable buildings). Based on the analysis of available literature, cartographic materials and documentation it was rated a minimum of the mineral deposits availability, depending on the type of exploitation of mineral deposits. The subject of research was planned and built investments of national and provincial roads in Poland. In case of road investment conduction through or closely to documented mineral deposits, its exploitation may cause conflicts in varying scale and scope. The result of the study was to determine a confrontation of road investments and the presence of mineral deposits divided into conflicts: a) the road operate hole and underground exploitation, and b) the road opencast exploitation. In this regard were used concrete examples of conflicts arising from the planning and implementation of road investments in Poland. Depending on the scale and scope of the conflict the proposals are consequently developed to minimize the negative impact of road construction on the availability of mineral deposits. These results should be reflected in the mineral resources management, where the availability of mineral deposits should be considered as one of the key issues of sustainable economic development. In this aspect it was pointed out the significant role of spatial planning and the need to enhance the legal protection of mineral deposits.","[Galas, Slavka; Galas, Andrzej] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Galas, S (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",,"Gałaś, Andrzej/A-7078-2017; Galas, Slavka/A-6631-2017","Gałaś, Andrzej/0000-0003-0083-3769; Galas, Slavka/0000-0003-3901-8390",,,,,8,3,3,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,485,491,,,,,,7,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200062,0

The paper separates sets of general, extensive and intensive indicators. For the first time the method basing on cycling process of metal stock utilization and its apparent annual consumption is proposed. The application of this methodological approach in one of metallurgy branches has allowed to compare metal stock formation and consumption under different versions of metallurgic production :in a territorial innovation cluster and without it. The substantial improvement of indices within the cluster has been demonstrated: the share of secondary raw materials in metal stock formation increased by 25%. The natural resources management has a paramount importance for material consuming production utilizing initial raw materials such as metallurgy. Separation of a new responsibility sphere and elaboration of metal stock and indices of its formation and application makes it possible to perform a through evaluation of resources utilization (from initial raw material up to finished products) and to propose recommendation for their improved utilization.","[Kostygova, Lyudmila] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow, Russia",National University of Science & Technology (MISIS),"Kostygova, L (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow, Russia.",,"Kostygova, Luydmila/AAH-9427-2020",,,,,,5,6,6,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,381,387,,,,,,7,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200049,0

Its essence is in searching for sustainable forms of interaction between national interests and current needs of local societies, effective industrial development and preserving natural surroundings, harmonization of the present tasks and the future generations' needs. Former industrial territory, subject to artificial landscape modification, under certain circumstances may turn into the site of cultural pilgrimage and ecologic tourism. The present research objective is to study Ruskeala Mining Park Phenomenon (the Republic of Karelia, RF) using geological, historical and economical methods based on Green mining conception principles. The idea of creating a modern landscape mining park based on the marble quarry in Ruskeala was initially promoted by NGOs activists, and the marble deposit development history was an argument for museumification of the territory. Light-gray with numerous variations Ruskeala marble was used for facing St. Isaac Cathedral, Marble Palace, the Engineers' Castle and other impressive buildings of the Russian North capital and the surroundings. Creation of the mining park started in 2003, and two years later it was officially opened for tourists. Successful introduction of many innovations (landscape works, color illumination of the quarry and underground workings, cleaning the quarry walls of graffiti, installation of floating constructions, research and development works at depth and others) allows keeping high interest to the site for more than ten years. Today the mining park combines an open-air museum, extreme activities center and space for photo and video artists' work. Growing popularity of the mining park is confirmed by the attendance dynamic pattern; in 2015 it gained 170 thousand people. Against the global closures of enterprises Ruskeala might as well suffer the same fate as other Russian settlements built in the Soviet times specifically for the workers of local enterprises. Thanks to the energy of several enthusiasts Ruskeala Mining Park has become today one of the points of the region's long-term growth and shares its unique experience of using mining-industrial heritage in tourism.","[Shekov, Kirill; Vitali, Shekov] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Karelian Res Ctr, Moscow 117901, Russia","Geological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Karelian Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geology of the Karelian Research Centre (IG KarRC)","Shekov, K (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Karelian Res Ctr, Moscow 117901, Russia.",,"Shekov, Vitali/G-9122-2017",,,,,,6,2,2,0,13,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,515,522,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200066,0

These changes show as the decrease in the accessibility of multiprofile round-the-clock hospitals in several urban groups of regional significance centres, which, on one hand, may be evident of city peripheralisation process that has started before the changes in healthcare infrastructure, and, on the other hand, may have a serious effect on the attractiveness of any given urban group for new groups of inhabitants in the future, thereby causing the concentration of inhabitants in urban groups where such infrastructure is available in full. In accordance with the purpose of studying the urban system within this study, the authors wishes to emphasise the spatial significance of healthcare infrastructure as an element of the social infrastructure, which might be indicative of anticipated changes in the urban system itself. For this purpose, the authors have calculated the round-the-clock multiprofile hospital coverage index that produces a value of 0 to 1. The authors believe that any actions on a national scale, including those involving changes in the infrastructure, inevitably cause a response within the urban system. When the availability of social infrastructure within a territory deteriorates, this territory runs the risk of periphery effect, which in turn affects the distribution of population and the professional structure of the inhabitants of cities or towns. These changes are difficult to follow up from the standpoint of research and practice, as the aforementioned does not appear at once. The processes of regional economy are fairly inertial. However, within the prospect of the next 10-20 years, the tendency that has arisen today might have essential detrimental consequences, and this risk is to be taken into consideration when making any further urban development prospects.","[Zaluksne, Viktorija; Bulderberga, Zane; Rivza, Baiba] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Zaluksne, V (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",,"Vitolina, Zane/AAF-4767-2019","Vitolina, Zane/0000-0002-7416-023X",,,,,6,1,1,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",1314-2704,,978-619-7105-67-4,INT MULTI SCI GEOCO,,,2016,,,,,,,321,326,,,,,,6,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BG7NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391520200041,0

The analysis of such components as trust, friendship, cooperation, engagement in activities for the benefit of local community, participation in organisations, obtaining information and the level of communication, participation in elections and the assessment of democracy made it possible to conclude that, in principle, there are no significant differences between social capital in rural and urban areas of the Lubelskie Region, which can be explained by the fact that rural areas are losing its traditional agricultural character, and the mixing of population - the rural population flows into urban areas and the urban population settles in the countryside.

One of the main aims of the Sustainable Development Strategy of the European Union is environmental protection, at the same time maintaining capacity of land to support life in all its diversity, bearing in mind that natural resources are limited. The challenge is to ensure environmental protection and improvement of the environment, to promote sustainable production and consumption in order to break the link between economic growth and environmental degradation. This can be achieved by improving the effectiveness of management of resources as well as avoiding over-exploitation of renewable or non-renewable natural resources and stopping the loss of biodiversity.

In a comparative analysis of the respective regions of Taganrog and Ostfold, several case studies in the IT -industry and the construction industry are conducted. Some interesting findings are detected between the hierarchical layers of the firms researched. The CEOs in both countries share the view on the level of innovation capacity in the firms they manage, while the view of employees and middle managers in the Russian Taganrog region's about their involvement in the firms' innovation is higher level than in the Norwegian Ostfold region. This indicates that the Russian firms have a more decentralized organizational and management structure with higher innovative capabilities in the two industries researched, and this provides the Russian firms with an organizational innovative advantage versus their counterpart in the Norwegian region. Based upon a benchmark analysis of the innovative capacities of industries and firms, the gap in capabilities of innovations in the regions researched is detected.

In 2013-2014, in Kaunas district farm, oil seed pumpkins cultivars 'Heracles', 'Hamlet', 'Danaja' were grown for research. The aim of two years research - to investigate the influence of compost/organic mulch to the quality of organically grown oil seed pumpkin fruit. Pumpkin seedlings were mulched with 5 and 10 cm thick layer of compost mulch. Standard methods were applied to identify the following: dry matter, soluble dry matter, crude protein, crude fibre and amounts of MADF, NDF, ADF fibre and crude in the pumpkin flesh. The results have determined that 5 and 10 cm compost mulch layer had a significant effect on the amount of dry matter in the pumpkin flesh. Basically, mulching has increased the amount of soluble dry matter in the pumpkin flesh. Crude protein accumulation in the fruit flesh was essentially affected by 5 cm thick layer of compost. Mulching with 5 and 10 cm compost layer has significantly increased the amount of crude fibre in 'Hamlet' and 'Heracles' cultivars. 5 and 10 cm compost mulch had a significant effect on the amount of crude ash. According to the researched indicators set parameters in ecologic system of the researched oil-seed pumpkins, the best cultivator to be grown with organic mulching is 'Hamlet'.","[Cerniauskiene, Judita; Kulaitiene, Jurgita; Danilcenko, Honorata; Jariene, Elvyra] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Agron, Inst Agr & Food Sci, Studentu G 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Cerniauskiene, J (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Agron, Inst Agr & Food Sci, Studentu G 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno Raj, Lithuania.",judita.cerniauskiene@asu.lt; jurgita.kulaitiene@asu.lt; honorata.danilcenko@asu.lt; elvyra.jariene@asu.lt,"Kulaitienè, Jurgita/ABW-1175-2022; Černiauskienė, Judita/AAJ-3220-2020","Černiauskienė, Judita/0000-0002-1953-9300",,,,,19,0,0,1,3,ALEKSANDRAS STULGINSKIS UNIVERSITY,AKADEMIJA,"CENTRE RURAL SOCIAL RESEARCH, FAC ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITETO STR 10-406, AKADEMIJA, KAUNAS DISTR 53361, LITHUANIA",1822-3230,,978-609-449-092-7,RURAL DEVELOPMENT,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,10.15544/RD.2015.034,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Geography; Public Administration,BH7LF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402648800070,0

This is to meet regulatory requirements, but also to achieve efficient internal capital management. Over the recent years, there has been increasing interest in the utilisation of insurance data at a more granular level, and to model claims using stochastic processes. So far, this so-called 'micro-level reserving' approach has mainly focused on the Poisson process. In this paper, we propose and apply a Cox process approach to model the arrival process and reporting pattern of insurance claims. This allows for over-dispersion and serial dependency in claim counts, which are typical features in real data.

Of particular interest is the case of contingent capital for banks, in the form of debt that converts to equity, when conversion is triggered by a decline in the bank's stock price. We analyze the problem of existence and uniqueness of equilibrium values for a firm's liabilities in this context, meaning values consistent with a market-price trigger. Discrete-time dynamics allow multiple equilibria. In contrast, we show that the possibility of multiple equilibria can largely be ruled out in continuous time, where the price of the triggering security adjusts in anticipation of breaching the trigger. Our main condition for existence of an equilibrium requires that the consequences of triggering a conversion be consistent with the direction in which the trigger is crossed. For the design of contingent capital with a stock price trigger, this condition may be interpreted to mean that conversion should be disadvantageous to shareholders, and it is satisfied by setting the trigger sufficiently high. Uniqueness follows provided the trigger is sufficiently accessible by all candidate equilibria. We illustrate precise formulations of these conditions with a variety of applications.","[Glasserman, Paul] Columbia Business Sch, 403 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Glasserman, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, 403 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pg20@columbia.edu; bn2164@columbia.edu,,,,,,,33,21,25,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2016,84.0,6,,,,,2113,2153,,10.3982/ECTA11206,0.0,,,41,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EB7TR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387594000006,0

Conventional estimation methods rely on the key assumption that the spatial weight matrix is exogenous, which would likely be violated in some empirical applications where spatial weights are determined by economic factors. In this paper, we propose an SDPD model with individual fixed effects in a short time dimension, where the spatial weights can be endogenous and time-varying. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the two-stage instrumental variable (2SIV) estimator and we investigate its finite sample properties using a Monte Carlo simulation.

Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of treatments for advanced cancer published between 2003 and 2013. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses expressed in cost per life-year gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year using an intermediate endpoint as an outcome measure were eligible. Characteristics of selected studies were extracted and comprised population, treatment of interest, comparator, line of treatment, study perspective, and time horizon. Use of intermediate endpoints and methods adopted when OS data were lacking were analyzed. Results In total, 7219 studies were identified and 100 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Intermediate endpoints mostly used were progression-free survival and time to progression, accounting for 92 % of included studies. OS data were unavailable for analysis in nearly 25 % of economic evaluations. In the absence of OS data, studies most commonly assumed an equal risk of death for all treatment groups. Other methods included use of indirect comparison based on numerous assumptions, use of a proxy for OS, consultation with clinical experts, and use of published external information from different treatment settings. Conclusion Intermediate endpoints are widely used in the economic evaluation of new treatments for advanced cancer in order to estimate OS. Currently, different methods are used in the absence of suitable OS data and the choice of an appropriate method depends on many factors including the data availability.","[Beauchemin, Catherine; Lapierre, Marie-Eve; Letarte, Nathalie; Lachaine, Jean] Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Stn Ctr Ville, POB 6128, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Letarte, Nathalie] Univ Montreal, Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Notre Dame Hosp, Hlth Ctr,Dept Pharm, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Yelle, Louise] Univ Montreal, Hlth Ctr, Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Dept Med,Notre Dame Hosp, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Beauchemin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, Stn Ctr Ville, POB 6128, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",catherine.beauchemin@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2016,34.0,9,,,,,889,900,,10.1007/s40273-016-0401-4,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OM,27002517.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383550900005,0

Dealers play an important role in reducing trading frictions: In a market with no dealers, a larger fraction of assets would be misallocated, and prices would be higher.

Historically, the focus of these has often been cost effectiveness or cost utility, while other criteria were considered informally. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in the formal incorporation of additional criteria using multi-criteria decision analysis. Such an approach has not yet formally been part of decision-making policy in Ireland. Objective The objective of this analysis is to demonstrate that cost effectiveness is not the only criterion influencing reimbursement decisions in Ireland. Furthermore, the aim is to reveal criteria that may have informally influenced reimbursement decisions in the past. Methods A list of potential criteria was identified based on the literature, national guidelines and experience of the national HTA agency. Information on each of these criteria was sought for every assessment conducted in Ireland up to July 2015. A logistic regression was fitted to the data to identify influential parameters. Model selection was performed using the Bolasso method. Results Thirteen criteria were considered in the analysis. Two members of the HTA review team assessed the performance of the interventions against these criteria. Model selection suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and quality of evidence could be important drivers of reimbursement recommendations in Ireland. Less important drivers suggested include the year of assessment, the level of uncertainty, as well as safety and tolerability. Conclusion The analysis demonstrates that recommendations for or against the reimbursement of technologies in Ireland are not only driven by cost effectiveness. This highlights the need for more formal inclusion of criteria in the process, to improve transparency and ensure consistency.","[Schmitz, Susanne; McCullagh, Laura; Adams, Roisin; Barry, Michael; Walsh, Cathal] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Schmitz, Susanne; McCullagh, Laura; Barry, Michael] St James Hosp, Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Walsh, Cathal] Univ Limerick, HRI, Limerick, Ireland; [Walsh, Cathal] Univ Limerick, MACSI, Limerick, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; University of Limerick; University of Limerick,"Schmitz, S (通讯作者)，St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin 8, Ireland.;Schmitz, S (通讯作者)，St James Hosp, Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Dublin 8, Ireland.",schmitzs@tcd.ie,"Walsh, Chloe/AAM-1093-2020; Schmitz, Susanne/K-8854-2019; McCullagh, Laura/HOF-9342-2023","Barry, Michael/0000-0002-6232-3003; McCullagh, Laura/0000-0001-8342-8739; Walsh, Cathal/0000-0001-6599-9562",,,,,20,17,17,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2016,34.0,9,,,,,925,937,,10.1007/s40273-016-0406-z,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OM,27034245.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383550900008,0

In particular, our functional coefficient logarithmic autoregressive conditional duration (FC-LACD) model relies on a smooth transition autoregressive specification. The motivation lies on the fact that the latter yields a universal approximation if one lets the number of regimes grows without bound. After establishing sufficient conditions for strict stationarity, we address model identifiability as well as the asymptotic properties of the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator for the FC-LACD model with a fixed number of regimes. In addition, we also discuss how to consistently estimate a semiparametric variant of the FC-LACD model that takes the number of regimes to infinity. An empirical illustration indicates that our functional coefficient model is flexible enough to model IBM price durations.","[Fernandes, Marcelo] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Fernandes, Marcelo] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England; [Medeiros, Marcelo C.] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Veiga, Alvaro] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Elect Engn, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro,"Fernandes, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England.",marcelo.fernandes@fgv.br,"Medeiros, Marcelo C/I-9133-2014","Fernandes, Marcelo/0000-0002-4680-0439; VEIGA, Alvaro/0000-0003-0200-6724",CNPq; Pronex/FAPERJ,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Pronex/FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)),We thank the CNPq and Pronex/FAPERJ for financial support.,,29,1,1,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

In addition to receiving ordinary dividends when cash reserves reach a threshold, outside equity holders also receive special dividends or inject cash in the cash reserves to hedge against model uncertainty and smooth dividends.

We propose a plug-in estimator which is based on a dimension reduction technique and additional thresholding. It is shown that this estimator is consistent and can attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence under additional regularity conditions. This, however, requires an optimal choice of the dimension parameter m depending on certain characteristics of the structural function phi and the joint distribution of the regressor and the instrument, which are unknown in practice. We propose a fully data driven choice of m which combines model selection and Lepski's method. We show that the adaptive estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence up to a logarithmic factor.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to testing structural changes in GARCH models. The idea is to compare the log likelihood of a time-varying parameter GARCH model with that of a constant parameter GARCH model, where the time-varying GARCH parameters are estimated by a local quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) and the constant GARCH parameters are estimated by a standard QMLE. The test does not require any prior information about the alternatives of structural changes. It has an asymptotic N(0,1) distribution under the null hypothesis of parameter constancy and is consistent against a vast class of smooth structural changes as well as abrupt structural breaks with possibly unknown break points. A consistent parametric bootstrap is employed to provide a reliable inference in finite samples and a simulation study highlights the merits of our test.","[Chen, Bin] Univ Rochester, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Hong, Yongmiao] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Hong, Yongmiao] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",University of Rochester; Cornell University; Xiamen University,"Chen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.;Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",bchen8@mail.rochester.edu; yh20@cornell.edu,,"Hong, Yongmiao/0000-0002-9711-9061; Chen, Bin/0000-0001-7201-2359",National Science Foundation of China; Chinese Ministry of Education; Xiamen University,"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); Xiamen University(Xiamen University)",Hong acknowledges support from the National Science Foundation of China and the Cheung Kong Visiting Scholarship by the Chinese Ministry of Education and Xiamen University.,,50,11,14,5,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

By using a version of the stochastic maximum principle approach, we characterize the open loop equilibrium strategies via a stochastic system which consists of a flow of forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs in short) and an equilibrium condition.

This paper aims to examine the potential value of VOI, barriers and facilitators and the way forward with the use of VOI in the decision-making process for reimbursement of pharmaceuticals in the Netherlands. Three focus group interviews were conducted with researchers, policy makers, and representatives of pharmaceutical companies. The results revealed that although all stakeholders recognize the relevance of VOI, it is hardly used and many barriers to the performance and use of VOI were identified. One of these barriers is that not all uncertainties are easily incorporated in VOI, and the results may be biased if structural uncertainties are ignored. Furthermore, not all research designs indicated by VOI may be feasible in practice. To fully embed VOI into current decision-making processes, a threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and guidelines that clarify when and how VOI should be performed are needed.

The MIF method exploits the absolute continuity of admissible indemnification functions and formulates optimal reinsurance model into a functional linear programming of determining an optimal measurable function valued over a bounded interval. The MIF method was recently introduced to analyze the reinsurance model but without premium budget constraint. In this paper, a Lagrangian dual method is applied to combine with MIF to solve for optimal reinsurance solutions under premium budget constraint. Compared with the existing literature, the proposed integrated MIF-based Lagrangian dual method provides a more technically convenient and transparent solution to the optimal reinsurance design. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method, analytical solution is derived on a particular reinsurance model that involves minimizing Conditional Value at Risk (a special case of distortion function) and with the reinsurance premium being determined by the inverse-S shaped distortion principle.

The health system must be responsive to individual patient choices and preferences about their care, while considering the system consequences. While dynamic simulation modelling (DSM) and big data share characteristics, they present distinct and complementary value in healthcare. Big data and DSM are synergistic-big data offer support to enhance the application of dynamic models, but DSM also can greatly enhance the value conferred by big data. Big data can inform patient-centred care with its high velocity, volume, and variety (the three Vs) over traditional data analytics; however, big data are not sufficient to extract meaningful insights to inform approaches to improve healthcare delivery. DSM can serve as a natural bridge between the wealth of evidence offered by big data and informed decision making as a means of faster, deeper, more consistent learning from that evidence. We discuss the synergies between big data and DSM, practical considerations and challenges, and how integrating big data and DSM can be useful to decision makers to address complex, systemic health economics and outcomes questions and to transform healthcare delivery.","[Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Room 3C56 Hlth Res Innovat Ctr,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Burgos-Liz, Lina] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Room 3C58 Hlth Res Innovat Ctr,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Pasupathy, Kalyan S.] Mayo Clin, Robert D & Patricia E Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Deli, Clin Engn Learning Lab, Rochester, MN USA; [Padula, William V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [IJzerman, Maarten J.] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Wong, Peter K.] Hosp Sisters Hlth Syst, Illinois Div, Belleville, IL USA; [Wong, Peter K.] Hosp Sisters Hlth Syst, HSHS Med Grp, Belleville, IL USA; [Higashi, Mitchell K.] GE Healthcare, Barrington, IL USA; [Engbers, Jordan; Wiebe, Samuel] Univ Calgary, Clin Res Unit, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Crown, William] Optum Labs, Boston, MA USA; [Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Bioengn Div, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary; Mayo Clinic; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; University of Twente; General Electric; University of Calgary; Optum; University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Marshall, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Room 3C56 Hlth Res Innovat Ctr,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",damarsha@ucalgary.ca,"Osgood, Nathaniel/L-1805-2016; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; IJzerman, Maarten/AAB-6894-2020; IJzerman, Maarten J/Q-8963-2016; Padula, Bill/AGB-4625-2022; Patten, Scott/B-4434-2011; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","IJzerman, Maarten/0000-0001-5788-5805; IJzerman, Maarten J/0000-0001-5788-5805; Patten, Scott/0000-0001-9871-4041; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008; Osgood, Nathaniel/0000-0002-3994-3298",Hopewell Professorship of Clinical Neurosciences Research at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute; Alberta Innovates Health Solutions; American Brain Foundation; [1 F32 HS023710-01],Hopewell Professorship of Clinical Neurosciences Research at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute; Alberta Innovates Health Solutions; American Brain Foundation;,"Lina Burgos-Liz: No conflicts of interest.

This is motivated by the concern of overfitting and the typically imprecise inference in these highly parameterized models. For each VAR coefficient, this new method automatically decides whether it is constant or time-varying. Moreover, it can be used to shrink an otherwise unrestricted time-varying parameter VAR to a stationary VAR, thus providing an easy way to (probabilistically) impose stationarity in time-varying parameter models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a topical application, where we investigate the dynamic effects of structural shocks in government spending on U.S. taxes and gross domestic product (GDP) during a period of very low interest rates.","[Eisenstat, Eric; Strachan, Rodney W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Level 6,Colin Clark Bldg, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Chan, Joshua C.

Several variables commonly used to predict accidents rates, such as gender and territory, are being questioned by regulators. Insurers are pressured to find new variables that predict accidents more accurately and are socially acceptable. Annual mileage seems an ideal candidate. The recent development in new technologies should induce insurance carriers to explore ways to introduce mileage-based insurance premiums. We use the unique database of a major insurer in Taiwan to investigate whether annual mileage should be introduced as a rating variable in auto third-party liability insurance. We find that annual mileage is an extremely powerful predictor of the number of claims at-fault. The inclusion of mileage as a new variable should, however, not take place at the expense of bonus-malus systems; rather, the information contained in the bonus-malus premium level complements the value of annual mileage. An accurate rating system should therefore include annual mileage and bonus-malus as the two main building blocks, possibly supplemented by the use of other variables like age, territory and engine cubic capacity. While Taiwan has specific characteristics (high traffic density, a mild bonus-malus system and limited compulsory auto coverage), our results are so strong that we can confidently conjecture that they extend to all developed nations.","[Lemaire, Jean] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 459 JMHH,3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Park, Sojung Carol] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Wang, Kili C.] Tamkang Univ, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, Coll Commerce, Natl Chengchi Univ, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",University of Pennsylvania; Seoul National University (SNU); Tamkang University; National Chengchi University,"Park, SC (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151, South Korea.",lemaire@wharton.upenn.edu; park.sojung@gmail.com; kili@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Park, Sojung/AAQ-2573-2020",,,,,,43,53,54,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2016,46.0,1,,,,,39,69,,10.1017/asb.2015.25,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DD0GJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000369598100003,0

We first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through the degree of explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity (extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy-tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity measures in the asset cross section, but also reduces higher order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation proposed by Panayi et al. [Market resilience, 2014] for the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured by the majority of liquidity measures and has important ramifications for understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across a range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from the vast LOB data-set is then amenable to a functional data representation. This enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross section via functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components analysis) can explain between 10 and 40% of the variation in liquidity resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect.","[Panayi, Efstathios] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6EA, England; [Peters, Gareth W.; Kosmidis, Ioannis] UCL, Dept Stat, London WC1E 7HB, England; [Panayi, Efstathios; Peters, Gareth W.] UCL, Syst Risk Ctr, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Panayi, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6EA, England.",efstathios.panayi.10@ucl.uk,"; Kosmidis, Ioannis/A-3012-2012","Peters, Gareth/0000-0003-2768-8979; Kosmidis, Ioannis/0000-0003-1556-0302",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K002309/1]; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The support of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in funding the Systemic Risk Centre is gratefully acknowledged [grant number ES/K002309/1].,,42,3,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We analyse a set of effects leading to significant biases in the estimation of the criticality index' n that quantifies the degree of endogeneity of how much past events trigger future events. We report the following model biases: (i) evidence of strong upward biases on the estimation of n when using power law memory kernels in the presence of outliers, (ii) strong effects on n resulting from the form of the regularization part of the power law kernel, (iii) strong edge effects on the estimated n when using power law kernels and (iv) the need for an exhaustive search of the absolute maximum of the log-likelihood function due to its complicated shape. Moreover, we demonstrate that the calibration of the Hawkes process on mixtures of pure Poisson process with changes of regime leads to completely spurious apparent critical values for the branching ratio (), while the true value is actually . More generally, regime shifts on the parameters of the Hawkes model and/or on the generating process itself are shown to systematically lead to a significant upward bias in the estimation of the branching ratio. We demonstrate the importance of the preparation of the high-frequency financial data, in particular: (a) the impact of overnight trading in the analysis of long-term trends, (b) intraday seasonality and detrending of the data and (c) vulnerability of the analysis to day-to-day non-stationarity and regime shifts. Special care is given to the decrease of quality of the timestamps of tick data due to latency and grouping of messages to packets by the stock exchange. Altogether, our careful exploration of the caveats of the calibration of the Hawkes process stresses the need for considering all the above issues before any conclusion can be sustained.

Little research has been published on the incremental cost effectiveness of preventative therapy (PT) in groups at high risk for progression from latent TB infection (LTBI) with Mycobacterium TB (MTB) to active disease. A systematic review of studies with a primary focus on model-driving inputs and methodological differences was conducted. A search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE to July 2014 was undertaken, and reference lists of eligible articles and relevant reviews were examined. A total of 876 citations were retrieved, with a total of 24 studies being eligible for inclusion, addressing six high-risk groups other than contact persons. Results varied considerably between studies and countries, and also over time. Although the selected studies generally demonstrated cost effectiveness for PT in HIV-infected subjects and healthcare workers (HCWs), the outcome of these analyses can be questioned in light of recent epidemiologic data. For immigrants from high TB-burden countries, patients with end-stage renal disease, and the immunosuppressed, now defined as further vulnerable groups, no consistent recommendation can be taken from the literature with respect to cost effectiveness of screening and treating LTBI. When the concept of a fixed willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold as a prerequisite for final categorization was used, the sums ranged between 'no specification' and US$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. To date, incremental cost-effectiveness analyses on PT in groups at high risk for TB progression, other than contacts, are surprisingly scarce. The variation found between studies likely reflects variations in the major epidemiologic factors, particularly in the estimates on the accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) as screening methods used before considering PT. Further research, including explicit evaluation of local epidemiological conditions, test accuracy, and methodology of WTP thresholds, is needed.","[Diel, Roland] Univ Med Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Inst Epidemiol, D-24015 Kiel, Germany; [Lampenius, Niklas] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Accounting & Finance, Stuttgart, Germany; [Nienhaus, Albert] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Hlth Serv Res Dermatol & Nursing, Hamburg, Germany",University Hohenheim; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf,"Diel, R (通讯作者)，Univ Med Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Inst Epidemiol, Niemannsweg 11, D-24015 Kiel, Germany.",roland.diel@epi.uni-kiel.de,"Nienhaus, Albert/ISS-7060-2023","Nienhaus, Albert/0000-0003-1881-7302","Cellestis Ltd; Oxford Immunotec, Inc.; Pharmore Ltd.","Cellestis Ltd; Oxford Immunotec, Inc.; Pharmore Ltd.","In the previous 5 years, Roland Diel has received a fee and/or travel reimbursement for speaking at symposia supported by Cellestis Ltd, Oxford Immunotec, Inc., and Pharmore Ltd.",,65,9,10,2,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2015,33.0,8,,,,,783,809,,10.1007/s40273-015-0267-x,0.0,,,27,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CN8FP,25774015.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358675200002,0

Litigation concerns, a more risk-averse regulatory policy, and the difficulty of developing a product with a compelling risk-benefit profile in this category may have limited innovators' expected return on investment and restricted investment in this therapeutic area. The objective of the study was to estimate perceived manufacturer risk associated with product safety litigation and increased development costs vs. revenue expectations on anticipated return on investment and to determine which scenarios might change a manufacturer's investment decision. Expected net present value of a weight-management drug entering pre-clinical trials was calculated for a range of scenarios representing evolving expectations of development costs, revenue, and litigation risk over the past 25 years. These three factors were based on published estimates, historical data, and analogs from other therapeutic areas. The main driver in expected net present value calculations is expected revenue, particularly if one assumes that litigation risk and demand are positively correlated. Changes in development costs associated with increased regulatory concern with potential safety issues for the past 25 years likely did not impact investment decisions. Regulatory policy and litigation risk both played a role in anti-obesity drug development; however, product revenue-reflecting efficacy at acceptable levels of safety-was by far the most important factor. To date, relatively modest sales associated with recent product introductions suggest that developing a product that is sufficiently efficacious with an acceptable level of safety continues to be the primary challenge in this market.","[Chawla, Anita; Carls, Ginger; Deng, Edmund; Tuttle, Edward] Anal Grp, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",Analysis Group Inc.,"Chawla, A (通讯作者)，Anal Grp, 1010 El Camino Real,Suite 310, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",Anita.Chawla@analysisgroup.com,,,,,,,71,2,2,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2015,33.0,7,,,,,749,763,,10.1007/s40273-015-0300-0,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CL6EN,26054325.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357060500012,0

We introduce the OEH model, which incorporates this fact when determining the optimal trading horizon for an order, an input required by many sophisticated execution strategies. This model exploits the trader's private information about her trade's side and size, and how it will shift the prevailing order flow. From a theoretical perspective, OEH explains why market participants may rationally dump their orders in an increasingly illiquid market. We argue that trade side and order imbalance are key variables needed for modeling market impact functions, and their dismissal may be the reason behind the apparent disagreement in the literature regarding the functional form of the market impact function. We show that in terms of its information ratio OEH performs better than participation rate schemes and VWAP strategies. Our backtests suggest that OEH contributes substantial execution alpha for a wide variety of futures contracts.

The model can be partially identified due to potentially limited-support regressors and an unknown distribution of errors. A set estimator analogous to the maximum score estimator is essentially cube-root consistent for the identified set when a continuous but possibly bounded regressor is present. Arbitrarily fast convergence occurs when all regressors are discrete. We also establish the validity of a subsampling procedure for constructing confidence sets for the identified set. As a technical contribution, we provide more convenient sufficient conditions on the underlying empirical processes for cube-root convergence and a sufficient condition for arbitrarily fast convergence, both of which can be applied to other models. Finally, we carry out a series of Monte Carlo experiments, which verify our theoretical findings and shed light on the finite-sample performance of the proposed procedures.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Blevins, JR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 N High St,410 Arps Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",blevins.141@osu.edu,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Our estimator is inspired by Pickands (1975) where it is shown that arbitrary distributions which lie in the domain of attraction of an extreme value type have tails that, in the limit, behave as generalized Pareto distributions (GPD). Smith (1987) has studied the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the parameters of the GPD in this context, but in our paper the relevant random variables used in estimation are standardized residuals from a first stage kernel based nonparametric estimation. We obtain convergence in probability and distribution of the residual based ML estimator for the parameters of the GPD as well as the asymptotic distribution for a suitably defined quantile estimator. A Monte Carlo study provides evidence that our estimator behaves well in finite samples and is easily implementable.

Although uncertainty is usually carefully addressed in health economic evaluations, whether and how the different sources of uncertainty are dealt with and with what methods in MCDA is less known. The objective of this study is to review how uncertainty can be explicitly taken into account in MCDA and to discuss which approach may be appropriate for healthcare decision makers. A literature review was conducted in the Scopus and PubMed databases. Two reviewers independently categorized studies according to research areas, the type of MCDA used, and the approach used to quantify uncertainty. Selected full text articles were read for methodological details. The search strategy identified 569 studies. The five approaches most identified were fuzzy set theory (45 % of studies), probabilistic sensitivity analysis (15 %), deterministic sensitivity analysis (31 %), Bayesian framework (6 %), and grey theory (3 %). A large number of papers considered the analytic hierarchy process in combination with fuzzy set theory (31 %). Only 3 % of studies were published in healthcare-related journals. In conclusion, our review identified five different approaches to take uncertainty into account in MCDA. The deterministic approach is most likely sufficient for most healthcare policy decisions because of its low complexity and straightforward implementation. However, more complex approaches may be needed when multiple sources of uncertainty must be considered simultaneously.","[Broekhuizen, Henk; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

Claims are being requested at random epochs from each reserve and the interclaim times are generally distributed. The two reserves are coupled in the sense that at a claim arrival epoch, claims are being requested from both reserves and the amounts requested are correlated. In addition, the claim amounts are correlated with the time elapsed since the previous claim arrival. We focus on the probability that this bivariate reserve process survives indefinitely. The infinite-horizon survival problem is shown to be related to the problem of determining the equilibrium distribution of a random walk with vector-valued increments with 'reflecting' boundary. This reflected random walk is actually the waiting time process in a queueing system dual to the bivariate ruin process. Under assumptions on the arrival process and the claim amounts, and using Wiener-Hopf factorization with one parameter, we explicitly determine the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the survival function, c.q., the two-dimensional equilibrium waiting time distribution. Finally, the bivariate transforms are evaluated for some examples, including for proportional reinsurance, and the bivariate ruin functions are numerically calculated using an efficient inversion scheme.

In more detail, we show that in our model the assumption of a positive dependence structure improves the best-possible lower estimate of a risk measure, while leaving unchanged its worst-possible upper risk bounds. In a similar way, we derive for convex risk measures that the assumption of a negative dependence structure leads to improved upper bounds for the risk while it does not help to increase the lower risk bounds in an essential way.

The investor invests her wealth in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky asset. The price processes of the riskless asset and the risky asset are modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain, which is the phase process of a BMAP. The possible consumption or investment are restricted to a sequence of random discrete time points which are determined by the same BMAP. The investor has only consumption opportunities at some of these random time points, has both consumption and investment opportunities at some other random time points, and can do nothing at the remaining random time points. The object of the investor is to select the consumption-investment strategy that maximizes the expected total discounted utility. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of the consumption-investment opportunity and the economic state on the value functions and consumption-investment strategies. The general solution and the exact solution under the assumption that the consumption and the terminal wealth are evaluated by the power utility are obtained. Finally, a numerical example is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Under the null that the {w(t)} are irrelevant, by orthogonalizing with respect to the {x(t)}, the estimator distributions of the x(t)'s parameters are unaffected by selection even for more variables than observations and for endogenous variables. Under the alternative, when the joint model nests the generating process, an improved outcome results from selection.

In a ruin context, similar mechanisms to the one proposed in this paper have been studied by, e.g., Tsai and Parker (2004), Afonso et al. (2009) and Loisel and Trufin (2013). In our proposed risk model, we assume that the effective premium rate is determined based on the surplus increments between successive random review times. When review times are distributed as a combination of exponentials and claim arrivals follow a compound Poisson process, we derive a matrix-form defective renewal equation for the Gerber-Shiu function, and provide an explicit expression for the discounted joint density of the surplus prior to ruin and the deficit at ruin. Numerical examples are later considered to numerically evaluate certain ruin-related quantities. A comparison with their counterparts in a constant premium rate model is also presented.

The primary statistic of marginal analysis is the marginal effect (ME). The ME facilitates the examination of outcomes for defined patient profiles while measuring the change in original units (e.g., costs, probabilities). The ME has a long history in economics; however, it is not widely used in health services research despite its flexibility and ability to provide unique insights. This paper, the first in a two-part series, introduces and illustrates the calculation of the ME for a variety of regression models often used in health services research. Part One includes a review of prior studies discussing MEs, followed by derivation of ME formulas for various regression models including linear, logistic, multinomial logit model (MLM), generalized linear model (GLM) for continuous data, GLM for count data, two-part model, sample selection (two-stage) model, and parametric survival model. Prior theoretical papers in health services research reported the derivation and interpretation of ME primarily for the linear and logistic models, with less emphasis on count models, survival models, MLM, two-part models, and sample selection models. These additional models are relevant for health services research studies examining costs and utilization. Part Two of the series will focus on the methods for estimating and interpreting the ME in applied research. The illustration, discussion, and application of ME in this two-part series support the conduct of future studies applying the marginal concept.","[Onukwugha, Eberechukwu] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Bergtold, Jason] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Jain, Rahul] HealthCore Inc, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Kansas State University; HealthCore, Inc","Onukwugha, E (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",eonukwug@rx.umaryland.edu,"Bergtold, Jason/AAA-1041-2022",,,,,,18,30,39,1,23,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2015,33.0,1,,,,,25,30,,10.1007/s40273-014-0210-6,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AX8IG,25189459.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347152700004,0

The two main contributions are: (i) an analytic characterization of the values of optimal contracts in the limit as the period length goes to 0, and (ii) the construction of relatively simple (almost) optimal contracts for fixed period lengths. Our setting is flexible and includes the pure hidden action or pure hidden information models as special cases. We show how such details of the underlying information structure affect the optimal provision of incentives and the value of the contracts. The dependence is very tractable and we obtain sharp comparative statics results.

Such tests are irregular in the sense that the first order derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the heterogeneity parameter is identically zero, and consequently the conventional Fisher information about the parameter is zero. Nevertheless, local asymptotic optimality of the C(alpha) tests can be established via LeCam's differentiability in quadratic mean and the limit experiment approach. This leads to local alternatives of order n(-1/4). The scalar case result is already familiar from existing literature and we extend it to the multidimensional case. The new framework reveals that certain regularity conditions commonly employed in earlier developments are unnecessary, i.e. the symmetry or third moment condition imposed on the heterogeneity distribution. Additionally, the limit experiment for the multidimensional case suggests modifications on existing tests for slope heterogeneity in cross sectional and panel data models that lead to power improvement. Since the C(alpha) framework is not restricted to the parametric model and the test statistics do not depend on the particular choice of the heterogeneity distribution, it is useful for a broad range of applications for testing parametric heterogeneity.","[Gu, Jiaying] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 214 David Kinley Hall,1407 W Gregory Dr,MC-707, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gu, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 214 David Kinley Hall,1407 W Gregory Dr,MC-707, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",gu17@illinois.edu,,,NSF [SES-11-53548]; Paul Boltz summer Fellowship,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Paul Boltz summer Fellowship,I gratefully acknowledge financial support from NSF grant SES-11-53548 and the Paul Boltz summer Fellowship.,,48,3,3,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The selected trading period covers 2087 trading days starting on 09/05/2005 and ending on 21/12/2015. The proposed model is a combined particle swarm optimiser (PSO) and a radial basis function (RBF) neural network which is trained using sliding windows of 300 and 400days. This is benchmarked against a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and higher order neural network using the same data-set. Outputs from the neural networks provide forecasts for 5days ahead trading simulations. To model the spread an expansive universe of 250 inputs across different asset classes is also used. Included in the input data-set are 20 Autoregressive Moving Average models and 10 Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity volatility models. Results reveal that the sliding window approach to modelling the crack spread is effective when using 300 and 400days training periods. Sliding windows of less than 300days were found to produce unsatisfactory trading performance and reduced statistical accuracy. The PSO RBF model which was trained over 300 is superior in both trading performance and statistical accuracy when compared to its peers. As each of the unfiltered models' volatility and maximum drawdown were unattractive, a threshold confirmation filter is employed. The threshold confirmation filter only trades when the forecasted returns are greater than an optimized threshold of forecasted returns. As a consequence, only forecasted returns of stronger conviction produce trading signals. This filter attempts to reduce maximum drawdowns and volatility by trading less frequently and only during times of greater predicted change. Ultimately, the confirmation filter improves risk return profiles for each model and transaction costs were also significantly reduced.","[Karathanasopoulos, Andreas; Khalil, Samer] Amer Univ Beirut, Olayan Business Sch, Beirut, Lebanon; [Dunis, Christian] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",American University of Beirut; Liverpool John Moores University,"Karathanasopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Olayan Business Sch, Beirut, Lebanon.",ak152@aub.edu.lb,,,,,,,43,5,5,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We work with the dependent multivariate Pareto type II proposed by Arnold (1983, 2015), which is widely used in insurance and risk analysis. We begin with an individual risk model, where the probability density function corresponds to a second kind beta distribution, obtaining the VaR, TVaR and several other tail risk measures. Then, we consider a collective risk model based on dependence, where several general properties are studied. We study in detail some relevant collective models with Poisson, negative binomial and logarithmic distributions as primary distributions. In the collective Pareto-Poisson model, the probability density function is a function of the Kummer confluent hypergeometric function, and the density of the Pareto-negative binomial is a function of the Gauss hypergeometric function. Using data based on one-year vehicle insurance policies taken out in 2004-2005 (Jong and Heller, 2008) we conclude that our collective dependent models outperform other collective models considered in the actuarial literature in terms of AIC and CAIC statistics.

Systematic mortality risk is due to the uncertain development of future mortality intensities, or hazard rates. In this paper, we develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a mortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure endowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are correlated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment by assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality forward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality risk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. The major result of this paper is that the value per contract solves a linear partial differential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can represent the limiting price as an expectation under an equivalent martingale measure. Another important result is that hedging with the mortality forward may raise or lower the price of this pure endowment comparing to its price without hedging, as determined in Bayraktar et al. (2009). The market price of the reference mortality risk and the correlation between the two portfolios jointly determine the cost of hedging. We demonstrate our results using numerical examples.

They developed a framework that yields optimal tests, in the sense that they nearly attain some local Gaussian power envelop. The main ingredient in their setup is that the variance of the process generating the changes in the parameters must go to zero at a fast rate. They recommended the so-called qLL test, a partial sums type test based on the residuals obtained from the restricted model. We show that for breaks that are very small, its power is indeed higher than other tests, including the popular sup-Wald (SW) test. However, the differences are very minor. When the magnitude of change is moderate to large, the power of the test is very low in the context of a regression with lagged dependent variables or when a correction is applied to account for serial correlation in the errors. In many cases, the power goes to zero as the magnitude of change increases. The power of the SW test does not show this non-monotonicity and its power is far superior to the qLL test when the break is not very small. We claim that the optimality of the qLL test does not come from the properties of the test statistics but the criterion adopted, which is not useful to analyze structural change tests. Instead, we use fixed-break size asymptotic approximations to assess the relative efficiency or power of the two tests. When doing so, it is shown that the SW test indeed dominates the qLL test and, in many cases, the latter has zero relative asymptotic efficiency.","[Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Yamamoto, Yohei] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Boston University; Hitotsubashi University,"Perron, P (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",perron@bu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0649350]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25870235, 25245042] Funding Source: KAKEN","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Perron acknowledges financial support for this work from the National Science Foundation under Grant SES-0649350.,,33,10,10,2,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We suggest a model which can capture the statistical properties of autocorrelation, volatility clustering and jump effects is more appropriate for modelling CO2 emission allowance prices. We establish a general framework for pricing CO2 emission allowance options on futures contracts with these properties and find that the jump risk significantly affects the value of the CO2 emission allowance option on futures contracts.

One of the main questions that worries both researchers and practitioners is the bias in the data on the operational losses amounts recorded. We support the assertions made by several authors and defend that this concern is serious when modeling operational losses data and, typically, is presented in all the databases. We show that it's possible, based on mild assumptions on the internal procedures put in place to manage operational losses, to make parametric inference using loss data statistics, that is, to estimate the parameters for the losses amounts, taking in consideration the bias that, not being considered, generates a two fold error in the estimators for the mean loss amount and the total loss amount, the former being overvalued and the last undervalued. In this paper, we do not consider the existence of a threshold for which, all losses above, are reported and available for analysis and estimation procedures. In this sense, we follow a different approach to the parametric inference. Here, we consider that the probability that a loss is reported and ends up recorded for analysis, increases with the size of the loss, what causes the bias in the database but, at the same time, we do not consider the existence of a threshold, above which, all losses are recorded. Hence, no loss has probability one of being recorded, in what we defend is a realist framework. We deduce the general formulae, present simulations for common theoretical distributions used to model (operational reported) losses amounts, estimate the impact for not considering the bias factor when estimating the value at risk and estimate the true total operational losses the bank incurred.","[Afonso, Lourdes B.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CMA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Real, Pedro Corte] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Matemat, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Afonso, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CMA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.",lbafonso@fct.unl.pt; parcr@fct.unl.pt,"Afonso, Lourdes/X-6006-2018","Afonso, Lourdes/0000-0002-3831-7164",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) [PEst-OE/MAT/UI0297/2014(CMA)],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge to Magentakoncept - Consultores Lda, for the computational support.

However, real-world insurance markets always place a limit on coverage, otherwise the insurer will be subjected to under a heavy financial burden when the insured suffers a large unexpected covered loss. In this paper, we revisit the optimal reinsurance problem under the optimality criteria of VaR and TVaR risk measures when the constraints for the reinsurer's risk exposure are presented. Two types of constraints are considered that have been proposed by Cummins and Mahul (2004) and Zhou et al. (2010), respectively. It is shown that two-layer reinsurance is always the optimal reinsurance policy under both VaR and TVaR risk measures and under both types of constraints. This implies that the two layer reinsurance policy is more robust. Furthermore, the optimal quantity of ceded risk depends on the confidence level, the safety loading and the tolerance level, as well as on the relation between them. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For a simple linear price impact model and a quadratic criterion, we explicitly obtain approximate optimal strategies in the intraday market and thermal power generation, and exhibit some remarkable properties of the trading rate. Furthermore, we study the case when there are jumps on the demand forecast and on the intraday price, typically due to error in the prediction of wind power generation.

In this paper, we develop a stochastic programming (SP) model for the hedging problem in a realistic setting, where all transactions take place at observed bid and ask prices. The SP model relies on a realistic modeling of the important risk factors for the application, the price of the underlying security and the volatility surface. The volatility surface is unobservable and must be estimated from a cross section of observed option quotes that contain noise and possibly arbitrage. In order to produce arbitrage-free volatility surfaces of high quality as input to the SP model, a novel non-parametric estimation method is used. The dimension of the volatility surface is infinite and in order to be able solve the problem numerically, we use discretization and principal component analysis to reduce the dimensions of the problem. Testing the model out-of-sample for options on the Swedish OMXS30 index, we show that the SP model is able to produce a hedge that has both a lower realized risk and cost compared with dynamic delta and delta-vega hedging strategies.","[Barkhagen, Mathias; Blomvall, Jorgen] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Barkhagen, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",mathias.barkhagen@liu.se,"Blomvall, Jörgen/A-4200-2010","Blomvall, Jorgen/0000-0002-3558-2579",,,,,33,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We present a feasible representation of optionality in TEP projects and propose a tractable evaluation of option value.

The markets are subject to independent, stochastic fluctuations in demands. According to the literature, the demand fluctuations generally hinder collusion, while the multimarket contact sometimes facilitates it. We show that when only partial collusion is sustainable under a single market, the per-market expected profit under the most collusive equilibrium increases with the number of markets. Further, the difference between the total expected profit under full collusion and that under the most collusive equilibrium vanishes, if the number of markets goes to infinity.

We use novel panel variance ratio tests, based on the wild bootstrap proposed in this paper, which exhibit desirable size and power properties in small samples. We have found evidence that stock returns have been highly predictable from 1964 to 1996, except for a period leading to the 1987 crash and its aftermath. After 1997, stock returns have been unpredictable overall. At a disaggregated level, we find evidence that large-cap portfolios have been priced more efficiently than small- or medium-cap portfolios; and that the stock returns from high-tech industries are far less predictable than those from non-high-tech industries.","[Kim, Jae H.] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Shamsuddin, Abul] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",La Trobe University; University of Newcastle,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",J.Kim@latrobe.edu.au,,"Shamsuddin, Abul/0000-0003-3109-4989",,,,,52,7,7,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Many approaches have been proposed in the last two decades to calibrate a SPD using financial options from the bond and equity markets. Among these, non and semiparametric methods were preferred because they can avoid model mis-specification of the underlying. However, these methods usually require a large data set to achieve desired convergence properties. One faces the problem in estimation by e.g., kernel techniques that there are not enough observations locally available. For this situation, we employ a Bayesian quadrature method because it allows us to incorporate prior assumptions on the model parameters and hence avoids problems with data sparsity. It is able to compute the SPD of both call and put options simultaneously, and is particularly robust when the market faces the data sparsity issue. As illustration, we calibrate the SPD for weather derivatives, a classical example of incomplete markets with financial contracts payoffs linked to non-tradable assets, namely, weather indices. Finally, we study related weather derivatives data and the dynamics of the implied SPDs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One particular stream of research is the application of the approach to outcome measurement. To date, there have been a dozen attempts (some combined) to operationalise the approach, and produce an outcome measure that offers a broader evaluative space than health-related quality-of-life measures. Applications have so far been confined to public health, physical, mental health and social care interventions, but the capability approach could be of benefit to evaluations of pharmacotherapies and other technologies. This paper provides an introduction to the capability approach, reviews the measures that are available for use in an economic evaluation, including their current applications, and then concludes with a discussion of a number of issues that require further consideration before the approach is adopted more widely to inform resource allocation decisions.","Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Lorgelly, PK (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",paula.lorgelly@monash.edu,"Lorgelly, Paula K/B-5400-2012","Lorgelly, Paula/0000-0002-8990-9514",,,,,62,18,25,0,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2015,33.0,8,,,,,849,855,,10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CN8FP,25862464.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358675200005,0

However, empirical evidence is ambiguous. Some studies find that inflation persistence varied over time, others conclude it was constant. This article contributes further evidence to this ongoing debate by modeling U.S. inflation dynamics using a sticky infinite hidden Markov model (sticky IHMM). The sticky IHMM is a Bayesian nonparametric approach to modeling structural breaks. It allows for an unknown number of breakpoints and is a flexible and attractive alternative to existing methods. We found that inflation persistence was highest in 1973-74 and then again around 1980. However, credible intervals for our estimates of inflation persistence were very wide.

To estimate both parametric and nonparametric coefficients, a three-stage estimation method is proposed. A nonparametric generalized method of moments (GMM) is adopted to estimate all coefficients firstly and an average method is used to obtain the root-N consistent estimator of parametric coefficients. At the last stage, the estimator of varying coefficients is obtained by the partial residuals. The consistency and asymptotic normality of both estimators are derived. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical results and to demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform well in a finite sample.","[Cai, Zongwu] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Cai, Zongwu; Fang, Ying] Xiamen Univ, MOE, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zongwu; Fang, Ying] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Linna] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Kansas; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Fudan University,"Fang, Y (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, MOE, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",yifst1@gmail.com,"wei, li/JWP-9848-2024; long, chen/JVM-8568-2024",,"National Nature Science Foundation of China [71131008, 70971113, 71271179]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2010221092]",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported, in part, by the National Nature Science Foundation of China grants #71131008 (Key Project), #70971113, and #71271179, as well as the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities grant #2010221092.",,46,12,13,0,70,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The two methods that we use are the Standard method of Maximum Entropy (SME) and the method of Maximum Entropy in the Mean (MEM). We analyze the performance and robustness of these two procedures in several numerical examples, in which the frequency of losses is Poisson and the individual losses are lognormal random variables. We shall verify that the reconstructions obtained pass a variety of statistical quality criteria, and provide good estimations of VaR and TVaR, which are important measures for risk management purposes. As side product of the work, we obtain a rather accurate numerical description of the density of such compound random variable. These approaches are also used to develop a procedure to determine the distribution of the individual losses from the knowledge of the total loss. Thus, if the only information available is the total loss, and the nature of the frequency of losses is known, the method of maximum entropy provides an efficient method to determine the individual losses as well.

Our analysis is performed in the class of normal variance mixture (NVM) models, which encompasses many distributions commonly used in financial modeling. For the special cases of jointly normally and t-distributed asset returns we derive closed formulas for the correlation under stress. For the NVM distribution, we calculate the asymptotic limit of the correlation under stress, which depends on whether the variables are in the maximum domain of attraction of the Frechet or Gumbel distribution. It turns out that correlations in heavy-tailed NVM models are less sensitive to stress than in medium- or light-tailed models. Our analysis sheds light on the suitability of this model class to serve as a quantitative framework for stress testing, and as such provides valuable information for risk and capital management in financial institutions, where NVM models are frequently used for assessing capital adequacy. We also demonstrate how our results can be applied for more prudent stress testing.","[Kalkbrener, Michael] Deutsch Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany; [Packham, Natalie] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Packham, N (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Dept Finance, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",n.packham@fs.de,,"Packham, Natalie/0000-0002-8065-747X",,,,,46,7,8,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We propose a copula-based model that is both hierarchical and hybrid (HYC for short), because: (i) the dependence structure is modeled as a hierarchical copula, (ii) it unifies the idea of the clusterized homogeneous copula-based approach (CHC for short) and its limiting version (LHC for short) proposed in Bernardi and Romagnoli (2012, 2013). Based on this, we compute the loss function of a world-wide sovereign debt portfolio which accounts for a systemic dependence of all countries, in line with a global valuation of financial risks. Our approach enables us to take into account the non-exchangeable behavior of a sovereign debts' portfolio clustered into several classes with homogeneous risk and to recover a possible risks' hierarchy. A comparison between the HYC loss surface and those computed through a pure limiting approach, which is commonly used in high dimensional problems, is presented and the impact of the concentration and the granularity errors is appreciated. Finally the impact of an enlargement of the dependence structure is discussed, in the contest of a geographical area sub-portfolios analysis now relevant to determine the risk contributions of subgroups under the presence of a wider dependence structure. This argument is presented in relation to the evaluation of the insurance premium and the collateral related to the designed project of an euro-insurance-bond. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this approach, earnings and costs are driven by double exponential jump diffusion processes and bankruptcy is declared when the income falls below a default threshold, which is proportional to the charges. A change of numeraire, under the Esscher risk neutral measure, is used to reduce the dimension. A closed form expression for the value of equity is obtained in terms of the expected present value operators, with and without disinvestment delay. In both cases, we determine the default threshold that maximizes the shareholder's equity. Subsequently, the probabilities of default are obtained by inverting the Laplace transform of the bankruptcy time. In numerical applications of the proposed model, we apply a procedure for calibration based on market and accounting data to explain the behaviour of shares for two real-world examples of insurance companies.

We extend He and Liang model (2013a,b) to describe dynamics of individual fund scale during distribution period. The fund scale is affected by investment return, benefit outgo and mortality credit. The management of the pension plan controls the asset allocation and benefit outgo policies to achieve the objective of pension members. The goal of the management is to minimize accumulated deviations between the actual benefit outgo and a pre-set target during the whole distribution period. The performance function (criterion) is the weighted average of the square and linear deviations to express more penalty on negative deviation than positive deviation. Using HJB (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman) equations and variational inequality methods, the closed-forms of the optimal policies are derived. The counterintuitive effect of the optimal proportion allocated in the risky asset with respect to the fund scale is also derived, and the optimal benefit outgo has the form of the spread method. Moreover, we use Monte Carlo Methods (MCM) to analyze economic behaviors of the optimal asset allocation and benefit outgo policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, reimbursing orphan drugs on an exceptional basis is increasingly difficult to sustain from a health system perspective. An understanding of the value that societies attach to providing orphan drugs at the expense of other health technologies is now recognised as an important input to policy debates. Objective The aim of this work was to scope the social value arguments that have been advanced relating to the reimbursement of orphan drugs, and to locate these within a coherent decision-making framework to aid reimbursement decisions in the presence of limited healthcare resources. Methods A scoping review of the peer reviewed and grey literature was undertaken, consisting of seven phases: (1) identifying the research question; (2) searching for relevant studies; (3) selecting studies; (4) charting, extracting and tabulating data; (5) analyzing data; (6) consulting relevant experts; and (7) presenting results. The points within decision processes where the identified value arguments would be incorporated were then located. This mapping was used to construct a framework characterising the distinct role of each value in informing decision making. Results The scoping review identified 19 candidate decision factors, most of which can be characterised as either value-bearing or 'opportunity cost'-determining, and also a number of value propositions and pertinent sources of preference information. We were able to synthesize these into a coherent decision-making framework. Conclusion Our framework may be used to structure policy discussions and to aid transparency about the values underlying reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs. These values ought to be consistently applied to all technologies and populations affected by the decision.","[Paulden, Mike; McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada; [Stafinski, Tania; Menon, Devidas] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Paulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, 736 Univ Terrace,8303 112 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada.",paulden@ualberta.ca,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016; McCabe, Christopher J/E-2051-2016","Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980",CIHR; Genome Canada-CIHR; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0707-10101] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0707-10101] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Genome Canada-CIHR; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This work was supported by an Emerging Team grant from the CIHR for 'Developing Effective Policies for Managing Technologies for Rare Diseases', and from a grant provided through the Genome Canada-CIHR 2012 Large-Scale Applied Research Project Competition in Genomics and Personalized Health for 'PACE-'Omics: Personalized, Accessible, Cost-effective applications of ' Omics technologies'.

Variants of our MMM that are shown to fit past data and to perform well in forecasting experiments are employed to evaluate the effects of alternative tax policies. Using quarterly data, our one-sector MMM has been able to predict the 2008 downturn and the 2009Q3 upturn of the U.S. economy. Among other results, this study, using transfer and impulse response functions associated with our MMM, finds that permanent 5 percentage points cut in the personal income and corporate profits tax rates will cause the U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to rise by 3.0 percentage points with a standard error of 0.6 percentage points. Also, while this policy change leads to positive growth of the government sector, its share of total real GDP is slightly reduced. This is understandable since short run effects of tax cuts include the transfer of tax revenue from the government to the private sector. The private sector is allowed to manage a larger portion of its revenue, while government is forced to cut public spending on social programs with little growth enhancing effects. This broadens private economic activities overall. Further, these tax rate policy changes stimulate the growth of the federal tax base considerably, which helps to reduce annual budget deficits and the federal debt.","[Zellner, Arnold] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ngoie, Jacques Kibambe] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ngoie, Jacques Kibambe] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Pretoria,"Ngoie, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",t-9ngoie@uchicago.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Economic Research for Southern Africa,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Economic Research for Southern Africa,"This research was financed by the National Science Foundation and Economic Research for Southern Africa.

At the core of these strategies is an evaluation of the past performance of the underlying securities to set up a target portfolio. In this work, we show by experiment that the performance evaluation for individual securities used in these schemes is based on trends in price data. This is derived using a wavelet trend decomposition scheme for the security evaluation in comparison to the classical approach. We further verify that neither random walks nor fractional Brownian motions model that effect, which leads to the assumption that trends in real-world data have a different characteristic. By analysing the market index with respect to trend size, trend drift and trend volatility we show that these characteristics exhibit scaling laws. Specifically, the trend size seen in real-world data is significantly longer than that of random process models. We show by experiment that the associated 'momentum exponent' describing the scaling law for trend sizes is an indicator for the momentum effect. Additionally, we verify that momentum strategies exploit these long trends by analysing the longest held positions. We conclude by analysing this 'momentum exponent' for world indices and show that only a fraction of markets has exponents similar to previously used random processes. This means that trends are more prevalent in the real world than in theory. Consequently, markets cannot be efficient and trends as exploited by momentum strategies are an important contribution to investment success.",,,,wilhelm.berghorn@gmail.com,,,,,,,61,7,7,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The insurer and reinsurer degrees of uncertainty do not have to be identical. The decision variable is not the retained (or ceded) risk, but its sensitivity with respect to the total claims. Thus, if one imposes strictly positive lower bounds for this variable, the reinsurer moral hazard is totally eliminated. Three main contributions seem to be reached. Firstly, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are given in a very general setting. Secondly, the optimal contract is often a bang-bang solution, i.e., the sensitivity between the retained risk and the total claims saturates the imposed constraints. Thirdly, the optimal reinsurance problem is equivalent to other linear programming problem, despite the fact that risk, uncertainty, and many premium principles are not linear. This may be important because linear problems may be easily solved in practice, since there are very efficient algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An incorrect model assumption can cause model misspecification which leads to reduced profits at best and dangerous, unanticipated risk exposure at worst. Even mixture models may not be sufficiently flexible to properly fit the data. Using a Bayesian nonparametric model instead can dramatically improve claim predictions and consequently risk management decisions in group health practices. The improvement is significant in both simulated and real data from a major health insurer's medium-sized groups. The nonparametric method outperforms a similar Bayesian parametric model, especially when predicting future claims for new business (entire groups not in the previous year's data). In our analysis, the nonparametric model outperforms the parametric model in predicting costs of both renewal and new business.

Domkhar valley has a total population of 1,269 people and 193 households and is divided into three villages based on their locations: Domkhar Do (lower village, 3,000 to 3,100 meters altitude), Domkhar Barma (middle village, 3,400 to 3,500 meters altitude), and Domkhar Gonma (upper village, 3,600 to 4,000 meters altitude). There is a hamlet called Kuramric at the highest point of the upper village at 4,100 meters. The villagers release their livestock in the pastures in the U-shaped valley located above Kuramric. Barley is the main crop cultivated in all three villages. Wheat can be cultivated in the lower and middle villages, but not in the upper village. We created a list of households in the three villages in Domkhar valley before conducting interviews. We then created a map showing irrigation canals, the land ownership and usage of each household from the GeoEye-1 satellite images taken in September and November 2010. We elucidated the change in land use and water management based on this map of irrigation canals, land ownership and usage along with the interviews and on-site observations. For more than 30 years, Ladakhi people has been receiving government rations of cheap flour, rice, sugar, and petroleum in Ladakh where the Sino-Indian Border Conflict and the Indo-Pakistani War were fought.

The paper shows that the OLS estimators are still elementwise consistent for the true autoregressive coefficients when neglecting a break in mean, but the sum of the estimators converges to unity. Thanks to this unit-root like behavior of the fitted model, the resulting conditional forecasts are consistent for the true values. As long as the dynamic structure is invariant, the robustness property of the forecasts holds a) under data-dependent lag length selection, b) for a piecewise smoothly varying mean function, and c) under general autoregressive dynamics of possibly infinite order including stationary long memory. Under breaks in the dynamic structure, however, estimators are asymptotically biased, and the forecasts from long autoregressions are biased themselves even in the limit.","[Demetrescu, Matei] Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Hassler, Uwe] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Kiel; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Demetrescu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Econometr, Olshausenstr 40-60, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",mdeme@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Demetrescu, Matei/ABD-6488-2021","Demetrescu, Matei/0000-0003-0815-5384","German Research Foundation (DFG) [DE 1617/2-1, HA 3306/5-1]; VolkswagenStiftung (Opus Magnum)",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); VolkswagenStiftung (Opus Magnum),Financial support of the German Research Foundation (DFG) through the grants DE 1617/2-1 and HA 3306/5-1 is gratefully acknowledged.

The paper has both empirical and theoretical contributions: we conduct an empirical analysis of the crude oil price dynamics and develop an accurate pricing set-up for arithmetic Asian options with discrete and continuous monitoring featuring stochastic volatility and discontinuous underlying asset price movements. Our theoretical contribution is applicable to various commodities exhibiting similar stylized properties. We here estimate the stochastic volatility model with price jumps as well as the nested model with omitted jumps to NYMEX WTI futures vanilla options. We find that price jumps and stochastic volatility are necessary to fit options. Despite the averaging effect, we show that Asian options remain sensitive to jump risk and that ignoring the discontinuities can lead to substantial mispricings.","[Kyriakou, Ioannis; Pouliasis, Panos K.; Papapostolou, Nikos C.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Kyriakou, I (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",ioannis.kyriakou@city.ac.uk,"Pouliasis, Panos/AAE-1093-2020; Kyriakou, Ioannis/J-6079-2019","Pouliasis, Panos/0000-0002-7389-3722; Kyriakou, Ioannis/0000-0001-9592-596X",,,,,62,15,15,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In establishing such convergence, the literature commonly uses martingale and semimartingale structures. While these structures have wide relevance, many applications involve a cointegration framework where endogeneity and nonlinearity play major roles and complicate the limit theory. This paper explores weak convergence limit theory to stochastic integral functionals in such settings. We use a novel decomposition of sample covariances of functions of I (1) and I (0) time series that simplifies the asymptotics and our limit results for such covariances hold for linear process, long memory, and mixing variates in the innovations. These results extend earlier findings in the literature, are relevant in many applications, and involve simple conditions that facilitate practical implementation. A nonlinear extension of FM regression is used to illustrate practical application of the methods.","[Liang, Hanying] Tongji Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Phillips, Peter C.

The stationary errors are allowed to be serially correlated and the regressors are allowed to be endogenous. The paper extends the fully modified estimator of Phillips and Hansen (1990) from cointegrating regressions to cointegrating polynomial regressions. The FM-OLS estimator has a zero-mean Gaussian mixture limiting distribution that allows for standard asymptotic inference. Wald and LM specification tests as well as a KPSS-type test for cointegration are derived. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a simulation study which shows that this FM-OLS estimator, as well as tests based upon it, perform well in the sense that the performance advantages over OLS are largely similar to the performance advantages of FM-OLS over OLS in standard cointegrating regressions.","[Wagner, Martin] Tech Univ Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany; [Wagner, Martin] Inst Adv Studies, Vienna, Austria; [Wagner, Martin] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Hong, Seung Hyun] Korea Inst Publ Finance, Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si, South Korea",Dortmund University of Technology,"Wagner, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dortmund, Fac Stat, Vogelpothsweg 87, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",mwagner@statistik.tu-dortmund.de,,"Wagner, Martin/0000-0002-6123-4797",Oesterreichische Nationalbank [13398]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [823],Oesterreichische Nationalbank; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors thank Peter Grabarczyk and Oliver Stypka for excellent research assistance.

Depending on the surplus process that is considered and whether dividend payouts are bounded or not, optimal strategies are generally of a band, barrier or threshold type. In reality, while surpluses change continuously, dividends are generally paid on a periodic basis. Because of this, the actuarial literature has recently considered strategies where dividends are only allowed to be distributed at (random) discrete times - according to a periodic strategy. In this paper, we focus on the Brownian risk model. In this context, the optimal continuous and periodic strategies have previously been shown (independently of one another) to be of barrier type. For the first time, we consider a model where both strategies are used. In such a hybrid strategy, decisions are allowed to be made either at any time (continuously), or periodically at a lower cost. This proves optimal in some cases. We also determine under which combination of parameters a pure continuous, pure periodic or hybrid (including both continuous and periodic dividend payments) barrier strategy is optimal. Interestingly, the hybrid strategy lies in-between periodic and continuous strategies, which provides some interesting insights. Results are illustrated.","[Avanzi, Benjamin; Tu, Vincent; Wong, Bernard] UNSW Sydney, UNSW Australia Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Avanzi, Benjamin] Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",University of New South Wales Sydney; Universite de Montreal,"Tu, V (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, UNSW Australia Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",b.avanzi@unsw.edu.au; v.tu@unsw.edu.au; bernard.wong@unsw.edu.au,"Avanzi, Benjamin/C-3888-2008","Avanzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-5424-4292","Australian School of Business Special Research Grant; Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme [LP130100723]; Australian Postgraduate Award; Australian Business School, UNSW","Australian School of Business Special Research Grant; Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme(Australian Research Council); Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government); Australian Business School, UNSW","The authors are grateful to the referees for useful comments that improved the presentation of the paper.

Our approach is based on finite mixture models of univariate distributions where all K components of the mixture are assumed to be from the same parametric family. Six models are developed with components from parametric, non-Gaussian families of distributions previously used in actuarial modeling: Burr, Gamma, Inverse Burr, Inverse Gaussian, Log-normal, and Weibull. Some of these component distributions are already alone suitable to model data with heavy tails, but do not cover the case of multimodality. Estimation of the models with a fixed number of components K is proposed based on the EM algorithm using three different initialization strategies: distance-based, k-means, and random initialization. Model selection is possible using information criteria, and the fitted models can be used to estimate risk measures for the data, such as VaR and TVaR. The results of the mixture models are compared to the composite Weibull models considered in recent literature as the best models for modeling Danish Fire insurance losses. The results of this paper provide new valuable tools in the area of insurance loss modeling and risk evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

If the state space is unbounded, full information revelation is possible for an arbitrarily large bias.

Individuals are assumed to abide by Savage's model of Subjective Expected Utility, in which everyone has his/her own utility and subjective probability. Disagreement on probabilities among individuals gives rise to uncertainty at the societal level, and thus society may entertain a set of probabilities rather than only one. We assume that social preference admits a Maxmin Expected Utility representation. In this context, two Pareto-type conditions are shown to be equivalent to social utility being a weighted average of individual utilities and the social set of priors containing only weighted averages of individual priors. Thus, society respects consensus among individuals' beliefs and does not add ambiguity beyond disagreement on beliefs.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the ERG review of the manufacturer's evidence submission, and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's final guidance (TA340) issued in June 2015. The manufacturer presented evidence on ustekinumab for two patient populations: (1) a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha)-inhibitor-na < ve population who had not previously received any TNF alpha inhibitors (biologics); and (2) a TNF alpha-inhibitor-exposed population who had previously received at least one TNF alpha inhibitor. The clinical evidence for ustekinumab was derived from two randomised controlled trials (PSUMMIT 1 and 2), in which a total of 927 patients who had not responded to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapies received ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg, or placebo. These data suggested that ustekinumab is more effective than placebo over 16-24 weeks in terms of both joint and skin response. In the absence of head-to-head comparisons between different biologics (ustekinumab, golimumab, etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab), the manufacturer conducted a network meta-analysis to estimate the relative efficacy of treatments for the TNF alpha-inhibitor-na < ve population. Results of this analysis were marked as academic in confidence and are therefore not reported. For the TNF alpha-inhibitor-exposed population, the clinical analysis was limited to ustekinumab versus conventional management only, and was based on a subgroup of 180 patients from the PSUMMIT 2 trial. The ERG raised concerns relating to the lack of data on the long-term efficacy of ustekinumab, the limited data available for the exposed population, and the lack of consideration of the sequential use of treatments. Based on the manufacturer's original model, the ERG found ustekinumab to be dominated by golimumab in the anti-TNF-inhibitor-na < ve population, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 29,843 pound/quality-adjusted life-years versus conventional management in the exposed population. The ERG's analyses highlighted the fact that there is significant uncertainty around the model results. In addition, the ERG's exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis, which incorporated the sequential use of TNF alpha inhibitors, suggested that ustekinumab would not be cost effective if it were used as second-line treatment. The initial NICE recommendations asserted that ustekinumab was not recommended for treating active PsA. However, the manufacturer submitted a post-consultation model that included a Patient Access Scheme (PAS), halving the unit cost of ustekinumab 90 mg to A 2147 pound (the same as a 45 mg dose). The NICE final recommendations were that, dependent on the inclusion of the PAS, ustekinumab is recommended as an option, along or in combination with methotrexate, for treating active PsA in adults only when treatment with TNF alpha inhibitors is contraindicated but would otherwise be considered, or the person has previously had treatment with one or more TNF alpha inhibitors, which has failed.","[O'Connor, Joanne; Rice, Stephen; Smith, Alison; Rodgers, Mark; Lopez, Rocio Rodriguez; Craig, Dawn; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"O'Connor, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",joanne.oconnor@newcastle.ac.uk,,"Rodriguez Lopez, Rocio/0000-0003-2460-8128; Smith, Alison/0000-0001-7709-1869",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [10/51/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 10/51/01) and has been published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment (see the HTA programme website for further project information [http://www.hta.ac.uk]).

Generalizing earlier results of Wang and Phillips (2009a, b, Econometric Theory 25, 710-738, Econometrica 77, 1901-1948), the conventional nonparametric local level kernel estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically (mixed) normal in these cases, thereby opening up inference by conventional nonparametric methods to a wide class of potentially nonlinear cointegrated relations. New results on the consistency of parametric estimates in nonlinear cointegrating regressions are provided, extending earlier research on parametric nonlinear regression and providing primitive conditions for parametric model testing. A model specification test is studied and confirmed to provide a valid mechanism for testing parametric specifications that is robust to endogeneity. But under long memory innovations the test is not pivotal, its convergence rate is parameter dependent, and its limit theory involves the local time of fractional Brownian motion. Simulation results show good performance for the nonparametric kernel estimates in cases of strong endogeneity and long memory, whereas the specification test is shown to be sensitive to the presence of long memory innovations, as predicted by asymptotic theory.","[Wang, Qiying] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Phillips, Peter C.

We develop semi-analytical solutions to fair charges of variable annuity guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit from both a policyholder's perspective and an insurer's perspective. The pricing framework from the policyholder's perspective was known previously in the literature only by numerical methods, whereas the insurer's pricing method was used in the industry but only with MonteCarlo simulations. While comparing their similarities and differences, we prove under the assumption of no friction cost the two pricing approaches are equivalent. In the presence of friction cost, the semi-analytic solutions in this paper lead to a fast and accurate algorithm for determining rider charges and other management fees.","[Feng, Runhuan] Univ Illinois, Dept Math, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Volkmer, Hans W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Feng, RH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Math, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",rfeng@illinois.edu; volkmer@uwm.edu,,"Feng, Runhuan/0000-0002-9957-1019",,,,,24,9,10,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Electronic data in EHRs is generated by people engaged in complex processes within complex environments, and their human input, albeit shaped by computer systems, is compromised by many human factors. These data are potentially valuable to health economists and outcomes researchers but are sufficiently large and complex enough to be considered part of the new frontier of 'big data'. This paper describes emerging methods that draw together data mining, process modelling, activity-based costing and dynamic simulation models. Our research infrastructure includes safe links to Leeds hospital's EHRs with 3 million secondary and tertiary care patients. We created a multidisciplinary team of health economists, clinical specialists, and data and computer scientists, and developed a dynamic simulation tool called NETIMIS (Network Tools for Intervention Modelling with Intelligent Simulation; http://www.netimis.com) suitable for visualization of both human-designed and data-mined processes which can then be used for 'what-if' analysis by stakeholders interested in costing, designing and evaluating healthcare interventions. We present two examples of model development to illustrate how dynamic simulation can be informed by big data from an EHR. We found the tool provided a focal point for multidisciplinary team work to help them iteratively and collaboratively 'deep dive' into big data.","[Johnson, Owen A.] Univ Leeds, Sch Comp, Leeds MRC Bioinformat Res Ctr, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Johnson, Owen A.] X Lab Ltd, Hanover Walk, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hall, Peter S.; Hulme, Claire] Univ Leeds, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Johnson, OA (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Comp, Leeds MRC Bioinformat Res Ctr, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Johnson, OA (通讯作者)，X Lab Ltd, Hanover Walk, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",o.a.johnson@leeds.ac.uk,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Hall, Peter S/O-3131-2019; Hulme, Charles/B-4115-2013","Hall, Peter S/0000-0001-6015-7841; Johnson, Owen Ashby/0000-0003-3998-541X; Hulme, Claire/0000-0003-2077-0419",UK Medical Research Council [MR/L01629X/1]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Diagnostic Evidence Co-operative Leeds; MRC [MR/L01629X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/L01629X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [CL-2012-02-501] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Diagnostic Evidence Co-operative Leeds(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Owen Johnson is a co-investigator in the Leeds MRC Medical Bioinformatics Research Centre (Principal Investigator: Professor Sir Alex Markham), which is funded by the UK Medical Research Council (Grant No. MR/L01629X/1).

The accounting trigger occurs when the capital ratio of the issuing bank falls below some contractual threshold. Under the regulatory trigger, sometimes called the point-of-non-viability (PONV) trigger, the regulatory authority may enforce equity conversion when the financial health of the bank deteriorates to certain distressed level. In this paper, we propose an equity-credit modelling of the joint process of the stock price and the capital ratio that integrates both a structural approach for the accounting trigger and a reduced-form approach for the PONV trigger of equity conversion. We also construct effective Fortet algorithms and finite difference schemes for numerical pricing of CoCo bonds under various forms of equity conversion pay-off.

But no loss can actually destroy more than the entire value of a bank or of a company, and this upper bound should be considered when dealing with tail-risk assessment. Introducing what we call the dual distribution, we show how to deal with heavy-tailed phenomena with a remote yet finite upper bound. We provide methods to compute relevant tail quantities such as the Expected Shortfall, which is not available under infinite-mean models, allowing adequate provisioning and capital allocation. This also permits a measurement of fragility. The main difference between our approach and a simple truncation is in the smoothness of the transformation between the original and the dual distribution. Our methodology is useful with apparently infinite-mean phenomena, as in the case of operational risk, but it can be applied in all those situations involving extreme fat tails and bounded support.","[Cirillo, Pasquale] Delft Univ Technol, EEMCS Fac, Appl Probabil Grp, Delft, NL, Netherlands; [Taleb, Nassim Nicholas] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, New York, NY USA",Delft University of Technology; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Cirillo, P (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, EEMCS Fac, Appl Probabil Grp, Delft, NL, Netherlands.",P.Cirillo@tudelft.nl,"Cirillo, Pasquale/C-1691-2009",,FP7 Marie Curie Action grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-618794],FP7 Marie Curie Action grant,Pasquale Cirillo acknowledges the support of the FP7 Marie Curie Action [grant number PCIG13-GA-2013-618794].,,36,16,16,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Therefore, the relative ranking of a portfolio can be evaluated without peer group information. We derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the Sharpe ratio of a uniformly distributed random portfolio, and conduct comparative analysis with US equity mutual funds.

The advantage in using a single-factor model is that it does not treat currency risks as carrying different weight from investment risks; regardless of its source, risk is measured as variance, and weighted accordingly. The aim of this paper is primarily to give actuaries a way ahead in the use of the single-factor CAPM in a multi-currency world for the purposes of the stochastic modelling of the assets and liabilities of long-term financial institutions, such as pension funds, particularly for the purposes of liability driven investments and market-consistent valuation, and the application of the model has been designed with that intention. However, it is envisaged that the model will also be of interest to other practitioners. The paper's major original contribution to the literature is its proof that, for a single-factor CAPM to work in a multi-currency world, there is a necessary condition. The theory is applied to two major currencies and two minor currencies, namely the US dollar, the UK pound, the South African rand and the Turkish lira.","[Thomson, Robert; Reddy, Taryn] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sahin, Sule] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Actuarial Sci, Ankara, Turkey",University of Witwatersrand; Hacettepe University,"Thomson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Stat & Actuarial Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",rthomson@icon.co.za; sule@hacettepe.edu.tr; taryn.reddy@wits.ac.za,,"Sahin, Sule/0000-0003-4080-9165",Actuarial Society of South Africa,Actuarial Society of South Africa,The financial assistance of the Actuarial Society of South Africa is acknowledged.

Commonly used copulas are Gaussian, t and Gumbel copulas. To further generalize these copulas, a new class of copulas, referred to as geometric copulas, is introduced by adding geometric distribution into the existing copulas. The interior-point penalty function algorithm is proposed to obtain maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of geometric copulas.

Many methods have been proposed to predict bankruptcies and detect financial crises, including conventional approaches and techniques involving artificial intelligence (AI). Financial distress information influences investor decisions, and investors depend on analysts' opinions and subjective judgements in assessing such information, which sometimes results in investors making mistakes. In the light of the foregoing, this paper proposes a novel quarterly time series classifier, which reduces the sheer volume of high-dimensional data to be analysed and provides decision-makers with rules that can be used as a reference in assessing the financial situation of a company. This study employs the following six attribute selection methods to reduce the high-dimensional data: (1) the chi-square test, (2) information gain, (3) discriminant analysis, (4) logistic regression (LR) analysis, (5) support vector machine (SVM) and (6) the proposed Join method. After selecting attributes, this study utilises the rough set classifier to generate the rules of financial distress. To verify the proposed method, an empirically collected financial distress data-set is employed as the experimental sample and is compared with the decision tree, multilayer perceptron and SVM under Type I error, Type II error and accuracy criteria. Because financial distress data are quarterly time series data, this study conducts non-time series and time series (moving windows) experiments. The experimental results indicate that the LR and chi-square attribute selection combined with the rough set classifier outperform the listing methods under Type I, Type II error and accuracy criteria.","[Cheng, Ching-Hsue; Wang, Ssu-Hsiang] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Management, Touliou 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Cheng, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Management, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliou 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan.",chcheng@yuntech.edu.tw,"Cheng, Ching-Hsue/D-1785-2012","Cheng, Ching-Hsue/0000-0002-5509-6965",,,,,54,5,6,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This approach of cumulating requirements bears the risk of individual measures negating or even conflicting with each other which might lessen their desired effects on financial stability. We provide an analysis of the impact of Basel III's main components on financial stability in a stock-flow consistent agent-based computational economic model. We find that the positive joint impact of the microprudential instruments is considerably larger than the sum of the individual contributions to stability, i.e. the standalone impacts are non-additive. However, except for the buffers, the macroprudential overlay's impact is either marginal or even destabilizing. Despite its simplicity, the leverage ratio performs poorly, especially when associated drawbacks are explicitly taken into account. Surcharges on SIBs seem to rather contribute to financial regulations complexity than to the resilience of the system.","[Krug, Sebastian; Lengnick, Matthias; Wohltmann, Hans-Werner] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Krug, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.",s.krug@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,44,28,30,2,88,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

For a given portfolio, time horizon, and probability alpha, the 100 alpha% VaR is defined as a threshold loss value, such that the probability that the loss on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value is alpha. That is to say, it is a quantile of the distribution of the losses, which has both good analytic properties and easy interpretation as a risk measure. However, its extension to the multivariate framework is not unique because a unique definition of multivariate quantile does not exist. In the current literature, the multivariate quantiles are related to a specific partial order considered in R-n, or to a property of the univariate quantile that is desirable to be extended to R-n. In this work, we introduce a multivariate value at risk as a vector-valued directional risk measure, based on a directional multivariate quantile, which has recently been introduced in the literature. The directional approach allows the manager to consider external information or risk preferences in her/his analysis. We derive some properties of the risk measure and we compare the univariate VaR over the marginals with the components of the directional multivariate VaR. We also analyze the relationship between some families of copulas, for which it is possible to obtain closed forms of the multivariate VaR that we propose. Finally, comparisons with other alternative multivariate VaR given in the literature, are provided in terms of robustness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to the principal-agent literature, we argue that optimal contracting in an infinite economy is not about a tradeoff between risk sharing and incentives, but it is all about incentives. Even when the economy is finite, optimal contracts do not depend on principals' risk aversion, but on market prices of risks. We also show that optimal contracting does not require relative performance evaluation, that the second best risk-free interest rate is lower than that of the first best, and that the second-best equity premium can be higher or lower than that of the first best. Moral hazard can contribute to the resolution of the risk-free rate puzzle.

Rather than modeling the age pattern of jump effects explicitly, most of the existing models assume that the distributions of jump effects and general mortality improvements across ages are identical. Nevertheless, this assumption does not seem to be in line with what we observe from historical data. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a Lee Carter variant that captures the age pattern of mortality jumps by a distinct collection of parameters. The model variant is then further generalized to permit the age pattern of jump effects to vary randomly. We illustrate the two proposed models with mortality data from the United States and English and Welsh populations, and use them to value hypothetical mortality bonds with similar specifications to the Atlas IX Capital Class B note that was launched in 2013. It is found that the features we consider have a significant impact on the estimated prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I use a data set of monthly metered billing data for 60,000 households for 2002-2009 from a particularly disadvantaged suburb of Pretoria, with rich price variation across 20 different nonlinear tariff schedules. I find that the free allowance acts as a lump-sum subsidy, without large effects on water consumption. However, it is possible to reallocate the current subsidy to form an optimal tariff without a free allowance, which would increase welfare while leaving the water provider's profit unchanged. This optimal tariff would also reduce the number of households consuming low quantities of water, a desirable policy goal according to the WHO.","Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Szabó, A (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Dept Econ, 3623 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",aszabo2@uh.edu,,,,,,,44,11,15,3,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2015,83.0,5,,,,,1913,1961,,10.3982/ECTA11917,0.0,,,49,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CT3VB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362733900009,0

When the tail index alpha of G-GARCH is within (0,2), it is shown that the LSE is not a consistent estimator of the parameters, but converges to a ratio of stable vectors. When alpha is an element of[2, 4], it is shown that the LSE is n1-2(/alpha)-consistent if alpha is an element of(2,4), log n-consistent if alpha = 2, and n(1/2) /logn-consistent if alpha = 4, and its limiting distribution is a functional of stable processes.

Its primary objective is to estimate gains by age from being married today (till death of at least one spouse) relative to remaining single for that same time period. An empirical methodology that relies on the model's equilibrium outcomes identifies the marriage gains using a single cross-section of observed aggregate matches. This behavioral dynamic model rationalizes a new marriage matching function. The model also solves the inverse problem of computing the vector of aggregate marriages, given a new distribution of available single individuals and estimated preferences. Finally, this paper develops a simple test of the model's empirical validity. Using aggregate data of new marriages and available single men and women in the United States over two decades from 1970 to 1990, I investigate the changes in marriage gains over this period.","Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Choo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",echoo@ucalgary.ca,,,"Economics Department at N.U.S.; SSHRC [410-2010-2584, 410-2006-1254]",Economics Department at N.U.S.; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I would like to thank a co-editor, three anonymous referees, Liang (Charles) Chen, Kimberly Gilbert, Shashi Khatri, Kevin Laughren, Miguel Olivo-Villabrille, Rob Oxoby, Harry Paarsch, Joanne Roberts, Matt Shum, Scott Taylor, and Arezou Zaresani for their insightful comments.

Cost-effectiveness studies of anticoagulants for stroke prevention in AF rarely utilise AF-stroke-specific cost data in their analyses, as data are limited. Data that exist do not account for AF found on prolonged cardiac monitoring after stroke, further underestimating the clinical and economic burden of AF-stroke. Objective Our objective was to investigate differences in direct medical costs of acute stroke care among patients with and without AF. Methods Data were prospectively collected from 213 consecutive patients with confirmed stroke (196 ischaemic [IS], 17 intracranial haemorrhage [ICH]), admitted to a UK district general hospital between November 2011 and October 2012. Sociodemographic, clinical and cardiac monitoring characteristics were recorded, and resource use was calculated using a 'bottom-up' approach. Univariate and multivariate stepwise regressions were performed to identify predictors of direct cost. Results Among patients with IS, 73 had AF (37 %). These patients were older, experienced greater stroke severity, lengths of hospitalisation, inpatient mortality and discharge to institutionalised care than those without AF. Mean acute care costs for the year 2012 were A 6,978 pound (standard deviation [SD] 6,769, range 510-36,952). Mean (SD) costs were significantly higher for patients with AF than for those without (A 9,083 pound [7,381] vs. A 5,729 pound [6,071], p = < 0.001). AF independently predicted acute care cost along with history of heart failure and stroke severity. The adjusted independent effect of having AF on costs was an additional A 2,173 pound (95 % confidence interval 91-4,254; p = 0.041). Costs for patients with an ICH did not differ according to cardiac rhythm. Conclusion Direct medical costs of acute stroke care for patients with AF may be 50 % greater than for patients without. Economic studies should take this into account to ensure the benefits of anticoagulants are not underestimated.","[Ali, Ali N.] Sheffield Teaching Hosp, Stroke Unit, Royal Hallamshire Hosp, Sheffield S10 2JF, S Yorkshire, England; [Howe, Joanne; Abdel-Hafiz, Ahmed] Rotherham Gen Hosp, Rotherham S60 2UD, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ali, AN (通讯作者)，Sheffield Teaching Hosp, Stroke Unit, Royal Hallamshire Hosp, Glossop Rd, Sheffield S10 2JF, S Yorkshire, England.",ali-ali@doctors.org.uk,"Ali, Irfan/JVO-2044-2024; MUÑOZ, ROSA ANA/H-3964-2018","Ali, Irfan/0009-0009-2492-4789; Ali, Ali/0000-0001-6339-4076",,,,,32,18,19,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2015,33.0,5,,,,,511,520,,10.1007/s40273-015-0263-1,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CG5OI,25693879.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353341100007,0

These limitations include linearity, homogeneity and stationarity. Agents in ABMs are autonomous entities, who interact with each other and with the environment. ABMs provide an inductive or 'bottom-up' approach, i.e. individual-level behaviours define system-level components. ABMs have a unique property to capture emergence phenomena that otherwise cannot be predicted by the combination of individual-level interactions. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic concepts and important features of ABMs. We present a case study of an application of a simple ABM to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening of an infectious disease.

Further, on every subset, an explicit Nash equilibrium strategy is derived by solving a pair of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Finally, for some special cases, we analyze the impact of time t and quadratic control parameter on the Nash equilibrium strategy and obtain some simple partition of [0, T].

We expand upon the existing literature by comparing two alternative resolution mechanisms: (i) liquidations triggered by either illiquidity or insolvency-related distress implying asset sales and compensation of creditors; and (ii) a bail-in mechanism avoiding bank closure by forcing a recapitalization provided by bank creditors. Our model speaks to how contagion dynamics unravel via illiquidity-driven defaults in the first case and higher-order losses in the latter one. Within this framework, we show how the liquidity risk externality can be resolved, and we put forward a macro-criterion to assess the adequacy of the liquidity ratio introduced with Basel III.","[Gaffeo, E.] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, I-38100 Trento, Italy; [Molinari, M.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, I-00161 Rome, Italy",University of Trento; Sapienza University Rome,"Molinari, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",massimo.molinari@uniroma1.it,"Gaffeo, Edoardo/C-8634-2011","Gaffeo, Edoardo/0000-0002-2236-2104; MOLINARI, MASSIMO/0000-0001-8635-5053",Fondazione Caritro,Fondazione Caritro(Fondazione Caritro),"The authors wish to thank the seminar participants at the 2013 EMAEE, 8th European Meeting on Applied Evolutionary Economics (Skema, Sophia-Antipolis, France), the 2013 INET International Conference on Interlinkages and Systemic Risk (Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy), the Workshop on Financial Networks, Bank Regulation, and the Role of Co-operative Banks (University of Trento, Dept. of Economics and Management, Italy).

The house purchase is financially attractive (due to high expected returns or tax deductions, for example), which provides an incentive to buy as soon as possible; however, its value is only partially correlated with financial markets and, therefore, its price risk cannot be perfectly hedged, which provides an incentive to delay purchase. Using martingale duality method, we fully characterize the optimal terminal wealth in the case of CARA utility, so that we can generate simple numerical solutions for different parameter values, and study the trade-off between the two conflicting incentives. We derive more explicit results when the price follows a Gaussian process. In particular, we identify conditions under which an optimal stopping time is deterministic.","[Cetin, Coskun] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Math & Stat, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Zapatero, Fernando] Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, FBE, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",California State University System; California State University Sacramento; University of Southern California,"Zapatero, F (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, FBE, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy,Bridge Hall 308, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",cetin@csus.edu; fzapatero@marshall.usc.edu,,"Cetin, Coskun/0000-0001-8457-8675",,,,,24,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The comparator was standard medical and supportive management that does not include alteplase. This paper provides a description of the company submission, the Evidence Review Group (ERG) review and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical effectiveness evidence for alteplase was derived from 5 trials. For the 3-4.5 h treatment window, alteplase did not show a statistically significant treatment effect on death or dependency at three months follow-up. For the 0-4.5 h treatment window data from a meta-analysis of 3 trials indicated that the reduction of death and dependency was statistically significant. In both cases there was a significant increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. The economic model described in the manufacturer's submission was considered by the ERG to meet the NICE reference case. The model structure was considered to be appropriate and the ERG has no major concerns regarding the selection of data used within the model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for all treatment windows were well below accepted willingness to pay thresholds. The ERG had no major concerns regarding the completeness of the submission or the robustness of the evidence presented. For all treatment windows considered, alteplase was found to be cost-effective compared with standard treatment.","[Holmes, Michael; Davis, Sarah; Simpson, Emma] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Holmes, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.w.holmes@shef.ac.uk,"Davis, Sarah E/A-2801-2010","Davis, Sarah/0000-0002-6609-4287",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [11/90/01STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 11/90/01STA).

Specifically, one approach is to fit a time series of mortality rates for some age to an AR(n)-GARCH(1, 1) model, and project the mortality rate for that age in the next nth year; the other is to fit an AR(1)GARCH(1, 1) model, and project the mortality rates recursively for the age in the next consecutive years. Further, we employ the copula method to capture the inter-age mortality dependence. Adopting mortality data of japan, the UK, and the USA, we demonstrate that it is indispensable to consider the conditional heteroskedasticity in our mortality models which provide better performances in out-of-sample projection and prediction intervals with a higher degree of coverage than the Lee Carter model. Finally, we numerically illustrate with mortality data of japan that VaR (Value at Risk) values for longevity risk, regarded as additional reserves for annuity or pension providers, will be overestimated if the conditional heteroskedasticity or/and the inter-age mortality dependence structure are ignored.

The farmers feel pressurized to move away from traditional methods of food production in order to improve their economic well-being by switching to mono-crops with high retail values. This has also led to social changes in the highland communities as some farmers are more successful than others for a variety of reasons. The primary purpose of this study is to research agricultural production systems which are both environmentally friendly and capable of providing the farmers and their families with food security and an improved standard of living. The study area in Pang Daeng Nai Royal Project Extensions collected a sample from 185 households. The input and output prices were an average taken from the three years and the data was analyzed by a multiple goal and multi-period programming model. This aimed to optimize resource management by considering four objective goals. These were to maximize income, ensure rice sufficiency for the household consumption, to minimize chemical costs and to minimize fertilizer costs. The analysis was subject to the constraints estimated from household consumption and income levels which were used for the household consumption model. The coefficients for the main crop were estimated from the production frontier function and this resulted in a 5 year planning framework. The primary results of this analysis indicate that it is possible to reach the optimization goals. For an average farm of 17.85 rai, the study suggests that the land should be allocated as follows: 27% for rice cultivation, 46% for field crop conservation farming (maize-legume relay-cropping), 11 % for perennial trees (mango), and 17 % for semi-perennial crops (passion fruit). This production system can generate of 92,600 -101,400 THB per year cash income per household. This will produce on average 1,261 kilograms of rice per year per household. By following this optimal land use, it could reduce the cost of chemicals and fertilizers by 6,600 -10,200 THB per household per year. If decisions on optimal land use are done in highland community, land would be allocated to mix perennial and semi-perennial fruit trees including without waste burning from production that the optimized production plan is environmentally sustainable.

In contrast, a bimatrix game may have no pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) even when every subgame has one. Nevertheless, Shapley's claim can be extended to bimatrix games as follows. We partition all bimatrix games into fifteen classes depending only on the preferences of two players. A subset is called a NE-theorem if a bimatrix game has a NE whenever it contains no subgame from t. We suggest a method to construct all minimal (that is, strongest) NE-theorems based on the procedure of joint generation of transversal hypergraphs given by a special oracle. By this method we obtain all (six) strongest NE-theorems. Let us remark that the suggested approach, which may be called math-pattern recognition, is very general: it allows to characterize completely an arbitrary target in terms of arbitrary attributes.","[Boros, Endre; Gurvich, Vladimir] Rutgers State Univ, MSIS Dept RBS & RUTCOR, 100 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Elbassioni, Khaled] Masdar Inst Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Makino, Kazuhisa] Kyoto Univ, RIMS, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Oudalov, Vladimir] Salient Management Co, 15 Roszel Rd,Suite 109, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Khalifa University of Science & Technology; Kyoto University,"Elbassioni, K (通讯作者)，Masdar Inst Sci & Technol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",endre.boros@rutgers.edu; kelbassioni@masdar.ac.ae; vladimir.gurvich@rutgers.edu; makino@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp; oudalov@gmail.com,"Gurvich, Vladimir/J-5763-2017; Boros, Endre/I-3066-2013","Elbassioni, Khaled/0000-0001-7021-5400; Boros, Endre/0000-0001-8206-3168","National Science Foundation [IIS-1161476]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24106002, 26280001] Funding Source: KAKEN","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We are thankful to Bernhard von Stengel and two anonymous referees for careful reading and many helpful remarks and suggestions.

This definition provides a framework for creating a connection between the infinite divisible distribution (in particular the ETS distribution) with fractional calculus. In addition, a definition for the ETS copula is discussed. A simulation study shows the accuracy of this definition, in comparison to the normal copula for measuring the dependency of data. An empirical study of stock market index returns for 20 countries shows the usefulness of the theoretical results.","[Fallahgoul, Hassan A.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kim, Young S.] SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Business, Deparment Finance, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Fabozzi, Frank J.] EDHEC Business Sch, Finance Grp, Nice, France",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Fabozzi, FJ (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, Finance Grp, Nice, France.",frank.fabozzi@edhec.com,,"Kim, Young Shin/0000-0002-3401-529X",Swiss National Science Foundation Sinergia grant 'Empirics of Financial Stability' [154445]; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO); BELSPO - Marie Curie Actions from European Commission,Swiss National Science Foundation Sinergia grant 'Empirics of Financial Stability'; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); BELSPO - Marie Curie Actions from European Commission,Hassan A.

The subordinator has a common and an idiosyncratic component, to reflect the properties of trade, which it represents. A calibration to a portfolio of 10 US stock indices returns over the period 2009-2013 shows that the hyperbolic specification has a very good fit to marginal distributions, to the overall correlation matrix and to the return distribution of both long-only and long-short random portfolios, which also incorporate non-linear dependence. Their tail behaviour is also well captured by the variance gamma specification. The main message is not only the goodness of fit, but also the flexibility in capturing dependence and the ease of calibration on large sets of returns.","[Luciano, Elisa] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Coll Carlo Alberto & Netspar, Turin, Italy; [Marena, Marina] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Turin, Italy; [Semeraro, Patrizia] Politecn Torino, Dept Architecture & Design, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Turin; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Luciano, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Coll Carlo Alberto & Netspar, Turin, Italy.",elisa.luciano@unito.it,"luciano, elisa/HTT-2306-2023","luciano, elisa/0000-0003-2992-3952; SEMERARO, Patrizia/0000-0003-2075-8196",,,,,32,18,19,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The stochastic local intensity (SLI) models such as the one proposed byArnsdorf and Halperin allow to get a stochastic jump intensity while keeping the same marginal laws. These models involve a nonlinear stochastic differential equation (SDE) with jumps. The first contribution of this paper is to prove the existence and uniqueness of such processes. This is made by means of an interacting particle system, whose convergence rate toward the nonlinear SDE is analyzed. Second, this approach provides a powerful way to compute pathwise expectations with the SLI model: we show that the computational cost is roughly the same as a crude Monte Carlo algorithm for standard SDEs.","[Alfonsi, Aurelien] Univ Paris Est, Paris, France; [Labart, Celine] Univ Savoie, Chambery, France; [Lelong, Jerome] Univ Grenoble Alpes, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Lelong, J (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Jean Kuntzmann, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France.",Jerome.lelong@imag.fr,,"Alfonsi, Aurelien/0000-0003-3816-6105",Chaire Risques Financiers of Fondation du Risque; Finance for Energy Market Research Centre,Chaire Risques Financiers of Fondation du Risque; Finance for Energy Market Research Centre,"Wewould like to thank Benjamin Jourdain (Universite Paris-Est) for fruitful discussions having stimulated this research.

However, the effective risk aversion shrinks toward one in proportion to performance fees. Risk shifting implications are ambiguous and depend on the manager's own risk aversion. Managers with equal investment opportunities but different performance fees and risk aversions may coexist in a competitive equilibrium.

In this article, we derive the large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators. Our derivations take into account that the propensity score is itself estimated in a first step, prior to matching. We prove that first step estimation of the propensity score affects the large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators, and derive adjustments to the large sample variances of propensity score matching estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The adjustment for the ATE estimator is negative (or zero in some special cases), implying that matching on the estimated propensity score is more efficient than matching on the true propensity score in large samples. However, for the ATET estimator, the sign of the adjustment term depends on the data generating process, and ignoring the estimation error in the propensity score may lead to confidence intervals that are either too large or too small.","[Abadie, Alberto] John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Abadie, Alberto; Imbens, Guido W.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Imbens, Guido W.] Stanford Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Abadie, A (通讯作者)，John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Abadie, A; Imbens, GW (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Imbens, GW (通讯作者)，Stanford Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",alberto_abadie@harvard.edu; imbens@stanford.edu,"imbens, guido/P-2333-2019",,"NSF [SES 0820361, SES 0961707]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0961707] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful to the editor and three referees for helpful comments, to Ben Hansen, Judith Lok, James Robins, Paul Rosenbaum, Donald Rubin, and participants in many seminars for comments and discussions, and to Jann Spiess for expert research assistance.

First, we estimate the bilateral reinsurance claims matrix using the aggregate outstanding reinsurance data from ISIS and theoretically analyze the interconnectedness in the global reinsurance network using network indicators. The robustness of the estimated matrix is fully assured by sensitivity analysis. Second, we theoretically analyze the contagious defaults introducing the Eisenberg-Noe framework. Reinsurers play a dominant role in the reinsurance network and most of them are included in our data sample. The network analysis finds that some reinsurers with large centrality measures are central in the hierarchical structure of the network. The default analysis shows the occurrences of many stand-alone defaults and only one contagious default via the global reinsurance network after the global financial crisis. In addition, one stress test based on a hypothetical severe stress scenario predicts a few occurrences of contagious defaults in the future. It follows from these analyses that systemic risk via the global reinsurance network is relatively restricted in the global non-life insurance market. In conclusion, our methodology would help supervisory authorities develop an assessment approach for interconnectedness in the global reinsurance network and aid the implementation of insurer stress tests for default contagion.

Our method can be applied to testing for serial independence of generalized errors, and testing for independence between the generalized errors and observable covariates. The former can serve as a unified approach to testing the adequacy of time series models, as model adequacy often implies that the generalized errors obtained after a suitable transformation are independent and identically distributed. The latter is a key identification assumption in many nonlinear economic models. Our tests are based on a classical sample dependence measure, the Hoeffding-Blum-Kiefer-Rosenblatttype empirical process applied to generalized residuals. We establish a uniform expansion of the process, thereby deriving an explicit expression for the parameter estimation effect, which causes our tests not to be nuisance-parameter-free. To circumvent this problem, we propose a multiplier-type bootstrap to approximate the limit distribution.

First, in the context of no microstructure effects, our results rigorously justify the Edgeworth expansions for realized volatility derived in Gonc, alves andMeddahi (2009, Econometrica 77, 283-306). Second, we show that the validity of the Edgeworth expansions for realized volatility might not cover the optimal two-point distribution wild bootstrap proposed by Gonc, alves and Meddahi. Then, we propose a new optimal nonlattice distribution, which ensures the second-order correctness of the bootstrap. Third, in the presence of microstructure noise, based on our Edgeworth expansions, we show that the new optimal choice proposed in the absence of noise is still valid in noisy data for the pre-averaged realized volatility estimator proposed by Podolskij and Vetter (2009, Bernoulli 15, 634-658). Finally, we show how confidence intervals for integrated volatility can be constructed using these Edgeworth expansions for noisy data. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the intervals based on the Edgeworth corrections have improved the finite sample properties relatively to the conventional intervals based on the normal approximation.","[Hounyo, Ulrich; Veliyev, Bezirgen] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, CREATES, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Hounyo, U; Veliyev, B (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, CREATES, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",uhounyo@econ.au.dk; bveliyev@econ.au.dk,"Veliyev, Bezirgen/K-4936-2019","Veliyev, Bezirgen/0000-0003-4627-0674",,,,,38,8,9,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

This paper developed a new method based on variational approximation of sequential Bayesian inference (VASB). Concepts and notions of the sequential Bayesian analysis and the variational approximation of an intractable posterior are simple and straightforward. Our VASB algorithm is not complicated and is easy to code. For a regression on multiple time-series, the regression coefficients, standard errors, prediction and residual error are time-varying and are estimated jointly at every time step. For a single time-series (e.g. price returns of an asset), its mean and variance are time-varying and are predicted jointly at every time step. The VASB algorithm performs better than the rolling and time-weighted statistics or regressions and the KF in terms of higher predictive power and stronger robustness. Derivations of the VASB algorithm are presented in the appendices.","[Ling, Hui Fox] Allianz Global Investors US LLC, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Stone, Douglas B.] Allianz Global Investors US LLC, San Diego, CA 92101 USA",,"Ling, H (通讯作者)，Allianz Global Investors US LLC, 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 USA.",Fox.Ling@AllianzGI.com,,,,,,,36,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Our method naturally incorporates fat-tailed error distributions and can be extended to other data features such as stochastic volatility. We show that the sequential Bayes factor provides an optimal test of fat-tails versus normality. We provide an empirical and theoretical analysis of the rate of learning of tail thickness under a default Jeffreys prior.

We focus on two main issues that typically arise in econometrics. First, many econometric models are estimated through maximum likelihood or pseudo-ML methods like, for example, limited dependent variable or gravity models. Second, often one might not want to fully specify the null hypothesis. Instead, one would rather impose some structure like separability or monotonicity. In order to address these points we introduce an adaptive omnibus test. Special emphasis is given to practical issues like adaptive bandwidth choice, general but simple requirements on the estimates, and finite sample performance, including the resampling approximations.","[Rodriguez-Poo, Juan M.] Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Sperlich, Stefan] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Vieu, Philippe] Univ Toulouse 3, F-31062 Toulouse, France",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Geneva; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Rodríguez-Póo, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",rodrigjm@unican.es,"Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel/F-6994-2016","Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-8751-3025; sperlich, stefan/0000-0001-5366-2612",Programa Estatal de Fomento de la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica de Excelencia/Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48326-C2-2-P]; Swiss National Science Foundation [100018-140295]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_140295] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Programa Estatal de Fomento de la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica de Excelencia/Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We acknowledge financial support from the Programa Estatal de Fomento de la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica de Excelencia/Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness.

Fundamentalists forecast future prices cum dividends through an adaptive learning rule. In contrast, chartists forecast future prices based on the observation of past price movements. Numerical simulations reveal that the interplay of fundamentalists and chartists robustly generates excess volatility of asset prices, volatility clustering, trends in prices (i.e. positive serial correlations of returns) over short horizons and oscillations in prices (i.e. negative serial correlations of returns) over long horizons, often observed in financial data. Moreover, we find that the memory of the learning rule plays a key role in explaining the above-mentioned stylized facts. In particular, we establish that excess volatility of asset prices; volatility clustering and autocorrelation of returns at different horizons emerge when fundamentalists have short memory. However, volatility clustering as well as short-run and long-run dependencies, observed in financial time series, are more pronounced when fundamentalists have longer memory.","[Leal, Sandrine Jacob] CEREFIGE, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Leal, Sandrine Jacob] ICN Business Sch Nancy Metz, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Leal, Sandrine Jacob] CNRS, GREDEG, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Leal, SJ (通讯作者)，CEREFIGE, 13 Rue Michel Ney, F-54000 Nancy, France.",sandrine.jacob-leal@icn-groupe.fr,,,,,,,104,3,3,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Both the insurance risk process and the dual model will be considered under exponential distributional assumption on the jump sizes while keeping the inter-arrival times arbitrary. In these two models, the Laplace transform of the Parisian ruin time is derived by extending the excursion techniques in Dassios and Wu (2008a) and taking advantage of the memoryless property of exponential distributions. Our results are represented in integral forms, which are expressed in terms of the (joint) densities of various ruin-related quantities that are available in the literature or obtainable using the Lagrange's expansion theorem. As a by-product, we also provide the joint distribution of the numbers of periods of negative surplus that are of duration more than d and less than d, which can be obtained using some of our intermediate results. The case where the Parisian delay period d is replaced by a random time is also discussed, and it is applied to find the Laplace transform of the occupation time when the surplus is negative.

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants' actions. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary trading statistics of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary trading statistics. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders' underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants.","[Yang, Steve Y.] Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn Program, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Qiao, Qifeng; Beling, Peter A.; Scherer, William T.; Kirilenko, Andrei A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Syst & Informat Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Kirilenko, Andrei A.] MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Stevens Institute of Technology; University of Virginia; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Yang, SY (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn Program, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",syang14@stevens.edu; ak67@mit.edu,,"Beling, Peter/0000-0003-2196-6982; Scherer, William/0000-0002-1069-7898",,,,,25,21,26,4,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We derive an asymptotically optimal bandwidth that minimizes a higher-order approximation to the asymptotic mean-squared error of the estimator of interest. We show that the optimal bandwidth is of the same order as the one minimizing the mean-squared error of the nonparametric plugin estimator, but the constants of proportionality are significantly different.

Unlike the effects of distribution factors, the level of the sharing rule cannot be uniquely identified without strong assumptions on preferences across households. Our new results show that, though not point identified without these assumptions, strong bounds on the sharing rule can be obtained. We get these bounds by applying revealed preference restrictions implied by the collective model to the household's continuous aggregate demand functions. We obtain informative bounds even if nothing is known about whether each good is public, private, or assignable within the household, though having such information tightens the bounds. We apply our method to US PSID data, obtaining narrow bounds that yield useful conclusions regarding the effects of income and wages on intrahousehold resource sharing, and on the prevalence of individual (as opposed to household level) poverty.","[Cherchye, Laurens] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; [De Rock, Bram] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Lewbel, Arthur] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Vermeulen, Frederic] Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Boston College; KU Leuven,"Cherchye, L (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, E Sabbelaan 53, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium.",laurens.cherchye@kuleuven-kortrijk.be; bderock@ulb.ac.be; lewbel@bc.edu; frederic.vermeulen@kuleuven.be,,"Cherchye, Laurens/0000-0003-3766-2449; Lewbel, Arthur/0000-0003-3864-2618; De Rock, Bram/0000-0002-5114-1386","European Research Council (ERC) [614221, 263707]; FWO (Research Fund-Flanders) [G057314N]; BELSPO; Research Fund KU Leuven [STRT/12/001]; European Research Council (ERC) [263707] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); FWO (Research Fund-Flanders)(FWO); BELSPO(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Research Fund KU Leuven(KU Leuven); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank an editor, three anonymous referees, Pierre-Andre Chiappori, Bart Capeau, Francois Maniquet, Erik Schokkaert, and participants at the NESG 2012 annual meeting in Groningen, the workshop Family Economics and Human Capital in the Family in Rome, the workshop Advances in Family Economics and Applications to Developing Countries in Nanterre, the workshop Demand Estimation and Modelling in Boston, the AEA meeting in Philadelphia, and seminar participants in Bologna, Brussels, Laval University, the University of Leuven, Tilburg University, Uppsala University, the University of East Anglia, the University of Oxford, CREST-ENSAE, and the Sveriges Riksbank for useful comments and suggestions.

J,"Magill, M; Quinzii, M; Rochet, JC",,,,"Magill, Michael; Quinzii, Martine; Rochet, Jean-Charles",,,A Theory of the Stakeholder Corporation,ECONOMETRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Endogenous uncertainty; stakeholder model,,"There is a widely held view within the general public that large corporations should act in the interests of a broader group of agents than just their shareholders (the stakeholder view). This paper presents a framework where this idea can be justified. The point of departure is the observation that a large firm typically faces endogenous risks that may have a significant impact on the workers it employs and the consumers it serves. These risks generate externalities on these stakeholders which are not internalized by shareholders. As a result, in the competitive equilibrium, there is under-investment in the prevention of these risks. We suggest that this under-investment problem can be alleviated if firms are instructed to maximize the total welfare of their stakeholders rather than shareholder value alone (stakeholder equilibrium). The stakeholder equilibrium can be implemented by introducing new property rights (employee rights and consumer rights) and instructing managers to maximize the total value of the firm (the value of these rights plus shareholder value). If there is only one firm, the stakeholder equilibrium is Pareto optimal. However, this is not true with more than one firm and/or heterogeneous agents, which illustrates some of the limits of the stakeholder model.","[Magill, Michael] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Quinzii, Martine] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] SFI, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] Toulouse Sch Econ IDEI, F-31015 Toulouse, France",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Zurich; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Magill, M (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",magill@usc.edu; mmquinzii@ucdavis.edu; jeancharles.rochet@gmail.com,,,European Research Council (European Community's Seventh Framework Programme) [249415-RMAC]; SFI (project Banking and Regulation),European Research Council (European Community's Seventh Framework Programme); SFI (project Banking and Regulation),"This paper was the basis for Rochet's Presidential Address to the Econometric Society in 2012.
