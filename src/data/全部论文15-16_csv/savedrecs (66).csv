An information structure is here represented by a non directed network, whose nodes are agents and whose links represent sharing agreements. We first study the equilibrium use of information given the network, finding that the extent to which a piece of information is observed by others affects the equilibrium use of it, in line with previous results in the literature. We then study the incentives to share information ex-ante, highlighting the role of the elasticity of payoffs to the equilibrium volatility of one's own strategy and of opponents' strategies. For the case of uncorrelated signals we fully characterise pairwise stable networks for the general linear quadratic game. For the case of correlated signals, we study pairwise stable networks for three specific linear quadratic games-Cournot Oligopoly, Keynes' Beauty Contest and a Public Good Game-in which strategies are substitute, complement and orthogonal, respectively. We show that signals' correlation favours the transmission of information, but may also prevent all information from being transmitted.","[Currarini, Sergio] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England; [Currarini, Sergio] Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Feri, Francesco] Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham, Surrey, England",University of Leicester; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Currarini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Venice, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",s.currarini@unive.it,,"Currarini, Sergio/0000-0002-5523-4125",,,,,18,12,13,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) and to produce a critical review of the company's submission to NICE. The clinical evidence was derived from three phase III, company-sponsored, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence comparing nalmefene, taken on an as-needed basis, in conjunction with psychosocial support with placebo in conjunction with psychosocial support. Psychosocial support was provided in the form of BRENDA, an intervention of lower intensity than that recommended in NICE Clinical Guideline 115 (NICE CG115). Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted in people who were drinking at high or very high risk levels at baseline and maintained this level of drinking during the screening phase prior to randomisation. This subgroup forms the licensed population. There were a number of limitations and uncertainties in the clinical evidence base which warrant caution in its interpretation. In particular, the post-hoc subgroup analyses and high dropout rates in the three nalmefene studies meant that the inference of treatment effects might be confounded. The company's economic evaluation showed that use of nalmefene in conjunction with psychosocial support in the form of BRENDA dominated the use of BRENDA in conjunction with placebo, providing more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a reduced cost. However, this evaluation did not meet the final scope issued by NICE, which specified that the comparator should be psychological intervention as defined in NICE CG115. The ERG produced alternative cost per QALY values for the comparison undertaken by the company and suggested three further comparisons deemed relevant: (1) nalmefene with psychological intervention as defined in NICE CG115; (2) delayed use of nalmefene in those who did not respond to psychological intervention as recommended in NICE CG115 alone; and (3) use of naltrexone outside of its marketing authorisation. The ERG thought it probable that using nalmefene in only those people who do not respond to psychological intervention alone was likely to be more cost effective compared with its immediate use in the entire licensed population. The Appraisal Committee accepted the comparison with psychosocial support in the form of BRENDA and believed that the most plausible cost per QALY was likely to be below A 5100 pound. Therefore, the Appraisal Committee concluded that nalmefene in conjunction with psychosocial support was a cost effective use of NHS resources compared with psychosocial support alone for treating people with alcohol dependence drinking at a high risk level, without physical withdrawal symptoms and not requiring immediate assisted withdrawal from alcohol.","[Stevenson, Matt; Pandor, Abdullah; Stevens, John W.; Rawdin, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Rice, Peter] NHS Tayside, Dundee DD11 1ES, Scotland; [Thompson, Jez] Lifeline Project, York YO24 1AU, N Yorkshire, England; [Morgan, Marsha Y.] UCL, Div Med, UCL Inst Liver & Digest Hlth, London NW3 2PF, England",University of Sheffield; University of London; University College London,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010; Morgan, Marsha Y/C-5909-2009","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Stevens, John/0000-0002-9867-7209",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [13/66/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This Project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project number 13/66/01).

The ground for this is a dearth of financial products to combat longevity risk, with a lack of buy-in and very limited variety of buy-out solutions available. The solutions that do exist frequently come at a very high price and many pension funds are in deficit on a buy-out basis. From our point of view creating an approach for evaluating the longevity risk faced by each pension fund and integrating it into dynamic risk budgeting strategies will help Swiss pension funds better understand the mechanism behind different longevity de-risking solutions and decide on the most suitable as well as affordable solution for them. To develop capital market solutions for longevity hedging strategies it is crucial that both hedgers (pension funds) as well as solution providers are able to quantify the longevity risk in the framework of a holistic risk management and to develop an adequate pricing approach. In this publication we present our stochastic coherent mortality model developed for Swiss pension funds based on the reference population of fifteen countries and discuss the robustness of the forecasts relative to the sample period used to fit the model, biological reasonableness of the forecasts and other modelling parameters as well as possible impact on results. The model has taken into account past single population modelling techniques and allows flexible age effect to capture the spread behaviour introduced by the target population. The augmented terms for the spread function are chosen based on their forecast accuracy and a coherent behaviour is expected in the long term. The idea behind is fairly simple and yields a design with both transparency and robustness. The model usage is not limited to Switzerland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A fixed pool of homogenous potential players with identical marginal bidding cost must incur an entry cost to enter the contest before they bid for prize(s). The designer can flexibly adjust the impact function of a generalized nested lottery contest and use a fixed budget to fund single or multiple prizes. Applying Dasgupta and Maskin (Rev Econ Stud 53(1):1-26, 1986), we establish the existence of symmetric equilibrium for all contest mechanisms concerned. A uniform upper bound for expected overall bids is identified for any eligible contest, assuming that potential bidders play symmetric equilibria. We show that the upper bound can be achieved through a Tullock contest with a single contingent prize, which adopts compatible bundles of success function and entry fees/subsidies. In particular, we identify the conditions under which the optimum can be achieved by solely setting the right discriminatory power in a Tullock contest with a single fixed prize. Finally, our analysis characterizes the optimal shortlisting rule, which reveals that the contest designer generally should exclude potential bidders to elicit higher bids.","[Fu, Qiang] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Business Policy, Singapore 117592, Singapore; [Jiao, Qian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jingfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Sun Yat Sen University; National University of Singapore,"Jiao, Q (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bizfq@nus.edu.sg; jiaoq3@mail.sysu.edu.cn; ecsljf@nus.edu.sg,"Fu, Qiang/D-4900-2016; Lu, Jingfeng/R-2868-2019",,"MOE Singapore (WBS) [R313-000-107-112, R122-000-155-112]",MOE Singapore (WBS),"We are grateful to the Co-Editor in charge Vijay Krishna, the associate editor and two anonymous referees for very insightful and constructive comments and suggestions.

The insurer is assumed to be a mean-variance optimizer. The financial market consists of one risk-free asset and one risky asset. The market price of risk depends on a Markovian, affine-form, square-root stochastic factor process, while the volatility and appreciation rate of the risky asset are given by non-Markovian, unbounded processes. The insurer faces the decision-making problem of choosing to purchase reinsurance, acquire new business and invest its surplus in the financial market such that the mean and variance of its terminal wealth is maximized and minimized simultaneously. We adopt a backward stochastic differential equation approach to solve the problem. Closed-form expressions for the efficient frontier and efficient strategy of the mean-variance problem are derived. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results in two special cases, the constant elasticity of variance model and Heston's model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When the value of tail order is larger than the dimension, it may lead to tail negative dependence. First, we prove results on conditions that lead to tail negative dependence for Archimedean copulas. Using the conditions, we construct new parametric copula families that possess upper tail negative dependence. Among them, a copula based on a scale mixture with a generalized gamma random variable (GGS copula) is useful for modeling asymmetric tail negative dependence. We propose mixed copula regression based on the GGS copula for aggregate loss modeling of a medical expenditure panel survey dataset. For this dataset, we find that there exists upper tail negative dependence between loss frequency and loss severity, and the introduction of tail negative dependence structures significantly improves the aggregate loss modeling.

[Multiscale Stochastic Volatility for Equity, Interest Rate, and Credit Derivatives, 2011] to models of the exponential Levy type. From a financial perspective, the inclusion of jumps and stochastic volatility allow us to capture the term-structure of implied volatility, as demonstrated in a calibration to S&P500 options data.","[Lorig, Matthew] Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lozano-Carbasse, Oriol] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Princeton University,"Lorig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mattlorig@gmail.com,"Lorig, Matthew/L-8420-2019","Lorig, Matthew/0000-0001-5307-3447",Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [0739195] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,24,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The first application utilised the principle for the water supply of a brewery. In this set up a water valve had to be manually closed. Very soon upgrades for an automatic operation of the device were adapted. With technological progress also the ram was improved, but got superseded by electric and fuel powered pumps. Today the ram constitutes a reliable and low-maintenance, sustainable alternative to motor-driven pumps. The hydraulic ram uses the kinetic energy of water flowing in a driver pipe to pump up about 10% of it to a higher elevation. Thereby, no external energy input is needed. As a lot of studies had been carried out constructing hydraulic rams with self built valves and for high water supply, the aim of this investigation was to construct a reliable and low-cost ram, made of locally available off-the-shelf parts. Different valves were tested in the lab under varying elevations of the water column in the driver pipe. The pumping pressure and water flow in the supply pipe were recorded for determining the ram's efficiency. An off-the-shelf clap check valve proved mosrt reliable with an acceptable efficiency of over 30%. One unit of a hydraulic ram was installed at a foothill location at Ban Ha, Samoeng District, Chiang Mai Province, and connected to an automatic low pressure irrigation system to irrigate a small plot of coffee trees. Soil moisture was monitored. The hydraulic ram operated maintenance free and fully automatic over six weeks, supplying the field sufficient quantities of water during this period at a pumping efficiency of 44%.

For each economy in this class, the equilibrium stochastic discount factor is an exponential function of the inverse mapping of a completely monotone function, evaluated at the aggregate consumption. This fact allows for general properties of the class to be studied analytically in terms of known properties of completely monotone functions. For example, conditions are presented under which the agents' cautiousness parameters and a distribution of initial wealth can be recovered from an equilibrium stochastic discount factor, even if nothing is known about the agents' endowments. This is a multiagent inverse problem since information about economic primitives is extracted from equilibrium prices. Several example economies are used to illustrate the results.","[Vanden, Joel M.] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Vanden, JM (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, Dept Finance, 341 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jmv13@psu.edu,,,Smeal College of Business; Tuck School of Business; Haas School at UC Berkeley; NASDAQ Educational Foundation,Smeal College of Business; Tuck School of Business; Haas School at UC Berkeley; NASDAQ Educational Foundation,"I thank the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Many of those concepts, such as Marginal Expected Shortfall or Tail Conditional Expectation, are simply some conditional expectations that evaluate the risk in adverse scenarios and are useful for signaling to a decision-maker the poor performance of its risk portfolio or to identify which sub-portfolio is likely to exhibit a massive downside risk. We investigate the latter risk under the assumption that it is measured via a coherent risk measure, which obviously generalizes the idea of only taking the expectation of the downside risk. Multiple examples are given and our numerical illustrations show how the asymptotic approximations can be used in the capital allocation exercise. We have concluded that the expectation of the downside risk does not fairly take into account the individual risk contribution when allocating the VaR-based regulatory capital, and thus, more conservative risk measurements are recommended. Finally, we have found that more conservative risk measurements do not improve the fairness of the cost of capital allocation when the uncertainty with parameter estimation is present, even at a very high level.

Many life tables used for annuity pricing are built in this way. The present paper adopts this point of view and proposes a simple and powerful mortality projection model in line with this elementary approach, based on the recently studied mortality improvement rates. Two main applications are considered. First, as most reference life tables produced by regulators are deterministic by nature, they can be made stochastic by superposing random departures from the assumed age-specific trend, with a volatility calibrated on market or portfolio data. This allows the actuary to account for the systematic longevity risk in solvency calculations. Second, the model can be fitted to historical data and used to produce longevity forecasts. A number of conservative and tractable approximations are derived to provide the actuary with reasonably accurate approximations for various relevant quantities, available at limited computational cost. Besides applications to stochastic mortality projection models, we also derive useful properties involving supermodular, directionally convex and stop-loss orders. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Under the standard system, the premium assigned to each policyholder is based only on the number of claims made. Therefore, a policyholder who has had an accident producing a relatively small amount of loss is penalised to the same extent as one who has had amore costly accident. This outcome would seem to be unfair. Accordingly, we present a statistical model which distinguishes between two different types of claims, incorporating a bivariate distribution based on the assumption of dependence. We also describe a bivariate prior distribution conjugated with respect to the likelihood. This approach produces credibility bonus-malus premiums that satisfy appropriate transition rules. A practical example of its application is presented and the results obtained are compared with those derived from the traditional Poisson-Gamma model in which only the number of claims is taken into account.

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is usually preferred when a parametric statistical model is correctly specified, but traditional MLE implementation for SV models is computationally infeasible due to high dimensionality of the integral involved. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a gradient-based simulated MLE method under the hidden Markov structure for SV models, which covers those driven by pure jump Levy processes. Gradient estimation using characteristic functions and sequential Monte Carlo in the simulation of the hidden states are implemented. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.","[Peng, Yijie; Hu, Jian-Qiang] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fu, Michael C.] Univ Maryland, Syst Res Inst, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Fudan University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hu, JQ (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",hujq@fudan.edu.cn,"Fu, Michael C/N-4098-2013; Hu, Jianqiang/K-2128-2017","Fu, Michael C/0000-0003-2105-4932;","National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-0856256, CMMI-1362303, CMMI-1434419]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11171256, 71028001, 71061160506, 71571048, 71071040]; Air Force of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-15-10050]; Science and Technology Agency of Sichuan Province [2014GZX0002]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institution of Higher Learning; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M571495]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Air Force of Scientific Research (AFOSR)(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Science and Technology Agency of Sichuan Province; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institution of Higher Learning; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [grant number CMMI-0856256], [grant number CMMI-1362303], [grant number CMMI-1434419], [EECS]; by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant number 11171256], [grant number 71028001], [grant number 71061160506], [grant number 71571048], [grant number 71071040]; by the Air Force of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [grant number FA9550-15-10050]; by the Science and Technology Agency of Sichuan Province [grant number 2014GZX0002]; by the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institution of Higher Learning, and by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2015M571495].",,37,5,5,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We also consider the general partially exact and bounded (PEB) approximations, which include the sharp lower bound and partially conditional moment matching approximation as special cases. The PEB approximations are known to lie between a sharp lower bound and an upper bound. Our numerical tests show that the PEB approximations to discrete arithmetic Asian option prices can produce highly accurate approximations when compared to other approximation methods.

In this paper, we argue that MCDA needs to subscribe to robust methodological processes related to the selection of objectives, criteria and attributes in order to be meaningful in the context of healthcare decision making and fulfil its role in value-based assessment (VBA). We propose a methodological process, based on multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) methods comprising five distinct phases, outline the stages involved in each phase and discuss their relevance in the HTA process. Importantly, criteria and attributes need to satisfy a set of desired properties, otherwise the outcome of the analysis can produce spurious results and misleading recommendations. Assuming the methodological process we propose is adhered to, the application of MCDA presents three very distinct advantages to decision makers in the context of HTA and VBA: first, it acts as an instrument for eliciting preferences on the performance of alternative options across a wider set of explicit criteria, leading to a more complete assessment of value; second, it allows the elicitation of preferences across the criteria themselves to reflect differences in their relative importance; and, third, the entire process of preference elicitation can be informed by direct stakeholder engagement, and can therefore reflect their own preferences. All features are fully transparent and facilitate decision making.","[Angelis, Aris; Kanavos, Panos] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Angelis, Aris; Kanavos, Panos] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Med Technol Res Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Angelis, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Angelis, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Med Technol Res Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.n.angelis@lse.ac.uk,"Angelis, Aris/AAH-1532-2021","Angelis, Aris/0000-0002-0261-4634","Advance-HTA, a research project from the European Commission, DG Research [305983]","Advance-HTA, a research project from the European Commission, DG Research","This study has been prepared under the auspices of Advance-HTA, a research project that has received funding from the European Commission, DG Research (Grant agreement no: 305983).

Each player is characterized by a (possibly misspecified) subjective model, which describes the set of feasible beliefs over payoff-relevant consequences as a function of actions. We introduce the notion of a Berk-Nash equilibrium: Each player follows a strategy that is optimal given her belief, and her belief is restricted to be the best fit among the set of beliefs she considers possible. The notion of best fit is formalized in terms of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is endogenous and depends on the equilibrium strategy profile. Standard solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and self-confirming equilibrium constitute special cases where players have correctly specified models. We provide a learning foundation for Berk-Nash equilibrium by extending and combining results from the statistics literature on misspecified learning and the economics literature on learning in games.","[Esponda, Ignacio] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, 1 Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Pouzo, Demian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 530-1 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Esponda, I (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, 1 Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",iesponda@wustl.edu; dpouzo@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,73,73,86,3,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2016,84,3,,,,,1093,1130,,10.3982/ECTA12609,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DR8FW,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380134800005,0

Because of the presence of group-level unobservables, standard quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if the treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our estimation technique is consistent as well as computationally simple, consisting of group-by-group quantile regression followed by two-stage least squares. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero-mean normality of our estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor, 1981, micro-level covariates can be used as internal instruments for the endogenous group-level treatment if they satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions. Our approach applies to a broad range of settings including labor, public finance, industrial organization, urban economics, and development; we illustrate its usefulness with several such examples. Finally, an empirical application of our estimator finds that low-wage earners in the United States from 1990 to 2007 were significantly more affected by increased Chinese import competition than high-wage earners.","[Chetverikov, Denis] UCLA, Dept Econ, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Larsen, Bradley] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Larsen, Bradley] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Palmer, Christopher] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Chetverikov, D (通讯作者)，UCLA, Dept Econ, 315 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Larsen, B (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Larsen, B (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Palmer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",chetverikov@econ.ucla.edu; bjlarsen@stanford.edu; cjpalmer@berkeley.edu,"Larsen, Bradley/JJF-9680-2023","Larsen, Bradley/0000-0002-8357-0046",,,,,48,54,60,4,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2016,84,2,,,,,809,833,,10.3982/ECTA12121,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8DQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373024100009,0

While there are no treatments for early-stage AMD, there are multiple modalities of treatment for advanced disease. Given the increasing prevalence of the disease, there are dozens of analyses of cost effectiveness of AMD treatments, but methods and approaches vary broadly. The goal of this review was to identify, characterize, and critique published models in AMD and provide guidance for their interpretation. After a literature review was performed to identify studies, and exclusion criteria applied to limit the review to studies comparing treatments for AMD, we compared methods across the 36 studies meeting the review criteria. To some extent, variation was related to targeting different audiences or acknowledging the most appropriate population for a given treatment. However, the review identified potential areas of uncertainty and difficulty in interpretation, particularly regarding duration of observation periods and the importance of visual acuity as an endpoint or a proxy for patient-reported utilities.

The objective of this study was to analyze and further develop a comprehensive MCDA framework (EVIDEM) to address rare disease issues and policies, while maintaining its applicability across disease areas. Specific issues and policies for rare diseases were identified through literature review. Ethical and methodological foundations of the EVIDEM framework v3.0 were systematically analyzed from the perspective of these issues, and policies and modifications of the framework were performed accordingly to ensure their integration. Analysis showed that the framework integrates ethical dilemmas and issues inherent to appraising interventions for rare diseases but required further integration of specific aspects. Modification thus included the addition of subcriteria to further differentiate disease severity, disease-specific treatment outcomes, and economic consequences of interventions for rare diseases. Scoring scales were further developed to include negative scales for all comparative criteria. A methodology was established to incorporate context-specific population priorities and policies, such as those for rare diseases, into the quantitative part of the framework. This design allows making more explicit trade-offs between competing ethical positions of fairness (prioritization of those who are worst off), the goal of benefiting as many people as possible, the imperative to help, and wise use of knowledge and resources. It also allows addressing variability in institutional policies regarding prioritization of specific disease areas, in addition to existing uncertainty analysis available from EVIDEM. The adapted framework measures value in its widest sense, while being responsive to rare disease issues and policies. It provides an operationalizable platform to integrate values, competing ethical dilemmas, and uncertainty in appraising healthcare interventions.","[Wagner, Monika; Khoury, Hanane; Rindress, Donna; Goetghebeur, Mireille] LASER Analyt, 1405 Transcanadienne,Suite 310, Montreal, PQ H9P 2V9, Canada; [Willet, Jacob] LASER Analyt, New York, NY USA; [Goetghebeur, Mireille] Univ Montreal, Sch Publ Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Wagner, M (通讯作者)，LASER Analyt, 1405 Transcanadienne,Suite 310, Montreal, PQ H9P 2V9, Canada.",monika.wagner@la-ser.com,,"Willet, Jacob/0000-0001-9499-4058","Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA; Genzyme (of Sanofi)","Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA(Sanofi-AventisGenzyme Corporation); Genzyme (of Sanofi)","This study was made possible by a research grant from Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Monika Wagner, Hanane Khoury, Jacob Willet, Donna Rindress, and Mireille Goetghebeur are employees of LASER Analytica, which has received funding from Genzyme (a subsidiary of Sanofi) for the conduct of this study and preparation of the manuscript.",,94,40,49,0,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2016,34,3,,,,,285,301,,10.1007/s40273-015-0340-5,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DF2HW,26547306.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371164200008,0

Data can be analyzed by means of a simple logistic regression model when the multivariate Gaussian time series component is absent and there is no overdispersion. In this paper we rather allow for overdispersion and the mixed regression model is fitted to mortality data from the United States and Sweden, with the aim to provide prediction and intervals for future mortality and annuity premium, as well as smoothing historical data, using the best linear unbiased predictor. We find that the form of the Gaussian time series has a large impact on the width of the prediction intervals, and it poses some new questions on proper model selection. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Similarly to Renshaw et al. (1996) and Sithole et al. (2000), the force of mortality will be defined using an exponential function of Legendre polynomials. We extend the approach of Ballotta and Haberman (2006) by conditionally adding a-stable Levy subordinators in the force of mortality. In particular, we focus on the Gamma and Variance-Gamma processes in order to show how Levy subordinators can capture mortality shocks. Generalized Linear Models is used to estimate coefficients of the explanatory variables and the Levy process. For this purpose, the coefficients of the process are obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood function. We use the mortality data of males in Japan from 1998-2011 and the U.S. from 1965-2010 in order to compare our results with the model proposed by Renshaw et al. (1996). Some preferences are indicated based on Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, likelihood ratio test and Akaike weights to support the proposed model. We then use a cubic smoothing spline method to fa the interest rate curve and illustrate some over (under) estimations in the prices of annuities under the structure suggested by Renshaw et al.

Nevertheless, the Expected, Utility Theory has constantly been criticized for its failure in capturing the actual human decision making, and its shortcoming motivates the recent development of behavioral economics and finance, such as the Disappointment Theory; this theory was first developed by (1) Bell (1985), and Loomes and Sugden (1986), that can successfully explain the Allais Paradox. Their theory was later enhanced to the (2) Disappointment Aversion Theory by Gul (1991), and then (3) Disappointment Theory without prior expectation by Cillo and Delquie (2006). In our present paper, we extend the problem studied by Kaluszka and Okolewski (2008) over the three mentioned disappointment models, while the solutions are still absent in the literature. We also conclude with the uniform optimality of the class of single layer indemnities in all these models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Cheung, K. C.; Chong, W.

As a remedy, we introduce a notion of paths of maximal (tail) dependence and utilize the notion to propose several new indices of tail dependence.

The economic burden associated with diabetes, especially in LMICs, is less clear. We provide a systematic review of the global evidence on the costs of type 2 diabetes. Our review seeks to update and considerably expand the previous major review of the costs of diabetes by capturing the evidence on overall, direct and indirect costs of type 2 diabetes worldwide that has been published since 2001. In addition, we include a body of economic evidence that has hitherto been distinct from the cost-of-illness (COI) work, i.e. studies on the labour market impact of diabetes. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, EconLit and IBSS (without language restrictions) for studies assessing the economic burden of type 2 diabetes published from January 2001 to October 2014. Costs reported in the included studies were converted to international dollars ($) adjusted for 2011 values. Alongside the narrative synthesis and methodological review of the studies, we conduct an exploratory linear regression analysis, examining the factors behind the considerable heterogeneity in existing cost estimates between and within countries. We identified 86 COI and 23 labour market studies. COI studies varied considerably both in methods and in cost estimates, with most studies not using a control group, though the use of either regression analysis or matching has increased. Direct costs were generally found to be higher than indirect costs. Direct costs ranged from $242 for a study on out-of-pocket expenditures in Mexico to $11,917 for a study on the cost of diabetes in the USA, while indirect costs ranged from $45 for Pakistan to $16,914 for the Bahamas. In LMICs-in stark contrast to HICs-a substantial part of the cost burden was attributed to patients via out-of-pocket treatment costs. Our regression analysis revealed that direct diabetes costs are closely and positively associated with a country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and that the USA stood out as having particularly high costs, even after controlling for GDP per capita. Studies on the labour market impact of diabetes were almost exclusively confined to HICs and found strong adverse effects, particularly for male employment chances. Many of these studies also took into account the possible endogeneity of diabetes, which was not the case for COI studies. The reviewed studies indicate a large economic burden of diabetes, most directly affecting patients in LMICs.

These RV budgets provide insight into the risk concentration of a portfolio. Furthermore, the RV budgets can be directly used in a portfolio strategy, called the equal-risk-contribution allocation strategy.

The utility maximization problem, including contingent claims in the market with transaction costs, has been widely researched. In this paper, closely following the results of Bouchard (Financ Stoch 6: 495-516, 2002), we consider the market equilibrium of contingent claims. This is done by specifying the utility function as exponential utility and, thus, determining equilibrium in the market with transaction costs. Unlike Davis and Yoshikawa (Math Finan Econ, 2015), we use the strong assumption to deduce the equilibrium at which trade does not occur (zero trade equilibrium). It implicitly shows that transaction costs may generate a non-zero trade equilibrium under a weaker assumption.","[Davis, Mark H.

Such dependence modelling is particularly important for managing credit risk, for instance, where joint defaults are a major cause of concern. Often, the dependence between the individual loss occurrence indicators is driven by a small number of unobservable factors. Conditional loss probabilities are then expressed as monotone functions of linear combinations of these hidden factors. However, combining the factors in a linear way allows for some compensation between them. Such diversification effects are not always desirable and this is why the present work proposes a new model replacing linear combinations with maxima. These max-factor models give more insight into which of the factors is dominant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this approach, annual health care costs depend naturally on the health state of the individual. We also derive the distribution of the NPV assuming that annual health care costs are iid random variables. We demonstrate analytically that, under special parametrization, the model with iid costs gives a similar expectation of the NPV to the one of the model with health dependent costs.

We study the optimal consumption, investment, and life insurance decision of an investor with power utility and an uncertain lifetime. To separate risk aversion from elasticity of inter-temporal substitution, we introduce certainty equivalents. We propose a time-inconsistent global optimization problem, and we present a verification theorem for an equilibrium control. In the special case without mortality risk, we discover that our optimization approach is equivalent to recursive utility optimization with Epstein-Zin preferences in the sense that the two approaches lead to the same result. We find this interesting since our optimization problem has an intuitive interpretation as a global maximization of certainty equivalents and since recursive utility, in contrast to our approach, gives rise to severe differentiability problems. Also, our optimization approach can there be seen as a generalization of recursive utility optimization with Epstein-Zin preferences to include mortality risk and life insurance.

Such an action is called pillage. In the majority pillage game, coalitional wealth contributes to coalitional power, but lexicographically less so than coalitional size. The majority pillage game refines the classic majority game in two respects. First, coalitional wealth can resolve ties in coalitional size. Second, a pillaging coalition need not contain a majority or even half of all of the players in the game. A majority of the players directly affected by the pillage, as winners or losers, is sufficient. This paper characterizes the stable sets of two and three-player games, and the symmetric (permutation invariant) stable sets of games with more than three players. For two or three players, the stable set is unique, and for any odd number of players, the symmetric stable set is unique and equal to the unique symmetric stable set for the classic majority game. If the number of players is even and at least four, no symmetric stable set exists.","[Jordan, J.

In this paper, we examine the ability of connectedness in the global network of financial linkages to predict systemic banking crises during the 1978-2010 period. Our results indicate that increases in a country's own connectedness and decreases in its neighbours' connectedness are associated with a higher probability of banking crises after controlling for macroeconomic fundamentals.

Attempts to forecast improving life expectancy have been boosted by the development of stochastic mortality modeling, for example the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (CBD) 2006 model. The most common optimization method for these models is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which relies on the assumption that the number of deaths follows a Poisson distribution. However, several recent studies have found that the true underlying distribution of death data is overdispersed in nature (see Cairns et al. 2009 and Dowd et al. 2010). Semiparametric models have been applied to many areas in economics but there are very few applications of such models in mortality modeling. In this paper we propose a local linear panel fitting methodology to the CBD model which would free the Poisson assumption on number of deaths. The parameters in the CBD model will be considered as smooth functions of time instead of being treated as a bivariate random walk with drift process in the current literature. Using the mortality data of several developed countries, we find that the proposed estimation methods provide comparable fitting results with the MLE method but without the need of additional assumptions on number of deaths. Further, the 5-year-ahead forecasting results show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of the forecast. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods A Markov model was constructed to model the costs and health outcomes of both treatments, potential adverse events, and resulting health states over 35 years. Analyses were based on a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with non-valvular AF at moderate to high risk of stroke. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over the lifetime, and was assessed from the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) perspective. Costs and utility data were drawn from public data and the literature, while event probabilities were derived from both the literature and rivaroxaban's pivotal ROCKET AF trial. Results Stroke prophylaxis with rivaroxaban offers health improvements over warfarin treatment at additional cost. From the SHI perspective, at baseline the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of rivaroxaban was a,not sign15,207 per QALY gained in 2014. The results were robust to changes in the majority of variables; however, they were sensitive to the price of rivaroxaban, the hazard ratios for stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, the time horizon, and the discount rate. Conclusion Our results showed that the substantially higher medication costs of rivaroxaban were offset by mitigating the shortcomings of warfarin, most notably frequent dose regulation and bleeding risk. Future health economic studies on novel oral anticoagulants should evaluate the cost effectiveness for secondary stroke prevention and, as clinical data from direct head-to-head comparisons become available, new anticoagulation therapies should be compared against each other.","[Mensch, Alexander; Stock, Stephanie; Mueller, Dirk] Univ Cologne, Cologne Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Stollenwerk, Bjoern] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management IGM, Munich, Germany",University of Cologne; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Mensch, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",alexander.mensch@yahoo.com,"Stollenwerk, Björn/G-5408-2013","Stollenwerk, Bjorn/0000-0002-3189-409X",,,,,78,17,17,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2015,33,3,,,,,271,283,,10.1007/s40273-014-0236-9,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CC6NB,25404426.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350480700008,0

We propose a multivariate regime switching unobserved components model to obtain transitory and permanent components for each series, allowing for potential recurrent and structural changes in their dynamics. Each component follows distinct two-state Markov processes representing low or high phases. Since the lead-lag relationship between the phases can vary over time, rather than pre-imposing a structure to their linkages, the proposed flexible framework enables us to study their specific lead-lag relationship over each one of their cycles and over each U.S. recession in the last 40 years. The decomposition of the series into permanent and transitory components reveals striking results. First, we find a strong nonlinear association between the components of money and prices-all low phases of the transitory component of prices were preceded by tight transitory and permanent money phases. We also find that most recessions were preceded by tight money phases (its cyclical and permanent components) and high transitory price phases (with the exception of the 2001 and 2009-2010 recessions). In addition, all recessions were associated with a decrease in transitory and permanent income.","[Anderson, Richard G.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO USA; [Chauvet, Marcelle] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Jones, Barry] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of California System; University of California Riverside; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Jones, B (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",bjones@binghamton.edu,"Chauvet, Marcelle/AAG-8251-2019; Jones, Barry/HRE-2456-2023","Chauvet, Marcelle/0000-0002-2548-5679; Jones, Barry/0009-0000-5180-3231",,,,,51,12,12,0,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

For non-brand keywords, we find that new and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads but that more frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average returns that are negative.","[Blake, Thomas; Nosko, Chris; Tadelis, Steven] eBay Res Labs, San Jose, CA 95125 USA; [Nosko, Chris] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tadelis, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tadelis, Steven] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",eBay Inc.; University of Chicago; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Blake, T (通讯作者)，eBay Res Labs, 2065 Hamilton Ave, San Jose, CA 95125 USA.",thblake@ebay.com; cnosko@chicagobooth.edu; stadelis@haas.berkeley.edu,,"Tadelis, Steven/0000-0001-8864-8052",,,,,26,156,183,9,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2015,83,1,,,,,155,174,,10.3982/ECTA12423,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CB9PB,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349962900006,0

Two types of risk models are considered, the first being a Markov-modulated diffusion approximation risk model and the second being a Markov-modulated classical risk model. The insurer can invest in a risk-free bond and a risky asset, where the underlying models for investment assets are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, observable Markov chain. The insurer can also purchase proportional reinsurance to reduce the exposure to insurance risk. The variance principle is adopted to calculate the reinsurance premium, and Markov-modulated constraints on both investment and reinsurance strategies are considered. Explicit expressions for the optimal strategies and value functions are derived by solving the corresponding regime-switching Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Numerical examples for optimal solutions in the Markov-modulated diffusion approximation model are provided to illustrate our results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We present a large volatility predicting method based on the distribution of recurrence intervals between successive volatilities exceeding a certain threshold Q, which has a one-to-one correspondencewith the expected recurrence time tau(Q). We find that the recurrence intervals with large tau(Q) are well approximated by the stretched exponential distribution for all stocks. Thus, an analytical formula for determining the hazard probability W(Delta t vertical bar t) that a volatility above Q will occur within a short interval Delta t if the last volatility exceeding Q happened t periods ago can be directly derived from the stretched exponential distribution, which is found to be in good agreement with the empirical hazard probability from real stock data. Using these results, we adopt a decision-making algorithm for triggering the alarm of the occurrence of the next volatility above Q based on the hazard probability. Using the 'receiver operator characteristic' analysis, we find that this prediction method efficiently forecasts the occurrence of large volatility events in real stock data. Our analysis may help us better understand reoccurring large volatilities and quantify more accurately financial risks in stock markets.","[Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Canabarro, Askery; Stanley, H.

This paper explores how this often unwarranted assumption can be relaxed in a simple way while incorporating rating factors into the model. The approach consists of fitting generalized linear models to the marginal frequency and the conditional severity components of the total claim cost; dependence between them is induced by treating the number of claims as a covariate in the model for the average claim size. In addition to being easy to implement, this modeling strategy has the advantage that when Poisson counts are assumed together with a log-link for the conditional severity model, the resulting pure premium is the product of a marginal mean frequency, a modified marginal mean severity, and an easily interpreted correction term that reflects the dependence. The approach is illustrated through simulations and applied to a Canadian automobile insurance dataset. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Finance, 2011, 11, 115-123] show that the inclusion of a risk-free asset strictly boosts the Sharpe ratio in a continuous-time setting, which is in sharp contrast to the static single-period case. In this paper, we extend their work to a discrete-time setting. Specifically, we prove that the multi-period mean-variance efficient frontier generated by both risky and risk-free assets is strictly separated from that generated by only risky assets. As a result, we demonstrate that the inclusion of a risk-free asset strictly enhances the best Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier in a multi-period discrete-time setting. Furthermore, we offer an explicit expression for the enhancement of the best Sharpe ratio, which was referred to as the premium of dynamic trading by Chiu and Zhou [op. cit.], although they do not present a computational formula for it. Our results further show that, in the case with a risk-free asset, if an investor can extract some money from his initial wealth at time 0, the efficient frontier with a risk-free asset can be tangent to that without a risk-free asset. Finally, based on real data from the American market, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the results obtained in this paper; a numerical comparison between the discrete-time case and the continuous-time case is also provided. Our numerical results reveal that the continuous-time model can be considered to be a limit of the discrete-time model.","[Yao, Haixiang] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhongfei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xingyi] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Sun Yat Sen University; University of Warwick,"Li, ZF (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lnslzf@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71231008, 71471045]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M560658, 2015T80896]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [2014A030312003]; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Guangzhou [14G42]; Characteristic and Innovation Foundation of Guangdong Colleges and Universities (Humanity and Social Science Type); Humanities and Social Science Research Foundation of the National Ministry of Education of China [15YJAZH051]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Guangzhou; Characteristic and Innovation Foundation of Guangdong Colleges and Universities (Humanity and Social Science Type); Humanities and Social Science Research Foundation of the National Ministry of Education of China,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71231008], [grant number 71471045]; the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2014M560658], [grant number 2015T80896]; the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [grant number 2014A030312003]; the Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Guangzhou [grant number 14G42]; and the Characteristic and Innovation Foundation of Guangdong Colleges and Universities (Humanity and Social Science Type), and the Humanities and Social Science Research Foundation of the National Ministry of Education of China [grant number 15YJAZH051].",,27,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

I show that an MIV can only aid in identification beyond that of a Monotone Treatment Selection assumption if for some region of the instrument the observed conditional-on-received-treatment outcomes exhibit monotonicity in the instrument in the opposite direction as that assumed by the MIV in a Simpson's Paradox-like fashion. Furthermore, an MIV can only aid in identification beyond that of a Monotone Treatment Response assumption if for some region of the instrument either the above Simpson's Paradox-like relationship exists or the instrument's indirect effect on the outcome (as through its influence on treatment selection) is the opposite of its direct effect as assumed by the MIV. The implications of the main findings for empirical work are discussed and the results are highlighted with an application investigating the effect of criminal convictions on job match quality using data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of the Youth.

It is an alternative treatment option to aripiprazole, and when compared with aripiprazole, lurasidone was associated with improved symptom reduction and reduced risk of weight gain and relapse. We conducted a cost-utility analysis of lurasidone versus aripiprazole from the perspective of healthcare services, using Scotland and Wales as specific case studies. Methods A 10-year Markov model, incorporating a 6-week acute phase and a maintenance phase across three health states (discontinuation, relapse, death) was constructed. Six-week probabilities of discontinuation and adverse events were based on a published independent mixed-treatment comparison; long-term risks of relapse and discontinuation were from an indirect comparison. Costs included drug therapy, relapse, and outpatient, primary and residential care. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5 %. Utility estimates were taken from published literature, and cost effectiveness was expressed as total 10-year incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results Lurasidone yielded a cost saving of 3383 pound and an improvement of 0.005 QALYs versus aripiprazole, in Scotland. Deterministic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that results were sensitive to relapse rates, while probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that lurasidone had the highest expected net benefit at willingness-to-pay thresholds of 20,000-30,000 pound per QALY. The probability that lurasidone was a cost-effective treatment strategy was approximately 75 % at all willingness-to-pay thresholds, with similar results being obtained for the Welsh analysis. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that lurasidone would provide an effective, cost-saving alternative for the healthcare service in the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia.","[Rajagopalan, Krithika; Loebel, Antony] Sunovion Pharmaceut Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 84 Waterford Dr, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA; [Trueman, David; Crowe, Lydia; Squirrell, Daniel] DRG Abacus, Bicester, Oxon, England",Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Company; Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.,"Rajagopalan, K (通讯作者)，Sunovion Pharmaceut Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 84 Waterford Dr, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA.",Krithika.Rajagopalan@sunovion.com,,"Rajagopalan, Krithika/0000-0002-4878-0822; Trueman, David/0000-0002-7886-6467","Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This research was funded by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,62,8,9,3,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2016,34,7,,,,,709,721,,10.1007/s40273-016-0405-0,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DO7CT,27067724.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377940500009,0

A notion of multidimensional g-expectation is proposed to provide a multidimensional version of nonlinear expectations. By a technical result on explicit expressions for the comparison theorem, uniqueness theorem, and viability on a rectangle of solutions to multidimensional backward stochastic differential equations, some necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the constancy, monotonicity, positivity, and translatability properties of multidimensional conditional g-expectations and multidimensional dynamic risk measures; we prove that a multidimensional dynamic g-risk measure is nonincreasingly convex if and only if the generator g satisfies a quasi-monotone increasingly convex condition. A general dual representation is given for the multidimensional dynamic convex g-risk measure in which the penalty term is expressed more precisely. It is shown that model uncertainty leads to the convexity of risk measures. As to applications, we show how this multidimensional approach can be applied to measure the insolvency risk of a firm with interacting subsidiaries; optimal risk sharing for -tolerant g-risk measures, and risk contribution for coherent g-risk measures are investigated. Insurance g-risk measure and other ways to induce g-risk measures are also studied at the end of the paper.","[Xu, Yuhong] Soochow Univ, Math Ctr Interdiscipline Res, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuhong] Soochow Univ, Sch Math Sci, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuhong] Univ Brest, Brest, France; [Xu, Yuhong] Shandong Univ, Jinan, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China; Soochow University - China; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Shandong University,"Xu, YH (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Sch Math Sci, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China.",yuhong.xu@hotmail.com,"Xu, Yuhong/GLR-7748-2022","Xu, Yuhong/0000-0003-0521-2646","Soochow University, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Financial Information Technology (SUFE); Project 111 [B12023]; collaborative innovation center for quantitative calculation and control of financial risk; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2007CB814900]","Soochow University, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Financial Information Technology (SUFE); Project 111(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); collaborative innovation center for quantitative calculation and control of financial risk; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China)","This work is partially supported by scientific research fund of Soochow University, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Financial Information Technology (SUFE), Project 111 (No. B12023), the collaborative innovation center for quantitative calculation and control of financial risk and the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (No. 2007CB814900) (Financial Risk).

However, classic panel data models for claim counts, such as the multivariate negative binomial distribution, do not put any time weight on past claims. More complex models can be used to consider this property, but often need numerical procedures to estimate parameters. When we want to add a dependence between different claim count types, the task would be even more difficult to handle. In this paper, we propose a bivariate dynamic model for claim counts, where past claims experience of a given claim type is used to better predict the other type of claims. This new bivariate dynamic distribution for claim counts is based on random effects that come from the Sarmanov family of multivariate distributions. To obtain a proper dynamic distribution based on this kind of bivariate priors, an approximation of the posterior distribution of the random effects is proposed. The resulting model can be seen as an extension of the dynamic heterogeneity model described in Bolance et al. (2007). We apply this model to two samples of data from a major Canadian insurance company, where we show that the proposed model is one of the best models to adjust the data. We also show that the proposed model allows more flexibility in computing predictive premiums because closed-form expressions can be easily derived for the predictive distribution, the moments and the predictive moments.

Our method relies on the method of importance sampling and on a linear Gaussian approximating model from which the latent process can be simulated. Given the presence of a latent long-memory process, we require a modification of the importance sampling technique. In particular, the long-memory process needs to be approximated by a finite dynamic linear process. Two possible approximations are discussed and are compared with each other. We show that an autoregression obtained from minimizing mean squared prediction errors leads to an effective and feasible method. In our empirical study, we analyze ten daily log-return series from the S&P 500 stock index by univariate and multivariate long-memory stochastic volatility models. We compare the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of a number of models within the class of long-memory stochastic volatility models.","[Mesters, G.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Mesters, G.] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Mesters, G.] Netherlands Inst Study Crime & Law Enforcement, Groningen, Netherlands; [Koopman, S.

These procedures have been developed with the purpose of attenuating size distortions and power deficiencies present for the uncorrected F-test. We develop a general theory to establish positive as well as negative finite-sample results concerning the size and power properties of a large class of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust tests. Using these results we show that nonparametrically as well as parametrically corrected F-type tests in time series regression models with stationary disturbances have either size equal to one or nuisance-infimal power equal to zero under very weak assumptions on the covariance model and under generic conditions on the design matrix. In addition we suggest an adjustment procedure based on artificial regressors. This adjustment resolves the problem in many cases in that the so-adjusted tests do not suffer from size distortions. At the same time their power function is bounded away from zero. As a second application we discuss the case of heteroskedastic disturbances.","[Preinerstorfer, David; Poetscher, Benedikt M.] Univ Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Pötscher, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Stat, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",benedikt.poetscher@univie.ac.at,,,Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 27398] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,62,14,15,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We compare our proposal with the standard Beveridge Nelson decomposition, for which the forecast function is obtained by iterating the one-step-ahead predictions via the chain rule. We illustrate that the multistep Beveridge-Nelson trend is more efficient than the standard one in the presence of model misspecification, and we subsequently assess the predictive validity of the extracted transitory component with respect to future growth.","[Proietti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Proietti, Tommaso] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Rome Tor Vergata; CREATES,"Proietti, T (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",tommaso.proietti@uniroma2.it,,"Proietti, Tommaso/0000-0001-5285-7522","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN [prot. 2010J3LZEN]; Danish National Research Foundation","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","Financial support by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), PRIN Research Project 2010-2011-prot. 2010J3LZEN, Forecasting economic and financial time series: understanding the complexity and modelling structural change, and from CREATES Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78), funded by the Danish National Research Foundation, is gratefully acknowledged.",,36,2,2,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Hope and fear are modeled through an inverse-S shaped probability weighting function and aspirations through a probabilistic constraint. By employing the recently developed approach of quantile formulation, we solve the portfolio choice problem both thoroughly and analytically. These solutions motivate us to introduce a fear index, a hope index, and a lottery-likeness index to quantify the impacts of three emotions, respectively, on investment behavior. We find that a sufficiently high level of fear endogenously necessitates portfolio insurance. On the other hand, hope is reflected in the agent's perspective on good states of the world: a higher level of hope causes the agent to include more scenarios under the notion of good states and leads to greater payoffs in sufficiently good states. Finally, an exceedingly high level of aspirations results in the construction of a lottery-type payoff, indicating that the agent needs to enter into a pure gamble in order to achieve his goal. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our findings.","[He, Xue Dong] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xun Yu] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Columbia University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Oxford,"He, XD (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, IEOR, SW Mudd Bldg,Room 316,500 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",xh2140@columbia.edu,,,Columbia University; University of Oxford; Nomura Centre for Mathematical Finance; Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; GRF [CUHK419511],Columbia University; University of Oxford; Nomura Centre for Mathematical Finance; Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; GRF,"We are grateful for comments from seminar and conference participants at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Columbia University, Tongji University, the University of St. Gallen, Risk and Stochastics Day 2010 at the London School of Economics and Political Science, the 2010 Workshop on Stochastics, Control and Finance at Imperial College, the Sixth World Congress of the Bachelier Finance Society in Toronto, the Sixth Oxford-Princeton Workshop on Mathematical Finance at the University of Oxford, the 2011 SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications in Baltimore, the 2011 Workshop of the Sino-French Summer School in Stochastic Modeling and Applications in Beijing, the 2011 HKU-HKUST-Stanford Conference in Quantitative Finance in Hong Kong, the Seventh World Congress of the Bachelier Finance Society in Sydney, the St. Gallen Workshop in Quantitative Behavioral Finance, the First Asian Quantitative Finance Conference in Singapore, and the Twelfth Winter School on Mathematical Finance in Lunteren.

Methodological guidelines for health economic evaluations used by EUnetHTA partners were collected through a survey. Information from each guideline was extracted using a pre-tested extraction template. On the basis of the extracted information, a summary describing the methods used by the EUnetHTA countries was written for each methodological item. General recommendations were formulated for methodological issues where the guidelines of the EUnetHTA partners were in agreement or where the usefulness of economic evaluations may be increased by presenting the results in a specific way. At least one contact person from all 33 EUnetHTA countries (100 %) responded to the survey. In total, the review included 51 guidelines, representing 25 countries (eight countries had no methodological guideline for health economic evaluations). On the basis of the results of the extracted information from all 51 guidelines, EUnetHTA issued ten main recommendations for health economic evaluations. The presented review of methodological guidelines for health economic evaluations and the consequent recommendations will hopefully improve the comparability, transferability and overall usefulness of economic evaluations performed within EUnetHTA. Nevertheless, there are still methodological issues that need to be investigated further.","[Heintz, Emelie; Davidson, Thomas] Swedish Agcy Hlth Technol Assessment & Assessment, SE-10359 Stockholm, Sweden; [Heintz, Emelie; Davidson, Thomas] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Med Technol Assessment CMT, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Gerber-Grote, Andreas] Inst Qualitat & Wirtschaftlichkeit Gesundheitswes, Cologne, Germany; [Ghabri, Salah; Hamers, Francoise F.] Haute Autorite Sante, Dept Econ & Publ Hlth Evaluat, St Denis, France; [Rupel, Valentina Prevolnik; Slabe-Erker, Renata] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia",Linkoping University,"Heintz, E (通讯作者)，Swedish Agcy Hlth Technol Assessment & Assessment, Box 3657, SE-10359 Stockholm, Sweden.",emelie.heintz@sbu.se; andreas.gerber-grote@iqwig.de,"Heintz, Emelie/GYD-4031-2022","Heintz, Emelie/0000-0002-0715-7591; Slabe-Erker, Renata/0000-0003-2566-9563",,,,,54,58,61,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2016,34,1,,,,,59,76,,10.1007/s40273-015-0328-1,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DA9XL,26446858.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368163000007,0

The purpose of this paper is to complement the analysis of Ramsay and Oguledo by considering production costs which are proportional to the number of policies offered by an insurer. In addition to the result of Ramsay and Oguledo we show that the group of individuals who obtain insurance is partitioned into several subgroups, where each subgroup is offered the same insurance policy. To derive this result we introduce the concept of incentive compatibility which ensures that an individual has no incentive to buy another policy. Assuming that individuals have loss averse utility, we fully characterize the boundaries of these subgroups as the result of an undercutting process in premiums between the insurers.

For the cointegration and copula methods, we design a computationally efficient two-step pairs trading strategy. In terms of economic outcomes, the distance, cointegration and copula methods show a mean monthly excess return of 91, 85 and 43 bps (38, 33 and 5 bps) before transaction costs (after transaction costs), respectively. In terms of continued profitability, from 2009, the frequency of trading opportunities via the distance and cointegration methods is reduced considerably, whereas this frequency remains stable for the copula method. Further, the copula method shows better performance for its unconverged trades compared to those of the other methods. While the liquidity factor is negatively correlated to all strategies' returns, we find no evidence of their correlation to market excess returns. All strategies show positive and significant alphas after accounting for various risk-factors. We also find that in addition to all strategies performing better during periods of significant volatility, the cointegration method is the superior strategy during turbulent market conditions.","[Rad, Hossein; Low, Rand Kwong Yew; Faff, Robert] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Low, Rand Kwong Yew] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",University of Queensland; New York University,"Low, RKY (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;Low, RKY (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA.",r.low@business.uq.edu.au,"Low, Rand/AAQ-1677-2020; Simbolon, Parlindungan/AAV-3622-2020; Low, Rand/ABE-6670-2020; Faff, Robert/G-1654-2014","Simbolon, Parlindungan/0000-0003-2071-6295; Low, Rand/0000-0002-0290-7840; Faff, Robert/0000-0001-6867-9599",Australia Awards-Endeavour Research Fellowship; Australian Institute for Business and Economics (AIBE); Accounting & Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand (AFAANZ); UQ Postdoctoral Research Grant 'Portfolio optimization and risk management techniques for financial crisis',"Australia Awards-Endeavour Research Fellowship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Institute for Business and Economics (AIBE); Accounting & Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand (AFAANZ); UQ Postdoctoral Research Grant 'Portfolio optimization and risk management techniques for financial crisis'","The authors acknowledge funding from the (1) Australia Awards-Endeavour Research Fellowship (2) Australian Institute for Business and Economics (AIBE) in support of Dr Rand K.

This closed-form solution is based on a new stochastic process, called the J-process, which is an extension of the Wiener process satisfying the martingale property. The J-process is based on a new statistical law called the J-law, which is an extension of the normal law. The J-law relies on four parameters in its general form. It has interesting asymmetry and tail properties, allowing it to fit the reality of financial markets with good accuracy, which is not the case for the normal law. Despite the use of one state variable, we find results similar to those of Heston dealing with the bi-dimensional stochastic volatility problem for pricing European calls. Inverting the BS formula, we plot the smile curve related to this closed-form solution. The J-model can also serve to determine the implied volatility by inverting the J-formula and can be used to price other kinds of options such as American options.","[Jerbi, Yacin] Sfax Univ, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Sfax, Sfax 3018, Tunisia",Universite de Gafsa; Universite de Sfax,"Jerbi, Y (通讯作者)，Sfax Univ, Fac Sci Econ & Gest Sfax, BP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",yacin.jerbi@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,6,6,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

These issues should be reflected in the design of health economic models. This article considers three important aspects of time in modelling: (1) which cohorts to simulate and how far into the future to extend the analysis; (2) the simulation of time, including the difference between discrete-time and continuous-time models, cycle lengths, and converting rates and probabilities; and (3) discounting future costs and effects to their present values. We provide a methodological overview of these issues and make recommendations to help inform both the conduct of cost-effectiveness analyses and the interpretation of their results. For choosing which cohorts to simulate and how many, we suggest analysts carefully assess potential reasons for variation in cost effectiveness between cohorts and the feasibility of subgroup-specific recommendations. For the simulation of time, we recommend using short cycles or continuous-time models to avoid biases and the need for half-cycle corrections, and provide advice on the correct conversion of transition probabilities in state transition models. Finally, for discounting, analysts should not only follow current guidance and report how discounting was conducted, especially in the case of differential discounting, but also seek to develop an understanding of its rationale. Our overall recommendations are that analysts explicitly state and justify their modelling choices regarding time and consider how alternative choices may impact on results.","[O'Mahony, James F.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland; [Newall, Anthony T.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [van Rosmalen, Joost] Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Trinity College Dublin; University of New South Wales Sydney; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"van Rosmalen, J (通讯作者)，Erasmus MC, Dept Biostat, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",jfomahon@tcd.ie; a.newall@unsw.edu.au; j.vanrosmalen@erasmusmc.nl,,"O'Mahony, James/0000-0003-3414-7388; Newall, Anthony/0000-0003-0836-1065; van Rosmalen, Joost/0000-0002-9187-244X",Health Research Board of Ireland under the CERVIVA II inter-disciplinary enhancement grant,Health Research Board of Ireland under the CERVIVA II inter-disciplinary enhancement grant,"The authors would like to thank Dr. Josephine Reyes and Dr. James Wood of The University of New South Wales for their useful comments.

A test statistic based on the least squares estimate has good first-order asymptotic properties, but these may not be relevant in small-or moderate-sized samples, especially as (depending on properties of the spatial weight matrix) the usual parametric rate of convergence may not be attained. We thus develop tests with more accurate size properties, by means of Edgeworth expansions and the bootstrap. Although the least squares estimate is inconsistent for the correlation parameter, we show that under quite general conditions its probability limit has the correct sign, and that least squares testing is consistent; we also establish asymptotic local power properties.

We define and study a nested factor model', where the linear factors part is standard, but where the log-volatility of the linear factors and of the residuals are themselves endowed with a factor structure and residuals. We propose a calibration procedure to estimate these log-vol factors and the residuals. We find that whereas the number of relevant linear factors is relatively large (10 or more), only two or three log-vol factors emerge in our analysis of the data. In fact, a minimal model where only one log-vol factor is considered is already very satisfactory, as it accurately reproduces the properties of bivariate copulas, in particular, the dependence of the medial point on the linear correlation coefficient, as reported in Chicheportiche and Bouchaud [Int. J. Theor. Appl. Finance, 2012, 15].

In this paper, we extend the true martingale algorithm' proposed by Belomestny et al. [Math. Finance, 2009, 19, 53-71] for the pure-diffusion models to the jump-diffusion models, to fast compute true tight upper bounds on the Bermudan option price in a non-nested simulation manner. By exploiting the martingale representation theorem on the optimal dual martingale driven by jump-diffusion processes, we are able to explore the unique structure of the optimal dual martingale and construct an approximation that preserves the martingale property. The resulting upper bound estimator avoids the nested Monte Carlo simulation suffered by the original primal-dual algorithm, therefore significantly improving the computational efficiency. Theoretical analysis is provided to guarantee the quality of the martingale approximation. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency of our algorithm.","[Zhu, Helin; Ye, Fan; Zhou, Enlu] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Zhou, EL (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",enlu.zhou@isye.gatech.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CMMI-1413790]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA-9550-14-1-0059],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number CMMI-1413790]; the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [grant number FA-9550-14-1-0059].,,39,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The model remains tractable and amenable to empirical analysis because of stochastic shocks to commuting decisions, which yield a gravity equation for commuting flows. To structurally estimate agglomeration and dispersion forces, we use data on thousands of city blocks in Berlin for 1936, 1986, and 2006 and exogenous variation from the city's division and reunification. We estimate substantial and highly localized production and residential externalities. We show that the model with the estimated agglomeration parameters can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure. We show how our quantitative framework can be used to undertake counterfactuals for changes in the organization of economic activity within cities in response, for example, to changes in the transport network.","[Ahlfeldt, Gabriel M.] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ahlfeldt, Gabriel M.; Redding, Stephen J.; Sturm, Daniel M.; Wolf, Nikolaus] CEPR, London, England; [Redding, Stephen J.] Princeton Univ, WWS, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Redding, Stephen J.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Redding, Stephen J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sturm, Daniel M.] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Wolf, Nikolaus] Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Ahlfeldt, GM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Ahlfeldt, GM; Redding, SJ; Sturm, DM; Wolf, N (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Redding, SJ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, WWS, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;Redding, SJ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;Redding, SJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Sturm, DM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Wolf, N (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",g.ahlfeldt@lse.ac.uk; reddings@princeton.edu; d.m.sturm@lse.ac.uk; nikolaus.wolf@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,"Ahlfeldt, Gabriel/0000-0001-5664-3230; Sturm, Daniel/0000-0001-6408-8089; Wolf, Nikolaus/0000-0002-7461-2910","European Research Council [263733]; German Science Foundation [STU 477/1-1, WO 1429/1-1]; Centre for Economic Performance; Princeton University; ESRC [ES/M010341/1, ES/H02123X/1, ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1, ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; European Research Council (ERC) [263733] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Centre for Economic Performance; Princeton University(Princeton University); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to the European Research Council (Grant 263733), German Science Foundation (Grants STU 477/1-1 and WO 1429/1-1), the Centre for Economic Performance, and Princeton University for financial support.

The coefficient of tail dependence was proposed by Ledford and Tawn (1996, 1997) to distinguish asymptotic independence and asymptotic dependence. Recently a new measure based on the conditional Kendall's tau was proposed by Asimit et al. (2015) to measure the tail dependence and to distinguish asymptotic independence and asymptotic dependence. For effectively constructing a confidence interval for this new measure, this paper proposes a smooth jackknife empirical likelihood method, which does not need to estimate any additional quantities such as asymptotic variance. A simulation study shows that the proposed method has a good finite sample performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The HF trader maximizes expected terminal wealth and is constrained by both capital and the amount of inventory that she can hold at any time. The risk metrics enable the HF trader to fine tune her strategies by trading off different metrics of inventory risk, which also proxy for capital risk, against expected profits. The dynamics of the midprice of the asset are driven by information flows which are impounded in the midprice by market participants who update their quotes in the limit order book. Furthermore, the midprice also exhibits stochastic jumps as a consequence of the arrival of market orders that have an impact on prices which can give rise to market momentum (expected prices to trend up or down). The HF trader's optimal strategy incorporates a buffer to cover adverse selection costs and manages inventories to maximize the expected gains from market momentum.","[Cartea, Alvaro] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Jaimungal, Sebastian] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of London; University College London; University of Toronto,"Jaimungal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",sebastian.jaimungal@utoronto.ca,,"Jaimungal, Sebastian/0000-0002-0193-0993; Cartea, Alvaro/0000-0002-7426-4645",NSERC; Mprime,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Mprime,"The authors would like to thank Rob Almgren, Tomasz Bielecki, Adrien De Larrard, Jason Ricci, and participants at the SIAM Conference on Financial Mathematics and Engineering 2012, Young Researchers Workshop on Finance Tokyo 2012, and Universidad Carlos III, Madrid.

Our contribution is to evaluate demand for these products which provide access to equity investments with money-back guarantees, longevity risk hedging, and partially-refundable premiums, in a realistic world with uncertain labor and capital market income as well as mortality risk. Others have predicted that consumers will only purchase such annuities late in life, but we show that they will optimally purchase GMWBs prior to retirement, consistent with their recent rapid uptick in sales. Additionally, many individuals optimally adjust their portfolios and consumption streams along the way by taking cash withdrawals from the products. These products can substantially enhance consumption, by up to 10% for those who experience highly unfavorable experiences in the stock market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our approximant of Gerber-Shiu functions under Levy subordinator model has O(n) computational complexity in comparison with that of O(n log n) via the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Also, for Gerber-Shiu functions within our proposed refined Sobolev space, we introduce an explicit error bound, which seems to be absent from the literature.

We present a simple, alternative approach to the dual representation of convex risk measures by directly applying to the acceptance set the external characterization of closed, convex sets. We prove that risk measures are nondegenerate if and only if the pricing functional admits a positive extension which is a supporting functional for the underlying acceptance set, and provide a characterization of when such extensions exist.

To introduce clustering in equity returns, the reference index is modelled by a diffusion combined with a bivariate self-excited jump process. We infer a semi-closed form or parametric expression of the moment generating functions in this framework for the equity return and the intensities of jumps. An econometric procedure is proposed to fit the model to a time series. Next, we develop a method, based on a normal inverse Gaussian approximation of the index return, to evaluate options embedded in simple variable annuities. To conclude, we compare prices, one-year value at risks, and tail value at risks of simple EIAs, computed with different models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As this risk measure has to be estimated from historical data, it is important to be able to verify and compare competing estimation procedures. In statistical decision theory, risk measures for which such verification and comparison is possible, are called elicitable. It is known that quantile-based risk measures such as value at risk are elicitable. In this paper, the existing result of the nonelicitability of expected shortfall is extended to all law-invariant spectral risk measures unless they reduce to minus the expected value. Hence, it is unclear how to perform forecast verification or comparison. However, the class of elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measures does not reduce to minus the expected value.

In the fixed design case these nonparametric sample covariances have different uniform asymptotic rates depending on direction, a result that differs fundamentally from the random design and stationary cases. The uniform asymptotic rates derived exceed the corresponding rates in the stationary case and confirm the existence of uniform super-consistency. The modelling framework and convergence rates allow for endogeneity and thus broaden the practical econometric import of these results. As a specific application, we establish uniform consistency of nonparametric kernel estimators of the coefficient functions in nonlinear cointegration models with time varying coefficients or functional coefficients, and provide sharp convergence rates. For the fixed design models, in particular, there are two uniform convergence rates that apply in two different directions, both rates exceeding the usual rate in the stationary case.","[Li, Degui] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Phillips, Peter C.

The theory mentioned that the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) could be used to estimate the limiting distribution of the excess value over a certain threshold; thus the tail behaviors are analyzed. However, the central behavior is important because it may affect the estimation of model parameters in GPD, and the evaluation of catastrophic insurance premiums also depends on the central behavior. This paper proposes four mixture models to model earthquake catastrophic loss and proposes Bayesian approaches to estimate the unknown parameters and the threshold in these mixture models. MCMC methods are used to calculate the Bayesian estimates of model parameters, and deviance information criterion values are obtained for model comparison. The earthquake loss of Yunnan province is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. Results show that the estimation of the threshold and the shape and scale of GPD are quite different. Value-at-risk and expected shortfall for the proposed mixture models are calculated under different confidence levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our method allows for the treatment of the general case of the prediction error of the loss development result between two arbitrary future horizons. In the well-known special cases considered previously by Mack (1993) and Merz and Wuthrich (2008), our estimators coincide with theirs. However, the algebraic form in which we cast them is new, considerably more compact and more intuitive to understand. For example, in the classical case treated by Mack (1993), we show that the mean squared prediction error divided by the squared estimated ultimate loss can be written as Sigma(j)(u) over cap (2)(j)(q) over cap (j), where (u) over cap (j) measures the (relative) uncertainty around the jth development factor and (q) over cap (j) the proportion of the estimated ultimate loss that it affects. The error propagation method also provides a natural split into process error and parameter error. Our proofs identify and exploit symmetries of chain ladder processes in a novel way. For the sake of wider practical applicability of the formulae derived, we allow for incomplete historical data and the exclusion of outliers in the triangles.","[Rohr, Ancus] Helvetia Insurance Switzerland, St Alban Anlage 26, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",,"Röhr, A (通讯作者)，Helvetia Insurance Switzerland, St Alban Anlage 26, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",ancus.roehr@helvetia.ch,,,,,,,13,11,11,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2016,46,2,,,,,293,330,,10.1017/asb.2016.9,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DR3GC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379789600004,0

We aimed to create a practical tool providing model users with a structured view into the validation status of HE decision models, to address this trade-off. A Delphi panel was organized, and was completed by a workshop during an international conference. The proposed tool was constructed iteratively based on comments from, and the discussion amongst, panellists. During the Delphi process, comments were solicited on the importance and feasibility of possible validation techniques for modellers, their relevance for decision makers, and the overall structure and formulation in the tool. The panel consisted of 47 experts in HE modelling and HE decision making from various professional and international backgrounds. In addition, 50 discussants actively engaged in the discussion at the conference workshop and returned 19 questionnaires with additional comments. The final version consists of 13 items covering all relevant aspects of HE decision models: the conceptual model, the input data, the implemented software program, and the model outcomes. Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE) is a validation-assessment tool in which model developers report in a systematic way both on validation efforts performed and on their outcomes. Subsequently, model users can establish whether confidence in the model is justified or whether additional validation efforts should be undertaken. In this way, AdViSHE enhances transparency of the validation status of HE models and supports efficient model validation.","[Vemer, P.; Feenstra, T.

We show that for a temporally dependent factor, the standard within groups (WG) estimator is inconsistent even as both N and T tend to infinity. Next we investigate the properties of the common correlated effects pooled (CCEP) estimator of Pesaran (2006) which eliminates the error cross-sectional dependence using cross-sectional averages of the data. In contrast to the static case, the CCEP estimator is only consistent when next to N also T tends to infinity. It is shown that for the most relevant parameter settings, the inconsistency of the CCEP estimator is larger than that of the infeasible WG estimator, which includes the common factors as regressors. Restricting the CCEP estimator results in a somewhat smaller inconsistency. The small sample properties of the various estimators are analyzed using Monte Carlo experiments. The simulation results suggest that the CCEP estimator can be used to estimate dynamic panel data models provided T is not too small. The size of N is of less importance.","[Everaert, Gerdie; De Groote, Tom] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Everaert, G (通讯作者)，Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",gerdie.everaert@UJGent.be,,,,,,,21,63,62,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Portfolios constructed using the risk parity approach are a compromise between two well-known diversification techniques: minimum variance optimization and the equal weighting approach. In this paper, we discuss the problem of finding portfolios that satisfy risk parity over either individual assets or groups of assets. We describe the set of all risk parity solutions by using convex optimization techniques over orthants and we show that this set may contain an exponential number of solutions. We then propose an alternative non-convex least-squares model whose set of optimal solutions includes all risk parity solutions, and propose a modified formulation which aims at selecting the most desirable risk parity solution according to a given criterion. When general bounds are considered, a risk parity solution may not exist. In this case, the non-convex least-squares model seeks a feasible portfolio which is as close to risk parity as possible. Furthermore, we propose an alternating linearization framework to solve this non-convex model. Numerical experiments indicate the effectiveness of our technique in terms of both speed and accuracy.","[Bai, Xi; Scheinberg, Katya] Lehigh Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 200 West Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Tutuncu, Reha] Goldman Sachs Asset Management, New York, NY USA",Lehigh University,"Bai, X (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 200 West Packer Ave, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",xib210@lehigh.edu,,,NSF [DMS 10-16571]; AFOSR [FA9550-11-1-0239]; DARPA [FA 9550-12-1-0406],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AFOSR(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),This work was supported in part by NSF [grant number DMS 10-16571]; AFOSR [grant number FA9550-11-1-0239]; and DARPA [grant number FA 9550-12-1-0406] negotiated by AFOSR.,,9,48,56,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Aim The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation conforming to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DXL + ASC versus ASC from the perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS). Methods Cost-utility analyses were conducted using trial data. Utility values were captured using the EQ-5D completed by patients at 3- and 6-weekly intervals, while resource use was captured using nurse-completed report forms and patient reports. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and the main outcome was cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture sampling uncertainty and to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The analysis horizon was the trial period (median follow-up 12 months) and no modelling or discounting of future costs and benefits was conducted. Results Average costs were A 9352 pound and A 6218 pound for DXL + ASC and ASC, respectively, and average QALYs were 0.302 and 0.186, respectively. This yielded an ICER of A 27,180 pound for DXL + ASC. DXL + ASC had a 24 % chance of being cost effective at a A 20,000 pound QALY threshold (lambda) and a mean net monetary benefit of -A 821; pound this rose to 59 % and A 332 pound when the threshold was raised to A 30,000 pound. If NICE end-of-life criteria are applied, the probability of cost effectiveness increases to 90 % (at lambda = A 50,000) pound. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Conclusions DXL + ASC is likely to be cost effective if an end-of-life premium is applied. Further research should determine the impact of different utility measurement strategies and different chemotherapy delivery modes on estimates of cost effectiveness.","[Meads, David M.; Hulme, Claire T.] Univ Leeds, Sch Med, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England; [Marshall, Andrea; Dunn, Janet A.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Ford, Hugo E.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a summary of the manufacturer's submission of ipilimumab, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA319, issued in July 2014. Ipilimumab at a recommended dose of 3 mg/kg monotherapy was previously granted marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency in adult patients who had received prior therapy and was recommended by NICE in guidance TA268. In October 2013, the EMA approved the extension of this indication to previously untreated advanced melanoma patients. NICE decisions are bound by the marketing authorisation; therefore, the decision problem faced by the NICE Appraisal Committee was whether ipilimumab at a recommended dose of 3 mg/kg monotherapy was effective and cost effective compared with first-line standard of care involving dacarbazine (DTIC) and vemurafenib (for BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients). The CA184-024 trial was the primary source of clinical evidence for ipilimumab. However, this was based on a dose of 10 mg/kg with concomitant DTIC. The results over a 5-year period indicated that ipilimumab 10 mg/kg plus DTIC demonstrated a significant increase in median overall survival (OS) of 2.1 months compared with DTIC plus placebo (11.2 vs. 9.1 months). The BRIM-3 trial, which was an open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) in BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients, was the primary source of evidence for an indirect comparison with vemurafenib. The results showed that vemurafenib increased median OS by 3.6 months compared with DTIC (13.2 vs. 9.6 months). The economic evaluation compared the costs and outcomes of ipilimumab by assuming that the 3 mg/kg dosing regimen was clinically equivalent in efficacy to an ipilimumab 10 mg/kg dosing regimen plus DTIC and by using a treatment sequencing approach that incorporated second-line active therapy and third-line best supportive care (BSC). In the first appraisal meeting, the committee recommended ipilimumab only in the context of research as part of a clinical study. This was primarily based on the lack of robust evidence to support the assumption of clinical equivalence between dosages and the absence of evidence available to inform the sequential use of treatments. Following the consultation, the manufacturer submitted additional analyses and evidence to support the cost effectiveness of ipilimumab at first line. The manufacturer's response was based on concerns relating to uncertainty surrounding the relative efficacy of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy compared with DTIC and vemurafenib, comparability of the patient populations at first and second line, and the effects of concomitant DTIC. These additional analyses indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was A 47,900 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ipilimumab compared with DTIC and A 28,600 pound per QALY gained for ipilimumab compared with vemurafenib. Following consideration of the additional evidence and the responses from a large number of consultees and commentators, the committee recommended ipilimumab as an option for adults with previously untreated advanced melanoma.","[Giannopoulou, Christina; Sideris, Eleftherios; McKenna, Claire] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Wade, Ros; Moe-Byrne, Thirimon; Eastwood, Alison] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"McKenna, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",claire.mckenna@york.ac.uk,"Moe-Byrne, Thirimon/AAY-8744-2021; Wade, Rosalind Fay/AAB-5808-2019; Wade, Ros/AAB-7268-2019","Wade, Rosalind Fay/0000-0002-8666-8110; Byrne, Thirimon Moe/0000-0002-2827-9715",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme [08/210],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 08/210).,,21,11,11,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2015,33,12,,,,,1269,1279,,10.1007/s40273-015-0299-2,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CX5BW,26043718.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365717000004,0

Traditionally, MAUIs have been developed and applied in adult populations. However, increasingly, researchers in health economics and other disciplines are recognising the importance of the measurement and valuation of health in both children and adolescents. Presently, there are nine generic MAUIs available internationally that have been used in paediatric populations: the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), the Health Utility Index Mark 2 (HUI2), the HUI3, the Sixteen-dimensional measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (16D), the Seventeen-dimensional measure of HRQoL (17D), the Assessment of Quality of Life 6-Dimension (AQoL-6D) Adolescent, the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), the EQ-5D Youth version (EQ-5D-Y) and the Adolescent Health Utility Measure (AHUM). This paper critically reviews the development and application of the above nine MAUIs and discusses the specific challenges of health utility measurement in children and adolescents. Areas for further research relating to the development and application of generic MAUIs in paediatric populations are highlighted.","[Chen, Gang] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Clin Effectiveness, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Flinders University South Australia,"Ratcliffe, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Clin Effectiveness, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia.",gang.chen@flinders.edu.au; julie.ratcliffe@flinders.edu.au,"Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [1021899],Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"We would like to thank Dr. Katherine Stevens, ScHARR, University of Sheffield, delegates from the 36th Australian Health Economics Society Conference, Adelaide 2014 and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

Specifically, we consider local average responses and average partial effects and test whether these effects are identical across different levels of treatment, including testing whether they are zero for all treatment levels as a special case. Our tests are based on consistent procedures of Bierens (1982, Journal of Econometrics 20, 105-134; 1990, Econometrica 58, 1443-1458) and Stinchcombe and White (1998, Econometric Theory 14, 295-324). The tests are easy to implement and achieve n(-1/2) local power. Monte Carlo simulations show that the tests perform well in finite samples. We apply our tests to study the interest rate elasticities of loan demand in microfinance. We also extend our testing procedures to covariate-conditioned average effects and marginal effects.","[Lu, Xun] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [White, Halbert] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Lu, X (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xunlu@ust.hk,,,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [DAG11BM09],Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Lu acknowledges the support from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under grant number DAG11BM09.,,48,1,2,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The insurer can transfer part of the risk to a reinsurer via proportional reinsurance or acquire new business. Moreover, stochastic interest rate and inflation risks are taken into account. To reduce the two kinds of risks, not only a risk-free asset and a risky asset, but also a zero-coupon bond and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are available to invest in for the insurer. Applying stochastic control theory, we provide and prove a verification theorem and establish the corresponding extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By solving the extended HJB equation, we derive the time-consistent reinsurance-investment strategy as well as the corresponding value function for the mean-variance problem, explicitly. Furthermore, we formulate a precommitment mean-variance problem and obtain the corresponding time-inconsistent strategy to compare with the time-consistent strategy. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effects of model parameters on the time-consistent strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

EQ-5D and SF-6D are commonly used to value outcomes in chronic conditions with episodic symptoms, such as heavy menstrual bleeding (clinically termed menorrhagia). Because of their narrow-health focus and the condition's periodic nature these measures may be unsuitable. A viable alternative measure is willingness to pay (WTP) from the welfarist framework. We explore the use of WTP in a preliminary cost-benefit analysis comparing pharmaceutical treatments for menorrhagia. A cost-benefit analysis was carried out based on an outcome of WTP. The analysis is based in the UK primary care setting over a 24-month time period, with a partial societal perspective. Ninety-nine women completed a WTP exercise from the ex-ante (pre-treatment/condition) perspective. Maximum average WTP values were elicited for two pharmaceutical treatments, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and oral treatment. Cost data were offset against WTP and the net present value derived for treatment. Qualitative information explaining the WTP values was also collected. Oral treatment was indicated to be the most cost-beneficial intervention costing A 107 pound less than LNG-IUS and generating A 7 pound more benefits. The mean incremental net present value for oral treatment compared with LNG-IUS was A 113 pound. The use of the WTP approach was acceptable as very few protests and non-responses were observed. The preliminary cost-benefit analysis results recommend oral treatment as the first-line treatment for menorrhagia. The WTP approach is a feasible alternative to the conventional EQ-5D/SF-6D approaches and offers advantages by capturing benefits beyond health, which is particularly relevant in menorrhagia.","[Sanghera, Sabina; Frew, Emma; Roberts, Tracy Elizabeth] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Gupta, Janesh Kumar] Univ Birmingham, Sch Clin & Expt Med, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Kai, Joe] Univ Nottingham, Div Primary Care, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kai, Joe] Univ Nottingham, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Frew, E (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",E.Frew@bham.ac.uk,"Frew, Emma/AAO-5141-2021; Roberts, Tracy/AAO-4610-2021","Frew, Emma/0000-0002-5462-1158; Roberts, Tracy/0000-0002-0624-0537; Kai, Joe/0000-0001-9040-9384; Sanghera, Sabina/0000-0001-8387-3103",National Institute for Health Research [02/06/02]; National Institute for Health Research [02/06/02] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"We thank the women who participated in the study and the National Institute for Health Research for funding the research (Grant No: 02/06/02).

The main feature of the proposal is that the bandwidth used to estimate the infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter is chosen by minimizing the mean squared error of the fitted semiparametric model. We formally justify data-driven inference. We introduce the concept of asymptotic normality, uniform in the bandwidth, and show that the proposed estimator achieves this property for a wide range of bandwidths. The method of proof is different from that in Powell (2001) and permits straightforward extensions to other semiparametric or even fully nonparametric specifications of the selection equation. The results of a small Monte Carlo suggest that our estimator has excellent finite sample performance, comparing well with other competing estimators based on alternative choices of smoothing parameters.","[Escanciano, Juan Carlos] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Zhu, Lin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Tsinghua University,"Zhu, L (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhulin@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Escanciano, Juan Carlos/R-1878-2018","Escanciano, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6559-416X",,,,,22,4,4,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

These papers have, however, taken the lag length in the unit root test regression to be a deterministic function of the sample size, rather than data-determined, the latter being standard empirical practice. We investigate the finite sample impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity on conventional data-dependent lag selection methods in augmented Dickey-Fuller type regressions and propose new lag selection criteria which allow for unconditional heteroskedasticity. Standard lag selection methods are shown to have a tendency to over-fit the lag order under heteroskedasticity, resulting in significant power losses in the (wild bootstrap implementation of the) augmented Dickey-Fuller tests under the alternative. The proposed new lag selection criteria are shown to avoid this problem yet deliver unit root tests with almost identical finite sample properties as the corresponding tests based on conventional lag selection when the shocks are homoskedastic.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Phillips, Peter C.

Our primary interest is on the estimation of the parameter vector, as it provides the basis for estimation of firm specific (in)efficiency. Our frontier model is similar to that of Fan et al. (1996), but here we extend their work in that: a) we establish the asymptotic properties of their estimation procedure, and b) propose and establish the asymptotic properties of an alternative estimator based on the maximization of a conditional profile likelihood function. The estimator proposed in Fan et al. (1996) is asymptotically normally distributed but has bias which does not vanish as the sample size n -> infinity. In contrast, our proposed estimator is asymptotically normally distributed and correctly centered at the true value of the parameter vector. In addition, our estimator is shown to be efficient in a broad class of semiparametric estimators. Our estimation procedure provides a fast converging alternative to the recently proposed estimator in Kumbhakar et al. (2007).

Suppose that the insurer is allowed to purchase excess-of-loss reinsurance and invests her surplus in a financial market consisting of one risk-free asset and one risky asset whose price process is described by Heston's SV model. Under the consideration of the performance-related capital inflow/outflow, the wealth process of the insurer is modeled by a stochastic differential delay equation. The insurer's aim is to maximize the expected exponential utility of the combination of terminal wealth and average performance wealth. By adopting the dynamic programming approach, the optimal strategies and the optimal value functions are derived explicitly under two cases: the investment-reinsurance case and the investment-only case.

This article summarizes the review of evidence by the Evidence Review Group (ERG) and provides a summary of the NICE Appraisal Committee's (AC's) decision. The clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centred, open-label, randomized, phase III study comparing eribulin with treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in 762 patients with LABC/MBC. Clinical effectiveness results were submitted for two populations: the overall intention-to-treat (ITT) population and a subset (n = 488) that included only patients from North America, Western Europe and Australia (Region 1). For the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), a primary analysis (after 55 % of patients had died) and an updated analysis (after 77 % of patients had died) were conducted. In the ITT population, treatment with eribulin was associated with a significant improvement in median OS compared with TPC in both primary [difference in median OS 2.5 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.99] and updated analyses (2.7 months; HR 0.81, 95 % CI 0.67-0.96). A statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was reported for eribulin compared with TPC when assessed by the investigator (difference in median PFS 1.48 months; HR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.64-0.90), but not when assessed by the ERG (1.44 months; HR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.71-1.05). Gains in OS were greater for Region 1 patients than for the ITT population (3.1 vs. 2.7 months). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data suggested a benefit for eribulin responders, but was based on phase II studies. In the eribulin arm, serious adverse events included febrile neutropenia (4.2 %) and neutropenia (1.8 %), with peripheral neuropathy being the most common reason for treatment discontinuation. The manufacturer's economic evaluation using Patient Access Scheme costs reported a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for eribulin versus TPC (Region 1) of A 46,050 pound per quality-adjusted life year gained (corrected to A 45,106 pound when an erroneous data entry was removed). The ERG's revised ICERs were A 61,804 pound for Region 1 and A 76,110 pound for the overall population.

This study was done to compare relay cropping of maize with legumes to reduce burning in the highlands at Pang-da Royal Agriculture Station. The experiment was conducted with 3 maize-legume relay treatments ( maize + lablab, maize + ricebean and maize + cowpea) and maize monoculture ( farmer's practice) with 3 replicates in the wet season of 2012 and 2013. The maize grain yield was 5.19 Mg/ha in maize-mono, but 24 - 53% higher in the maize-legume relays. There was additional legume grain yield of 0.13 Mg/ha in maize + lablab, 0.30 Mg/ha in maize + ricebean and 0.73 Mg/ha in maize + cowpea. Contribution from biological N-2 fixation in legumes is most likely to have contributed to the total above ground nitrogen of 288 kg N/ha in maize + lablab, 177 kg N/ha in maize + ricebean and 186 kg N/ha in maize + cowpea, compared with 101 kg N/ha in maize-mono. While the maize-mono residue was lost in burning, 136 kg N/ha was retained in the maize+lablab bean residue, 68 kg N/ha in maize + ricebean residue and 36 kg N/ha in maize + cowpea residue.

We show that a cardinal property of the plausibility order and a strengthening of the notion of Bayesian consistency provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a PBE to be a sequential equilibrium.","[Bonanno, Giacomo] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Bonanno, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gfbonanno@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

In nonstandard problems, however, their frequentist coverage property does not guarantee that they do so in a reasonable fashion. For instance, confidence intervals may be empty or extremely short with positive probability, even if they are based on inverting powerful tests. We apply a betting framework and a notion of bet-proofness to formalize the reasonableness of confidence intervals as descriptions of parameter uncertainty, and use it for two purposes. First, we quantify the violations of bet-proofness for previously suggested confidence intervals in nonstandard problems. Second, we derive alternative confidence sets that are bet-proof by construction. We apply our framework to several nonstandard problems involving weak instruments, near unit roots, and moment inequalities. We find that previously suggested confidence intervals are not bet-proof, and numerically determine alternative bet-proof confidence sets.","[Muller, Ulrich K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Norets, Andriy] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, 64 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Princeton University; Brown University,"Müller, UK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",umueller@princeton.edu; andriy_norets@brown.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1260861]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1449346] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank an anonymous referee, Bruce Hansen, and the participants of the Northwestern Junior Festival on New Developments in Microeconometrics, the Cowles Foundation Summer Econometrics Conference, and the seminars at Cornell, Princeton, and Columbia for useful comments and discussions.

For that we compare several high dimensional copula models, from naive ones to complex factor copulas, which are able to simultaneously tackle the curse of dimensionality and introduce a high level of complexity into the model. We explore both static and dynamic copula fitting. In the dynamic case we allow different levels of flexibility for the dependence parameters which are driven by a GAS (Generalized Autoregressive Scores) model, in the spirit of Oh and Patton (2015).

The set of possible contract terms might, however, be restricted by a regulatory default constraint - a fact that can force the two parties to initiate sub-optimal insurance contracts. We show that this effect can be mitigated if regulatory policy is more flexible. We suggest that the regulator implement a traffic light system where companies are forced to reduce the riskiness of their asset allocation in distress. In a utility-based framework, we show that the introduction of such a system can increase the benefits of the policyholder without deteriorating the benefits of the insurance company. At the same time, default probabilities (and thus solvency capital requirements) can be reduced.","[Chen, An; Hieber, Peter] Univ Ulm, Inst Insurance Sci, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89069 Ulm, Germany",Ulm University,"Hieber, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ulm, Inst Insurance Sci, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",an.chen@uni-ulm.de; peter.hieber@uni-ulm.de,"Hieber, Peter/AAA-1189-2022","Hieber, Peter/0000-0001-5189-5308",German Association of Insurance Science (DVFVW),German Association of Insurance Science (DVFVW),"Peter Hieber acknowledges funding by the German Association of Insurance Science (DVFVW).

The appreciation rate and volatility of the stock, the premium rate and volatility of the risk process of the insurer are assumed to be adapted stochastic processes, while the interest rate is assumed to be deterministic. The object is to maximize the utility of intertemporal consumption and terminal wealth. By the method of multi-person differential game, we show that the time-consistent equilibrium strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function can be characterized by the unique solutions of a BSDE and an integral equation. Under appropriate conditions, we show that this integral equation admits a unique solution. Furthermore, we compare the time-consistent equilibrium strategies with the optimal strategy for exponential discount function, and with the strategies for naive insurers in two special cases.

Each AAI manages her own risks by purchasing reinsurance with the objective of maximizing the expected utility of her relative terminal surplus with respect to that of her counterparty. The two AAIs' decisions influence each other through the insurers' relative performance concerns and the correlation between their surplus processes. We establish a general framework of Nash equilibrium for the associated non-zero-sum game with model uncertainty. For the representative case of exponential utilities, we solve the equilibrium strategies explicitly. Numerical studies are conducted to draw economic interpretations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, if we further assume that there are finitely many European and American options traded, then we are able to show that these conditions are also sufficient. To show sufficiency, we construct a model under which both American and European options are correctly priced at all strikes simultaneously.

We assume that the manager of the company has time inconsistent preferences, which are described by a quasi-hyperbolic discount function, and that financing is permitted to prevent the company from going bankrupt. The manager's objective is to maximize the expected cumulative dividend payments minus financing costs. We solve the optimization problems for a naive manager and a sophisticated manager, and obtain explicit solutions for both managers. Our results show that the manager with time-inconsistent preferences tends to pay out dividends earlier. We also present some economic implications and sensitivity analysis for our results.

The bootstrap method applies to extremum estimators, such as quasi-maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments estimators, among others. Unlike existing parametric bootstrap procedures for quasi-likelihood ratio type tests, this bootstrap approach does not require any specific parametric assumption on the data distribution, and constructs the bootstrap samples in a fully nonparametric way. We derive the higher-order improvements of the nonparametric bootstrap compared to procedures based on standard first-order asymptotic theory. We show that the magnitude of these improvements is the same as those of parametric bootstrap procedures currently proposed in the literature. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the reliability and accuracy of the nonparametric bootstrap.","[Camponovo, Lorenzo] Univ St Gallen, Fac Math & Stat, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Camponovo, L (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Fac Math & Stat, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",lorenzo.camponovo@unisg.ch,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

This study assesses the validity of coverage in the HES outpatient dataset. Methods Men who died of, or with, prostate cancer were selected from a prostate-cancer screening trial (CAP, Cluster randomised triAl of PSA testing for Prostate cancer). Details of visits that took place after 1/4/2003 to hospital outpatient departments for conditions related to prostate cancer were extracted from medical records (MR); these appointments were sought in the HES outpatient dataset based on date. The matching procedure was repeated for periods before and after 1/4/2008, when the HES outpatient dataset was accredited as a national statistic. Results 4922 outpatient appointments were extracted from MR for 370 men. 4088 appointments recorded in MR were identified in the HES outpatient dataset (83.1 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 82.0-84.1). For appointments occurring prior to 1/4/2008, 2195/2755 (79.7 %; 95 % CI 78.2-81.2) matches were observed, while 1893/2167 (87.4 %; 95 % CI 86.0-88.9) appointments occurring after 1/4/2008 were identified (p for difference < 0.001). 215/370 men (58.1 %) had at least one appointment in the MR review that was unmatched in HES, 155 men (41.9 %) had all their appointments identified, and 20 men (5.4 %) had no appointments identified in HES. Conclusions The HES outpatient dataset appears reasonably valid for research, particularly following accreditation. The dataset may be a suitable alternative to collecting MR data from hospital notes within a trial, although caution should be exercised with data collected prior to accreditation.","[Thorn, Joanna C.; Turner, Emma; Walsh, Eleanor; Donovan, Jenny L.; Martin, Richard M.; Noble, Sian M.] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Hounsome, Luke; Verne, Julia] Publ Hlth England, Knowledge & Intelligence Team South West, 2 Rivergate, Bristol BS1 6EH, Avon, England; [Neal, David E.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Oncol, Box 279 S4,Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Hamdy, Freddie C.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Surg Sci, Old Rd Campus Res Bldg, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England",University of Bristol; Public Health England; Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke's Hospital; University of Cambridge; University of Oxford,"Thorn, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",joanna.thorn@bristol.ac.uk,"Turner, Emma/AAC-1828-2022","Turner, Emma/0000-0003-2575-387X; Noble, Sian/0000-0002-8011-0722; Hamdy, Freddie/0000-0003-2627-2154; Martin, Richard/0000-0002-7992-7719","Cancer Research UK/UK Department of Health [C11043/A4286, C18281/A8145, C18281/A11326, C18281/A15064]; MRC [MR/K006525/1, MR/K025643/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Cancer Research UK [15064] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MR/K025643/1, MR/K006525/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0514-10114] Funding Source: researchfish",Cancer Research UK/UK Department of Health(Cancer Research UK); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"The authors acknowledge the contribution of the CAP trial group.

Under the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model, we formulate the problem through a first-passage time problem on realized variance, and generalize the standard risk-neutral valuation theory for fixed maturity options to a case involving random maturity. By time change and the general theory of Markov diffusions, we characterize the joint distribution of the first-passage time of the realized variance and the corresponding variance using Bessel processes with drift. Thus, explicit formulas for a useful joint density related to Bessel processes are derived via Laplace transform inversion. Based on these theoretical findings, we obtain a Black-Scholes-Merton-type formula for pricing timer options, and thus extend the analytical tractability of the Heston model. Several issues regarding the numerical implementation are briefly discussed.","[Li, Chenxu] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Li, CX (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",cxli@gsm.pku.edu.cn,,,Guanghua School of Management; Center for Statistical Sciences; Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics and Quantitative Finance (Ministry of Education) at Peking University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11201009]; Columbia University,Guanghua School of Management; Center for Statistical Sciences; Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics and Quantitative Finance (Ministry of Education) at Peking University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Columbia University,"I am grateful to Professors Dilip Madan (Editor) and Jerome Detemple (Co-Editor), an Associate Editor, and two anonymous referees for their extensive and constructive comments.

Emphasis is placed on the stochastic cash flows in both wealth and liability dynamic processes, and the optimal investment and liquidity management strategies in achieving the M-V bi-objective of terminal surplus are evaluated. In this model, not only the asset returns and liability returns, but also the cash flows depend on the stochastic market states, which are assumed to follow a discrete-time Markov chain. Adopting the dynamic programming approach, the matrix theory and the Lagrange dual principle, we obtain closed-form expressions for the efficient investment strategy. Our proposed model is examined through empirical studies of a defined contribution pension fund. In-sample results show that, given the same risk level, an ALM investor (a) starting in a bear market can expect a higher return compared to beginning in a bull market and (b) has a lower expected return when there are major cash flow problems.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to provide a critical overview of the issues related to dengue economics research and to form a background with which to address the question of cost. Three literature databases were searched [PubMed, Embase and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS)], covering a period from 1980 to 2013, to identify papers meeting preset inclusion criteria. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality on the basis of a quality checklist developed for this purpose. An expert survey was designed to identify priority areas in dengue economics research and to identify gaps between the methodology and actual practice. Survey responses were combined with the literature review findings to determine stakeholder priorities in dengue economics research. The review identified over 700 papers. Forty-two of these papers met the selection criteria. The studies that were reviewed presented results from 32 dengue-endemic countries, underscoring the importance of dengue as a global public health problem. Cost analyses were the most common, with 21 papers, followed by nine cost-effectiveness analyses and seven cost-of-illness studies, indicating a relatively strong mix of methodologies. Dengue annual overall costs (in 2010 values) ranged from US$13.5 million (in Nicaragua) to $56 million (in Malaysia), showing cost variations across countries. Little consistency exists in the way costs were estimated and dengue interventions evaluated, making generalizations around costs difficult. The current evidence suggests that dengue costs are substantial because of the cost of hospital care and lost earnings. Further research in this area will broaden our understanding of the true economic impact of dengue.","[Constenla, Dagna; Garcia, Cristina; Lefcourt, Noah] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Constenla, Dagna] DVI, Baltimore, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Constenla, D (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, 855 N Wolfe St,Suite 600, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dconste1@jhu.edu,,,Pan-American Health and Education Foundation (PAHEF) - Sanofi Pasteur; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Gates,Pan-American Health and Education Foundation (PAHEF) - Sanofi Pasteur; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Gates,"JHU's IVAC received a sponsored grant from the Pan-American Health and Education Foundation (PAHEF), which was primarily funded by Sanofi Pasteur.

Prophylactic administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces the risks of these digestive symptoms. We investigated the cost effectiveness of adding a PPI to ASA therapy for ischemic stroke patients in Japan. A Markov state-transition model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of ASA monotherapy with ASA plus PPI co-therapy in patients with histories of upper gastrointestinal ulcers and ischemic stroke. The model takes into account ASA adherence rate and adverse effects due to ASA, including hemorrhagic stroke and UGIB. The analysis was performed from the perspective of healthcare payers in 2013. In the base case, total life-years by PPI co-therapy and monotherapy were 16.005 and 15.932, respectively. The difference in duration of no therapy (no ASA or PPI) between the therapies was 558.5 days, which would prevent 30.3 recurrences of ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PPI co-therapy relative to monotherapy was Ayen1,191,665 (US$11,458) per life-year gained. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, PPI co-therapy was consistently cost effective at a willingness to pay of Ayen5,000,000 (US$48,077) per life-year gained. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that PPI co-therapy was cost effective was 89.74 % at the willingness to pay. Co-therapy with ASA plus PPI appears to be cost-effective compared with ASA monotherapy. The addition of PPI also appeared to prolong the duration of ASA therapy, thereby reducing the risk of ischemic stroke.","[Takabayashi, Nobuyoshi; Murata, Kyoko; Tanaka, Shiro; Kawakami, Koji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Pharmacoepidemiol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Takabayashi, Nobuyoshi] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Osaka, Japan",Kyoto University; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd,"Kawakami, K (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Pharmacoepidemiol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",kawakami.koji.4e@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kawakami, Koji/GZA-6582-2022; 田中, 司朗/GON-6916-2022","Kawakami, Koji/0000-0002-7477-4071; 田中, 司朗/0000-0001-6817-5235",Kyowa Hakko Kirin; Bayer; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma; Olympus; Stella Pharma; Kaken Pharmaceutical; Advanced Medicalcare; Otsuka Pharmaceuticals,"Kyowa Hakko Kirin(Kyowa Kirin Ltd); Bayer(Bayer AG); Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma(Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.); Olympus; Stella Pharma; Kaken Pharmaceutical; Advanced Medicalcare; Otsuka Pharmaceuticals(Otsuka Pharmaceutical)","NT is an employee of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

It is assumed that the capital transfers between the companies are instantaneous and incur a certain proportional cost, and that ruin occurs when neither company can cover the deficit of the other. We study the survival probability as a function of initial capitals and express its bivariate transform through two univariate boundary transforms, where one of the initial capitals is fixed at 0. We identify these boundary transforms in the case when claims arriving at each company form two independent processes. The expressions are in terms of Wiener-Hopf factors associated to two auxiliary compound Poisson processes. The case of non-mutual agreement is also considered. The proposed model shares some features of a contingent surplus note instrument and may. be of interest in the context of crisis management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Relaxing the independence assumption, this article explores methods that allow for the correlation among frequency and severity components for micro-level insurance data. To introduce granular dependence, we rely on a hurdle modeling framework where the hurdle component concerns the occurrence of claims and the conditional component looks into the number and size of claims given occurrence. We propose two strategies to correlate the number of claims and the average claim size in the conditional component. The first is based on conditional probability decomposition and treats the number of claims as a covariate in the regression model for the average claim size, the second employed a mixed copula approach to formulate the joint distribution of the number and size of claims. We perform a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the two approaches and then demonstrate their application using a U.S. auto insurance dataset. The hold-out sample validation shows that the proposed model is superior to the industry benchmarks including the Tweedie and the two-part generalized linear models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

With the advance of technology, however, markets have become more sophisticated. To determine whether this has resulted in an improved market efficiency, we investigate whether statistically significant lagged correlation relationships exist in financial markets. We introduce a numerical method to statistically validate links in correlation-based networks, and employ our method to study lagged correlation networks of equity returns in financial markets. Crucially, our statistical validation of lead-lag relationships accounts for multiple hypothesis testing over all stock pairs. In an analysis of intraday transaction data from the periods 2002-2003 and 2011-2012, we find a striking growth in the networks as we increase the frequency with which we sample returns. We compute how the number of validated links and the magnitude of correlations change with increasing sampling frequency, and compare the results between the two data-sets. Finally, we compare topological properties of the directed correlation-based networks from the two periods using the in-degree and out-degree distributions and an analysis of three-node motifs. Our analysis suggests a growth in both the efficiency and instability of financial markets over the past decade.","[Curme, Chester; Stanley, H.

We propose a Local News Sentiment Level model, based on the Local Level model of Durbin and Koopman [Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods, 2001], to construct a running series of news sentiment from irregularly observed news items' sentiments. We construct several return and variation measures to proxy for the fine dynamics of the natural gas futures prices. We employ event studies, Granger causality tests and several state-of-the-art volatility models to assess the effect of news on the returns, price jumps and the volatility. We find significant relationships between news sentiment and the dynamic characteristics of natural gas futures prices. Our findings are, among others, that the arrival of news in non-trading periods causes overnight returns, that news sentiment is Granger caused by negative semi-volatility and that news sentiment is more sensitive to negative than to positive jumps. In addition to that we find strong evidence that news sentiment severely Granger causes price jumps and conclude that market participants trade futures as some function of aggregated news. We augment volatility models with news sentiment measures and conduct an out-of-sample volatility forecasting study. The first class of models is the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models the second class is the high-frequency-based volatility models of Shephard and Shephard [J. Appl. Econ., 2010, 25, 197-231] and Noureldin et al. [J. Appl. Econ., 2012, 27(6), 907-933]. We adapt both models to account for asymmetric volatility, leverage and time to maturity effects. By augmenting all models with news sentiment variables, we find that including news sentiment in volatility models significantly improves volatility forecasts.","[Borovkova, Svetlana] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mahakena, Diego] Flow Traders, NL-1018 LL Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Borovkova, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.a.borovkova@vu.nl,,,,,,,73,39,42,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society have published a joint clinical guideline that recommends providing patients with information on prognosis and self-management, the use of medications with proven benefits and, for those who do not improve, consideration be given to the use of spinal manipulation (for acute lower back pain only), interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, massage, yoga, cognitive behavioural therapy or relaxation. The purpose of this review was to evaluate published economic evaluations of pharmacological management for chronic lower back pain. A total of seven studies were eligible for inclusion in there view. The quality of the economic evaluations undertaken in the included studies was not high. This was primarily because of the nature of the underlying clinical evidence, most of which did not come from rigorous randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the manner in which it was incorporated into the economic evaluations. All studies provided reasonable information about what aspects of healthcare and other resource use were identified, measured and valued. However, the reporting of total costs was not uniform across studies. Measures of pain and disability were the most commonly collected outcomes measures. Two studies collected information on quality of life directly from participants while two studies modelled this information based on the literature. Future economic evaluations of interventions for chronic lower back pain, including pharmacological interventions, should be based on the results of well-conducted RCTs where the measurement of costs and outcomes such as quality of life and quality-adjusted life-years is included in the trial protocol, and which have a follow-up period sufficient to capture meaningful changes in both costs and outcomes. In the absence of RCT data, economic models should be used to estimate future costs and outcomes using robust methods.","[Haas, Marion; Lourenco, Richard De Abreu] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Haas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",marion.haas@chere.uts.edu.au,"Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017; De Abreu Lourenco, Richard/ABC-3150-2020","De Abreu Lourenco, Richard/0000-0002-5978-8774",,,,,20,8,9,0,24,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2015,33,6,,,,,561,569,,10.1007/s40273-015-0258-y,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CJ0VR,25604096.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355197700003,0

Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to identify and present humanistic [health-related quality of life (HRQoL)] and economic burdens of symptomatic COPD. Methods A comprehensive search of online databases (reimbursement or claims databases/other databases), abstracts from conference proceedings, published literature, clinical trials, medical records, health ministries, financial reports, registries, and other sources was conducted. Adult patients of any race or gender with symptomatic COPD were included. Humanistic and economic burdens included studies evaluating HRQoL and cost and resource use, respectively, associated with symptomatic COPD. Results Thirty-two studies reporting humanistic burden and 74 economic studies were identified. Symptomatic COPD led to impairment in the health state of patients, as assessed by HRQoL instruments. It was also associated with high economic burden across all countries. The overall, direct, and indirect costs per patient increased with an increase in symptoms, dyspnoea severity, and duration of disease. Across countries, the annual societal costs associated with symptomatic COPD were higher among patients with comorbidities. Conclusions Symptomatic COPD is associated with a substantial economic burden. The HRQoL of patients with symptomatic COPD is, in general, low and influenced by dyspnoea.","[Srivastava, Kunal; Thakur, Deepika; Sharma, Sheetal] HERON Hlth PVT Now Parexel, Chandigarh, India; [Punekar, Yogesh Suresh] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Value Evidence & Outcomes, Uxbridge UB11 1BT, Middx, England",GlaxoSmithKline,"Punekar, YS (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Value Evidence & Outcomes, Stockley Pk West,1-3 Iron Bridge Rd, Uxbridge UB11 1BT, Middx, England.",yogesh.q.punekar@gsk.com,,,GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),"Funding for this study was provided by GlaxoSmithKline.

The logarithmic value of the policyholder's account, before deducting any fees, is described by a jump diffusion process which is independent of the time-to-death random variable. The distribution of the time-to-death random variable is approximated by a combination of exponential distributions, which are dense in the space of density functions on [0, infinity). We characterize the Laplace transform of the distribution of a general refracted jump diffusion process through some integro-differential equations. Besides, the distribution of a refracted double exponential jump diffusion process at an independent exponential random variable is derived, from which closed-form formulas to evaluate the total expenses and the fair fee rates are obtained.

Our methods are designed to distinguish between three states of the world: (i) the model is structurally stable in the sense that the population moment condition holds at the same parameter value throughout the sample; (ii) the model parameters change at some point in the sample but otherwise the model is correctly specified; and (iii) the model exhibits more general forms of instability than a single shift in the parameters. An advantage of the info-metric approach is that the null hypotheses concerned are formulated in terms of distances between various choices of probability measures constrained to satisfy (i) and (ii), and the empirical measure of the sample. Under the alternative hypotheses considered, the model is assumed to exhibit structural instability at a single point in the sample, referred to as the break point; our analysis allows for the break point to be either fixed a priori or treated as occuring at some unknown point within a certain fraction of the sample. We propose various test statistics that can be thought of as sample analogs of the distances described above, and derive their limiting distributions under the appropriate null hypothesis. The limiting distributions of our statistics are nonstandard but coincide with various distributions that arise in the literature on structural instability testing within the Generalized Method of Moments framework. A small simulation study illustrates the finite sample performance of our test statistics.","[Hall, Alastair R.; Li, Yuyi; Orme, Chris D.; Sinko, Arthur] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Hall, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, SoSS, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alastair.hall@manchester.ac.uk,"Orme, Chris D/H-3698-2013",,ESRC [RES-062-23-1351]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G002401/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G002401/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The first author acknowledges the support of the ESRC grant RES-062-23-1351.,,28,3,3,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

One popular restriction is the assumption that the shocks to the trend and cycle are orthogonal. Another is the assumption that the trend is a pure random walk process. The unobserved components (UC) model (Harvey, 1985) assumes both of the above, whereas the BN decomposition (Beveridge and Nelson, 1981) assumes only the latter. Quah (1992) investigates a broad class of decompositions by making the former assumption only. This paper develops a convenient general framework in which alternative trend-cycle decompositions are regarded as special cases, and examines alternative decomposition schemes from the perspective of the frequency domain. We find that, although the conventional UC model is not necessarily a misspecification for describing the postwar U.S. GDP, choosing a univariate model among alternatives on the purely statistical grounds is difficult.","[Iwata, Shigeru; Li, Han] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Iwata, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",iwata@ku.edu,,,,,,,22,3,5,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

This paper describes some of the barriers that Haavelmo's ideas have had (and still have) to overcome and lays out a logical framework that has evolved from Haavelmo's insight and matured into a coherent and comprehensive account of the relationships between theory, data, and policy questions. The mathematical tools that emerge from this framework now enable investigators to answer complex policy and counterfactual questions using simple routines, some by mere inspection of the model's structure. Several such problems are illustrated by examples, including misspecification tests, nonparametric identification, mediation analysis, and introspection. Finally, we observe that economists are largely unaware of the benefits that Haavelmo's ideas bestow upon them and, to close this gap, we identify concrete recent advances in causal analysis that economists can utilize in research and education.","[Pearl, Judea] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Pearl, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Comp Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",judea@cs.ucla.edu,,,"NSF [IIS-1249822, IIS-1302448]; ONR [N00014-13-1-0153, N00014-10-1-0933]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research),"This paper has benefited from discussions with J.H.

We provide an analysis of the limiting distributions of the proposed bootstrap statistics under both the null hypothesis of exogeneity (size) and the alternative hypothesis of endogeneity (power). We show that when identification is strong, the bootstrap provides a high-order approximation of the null limiting distributions of the statistics and is consistent under the alternative hypothesis if the endogeneity parameter is fixed. However, the bootstrap only provides a first-order approximation when instruments are weak. Moreover, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition under which the proposed bootstrap tests exhibit power under (fixed) endogeneity and weak instruments. The latter condition may still hold over a wide range of cases as long as at least one instrument is relevant. Nevertheless, all bootstrap tests have low power when all instruments are irrelevant, a case of little interest in empirical work.

The present study aimed to understand how the highland communities perceived and defined their food security, and to develop community food security assessment. Two upland villages and three highland villagers in the Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand were selected. Quality research methods and tools were employed. The meaning of food security as given by farmers could be grouped into seven attributes. Using the FAO food security framework, there were 18 key indicators covered farmers' meaning and perception of food security. Based on new modified indicators, the community's self-assessment showed that each village had reached different levels of food security. Thus understanding farmers' perception and assessment of their food security would have practical implications for enhancing community food security. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The study used data from four weather stations located at the altitude ranging from 320 to 1400 m a.s.l., covering the period of 1988 to 2011. We used two indexes, NINO3 (sea surface temperature based) and SOI (Southern Oscillation Index, atmospheric pressure based) to relate their impacts on temperature and rainfall several months in advance. The relationships of ENSO phases and the weather elements were higher by using SOI than NINO3. The corresponding results of correlation between 3-month running mean of SOI and monthly rainfall, T-max and T-min are found, especially during March to June in strong and medium ENSO years. The anomaly of T-max related on SOI was shown higher than T-min. Considering monthly rainfall, a significant decrease was found in May and June in only strong and medium ENSO events and the rainfall pattern differed significantly from the normal pattern. The variations of temperature and rainfall could be predicted by the SOI one to several months in advance and can be applied in other provinces in mountainous zone in Upper Northern Thailand.

The chrysanthemum growers encountered soil-born diseases, nematodes and accumulation of salinity when production in the same area was practiced continuously. Soilless culture was a cultivation technique independent from soil condition. The purpose of this research was to determine the growth of chrysanthemum grown in two soilless systems included tray system and trough system. The tray system used seedling trays (50 holes, 140 cm(3)/hole) as container, and the trays were arranged over the raise base covered with polyethylene sheet. Cuttings of chrysanthemum 'New Yellow' were grown in the tray and arranged at density 81 plants/m(2). Each plant was irrigated by drip emitter 6 times/day with nutrient solution containing N 200, P 60, K 300 Mg 50, S 75, Fe 12, Mn 2, B 0.3, Cu 0.1, Zn 0.1 mg/L. The trough system was made from polyethylene sheet with a thickness of 0.04 mm laid over polyethylene sheet. The height of the trough was 15 cm and the width was 1 m. Chrysanthemum cuttings were grown in trough containing of coconut peat thickness 10 cm height and plants were fertigated with nutrient solution by drip tape once a day for three weeks, after that the plants were fertigated three times a week. The growth and flowering of chrysanthemum in the two systems were observed. The growth and quality of flowers produced in the tray and the trough system were similar. No significant differences in flower characteristics were observed between the two systems except for flower color. Chrysanthemum produced in both soilless systems received the same price for grade A as soil grown chrysanthemum. This indicated that chrysanthemum production in soilless system can be adopted to eliminate soil related diseases in the highlands. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We derive semiexplicit expressions for the supremum lower bound V-inf on the hedged payoff, at maturity T, of a long position in the realized variance of S. Equivalently, V-inf is the supremum strike K such that an investor with a long position in a variance swap with strike K can ensure a nonnegative payoff at T.

The novelty of our approach is its capability to select the number of components along with a satisfactory fitting of the model.

Due to the increased susceptibility of older adults to infectious diseases and their consequences, vaccination programmes are an important health intervention to help maintain healthy ageing. While much of the existing literature suggests that current vaccination programmes targeted at older adults and the elderly are likely to be cost effective in high-income countries, we argue that it is important to more fully consider some important issues and challenges. Since the majority of vaccines have been developed for children, economic evaluations of vaccination programmes have consequentially tended to focus on this age group and on how to incorporate herd-immunity effects. While programmes targeted at older adults and the elderly may also induce some herd effects, there are other important challenges to consider in these economic evaluations. For example, age and time effects in relation to vaccine efficacy and duration of immunity, as well as heterogeneity between targeted individuals in terms of risk of infection, severity of disease and response to vaccination. For some pathogens, there is also the potential for interactions with childhood programmes in the form of herd-immunity effects.","[Dirmesropian, Sevan; Wood, James G.; MacIntyre, C.

To calculate IBNR reserve, one needs to model claim arrivals and then predict IBNR claims. However, factors such as temporal dependence among claim arrivals and environmental variation are often not incorporated in many of the current loss reserving models, which may greatly affect the accuracy of IBNR predictions. In this paper, we propose to model the claim arrival process together with its reporting delays as a marked Cox process. Our model is versatile in modeling temporal dependence, allowing also for natural interpretations. This paper focuses mainly on the theoretical aspects of the proposed model. We show that the associated reported claim process and IBNR claim process are both marked Cox processes with easily convertible intensity functions and marking distributions. The proposed model can also account for fluctuations in the exposure. By an order statistics property, we show that the corresponding discretely observed process preserves all the information about the claim arrivals. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions for both the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the distributions of the numbers of reported claims and IBNR claims.

Assuming the existence of a numeraire portfolio for the US equity market, fair prices of derivatives under the benchmark approach can be obtained directly under the real-world measure. Under this modelling framework, there exists a direct link between observed call option prices on the index and the real-world density for the underlying index. We use a novel method for the estimation of option-implied volatility surfaces of high quality, which enables the subsequent analysis. We show that the real-world density that we recover is consistent with the observed realized dynamics of the underlying index. This admits the identification of liquidity premia embedded in option price data. We identify and estimate two separate liquidity premia embedded in S&P 500 index options that are consistent with previous findings in the literature.","[Barkhagen, Mathias; Blomvall, Joergen] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math Sci, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Linkoping University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Barkhagen, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",mathias.barkhagen@liu.se,"Blomvall, Jörgen/A-4200-2010","Platen, Eckhard/0000-0003-4595-3123; Blomvall, Jorgen/0000-0002-3558-2579",,,,,33,1,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The time-changed JCIR process is a time-inhomogeneous Markov semimartingale which can be either a jump-diffusion or a pure-jump process, and it has a mean-reverting jump component that leads to mean reversion in the prices in addition to the smooth mean-reversion force. Furthermore, the characteristics of the time-changed JCIR process are seasonal, allowing spikes to occur in a seasonal pattern. The Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process can be efficiently computed by Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. This allows us to recover its transition density through efficient Laplace inversion and to calibrate our model using maximum likelihood estimation. To price electricity derivatives, we introduce a class of measure changes that transforms one time-changed JCIR process into another time-changed JCIR process. We derive a closed-form formula for the futures price and obtain the Laplace transform of futures option price in terms of the Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process, which can then be efficiently inverted to yield the option price. By fitting our model to two major electricity markets in the US, we show that it is able to capture both the trajectorial and the statistical properties of electricity prices. Comparison with a popular jump-diffusion model is also provided.","[Li, Lingfei; Mo, Zhiyu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mendoza-Arriaga, Rafael] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Mitchell, Daniel] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Engn Syst & Design, Singapore, Singapore",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Li, LF (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lfli@se.cuhk.edu.hk,"Li, Lingfei/IWM-1338-2023; Mitchell, Dann M/U-6509-2018","Li, Lingfei/0000-0002-1761-3458;",Hong Kong Research Grant Council ECS [24200214],Hong Kong Research Grant Council ECS,Lingfei Li acknowledges research support from Hong Kong Research Grant Council ECS [grant number 24200214].,,59,11,12,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The disease affects quality of life (QOL) and poses an economic burden on patients, payers, and society. The objective of this review was to quantify the economic burden and quality-of-life effects and identify the gaps that should be addressed by future research. Free-text and subject heading searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Database, and the Web of Science Core Collection database were conducted to identify observational and interventional studies reporting costs and/or quality-of-life effects published up to 2 October 2015. Studies were included irrespective of whether they were conducted prospectively or retrospectively. The focus population consisted of adult patients aged 18 years or older affected by any stage of CLL. Studies were included regardless of whether the underlying population was treated at baseline or not. Risk of bias was assessed using a quality checklist developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project for (randomized) controlled trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies. Economic evaluations were rated using a checklist developed by Stuhldreher et al. (Int J Eat Disord 45:476-91, 2012). From 2451 records identified, 27 studies were found to be eligible for inclusion. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to methodology, perspective, and data used. Annual direct costs per person ranged from US$4491 in Germany to US$43,913 in the USA. The share of costs attributable to drug treatment varied between 26.2 and 79 %. Indirect costs amounted to US$4208. Severity of disease was a predictor for quality of life, whereas differences by age and sex were mainly present in subdomains. Comparisons of treated and untreated populations resulted in an increase of quality of life in favor of treated populations in the long-term perspective. Differences between treatments were small. Consequently, cost effectiveness in decision-analytic models did not depend on whether quality of life or survival are used to describe the benefits of treatment. Although the quantity and the quality of health economic and quality-of-life evidence have substantially increased, there is still a need for studies that take a patient or societal perspective. Factors that influence costs and the quality of life of patients seem to be well-established, while longitudinal lifetime cost studies at the population level are still scarce.","[Frey, Simon; Blankart, Carl R.; Stargardt, Tom] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Blankart, Carl R.] Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Gerontol & Hlth Care Res, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of Hamburg; Brown University,"Stargardt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",simon.frey@uni-hamburg.de; tom.stargardt@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Blankart, Carl R/Q-7843-2018","Blankart, Carl R/0000-0001-6719-0038",,,,,53,22,24,2,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2016,34,5,,,,,479,498,,10.1007/s40273-015-0367-7,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DJ4HO,26739956.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374166200006,0

The most prominent such bubble is the classic rational bubble. We study housing markets in the United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are finite-maturity, pre-paid, and tradeable ownership contracts with maturities often exceeding 700 years. Freeholds are infinite-maturity ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds with extremely-long maturities and freeholds reflects the present value of a claim to the freehold after leasehold expiry, and is thus a direct empirical measure of the transversality condition. We estimate this price difference, and find no evidence of failures of the transversality condition in housing markets in the U.K. and Singapore, even during periods when a sizable bubble was regularly thought to be present.","[Giglio, Stefano] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Giglio, Stefano; Maggiori, Matteo; Stroebel, Johannes] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Giglio, Stefano; Maggiori, Matteo; Stroebel, Johannes] CEPR, Marion, IN USA; [Maggiori, Matteo] Harvard Univ, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stroebel, Johannes] NYU, Stern Sch Business, 44 West 4th St, New York, NY 10014 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Harvard University; New York University,"Giglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.;Giglio, S (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Giglio, S (通讯作者)，CEPR, Marion, IN USA.",stefano.giglio@chicagobooth.edu; maggiori@fas.harvard.edu; johannes.stroebel@stern.nyu.edu,,,Harvard Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; NYU Stern Center for the Global Economy and Business; Fama-Miller Center; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,Harvard Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; NYU Stern Center for the Global Economy and Business; Fama-Miller Center; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,"We thank Nick Barberis, Sugato Bhattacharyya, Antje Berndt, Luigi Bocola, Markus Brunnermeier, John Campbell, VV Chari, John Cochrane, Marco Di Maggio, Eugene Fama, Emmanuel Farhi, Robert Flood, Xavier Gabaix, Edward Glaeser, Bob Hall, Valentin Haddad, Harrison Hong, Mervyn King, Narayana Kocherlakota, Stefan Nagel, Thomas Philippon, Monika Piazzesi, Tomasz Piskorski, Neil Shephard, Andrei Shleifer, Alp Simsek, Jeremy Stein, Jules van Binsbergen, Stijn van Nieuwerburgh, Wei Xiong, Mark Watson, Bill Wheaton, as well as seminar and conference participants at NBER Monetary Economics, Minnesota Workshop in Macroeconomic Theory, Northwestern, UCLA, HBS Finance Retreat, Sciences Po, Chicago Booth, NYU Stern, Boston University/Boston Fed Conference on Macro-Finance Linkages, Texas Finance Festival, SFS Cavalcade, BIS, MIT Junior Finance Faculty Conference 2015, and the New York Junior Macroeconomics and Finance Group meeting for helpful discussions.

In insurance, the index and its modifications have been used to compare the riskiness of portfolios, to order reinsurance contracts, and to summarize insurance scores (relativities). In this paper, we establish several stochastic orders between the Gini indexes of multivariate elliptical risks with the same marginals but different dependence structures. This work is motivated by the applied studies of Brazauskas et al. (2007) and Samanthi et al. (2015), who employed the Gini index to compare the riskiness of insurance portfolios. Based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations, these authors have found that the power function of the associated hypothesis test increases as portfolios become more positively correlated. The comparison of the Gini indexes (of empirically estimated risk measures) presented in this paper provides a theoretical explanation to this statistical phenomenon. Moreover, it enriches the studies of the problem of central concentration of elliptical distributions and generalizes the pd-1 order proposed by Shaked and Tong (1985). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Evidence Review Group (ERG) produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from GEMINI 1, a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of the induction and maintenance of clinical response and remission by vedolizumab (MLN0002) in patients with moderate-to-severe active UC with an inadequate response to, loss of response to or intolerance of conventional therapy or anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The clinical evidence showed that vedolizumab performed significantly better than placebo in both the induction and maintenance phases. In the post hoc subgroup analyses in patients with or without prior anti-TNF-alpha therapy, vedolizumab performed better then placebo (p value not reported). In addition, a greater improvement in health-related quality of life was observed in patients treated with vedolizumab, and the frequency and types of adverse events were similar in the vedolizumab and placebo groups, but the evidence was limited to short-term follow-up. There were a number of limitations and uncertainties in the clinical evidence base, which warrants caution in its interpretation-in particular, the post hoc subgroup analyses and high dropout rates in the maintenance phase of GEMINI 1. The company also presented a network meta-analysis of vedolizumab versus other biologic therapies indicated for moderate-to-severe UC. However, the ERG considered that the results presented may have underestimated the uncertainty in treatment effects, since fixed-effects models were used, despite clear evidence of heterogeneity among the trials included in the network. Results from the company's economic evaluation (which included price reductions to reflect the proposed patient access scheme for vedolizumab) suggested that vedolizumab is the most effective option compared with surgery and conventional therapy in the following three populations: (1) a mixed intention-to-treat population, including patients who have previously received anti-TNF-alpha therapy and those who are anti-TNF-alpha na < ve; (2) patients who are anti-TNF-alpha na < ve only; and (3) patients who have previously failed anti-TNF-alpha therapy only. The ERG concluded that the results of the company's economic evaluation could not be considered robust, because of errors in model implementation, omission of relevant comparators, deviations from the NICE reference case and questionable model assumptions. The ERG amended the company's model and demonstrated that vedolizumab is expected to be dominated by surgery in all three populations.","[Essat, Munira; Tappenden, Paul; Ren, Shijie; Bessey, Alice; Archer, Rachel; Wong, Ruth] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Lobo, Alan] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Royal Hallamshire Hosp, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Hoque, Sami] Barts Hlth NHS Trust, Whipps Cross Univ Hosp, London, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; Barts Health NHS Trust; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Essat, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.essat@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; Essat, Munira/0000-0003-2397-402X",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [13/110/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project No. 13/110/01).

One candidate explanation is that funds process information about future asset values and use that information to invest in high-valued assets. But formal theories are scarce because information choice models with many assets are difficult to solve as well as difficult to test. This paper tackles both problems by developing a new attention allocation model that uses the state of the business cycle to predict information choices, which in turn, predict observable patterns of portfolio investments and returns. The predictions about fund portfolios' covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and return dispersion, and their excess returns are all supported by the data. These findings offer new evidence that some investment managers have skill and that attention is allocated rationally.","[Kacperczyk, Marcin] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn] NYU, Dept Finance, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Veldkamp, Laura] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Veldkamp, Laura] CEPR, London, England; [Veldkamp, Laura] NYU, Dept Econ, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA",Imperial College London; New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; New York University,"Kacperczyk, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Van Nieuwerburgh, S (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Finance, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.;Van Nieuwerburgh, S; Veldkamp, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Van Nieuwerburgh, S; Veldkamp, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Veldkamp, L (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, Stern Sch Business, 44 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",m.kacperczyk@imperial.ac.uk; svnieuwe@stern.nyu.edu; lveldkam@stern.nyu.edu,"Kacperczyk, Marcin/AGG-9764-2022",,Q-group,Q-group,"We thank John Campbell, Joseph Chen, Xavier Gabaix, Vincent Glode, Lars Hansen, Christian Hellwig, Ralph Koijen, Jeremy Stein, Matthijs van Dijk, Robert Whitelaw, as well as three anonymous referees, and participants in several seminars and conferences for valuable comments and suggestions.

While guidelines advocating more standardization of such HEEs (mainly for curative drugs) exist, several immunization-specific aspects (e.g. indirect effects or discounting approach) are still a subject of debate within the scientific community. The objective of this study was to develop a consensus framework for HEEs of vaccines to support the development of national guidelines in Europe. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify prevailing issues related to HEEs of vaccines. Furthermore, European experts in the field of health economics and immunization decision making were nominated and asked to select relevant aspects for discussion. Based on this, a workshop was held with these experts. Aspects on 'mathematical modelling', 'health economics' and 'decision making' were debated in group-work sessions (GWS) to formulate recommendations and/or-if applicable-to state 'pros' and 'contras'. A total of 13 different aspects were identified for modelling and HEE: model selection, time horizon of models, natural disease history, measures of vaccine-induced protection, duration of vaccine-induced protection, indirect effects apart from herd protection, target population, model calibration and validation, handling uncertainty, discounting, health-related quality of life, cost components, and perspectives. For decision making, there were four aspects regarding the purpose and the integration of HEEs of vaccines in decision making as well as the variation of parameters within uncertainty analyses and the reporting of results from HEEs. For each aspect, background information and an expert consensus were formulated. There was consensus that when HEEs are used to prioritize healthcare funding, this should be done in a consistent way across all interventions, including vaccines. However, proper evaluation of vaccines implies using tools that are not commonly used for therapeutic drugs. Due to the complexity of and uncertainties around vaccination, transparency in the documentation of HEEs and during subsequent decision making is essential.","[Ultsch, Bernhard; Wichmann, Ole] Robert Koch Inst, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Immunisat Unit, Seestr 10, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Damm, Oliver; Greiner, Wolfgang] Univ Bielefeld, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Beutels, Philippe; Bilcke, Joke] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Steinbeis Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gerber-Grote, Andreas] Inst Qual & Efficiency Hlth Care IQWiG, Cologne, Germany; [Hanquet, Germaine] Belgian Hlth Care Knowledge Ctr KCE, Brussels, Belgium; [Hutubessy, Raymond] WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Hutubessy, Raymond] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Jit, Mark] Publ Hlth England, London, England; [Knol, Mirjam] Ctr Infect Dis Control RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [von Kries, Ruediger] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Kuhlmann, Alexander] Leibniz Univ Hannover, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Levy-Bruhl, Daniel] Inst Veille Sanitaire InVS, St Maurice, France; [Perleth, Matthias] Fed Joint Comm G BA, Berlin, Germany; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Salo, Heini] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf THL, Helsinki, Finland; [Siebert, Uwe] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol UMIT, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] ONCOTYROL, Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Innsbruck, Austria; [Wasem, Jurgen] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany",Robert Koch Institute; University of Bielefeld; University of Antwerp; World Health Organization; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Public Health England; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; University of Munich; Leibniz University Hannover; Sante publique France; University of Groningen; Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare; University of Duisburg Essen,"Ultsch, B (通讯作者)，Robert Koch Inst, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Immunisat Unit, Seestr 10, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",UltschB@rki.de,"Kuhlmann, Alexander/JFA-2021-2023; Perleth, Matthias/C-6438-2016; Siebert, Uwe/HTO-0915-2023; Siebert, Uwe/M-5057-2019; Bilcke, Joke/AAC-8932-2019; Wasem, Juergen/AAT-8398-2021; Jit, Mark/HDM-7797-2022; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Perleth, Matthias/0000-0001-5574-8356; Siebert, Uwe/0000-0001-6425-7671; Siebert, Uwe/0000-0001-6425-7671; Bilcke, Joke/0000-0001-5720-5291; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; Jit, Mark/0000-0001-6658-8255; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel/0000-0002-4246-0932; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Wasem, Juergen/0000-0001-9653-168X",Federal Ministry of Health Germany,Federal Ministry of Health Germany,This study is part of a research project that is fully funded by the Federal Ministry of Health Germany.,,119,80,85,1,23,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2016,34,3,,,,,227,244,,10.1007/s40273-015-0335-2,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DF2HW,26477039.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371164200004,0

Furthermore, the theoretical dynamic properties of a time-varying-parameter EGARCH(1,1)-M are derived. We discuss them and apply the suggested Bayesian estimation to three major stock markets.","[Anyfantaki, Sofia; Demos, Antonis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Anyfantaki, S (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece.",sanyfantaki@aueb.gr,"Demos, Antonis/ABA-9763-2020; Anyfantaki, Sofia/HKF-1203-2023","Anyfantaki, Sofia/0000-0002-5449-4996",,,,,25,7,7,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The article analyzes 299 leading international journals in economics using quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), and highlights the similarities and differences in various RAMs, which are based on alternative transformations of citations and influence. All existing RAMs to date have been static, so two new dynamic RAMs are developed to capture changes in impact factor over time and escalating journal self-citations. Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to determine When, Where, and How (frequently) published articles are cited (see Chang et al., 2011a-c). The RAMs are grouped in four distinct classes that include impact factor, mean citations, and non-citations, journal policy, number of high quality articles, journal influence, and article influence. These classes include the most widely used RAMs, namely, the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self-citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self citations (5YIF), Eigenfactor (or Journal Influence), Article Influence, h-index, and Papers Ignored-By Even The Authors (PI-BETA). As all existing RAMs to date have been static, two new dynamic RAMs are developed to capture changes in impact factor over time (5YD2=5YIF/2YIF) and Escalating Self-Citations (ESC). We highlight robust rankings based on the harmonic mean of the ranks of RAMs across the four classes. It is shown that emphasizing the 2YIF of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published articles are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published articles are cited, can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal quality, impact, and influence relative to the harmonic mean of the ranks.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Finance, Dept Appl Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Maasoumi, Esfandiar] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid, Spain",National Tsing Hua University; Emory University; National Tsing Hua University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Complutense University of Madrid,"McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X","National Science Council, Taiwan; Australian Research Council","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","For financial support, the first author wishes to thank the National Science Council, Taiwan, and the third author wishes to acknowledge the Australian Research Council and the National Science Council, Taiwan.",,14,16,16,1,55,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

High level of concentration in the borrowing side led to lower interconnectivity but higher systemic risk prior to the crisis.

This paper analyzes the impact of cost effectiveness and severity of disease on reimbursement decisions for new pharmaceuticals. Data has been extracted from all decisions made by the TLV between 2005 and 2011. Cost effectiveness is measured as the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, whereas disease severity is a binary variable (severe-not severe). In total, the dataset consists of 102 decisions, with 86 approved and 16 declined reimbursements. The lowest cost per QALY of declined reimbursements is Swedish kronor (SEK) 700,000 (a,not sign79,100), while the highest cost per QALY of approved reimbursements is SEK1,220,000 (a,not sign135,600). At a cost per QALY of SEK702,000 Swedish kronor (non-severe diseases) and SEK988,000 (severe diseases), the likelihood of approval is estimated to be 50/50 (a,not sign79,400 and a,not sign111,700). The TLV places substantial weight on both the cost effectiveness and the severity of disease in reimbursement decisions, and the implied willingness to pay for a QALY is higher than the often cited 'rule of thumb' in Swedish policy debates.","[Svensson, Mikael] Univ Orebro, Dept Econ, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Nilsson, Fredrik O.

Despite the publication of technical guides for the conduct of mapping research, guidance for the reporting of mapping studies is currently lacking. The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a new checklist, which aims to promote complete and transparent reporting of mapping studies. The primary audiences for the MAPS statement are researchers reporting mapping studies, the funders of the research, and peer reviewers and editors involved in assessing mapping studies for publication. A de novo list of 29 candidate reporting items and accompanying explanations was created by a working group comprising six health economists and one Delphi methodologist. Following a two-round modified Delphi survey with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies and the biomedical journal editorial community, a final set of 23 items deemed essential for transparent reporting, and accompanying explanations, was developed. The items are contained in a user-friendly 23-item checklist. They are presented numerically and categorised within six sections, namely: (1) title and abstract; (2) introduction; (3) methods; (4) results; (5) discussion; and (6) other. The MAPS statement is best applied in conjunction with the accompanying MAPS explanation and elaboration document. It is anticipated that the MAPS statement will improve the clarity, transparency and completeness of reporting of mapping studies. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the MAPS statement is being co-published by seven health economics and quality-of-life journals, and broader endorsement is encouraged. The MAPS working group plans to assess the need for an update of the reporting checklist in 5 years' time.","[Petrou, Stavros; Froud, Robert] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford, England; [Dakin, Helen; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ London, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Oppe, Mark] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Froud, Robert] Norges Helsehoyskole, Oslo, Norway",University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Brunel University,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Froud, Robert/AAQ-2429-2021; Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Froud, Robert/0000-0002-9193-2297; Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X; Gray, Alastair/0000-0003-0239-7278; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544","MRC [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),,,27,26,26,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2015,33,10,,,,,985,991,,10.1007/s40273-015-0319-2,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CR8TE,26232201.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361626100001,0

The available information consists of the reporting delays, settlement delays and claim payments. The model settings include Poisson distributed frequency of claims produced by each policy, claims payable at the settlement time, and the amount of payment depending only on its settlement delay. While such settings are applicable to certain but not all practical cases, the principal purpose of the paper is to examine the efficiency of individual data against aggregate data. We refer to loss reserving as to estimate the projections of the outstanding liabilities on observed information. The efficiency of the individual loss reserving against classical aggregate loss reservings, namely Chain-Ladder (C-L) and Bornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F), is assessed by comparing the asymptotic variances of the errors in estimating the conditional expectation (projection) of the outstanding liability between individual, C-L and B-F reservings. The research shows a significant increase in the accuracy of loss reserving by using individual data compared with aggregate data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the baseline event incidence for patients without risk factors (incidence_no_risk) may not be reported in the literature, therefore the event incidence in the population (incidence_pop) is commonly used in its place as the baseline. However, this is problematic because incidence_pop is a weighted average of a heterogeneous population. We therefore developed a method for deriving the incidence for persons without risk factors (incidence_no_risk) by adjustment of incidence_pop. We calculated incidence_no_risk using the relative risk for events due to risk factors (RR_risk), incidence_pop, and the prevalence of the risk factor (pRF), which are typically available in the literature. Since the incidence for patient with risk factors (incidence_risk) can be expressed as incidence_risk = incidence_no_risk x RR_risk, we found that incidence_no_risk = incidence_pop/((RR_risk x pRF) + (1 - pRF)). We validated the equation by modeling the fracture incidence in high-risk patients in an osteoporosis transition-state model. With incidence_pop used as the baseline fracture incidence, the model overestimated hip fractures in the study population (10.72 fractures/1000 patient-years). After adjustment of incidence_pop using incidence_no_risk as the baseline incidence, the model accurately predicted hip fractures (2.27/1000 patient-years). Therefore, incidence_no_risk can be calculated using this method based on the event incidence for the study population, the relative risk increase associated with the risk factor, and the prevalence of the risk factor.","[Nelson, Scott D.] Dept Vet Affairs, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Nelson, Scott D.; Lafleur, Joanne] Univ Utah, Coll Pharm, LS Skaggs Pharm Inst, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Malone, Daniel] Univ Arizona, Dept Pharm Practice & Sci, Tucson, AZ USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Arizona,"Nelson, SD (通讯作者)，Dept Vet Affairs, Salt Lake City, UT USA.",Scott.Nelson@pharm.utah.edu,"Nelson, Scott/I-7607-2019","Nelson, Scott/0000-0002-1941-1817","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); Veterans Affairs Advanced Fellowship Program in Medical Informatics of the Office of Academic Affiliations, Department of Veterans Affairs","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); Veterans Affairs Advanced Fellowship Program in Medical Informatics of the Office of Academic Affiliations, Department of Veterans Affairs","Financial support for this study was provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).

Empirical experiments indicate that the occurrence frequency ;of natural catastrophes (NatCat) has a serially dependent trend and that the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross square-root model for global insured losses is best fit than any other static distributions. The results are used to develop a NatCat risk insurance model that sets up a NatCat premium formula, uses the serially dependent dynamics of insured loss and establishes the cash flow of all involved parties while considering corporate income tax and no additional risk premium. The simulation results based on this model shows that fluctuation reserves, catastrophe bonds and catastrophe funds with payback schemes are feasible options for smoothing risk because they can benefit all long-term involved parties, including insurance company shareholders, the insured, bondholders, the fund and the government (i.e. taxpayers).

GPU speed-up examples reported in the literature often involve Monte Carlo algorithms, and there are software tools commercially available that help migrate Monte Carlo financial pricing models to GPU. We present a survey of Monte Carlo and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods, and discuss existing (quasi) Monte Carlo sequences in GPU libraries. We discuss specific features of GPU architecture relevant for developing efficient (quasi) Monte Carlo methods.

Different from 'slow-burn' spillover or interdependence among these markets, 'fast and furious' contagion can occur instantly. To investigate this kind of contagion from the US, Japan and Hong Kong to other Asian economies, we design a research strategy to capture fundamental interdependence, or 'slow-burn' spillover, among these stock markets as well as short-term departures from this interdependence. Based on these departures, we propose a new contagion measure which reveals how one market responds over time to a shock in another market. We also propose international portfolio analysis for contagion via variance decomposition from the portfolio manager's perspective. Using this research strategy, we find that the US stock market was cointegrated with the Asian stock markets during four specific periods from 3 July 1997 to 30 April 2014. Beyond this fundamental interdependence, the shocks from both Japan and Hong Kong have significant 'fast and furious' contagion effects on other Asian stock markets during the US subprime crisis, but the shocks from the US have no such effects.","[Wu, Lei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Meng, Qingbin] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Xu, Kuan] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Beihang University; Renmin University of China; Dalhousie University,"Meng, QB (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",mengqingbin@rbs.org.cn; kuan.xu@dal.ca,"WU, LEI/L-4262-2019","Xu, Kuan/0000-0003-0414-0644; Wu, Lei/0000-0001-5487-916X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303016]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Sciences Projects [31702156, 10YJC790196]; Beijing City Board of Education of Young Talent Plan [31702156, 10YJC790196]; School of Business, Renmin University of China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China, Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Sciences Projects; Beijing City Board of Education of Young Talent Plan; School of Business, Renmin University of China","Lei Wu thanks the National Natural Science Foundation of China for support (Grant No. 71303016).

The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a medication review with follow-up (MRF) service for older adults with polypharmacy in Spanish community pharmacies against the alternative of having their medication dispensed normally. The study was designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial, and was carried out over a time horizon of 6 months. The target population was older adults with polypharmacy, defined as individuals taking five or more medicines per day. The study was conducted in 178 community pharmacies in Spain. Cost-utility analysis adopted a health service perspective. Costs were in euros at 2014 prices and the effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). In order to analyze the uncertainty of ICER results, we performed a non-parametric bootstrapping with 5000 replications. A total of 1403 older adults, aged between 65 and 94 years, were enrolled in the study: 688 in the intervention group (IG) and 715 in the control group (CG). By the end of the follow-up, both groups had reduced the mean number of prescribed medications they took, although this reduction was greater in the IG (0.28 +/- A 1.25 drugs; p < 0.001) than in the CG (0.07 +/- A 0.95 drugs; p = 0.063). Older adults in the IG saw their quality of life improved by 0.0528 +/- A 0.20 (p < 0.001). In contrast, the CG experienced a slight reduction in their quality of life: 0.0022 +/- A 0.24 (p = 0.815). The mean total cost was a,not sign977.57 +/- A 1455.88 for the IG and a,not sign1173.44 +/- A 3671.65 for the CG. In order to estimate the ICER, we used the costs adjusted for baseline medications and QALYs adjusted for baseline utility score, resulting in a mean incremental total cost of -a,not sign250.51 +/- A 148.61 (95 % CI -541.79 to 40.76) and a mean incremental QALY of 0.0156 +/- A 0.004 (95 % CI 0.008-0.023). Regarding the results from the cost-utility analysis, the MRF service emerged as the dominant strategy. The MRF service is an effective intervention for optimizing prescribed medication and improving quality of life in older adults with polypharmacy in community pharmacies. The results from the cost-utility analysis suggest that the MRF service is cost effective.","[Jodar-Sanchez, Francisco] Virgen del Rocio Univ Hosp, Technol Innovat Grp, Seville, Spain; [Jodar-Sanchez, Francisco] Andalusian Publ Fdn Hlth Res Management Seville, Seville, Spain; [Malet-Larrea, Amaia] Univ Basque Country, Vitoria, Spain; [Martin, Jose J.; Puerto Lopez del Amo, M.] Univ Granada, Appl Econ Dept, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Garcia-Mochon, Leticia] Andalusian Sch Publ Hlth, Granada, Spain; [Martinez-Martinez, Fernando; Gastelurrutia-Garralda, Miguel A.; Sabater-Hernandez, Daniel] Univ Granada, Pharmaceut Care Res Grp, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria; Sabater-Hernandez, Daniel; Benrimoj, Shalom I.] Univ Technol Sydney, Grad Sch Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Saez-Benito, Loreto] San Jorge Univ, Dept Pharm, Zaragoza, Spain",Virgen del Rocio University Hospital; University of Basque Country; University of Granada; Escuela Andaluza de Salud Publica; University of Granada; University of Technology Sydney; Universidad San Jorge,"Martín, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Appl Econ Dept, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jmartin@ugr.es,"Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria/B-7456-2013; Martín, José Jesús/AAB-7056-2019; del Amo Gonzál, M.

The Buhlmann-Straub credibility reserving (BSCR) model is a particular case of a CILI model where the risk parameter is only depending on i. We consider CILI models with additive diagonal risk (ADR), where the risk parameter is given by the sum of two components, one depending on the accident year i and the other depending on the calendar year t = i + j. The model can be viewed as an extension of the BSCR model including random diagonal effects, which are often declared to be important in loss reserving but rarely are specifically modeled. We show that the ADR model is tractable in closed form, providing credibility formulae for the reserve and the mean square error of prediction (MSEP). We also derive unbiased estimators for the variance parameters which extend the classical Buhlmann-Straub estimators. The results are illustrated by a numerical example and the estimators are tested by simulation. We find that the inclusion of random diagonal effects can be significant for the reserve estimates and, especially, for the evaluation of the MSEP. The paper is written with the purpose of illustrating the role of stochastic diagonal effects. To isolate these effects, we assume that the development pattern is given. In particular, our MSEP values do not include the uncertainty due to the estimation of the development pattern.","[Buehlmann, Hans] ETH, Dept Math, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Moriconi, Franco] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Perugia,"Moriconi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Econ, Via A Pascoli 1, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",hbuhl@math.ethz.ch; franco.moriconi1@unipg.it,,"Moriconi, Franco/0000-0002-8092-7652",,,,,13,6,6,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2015,45,2,,,,,309,353,,10.1017/asb.2015.3,0.0,,,45,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CG8WC,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353595000003,0

We consider a model in which each agent has a random preference ordering over individual potential matching partners, and agents' types are only partially observed by the econometrician. We show that in a large market, the inclusive value is a sufficient statistic for an agent's endogenous choice set with respect to the probability of being matched to a spouse of a given observable type. Furthermore, while the number of pairwise stable matchings for a typical realization of random utilities grows at a fast rate as the number of market participants increases, the inclusive values resulting from any stable matching converge to a unique deterministic limit. We can therefore characterize the limiting distribution of the matching market as the unique solution to a fixed-point condition on the inclusive values. Finally we analyze identification and estimation of payoff parameters from the asymptotic distribution of observable characteristics at the level of pairs resulting from a stable matching.","NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Menzel, K (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W4 St,6FL, New York, NY 10012 USA.",konrad.menzel@nyu.edu,,,,,,,44,41,57,1,50,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2015,83,3,,,,,897,941,,10.3982/ECTA12299,0.0,,,45,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CK1TO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355990500004,0

Equilibrium investments and the equilibrium matching will be efficient if agents can simultaneously negotiate investments and matches, but we focus on markets in which agents must first sink their investments before matching. Additional equilibria may arise in this sunk-investment setting, even though our matching market is competitive. These equilibria exhibit inefficiencies that we can interpret as coordination failures. All allocations satisfying a constrained efficiency property are equilibria, and the converse holds if preferences satisfy a separability condition. We identify sufficient conditions (most notably, quasiconcave utilities) for the investments of matched agents to satisfy an exchange efficiency property as well as sufficient conditions (most notably, a single crossing property) for agents to be matched positive assortatively, with these conditions then forming the core of sufficient conditions for the efficiency of equilibrium allocations.","[Noeldeke, Georg] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Samuelson, Larry] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Basel; Yale University,"Nöldeke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",georg.noeldeke@unibas.ch; Larry.Samuelson@yale.edu,,"Noldeke, Georg/0000-0001-6651-9890","National Science Foundation [SES-1153893]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1459158] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1153893] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Christian Hellwig, Werner Hildenbrand, George Mailath, and Karl Schlag for helpful comments and discussions.

Patient outcomes depend on quality of warfarin management, which includes regular monitoring and dose adjustments. Recently, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that do not require regular monitoring offer an alternative to warfarin. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cost effectiveness of NOACs for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation depends on the quality of warfarin control. We developed a Markov decision model to simulate warfarin treatment outcomes in relation to the quality of anticoagulation control, expressed as percentage of time in the therapeutic range (TTR). Standard treatment with adjusted-dose warfarin and improved anticoagulation control by genotype-guided dosing were compared with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. The analysis was performed from the Slovenian healthcare payer perspective using 2014 costs. In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban was below the threshold of a,not sign25,000 per quality-adjusted life-years compared with adjusted-dose warfarin with a TTR of 60 %. The probability that warfarin was a cost-effective option was around 1 %. This percentage rises as the quality of anticoagulation control improves. At a TTR of 70 %, warfarin was the preferred treatment in half the iterations. The cost effectiveness of NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased risk for stroke is highly sensitive to warfarin anticoagulation control. NOACs are more likely to be cost-effective options in settings with poor warfarin management than in settings with better anticoagulation control, where they may not represent good value for money.","[Janzic, Andrej; Kos, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Pharm, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Pharm, Askerceva Cesta 7, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mitja.kos@ffa.uni-lj.si,"Kos, Mitja/KCK-0806-2024; MUÑOZ, ROSA ANA/H-3964-2018; Kos, Mitja/C-7440-2019","Kos, Mitja/0000-0002-6801-6450",,,,,54,42,45,0,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2015,33,4,,,,,395,408,,10.1007/s40273-014-0246-7,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CF1AQ,25512096.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352276300007,0

These results hold even when the distribution and dimension of unobserved heterogeneity are neither known nor identified, and utilities are neither quasilinear nor parametrically specified. The welfare distributions take simple forms that are easy to compute in applications. In particular, average EV for a price rise equals the change in average Marshallian consumer surplus and is smaller than average CV for a normal good.

Recent findings regarding the secondary preventive benefits of HAART necessitate careful consideration of funding allocations for HIV/AIDS care. Our objective is to estimate non-HAART direct medical costs at different levels of disease progression and over time in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We considered the population of individuals with HIV/AIDS within a set of linked disease registries and health administrative databases (N = 11,836) from 1996 to 2010. Costs of hospitalization, physician billing, diagnostic testing and non-HAART medications were calculated in 2010 Canadian dollars. Effects of covariates on quarterly costs were assessed with a two-part model with logit for probability of non-zero costs and a generalized linear model (GLM). Net effects of CD4 strata on direct non-HAART medical costs were evaluated over time during the study period. Results Compared with person-quarters in which CD4 > 500/mm(3), costs were Can$185 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 132-239) greater for CD4 350-500/mm(3), Can$441 (95 % CI 366-516) greater for CD4 200-350/mm(3) and Can$1,173 (95 % CI 1,051-1,294) greater when CD4 < 200/mm(3). Prior to HIV care initiation, individuals incurred costs Can$385 (95 % CI 283-487) greater than in periods with CD4 > 500/mm(3). Hospitalization comprised the majority of the increment in costs amongst those with no measured CD4. Evaluated at CD4 state conditional means, those with CD4 < 200/mm(3) incurred quarterly costs of Can$5,781 (95 % CI 4,716-6,846) versus Can$1,307 (95 % CI 1,154-1,460; p < 0.001) for CD4 a parts per thousand yen500/mm(3) in 2010. Conclusion Non-HAART direct medical costs were substantially lower for individuals during periods of sustained virologic suppression and high CD4 count. HIV treatment and prevention evaluations require detailed health resource use data to inform funding allocation decisions.","[Nosyk, Bohdan; Lima, Viviane; Colley, Guillaume; Yip, Benita; Hogg, Robert S.; Montaner, Julio S.

The test statistic is based on an estimator of the topological distance between restricted and unrestricted probability measures corresponding to conditional independence or its absence. The distance is evaluated using a family of Generically Comprehensively Revealing (GCR) functions, such as the exponential or logistic functions, which are indexed by nuisance parameters. The use of GCR functions makes the test able to detect any deviation from the null. We use a kernel smoothing method when estimating the distance. An integrated conditional moment (ICM) test statistic based on these estimates is obtained by integrating out the nuisance parameters. We simulate the critical values using a conditional simulation approach. Monte Carlo experiments show that the test performs well in finite samples.

The proposed model is applied to the task of forecasting and trading three commodity exchange traded funds on a daily basis over the period 2012-2014. The inputs of the KH-vSVR models are selected through the model confidence set from a large pool of linear predictors. The KH-vSVR's statistical and trading performance is benchmarked against traditionally adjusted SVR structures and the best linear predictor. In addition to a simple strategy, a time-varying leverage trading strategy is applied based on heterogeneous autoregressive volatility estimations. It is shown that the KH-vSVR outperforms its counterparts in terms of statistical accuracy and trading efficiency, while the leverage strategy is found to be successful.","[Stasinakis, Charalampos; Sermpinis, Georgios] Univ Glasgow, Sch Business, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Psaradellis, Ioannis] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England; [Verousis, Thanos] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Glasgow; University of Liverpool; Newcastle University - UK,"Stasinakis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Business, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",charalampos.stasinakis@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Psaradellis, Ioannis/0000-0002-7628-8931; Verousis, Thanos/0000-0002-7812-1908; Sermpinis, Georgios/0000-0002-7341-8913",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1522286] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,50,11,11,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This paper develops a novel extended skew-t copula model to examine the effectiveness of gold and US dollar (USD) as hedge or safe haven asset against stock prices for seven developed markets over the 2000-2013 period. Our results indicate the existence of skewness and heavy/thin tails in the distributions of all three types of assets in most of the developed markets, lending support to the employment of flexible distributions to evaluate the tail dependences among assets. We find that USD is preferred to gold as a hedge asset during normal market conditions, while both assets can serve as safe haven assets for most countries when stock markets crash. Our simultaneous analysis of the three assets advises against a joint hedge strategy of gold and USD due to the high tail dependence between them during extreme market conditions. This result highlights the importance of simultaneous modelling of multiple assets in financial risk analysis.","[Liu, Chung-Shin] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Sichuan 611130, Peoples R China; [Chang, Meng-Shiuh] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ximing] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Wu, Ximing] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chui, Chin Man] Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies, Fujian 361005, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Chang, MS (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China.",mslibretto@hotmail.com,,,,,,,72,24,27,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We identify two general conditions on valuation updating rules that together guarantee that the probability of playing a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) converges to one in games where no player is indifferent between two outcomes without every other player being also indifferent. The same conditions guarantee that the fraction of times a SPNE is played converges to one almost surely. We also show that for additively separable valuations, in which valuations are the sum of empirical and error terms, the conditions guaranteeing convergence can be made more intuitive. In addition, we give four examples of valuations that satisfy our conditions.

We find evidence, using data from a Danish insurance company, that the simple Poisson model can set the credibility weight to one even when there are only three years of individual experience data resulting from large heterogeneity among policyholders, and in doing so, it can thus break down the credibility model. The generalized count models, on the other hand, allow the weight to adjust according to the number of years of experience available. We propose parametric estimators for the structural parameters in the credibility formula using the mean and variance of the assumed distributions and a maximum likelihood estimation over a collective data. As an example, we show that the proposed parameters from Mittag-Leffler provide weights that are consistent with the idea of credibility. A simulation study is carded out investigating the stability of the maximum likelihood estimates from the Weibull count model. Finally, we extend the analyses to multidimensional lines and explain how our approach can be used in selecting profitable customers in cross-selling; customers can now be selected by estimating a function of their unknown risk profiles, which is the mean of the assumed distribution on their number of claims.

We demonstrate that switching strategies produce positive returns and their performance is better than those from the buy-and-hold and non-switching strategies over our sample periods. We also demonstrate equivalent performance for switching with different learning horizons, implying that behavioural heterogeneity of stock investors arises from the coexistence of different strategies with varying degrees of learning horizons.

Therefore, instead of trying to transfer longevity risk to investors, it could be interesting for financial institutions to propose interest rate hedges adapted to longevity portfolios, in the spirit of liability driven investments. In this paper, we introduce a new structured financial product: the so-called Longevity Nominal Chooser Swaption. Thanks to such a contract, insurers could keep pure longevity risk and transfer to financial markets a great part of interest rate risk underlying annuity portfolios. We use a population dynamics longevity model and a classical two-factor interest rate model to price this product. Numerical results show that the option offered to the insurer (in terms of choice of nominal) is not too expensive in many real-world cases. We also discuss the pros and the cons of the product and of our methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These estimators can aid understanding of the existing estimators such as the local polynomial estimator and the partially linear estimator. The first estimator is the partially polynomial estimator which extends the partially linear estimator by further incorporating derivative differences of the conditional mean of the outcome on the two sides of the discontinuity point. This estimator is related to the local polynomial estimator by a relocalization effect. Unlike the partially linear estimator, this estimator can achieve the optimal rate of convergence even under broader regularity conditions. The second estimator is an instrumental variable estimator in the fuzzy design. This estimator will reduce to the local polynomial estimator if higher order endogeneities are neglected. We study the asymptotic properties of these two estimators and conduct simulation studies to confirm the theoretical analysis.","[Yu, Ping] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Yu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",p.yu@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,42,3,4,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

A Case Study Eliciting Preferences for End-of-Life Care,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Although efficient designs have sample size advantages for discrete choice experiments (DCEs), it has been hypothesised that they may result in biased estimates owing to some respondents using simplistic heuristics. The main objective was to provide a case study documenting that many respondents choose on the basis of a single attribute when exposed to highly efficient DCE designs but switch to a conventional multi-attribute decision rule when the design efficiency was lowered (resulting in less need to trade across all attributes). Additional objectives included comparisons of the sizes of the estimated coefficients and characterisation of heterogeneity, thus providing evidence of the magnitude of bias likely present in highly efficient designs. Five hundred and twenty-five respondents participating in a wider end-of-life survey each answered two DCEs that varied in their design efficiency. The first was a Street and Burgess 100 % efficient Orthogonal Main Effects Plan design (2(7) in 8), using the top and bottom levels of all attributes. The second DCE comprised one eighth of the full Orthogonal Main Effects Plan in 32 pairs, (a 2 x 4(6)). Linear probability models estimated every respondent's complete utility function in DCE1. The number of respondents answering on the basis of one attribute level was noted, as was the proportion of these who then violated this rule in DCE2, the less efficient DCE. Latent class analyses were used to identify heterogeneity. Sixty per cent of respondents answered all eight tasks comprising DCE1 using a single attribute; most used the rule choose cheapest end-of-life care plan. However, when answering the four less efficient tasks in DCE2, one third of these (20 % overall) then traded across attributes at least once. Among those whose decision rule could not be described qualitatively, latent class models identified two classes; compared to class one, class two was more concerned with quality rather than cost of care and wished to die in an institution rather than at home. Higher efficiency was also associated with smaller regression coefficients, suggesting either weaker preferences or lower choice consistency (larger errors). This is the first within-subject study to investigate the association between DCE design efficiency and utility estimates. It found that a majority of people did not trade across attributes in the more efficient design but that one third of these then did trade in the less efficient design. More within-subject studies are required to establish how common this is. It may be that future DCEs should attempt to maximise some joint function of statistical and cognitive efficiency to maximise overall efficiency and minimise bias.","[Flynn, Terry N.] TF Choices Ltd, 285 Mansfield Rd, Nottingham NG5 8JE, England; [Bilger, Marcel; Malhotra, Chetna; Finkelstein, Eric A.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Program Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Singapore, Singapore; [Malhotra, Chetna; Finkelstein, Eric A.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Lien Ctr Palliat Care, Singapore, Singapore; [Finkelstein, Eric A.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Duke University,"Flynn, TN (通讯作者)，TF Choices Ltd, 285 Mansfield Rd, Nottingham NG5 8JE, England.",drterryflynn@gmail.com,,"Malhotra, Chetna/0000-0002-5380-0525; Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686; Bilger, Marcel/0000-0002-2872-6597",Singapore Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council [NMRC/NIG/1036/2010]; Lien Centre for Palliative Care [Duke-NUS-LCPC(I)/2011/0001],"Singapore Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council(National Medical Research Council, Singapore); Lien Centre for Palliative Care","We acknowledge participants at the International Choice Modelling Conference in Sydney 2013 for helpful comments and Prof. Jordan Louviere for providing the conceptual basis for the two designs used and for comments on the results.

The aim of this study was to predict the budget impact of using DhP as a first- or second-line drug to treat uncomplicated malaria in children in Tanzania. A dynamic Markov decision model was developed based on clinical and epidemiological data to estimate annual cases of malaria in children aged under 5 years. The model was used to predict the budget impact of introducing DhP as the first- or second-line anti-malarial drug, from the perspective of the National Malaria Control Program in 2014; thus, only the cost of drugs and diagnostics were considered. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore overall uncertainties in input parameters. The model predicts that the policy that uses artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and DhP as the first- and second-line drugs (AL + DhP), respectively, will save about $US64,423 per year, while achieving a 3 % reduction in the number of malaria cases, compared with that of AL + quinine. However, the policy that uses DhP as the first-line drug (DhP + AL) will consume an additional $US780,180 per year, while achieving a further 5 % reduction in the number of malaria cases, compared with that of AL + DhP. The use of DhP as the second-line drug to treat uncomplicated malaria in children in Tanzania is slightly cost saving. However, the policy that uses DhP as the first-line drug is somewhat more expensive but with more health benefits.","[Mori, Amani Thomas; Norheim, Ole Frithjof; Robberstad, Bjarne] Univ Bergen, Dept Global Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Ctr Int Hlth, POB 7804, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Mori, Amani Thomas] Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, POB 65001, Dar Es Salaam 11103, Tanzania; [Norheim, Ole Frithjof; Robberstad, Bjarne] Univ Bergen, Ctr Intervent Sci Maternal & Child Hlth, POB 7804, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen; Muhimbili University of Health & Allied Sciences; University of Bergen,"Mori, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Global Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Ctr Int Hlth, POB 7804, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.;Mori, AT (通讯作者)，Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, POB 65001, Dar Es Salaam 11103, Tanzania.",pax_amani@yahoo.com; ole.norheim@uib.no; bjarne.robberstad@uib.no,"Norheim, Ole F./AAC-8771-2020; Robberstad, Bjarne/AAG-9322-2020","Norheim, Ole F./0000-0002-5748-5956; Robberstad, Bjarne/0000-0002-0708-2016","Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child Health (CISMAC) [223269]; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Scheme; University of Bergen (UiB), Norway","Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child Health (CISMAC); Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Scheme(Research Council of Norway); University of Bergen (UiB), Norway","The contribution by BR and OFN was supported by the Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child Health (CISMAC; Project Number 223269), which is funded by the Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Scheme and the University of Bergen (UiB), Norway.

The volatility inputs are estimated by modelling price fluctuations as a GARCH(1,1) process. The corresponding volatility correlation matrix is then constructed. It is found that the distribution of a significant number of eigenvalues of the volatility correlation matrix matches with the analytical result from RMT. Furthermore, the empirical estimates of short- and long-range correlations amongst eigenvalues, which are within RMT bounds, match with the analytical results for the Gaussian Orthogonal ensemble of RMT. To understand the information content of the largest eigenvectors, we estimate the contribution of the Global Industry Classification Standard industry groups to each eigenvector. In comparison with eigenvectors of correlation matrix for price fluctuations, only few of the largest eigenvectors of the volatility correlation matrix are dominated by a single industry group. We also study correlations between volatility returns' and log-volatility to find similar results.","[Singh, Ajay] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Singh, Ajay] Polar Securities Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Xu, Dinghai] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics; University of Waterloo,"Singh, A (通讯作者)，Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada.",asingh@polarsec.com,,,Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics; Government of Canada through Industry Canada; Province of Ontario through the Ministry of Research and Innovation,"Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics; Government of Canada through Industry Canada; Province of Ontario through the Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario)","We would like to thank the managing Editor and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions, which have led to improvement of the contents of our paper.

The optimal portfolio strategy is obtained by minimizing dynamically the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) using three main tools: a stochastic approximation algorithm, optimal quantization, and variance reduction techniques (importance sampling and linear control variable), as the quantities of interest are naturally related to rare events. As a first step, we investigate the problem of CVaR regression, which corresponds to a static portfolio strategy where the number of units of each tradable assets is fixed at time 0 and remains unchanged till maturity. We devise a stochastic approximation algorithm and study its a.s. convergence and weak convergence rate. Then, we extend our approach to the dynamic case under the assumption that the process modeling the nontradable source of risk and financial assets prices is Markovian.

We compare and contrast the known risk bounds for these estimators, which shows that neither James-Stein nor Lasso uniformly dominates the other. We investigate the finite sample risk using a simple simulation experiment. We find that the risk of Lasso estimation is particularly sensitive to coefficient parameterization, and for a significant portion of the parameter space Lasso has higher mean-squared error than OLS. This investigation suggests that there are potential pitfalls arising with Lasso estimation, and simulation studies need to be more attentive to careful exploration of the parameter space.","[Hansen, Bruce E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hansen, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",behansen@wisc.edu,"Hansen, Bruce E/AAZ-5224-2020",,"National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1258858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Research supported by the National Science Foundation.,,19,21,24,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We show that (G) over bar (d)(delta)(u), the Laplace transform of the time of ruin in the delayed model, also satisfies a defective renewal equation and use this to study the Cramer-Lundberg asymptotics and bounds of (G) over bar (d)(delta)(u). Next, the paper considers the stochastic decomposition of the residual lifetime of maximal aggregate loss and more generally L-delta(d) in the delayed renewal risk model, using the framework equation introduced in Kim and Willmot (2011) and the defective renewal equation for the Laplace transform of the time of ruin. As a result of the decomposition, we propose a way to calculate the mean and the moments of the proper deficit in the delayed renewal risk model. Lastly, closed form expressions are derived for the Gerber-Shiu function in the delayed renewal risk model with the distributional assumption of time until the first claim and simulation results are included to assess the impact of different distributional assumptions on the time until the first claim.

These models arise by combining popular mean-reverting processes with simple algebraic functions mapping the definition domain of the underlying mean-reverting process to the unit interval. The so obtained Ito processes preserve, to some extent, the mean-reverting trend of the underlying process while satisfying the fundamental properties of the so-called herd behaviour indices. In a numerical study, we calibrate the different model settings to time series data for a period spanning from January 2000 until October 2009 and investigate their ability to predict the future behaviour of herd behaviour indices.","[Guillaume, Florence] Univ Antwerp, Dept Math & Comp Sci, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Linders, Daniel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Accountancy Finance & Insurance, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven,"Guillaume, F (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Middelheimlaan 1, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.",florence.guillaume@uantwerpen.be,"Linders, Daniel/GRE-9792-2022; Linders, Daniel/M-3241-2014","Linders, Daniel/0000-0003-4206-2149;",,,,,19,1,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

First, we analyse the statistical properties of estimated spread components in the market, which are obtained by using two statistical models to decompose the bid-ask spread. We then propose a fractional response regression model based on two flexible cross-sectional probability density functions with covariates which accommodate certain aspects of the empirical estimates, such as skewness and bounded distribution. Our model has two main advantages: (i) it can be implemented easily in a maximum likelihood framework; (ii) in contrast to linear regression models, it provides a useful estimate of the statistical significance of the parameters, and predicts costs not only at the conditional mean but also by using quantiles of the estimated conditional distribution. The empirical results corroborate the presence of statistically significant large order processing costs and smaller adverse selection and inventory costs in the SSE. These spread components have a skewed empirical distribution and the proposed fractional regression models represent the behaviour of these costs reasonably well, surpassing the linear regression model in various specification tests.","[Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V.; Gomez-Deniz, Emilio] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Gomez-Deniz, Emilio] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, TiDES Inst, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Pérez-Rodríguez, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",jv.perez-rodriguez@ulpgc.es,"Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V./Q-4827-2019","Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V./0000-0002-6738-9191; Gomez-Deniz, Emilio/0000-0002-5072-7908",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) [ECO2009-14152]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2011-23189],Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN)(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Emilio Gomez-Deniz thanks Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (project ECO2009-14152, MICINN) and Ti DES Institute.JorgeV.Perez-Rodriguez thanks Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (project ECO2011-23189).

Giga-investments have long economic lives and can often steer their markets: information available is non-stochastic, normative, and often imprecise. The type of uncertainty that faces giga-investments is parametric and structural. We use possibility theory as a mathematical framework for modeling giga-investment profitability and based on the profitability models derive a new and intuitive four-step procedure for pricing giga-investment project insurance that is based on creating a pay-out distribution for the giga-investment project insurance contract.

We introduce a Hawkes one-factor model which is able to capture simultaneously the time clustering of jumps and the high synchronization of jumps across assets.","[Bormetti, Giacomo; Calcagnile, Lucio Maria; Corsi, Fulvio; Marmi, Stefano; Lillo, Fabrizio] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo; Calcagnile, Lucio Maria; Treccani, Michele; Marmi, Stefano; Lillo, Fabrizio] QUANTLab, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Treccani, Michele] LIST SpA, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Marmi, Stefano] CNRS, UMI 3483, Lab Fibonacci, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Lillo, Fabrizio] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Chim & Fis, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Lillo, Fabrizio] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI); University of Palermo; The Santa Fe Institute,"Treccani, M (通讯作者)，QUANTLab, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",m.treccani@list-group.com,"Corsi, Fulvio/JPL-0067-2023; Marmi, Stefano/AAB-6240-2022","Corsi, Fulvio/0000-0003-2683-4479; Marmi, Stefano/0000-0001-5105-8876; Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505",Scuola Normale Superiore grant [GR12CALCAG]; European Union [CRISIS-ICT-2011-288501]; [SNS11LILLB],Scuola Normale Superiore grant; European Union(European Union (EU));,"GB and LMC acknowledge the support of the Scuola Normale Superiore grant GR12CALCAG Entropia di Shannon ed efficienza informativa dei mercati finanziari'.

However, as medical technology evolves, health outcomes for a number of obesity-related illnesses improve. This article examines whether medical innovation can mitigate the adverse health and spending associated with obesity, using statins as a case study. Because of the relationship between obesity and hypercholesterolaemia, statins play an important role in the medical management of obese individuals and the prevention of costly obesity-related sequelae. Using well-recognized estimates of the health impact of statins and the Future Elderly Model (FEM)-an established dynamic microsimulation model of the health of Americans aged over 50 years-we estimate the changes in life expectancy, functional status and health care costs of obesity due to the introduction and widespread use of statins. Life expectancy gains of statins are estimated to be 5-6 % greater for obese individuals than for healthy-weight individuals, but most of these additional gains are associated with some level of disability. Considering both medical spending and the value of quality-adjusted life-years, statins do not significantly alter the costs of class 1 and 2 obesity (body mass index [BMI] a parts per thousand yen30 and a parts per thousand yen35 kg/m(2), respectively) and they increase the costs of class 3 obesity (BMI a parts per thousand yen40 kg/m(2)) by 1.2 %. Although statins are very effective medications for lowering the risk of obesity-associated illnesses, they do not significantly reduce the costs of obesity.","[Gaudette, Etienne; Goldman, Dana P.; Messali, Andrew; Sood, Neeraj] Univ So Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downey Way,Suite 210, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Gaudette, É (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downey Way,Suite 210, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",egaudett@healthpolicy.usc.edu,"Goldman, Dana P/E-7667-2013","Goldman, Dana P/0000-0001-8498-6396; Sood, Neeraj/0000-0001-9805-213X; Gaudette, Etienne/0000-0003-0359-2083","National Institute on Aging through the Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation [P30AG024968, P01AG033559]",National Institute on Aging through the Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation,"The authors are grateful to Bryan Tysinger, Jeff Sullivan and Duncan Ermini Leaf for their expert technical help, and to the National Institute on Aging for its support through the Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation (grant no.

At the primary venue, trading yields a linear price impact. In the dark pool, no price impact costs arise but order execution is uncertain, modeled by a multidimensional Poisson process. We characterize the costs of trading by a linear-quadratic functional which incorporates both the price impact costs of trading at the primary exchange and the market risk of the position. The solution of the cost minimization problem is characterized by a matrix differential equation with singular boundary condition; by means of stochastic control theory, we provide a verification argument. If a single-asset position is to be liquidated, the investor slowly trades out of her position at the primary venue, with the remainder being placed in the dark pool at any point in time. For multi-asset liquidations this is generally not the case; for example, it can be optimal to oversize orders in the dark pool in order to turn a poorly balanced portfolio into a portfolio bearing less risk.","[Kratz, Peter] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13453 Marseille 13, France; [Schoeneborn, Torsten] Deutsch Bank AG, Berlin, Germany",Aix-Marseille Universite; Deutsche Bank,"Kratz, P (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Lab Anal, Topol, Probabilites, F-13453 Marseille 13, France.",kratz@math.hu-berlin.de,,,Deutsche Bank through the Quantitative Products Laboratory,Deutsche Bank through the Quantitative Products Laboratory,"We wish to thank Ulrich Horst, Werner Kratz, Nicholas Westray, and the anonymous referees for useful suggestions and comments.

The two main risks that reverse mortgage providers face are house price risk and longevity risk. Recent real estate literature has shown that the idiosyncratic component of house price risk is large. We analyse the combined impact of house price risk and longevity risk on the pricing and risk profile of reverse mortgage loans in a stochastic multi-period model. The model incorporates a new hybrid hedonic-repeat-sales pricing model for houses with specific characteristics, as well as a stochastic mortality model for mortality improvements along the cohort direction (the Wills-Sherris model). Our results show that pricing based on an aggregate house price index does not accurately assess the risks underwritten by reverse mortgage lenders, and that failing to take into account cohort trends in mortality improvements substantially underestimates the longevity risk involved in reverse mortgage loans.

For rational players to usually restrict attention to a block of conventional strategies, no player should prefer to deviate from the block when others are likely to act conventionally and rationally inside the block. We explore two set-valued concepts, coarsely and finely tenable blocks, that formalize this notion for finite normal-form games. We then identify settled equilibria, which are Nash equilibria with support in minimal tenable blocks. For a generic class of normal-form games, our coarse and fine concepts are equivalent, and yet they differ from standard solution concepts on open sets of games. We demonstrate the nature and power of the solutions by way of examples. Settled equilibria are closely related to persistent equilibria but are strictly more selective on an open set of games. With fine tenability, we obtain invariance under the insertion of a subgame with a unique totally mixed payoff-equivalent equilibrium, a property that other related concepts have not satisfied.","[Myerson, Roger] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weibull, Jorgen] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Weibull, Jorgen] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, Stockholm, Sweden; [Weibull, Jorgen] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Math, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Chicago; Stockholm School of Economics; Royal Institute of Technology,"Myerson, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",rmyerson@uchicago.edu; jorgen.weibull@hhs.se,,,,,,,51,16,17,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2015,83,3,,,,,943,976,,10.3982/ECTA11048,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CK1TO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000355990500005,0

He proposed a new dominance relation incorporating farsightedness, but retained another feature of the stable set: that a coalition S can impose any imputation as long as its restriction to S is feasible for it. This implicitly gives an objecting coalition complete power to arrange the payoffs of players elsewhere, which is clearly unsatisfactory. While this assumption is largely innocuous for myopic dominance, it is of crucial significance for its farsighted counterpart. Our modification of the Harsanyi set respects coalitional sovereignty. The resulting farsighted stable set is very different from both the Harsanyi and the vNM sets. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a farsighted stable set containing just a single-payoff allocation. This condition roughly establishes an equivalence between core allocations and the union of allocations over all single-payoff farsighted stable sets. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existence and structure of farsighted stable sets in simple games. This last exercise throws light on both single-payoff and multi-payoff stable sets, and suggests that they do not coexist.","[Ray, Debraj] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Vohra, Rajiv] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",New York University; Brown University,"Ray, D (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",debraj.ray@nyu.edu; rajiv_vohra@brown.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1261560]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1261560] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are extremely grateful to Salvatore Nunnari for discussions on simple games with veto.

The examination reveals that the program has gained dominance primarily through its adherence to the scientific banner and style rather than its empirical relevance. The adoption of the hard science methodology is decisive in winning over the academic community; the taxonomy of econometrics into steps involving primarily specification, identification, and estimation has played a pivotal role in generating compartmentalized research topics with manageable technical challenge and also in facilitating the educational need for compiling self-contained subjects and definitely soluble questions.","[Qin, Duo] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London,"Qin, D (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London WC1E 7HU, England.",dq1@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,114,3,4,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

In them, he distinguished the definition of causal parameters from their identification. He showed that causal parameters are defined using hypothetical models that assign variation to some of the inputs determining outcomes while holding all other inputs fixed. He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) commonly used in the literature of causality (Pearl, 2000) and Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare the analysis of causality based on a methodology inspired by Haavelmo's ideas with other approaches used in the causal literature of DAGs. We discuss the limitations of methods that solely use the information expressed in DAGs for the identification of economic models. We extend our framework to consider models for simultaneous causality, a central contribution of Haavelmo.","[Heckman, James; Pinto, Rodrigo] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Pinto, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1155 E 60th St,Room 215, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",rodrig@uchicago.com,"Pinto, Rodrigo/IYS-8176-2023",,"American Bar Foundation; European Research Council [DEVHEALTH-269874, NICHD R37-HD065072]",American Bar Foundation; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"This research was supported in part by the American Bar Foundation, a grant from the European Research Council DEVHEALTH-269874, and NICHD R37-HD065072.

Salient concerns for fairness include the view that priority should be given to the severely ill over the less severely ill, that people have a right to realize their potential for health even if their capacity to benefit from treatment is moderate, and that everybody has the same right to treatment that averts premature death, even if their health and functional level is less than perfect. Cost-value analysis incorporates these concerns in formal economic evaluation of health interventions and programs and thus has a potential for ranking interventions and programs in a way that is more consistent with societal values. Data on the strength of public concerns for fairness are now sufficient to be useful in formal economic evaluation. The data may, within a context of fair and open deliberations, help societal decision makers to roughly indicate the societal value of a QALY in different circumstances and thus determine a tentative grading of willingness to pay for a QALY.","Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, N-0403 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Nord, E (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, POB 4404, N-0403 Oslo, Norway.",erik.nord@folkehelsa.no,,,,,,,28,14,14,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2015,33,2,,,,,89,95,,10.1007/s40273-014-0212-4,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AZ7FJ,25488879.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348384300002,0

Hong Huay) is one of the most economically important fruit products in Thailand, especially in the highlands of Chiang Mai where litchi can have natural off-season flowering even during the rainy season (June to August). The off-season production of litchi is not a common practice in the region because the physiological responses of litchi trees to flower induction techniques are still unclear. Therefore, we aim to use Random Forests (RF) as a tool to understand the effects of horticultural techniques on plant hormone dynamic or generative shoot development. A field experiment was conducted considering four horticultural treatments, namely (1) control, (2) girdling, (3) foliar spraying with 1% of monopotassium phosphate (0-52-34) and ethephon 800 mg/l, and (4) combination of girdling and foliar spraying. The girdling was applied at the end of leaf development stage. Foliar spray was applied three times at 7-d intervals from 14 days after girdling. Random Forests (RF) was applied to compute the percentage of flowering from plant hormone concentrations observed on 0, 7, 21, 35, 49, 56 and 63 days after the treatment, and to evaluate variable importance to illustrate physiological responses to horticultural treatments. In the field experiment, the three horticultural techniques could induce off-season flowering, while untreated trees had no flower, but leaf flushing. The RF model showed fair performance for modelling the percentage of flowering. The variable importance illustrated the effects of plant hormones in different tissues (i.e. wood, bark, leaves and apical bud) and timing (i.e. sampling dates). The variable importance of the total cytokinins and zeatin/zeatin riboside were observed to be high in wood, leaves and apical bud, while the importance of auxin in bark, wood and apical bud was found to be low on day 35. The RF model could present additional information for a deeper understanding of plant hormone dynamics in plant tissues and critical timing required for flower induction, which can be used for better and improved farmers' management and practices in the future.

They were slaughtered and dressed in USDA style. The experiment was designed by using t-test statistical analysis with two treatments, either Pietrain x Native (PxN) or Pietrain x Duroc (PxD). Pigs were slaughtered at an average weight of 88.8 vs 101 kg for PxN and PxD, respectively (P<0.05). PxN had a lower carcass weight (66.0 vs 73.5 kg, P<0.01), lean percentage (50.7 vs 59.9, P<0.01), loin eye area (47.2 vs 60.1 cm(2), p<0.01) and carcass length (75.1 vs 78.9 cm, P<0.01), but a higher total fat percentage (11.4 vs 7.6, P<0.01), compared with PxD. The ham percentage of PxN was lower than that of PxD (33.6 vs 34.6, P<0.01). Meat pH at 45 min and 24 h post mortem was found to be lower in PxN in both Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Semimembranosus (SM) muscle (6.03 and 5.63 vs 6.04 and 5.72) compared with PxD (6.47 and 5.96 vs 6.71 and 5.95, respectively). The meat of PxN was lighter (L*) than that of DxP (53.4 vs 48.6, P<0.01). There were no significant differences for redness (a*), yellowness (b*), TBARS value and collagen content. The LD of PxN was found to be lower in moisture (72.1 vs 73.6, P<0.05), protein (22.4 vs 23.3, P<0.01) and higher in fat content (5.37 vs 2.85, P<0.01) compared with PxD. The results of this study suggest that crosses with the robust breed Duroc, could be an alternative genotype in commercial Thai pork production because most performance, carcass and meat quality traits were superior to those of crossbreds with the native pig genotype. However, NxP provided favorably more intramuscular fat. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this article, we report the results of a literature review, focusing on nine European countries, with the aim of investigating how value is defined from the perspective of different stakeholders, how definitions of value are used, and how value is incorporated into decision making. Only three articles were identified that presented definitions of value, and there was no single shared definition of value in healthcare, which appears to be a highly subjective concept. The majority of the countries investigated combine clinical assessment with economic evaluation to make reimbursement recommendations; the quality-adjusted life-year is the most commonly used measure of value but does not capture broader aspects of value that may be important to patients and healthcare systems. We describe the use of value-based pricing and multi-criteria decision analysis, two approaches to the incorporation of broader aspects of value into decision making. Overall, we have identified considerable variation in how a product's value is defined by different stakeholders. Although a universal understanding of value in healthcare is important, it is clear that current definitions are insufficient, potentially leading to inconsistent reimbursement decisions. Ultimately, the establishment of clearer policies for defining and measuring value in healthcare is needed, and is likely to lead to improvements in the consistency of decision making.","[Antonanzas, Fernando] Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, Logrono, Spain; [Terkola, Robert] Univ Florida, Coll Pharm, Gainesville, FL USA; [Terkola, Robert] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacotherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTE2, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Healthy Aging & healthcaRE SHARE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands",Universidad de La Rioja; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Antoñanzas, F (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, Logrono, Spain.",fernando.antonanzas@unirioja.es,"Terkola, Robert/R-4048-2019; Antonanzas, Fernando/F-4610-2016","Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Antonanzas, Fernando/0000-0001-6122-9130","Novartis Pharma, Basel, under the AGORA initiative (a European Think Tank that aims to optimize access for patients to innovative treatments)","Novartis Pharma, Basel, under the AGORA initiative (a European Think Tank that aims to optimize access for patients to innovative treatments)","Research and editorial support was funded by Novartis Pharma, Basel, under the AGORA initiative (a European Think Tank that aims to optimize access for patients to innovative treatments).",,78,18,18,0,22,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2016,34,12,,,,,1227,1239,,10.1007/s40273-016-0434-8,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EC4ZK,27444306.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388142700003,0

However, as all policyholders' benefits are linked to common equity indices or funds, the classical assumption of independent claims is clearly inappropriate for equity-linked insurance. In other words, the strong law of large numbers fails to apply in the classical sense. In this paper, we investigate this fundamental question regarding the validity of strong laws of large numbers for equity-linked insurance. As a result, extensions of classical laws of large numbers and central limit theorem are presented, which are shown to apply to a great variety of equity-linked insurance products.

In this work, a novel second-order approximation for at-the-money (ATM) option prices is derived for a large class of exponential Levy models with or without Brownian component. The results hereafter shed new light on the connection between both the volatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters and the behavior of ATM option prices near expiration. In the presence of a Brownian component, the second-order term, in time-t, is of the form d2t(3-Y)/2, with d(2) only depending on Y, the degree of jump activity, on sigma, the volatility of the continuous component, and on an additional parameter controlling the intensity of the small jumps (regardless of their signs). This extends the well-known result that the leading first-order term is sigma t1/2/. In contrast, under a pure-jump model, the dependence on Y and on the separate intensities of negative and positive small jumps are already reflected in the leading term, which is of the form d1t1/Y. The second-order term is shown to be of the form d2t and, therefore, its order of decay turns out to be independent of Y. The asymptotic behavior of the corresponding Black-Scholes implied volatilities is also addressed. Our method of proof is based on an integral representation of the option price involving the tail probability of the log-return process under the share measure and a suitable change of probability measure under which the pure-jump component of the log-return process becomes a Y-stable process. Our approach is sufficiently general to cover a wide class of Levy processes, which satisfy the latter property and whose Levy density can be closely approximated by a stable density near the origin. Our numerical results show that the first-order term typically exhibits rather poor performance and that the second-order term can significantly improve the approximation's accuracy, particularly in the absence of a Brownian component.","[Figueroa-Lopez, Jose E.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Gong, Ruoting] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Houdre, Christian] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Figueroa-López, JE (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",figueroa@purdue.edu,,,"NSF [DMS-1149692, DMS-0906919]; Simons Foundation [246283]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Simons Foundation,"We gratefully acknowledge the constructive and insightful comments provided by two anonymous referees, which significantly contributed to improve the quality of the manuscript.

Automatic procedures to upgrade or downgrade risk exposure could potentially improve long term performance for such products. The risk and return of bonds is more easy to predict than the risk and return of stocks. This and the well known stock-bond correlation motivates the inclusion of the current bond yield in a model for the prediction of excess stock returns. Here, we take the actuarial long term view using yearly data, and focus on nonlinear relationships between a set of covariates. We employ fully nonparametric models and apply for estimation a local-linear kernel smoother. Since the current bond yield is not known, it is predicted in a prior step. The structure imposed this way in the final estimation process helps to circumvent the curse of dimensionality and reduces bias in the estimation of excess stock returns. Our validated stock prediction results show that predicted bond returns improve stock prediction significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An attractive feature of these new methods is that there is no need to estimate either the entire heavy-tailed loss distribution or the tail region of the distribution. Furthermore, we provide algorithms that facilitate applied researchers and practitioners in risk management area to implement the sophisticated empirical likelihood ratio (ELR) based methodologies to construct the CI of the true underlying 99.9% OpVaR. In a simulation study, we find that the weighted ELR (WELR) CI estimator is more reliable than the ELR CI estimator. The empirical results show that the nonparametric OpVaR estimates are consistently larger than those of other comparable methods, which provide adequate regulatory capitals, particularly during crises. The findings have implications for regulators, and effective and efficient risk financing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Funding decisions for these therapies requires weighing up their effectiveness and costs. The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of monotherapy with oral PAH-specific therapies versus supportive care as initial therapy for patients with functional class (FC) II and III PAH in Canada. A cost-utility analysis, from the perspective of a healthcare system and based on a Markov model, was designed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with bosentan, ambrisentan, riociguat, tadalafil, sildenafil and supportive care for PAH in treatment-na < ve patients. Separate analyses were conducted for cohorts of patients commencing therapy at FC II and III PAH. Transition probabilities, based on the relative risk of improving and worsening in FC with treatment versus placebo, were derived from a recent network meta-analysis. Utility values and costs were obtained from published data and clinical expert opinion. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. Analysis suggests that sildenafil is the most cost-effective therapy for PAH in patients with FC II or III. Sildenafil was both the least costly and most effective therapy, thereby dominating all other treatments. Tadalafil was also less costly and more effective than supportive care in FC II and III; however, sildenafil was dominant over tadalafil. Even given the uncertainty within the clinical inputs, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that apart from sildenafil and tadalafil, the other PAH therapies had negligible probability of being the most cost effective. The results show that initiation of therapy with sildenafil is likely the most cost-effective strategy in PAH patients with either FC II or III disease.","[Coyle, Kathryn; Coyle, Doug] Brunel Univ, Gaskell Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Coyle, Doug] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Blouin, Julie; Lee, Karen; Jabr, Mohammed F.; Khai Tran; Innes, Mike] Canadian Agcy Drugs & Technol Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mielniczuk, Lisa] Univ Ottawa, Inst Heart, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Swiston, John] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Brunel University; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute; University of British Columbia,"Coyle, K (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Gaskell Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Kathryn.Coyle@brunel.ac.uk,,"Coyle, Doug/0000-0003-3492-2268",Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH),Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH),This research was supported by funds from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH).,,45,21,22,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2016,34,5,,,,,509,520,,10.1007/s40273-015-0366-8,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DJ4HO,26739957.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374166200008,0

While effective, sofosbuvir is also associated with a considerable cost. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir-containing regimens in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 5 (HCV-G5) mono-infection in South Africa (SA). We constructed a lifetime horizon decision-analytic Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection to evaluate the cost effectiveness of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) monotherapy against sofosbuvir triple therapy (SOF-TT) (sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin [peg-INF/RBV]) and the current standard of care (SOC) (peg-INF/RBV) for patients with chronic HCV-G5 in the South African context. The model was populated with data from published literature, expert opinion and South African private sector cost data. The price modelled for sofosbuvir was the predicted South African private sector price of 82,129.32 South African rand (R) (US$7000) for 12 weeks. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective. The outcome measures were discounted and undiscounted costs (in 2015 South African rand and US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Outcomes from the cost-effectiveness model show that SOF/LDV yields the most favourable future health economic outcomes compared with SOF-TT and the current SOC in SA. Findings relating to the lifetime incremental cost per QALY gained for patients infected with HCV-G5 indicate that SOF/LDV dominated both SOF-TT and SOC, i.e. SOF/LDV is less costly and more effective.

In only 14 years, a drastic shift in public opinion required two constitutional amendments. I develop and estimate a model of endogenous law enforcement, determined by beliefs about the Prohibition-crime nexus and alcohol-related moral views. In turn, the policy outcomes shape subsequent learning about Prohibition enforcement costs. I estimate the model through maximum likelihood on Prohibition Era city-level data on police enforcement, crime, and alcohol-related legislation. The model can account for the variation in public opinion changes, and the heterogeneous responses of law enforcement and violence across cities. Results show that a 15% increase in the homicide rate can be attributed to Prohibition enforcement. The subsequent learning-driven adjustment of local law enforcement allowed for the alcohol market to rebound to 60% of its pre-Prohibition size. I conclude with counterfactual exercises exploring the welfare implications of policy learning, prior beliefs, preference polarization, and alternative political environments. Results illustrate the importance of incorporating the endogenous nature of law enforcement into our understanding of policy failure and policy success.","[Garcia-Jimeno, Camilo] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk,McNeil Bldg,Off 528, Philadelphia, PA 19147 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"García-Jimeno, C (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk,McNeil Bldg,Off 528, Philadelphia, PA 19147 USA.",gcamilo@sas.upenn.edu,,,MIT's George and Obie Schultz Fund; Banco de la Republica de Colombia,MIT's George and Obie Schultz Fund; Banco de la Republica de Colombia,"This paper is based on the first chapter of my Ph.D. dissertation at MIT.

First, we consider entrance times of random walks, i.e. the time of first entry to the negative axis. Partition sum formulas are given for entrance time probabilities, the nth derivative of the generating function, and the nth falling factorial entrance time moment. Similar formulas for the characteristic function of the position of the random walk both conditioned on entry and conditioned on no entry are also established. Second, we consider a model for a with-profits collective pension fund. The model has previously been studied by approximate methods, but we give here an essentially complete theoretical description of the model based on the entrance time results. We also conduct a mean-variance analysis for a fund in stationarity. To facilitate the analysis we devise a simple and effective exact simulation algorithm for sampling from the stationary distribution of a regenerative Markov chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The surplus process of the insurer is described by the diffusion model which is an approximation of the classical Cramer-Lundberg model. The insurer can purchase reinsurance and invest her surplus in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and multiple risky assets. The insurer is not allowed to short sell the risky assets. Two optimization problems, maximizing the expected utility function of terminal wealth and minimizing the probability of ruin, are considered. We first derive the form of optimal reinsurance for the two optimization problems. Then, by using the stochastic dynamic programming, we obtain the closed-form expressions of optimal investment and reinsurance strategies and optimal value functions for the two optimization problems. We find that our results are more general than some ones in the existing literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main difference between these two approaches is the information of default identities. In this paper, we propose a conditional top-down approach which models the default times with a predetermined default order of identities. Thus conditioned on the default order, the default times of a bottom-up model can be constructed simply using a top-down approach. We use the tool of assumptions to separate the information of default orders from the ordered default times. The predetermined assumption (a special H assumption) introduced here allows that the construction of the loss process relates to a probability on permutations. We can derive the probabilities on default orders from the known bottom-up models satisfying the predetermined assumption (e.g. Jarrow-Yu's contagion model), and obtain new choices of probability on default orders based on some simple and interesting indices of permutations such as the inverse index. Furthermore, under the predetermined assumption, some generic pricing problems of the bottom-up models can be simplified to the special case of the conditional Markov loss model. We then apply these results to Jarrow-Yu's contagion model and give an efficient approach to the pricing problem of CDO tranches, where new expansions of the loss distributions are derived by the random matrix exponential.","[Tang, Lian; Xiang, Kai-Nan] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Sci, Guilin 541004, Guangxi, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Guilin University of Technology,"Wang, B (通讯作者)，Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Sci, Guilin 541004, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",binwang@glut.edu.cn,"Xiang, Kai-Nan/B-4014-2008",,"NSFC [11271204, 11401127]; Guangxi Natural Science Foundation [2014GXNSFCA118015, 2014GXNSFBA118006]; startup Grant in Guilin University of Technology",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province); startup Grant in Guilin University of Technology,"The work is supported partially by NSFC [No. 11271204 and 11401127], Guangxi Natural Science Foundation [No. 2014GXNSFCA118015, 2014GXNSFBA118006] and the startup Grant in Guilin University of Technology.",,32,0,0,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Rational expectations models have been proposed to explain these phenomena; however, such models suffer from a number of criticisms, including lack of experimental support. Moreover, they assume unbiased forecasts without explaining how the investors form their forecasts. In this paper, we provide a model of asset price forecasts and market prices that can be calibrated with experimental data and that can capture various behavioural characteristics of investors such as confidence and panic. We study the resulting dynamical system and show that asset price bubbles may result from seemingly reasonable forecasts and decisions of investors. The model attempts to provide insight into the qualitative connection between investors' forecasting behaviour and the formation of bubbles and cycles. We present results on the convergence of the process to a fixed point, or to an attractor that describes a price cycle, or to long-run behaviour that seems unpredictable, and we consider where in the cycles most time is spent.","[Cheriyan, Vinod; Kleywegt, Anton J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Cheriyan, V (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",vinod.cheriyan@gatech.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CMMI-0700161],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number CMMI-0700161].,,71,5,7,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In total, we have access to 399 individual specific variables that all could potentially impact the retirement decision. We use variants of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and the adaptive Lasso applied to logistic regression in order to uncover determinants of the retirement decision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of these estimators in microeconometrics to a problem of this type and scale. Furthermore, we investigate whether the factors influencing the retirement decision are stable over time, gender, and marital status. It is found that this is the case for core variables such as age, income, wealth, and general health.

We identify and estimate the model with a large panel that matches data on publicly listed firms to information on their executives. The structural estimates obtained are used to decompose the firm-size pay gap. We find that although total compensation and incentive pay increase with firm size, certainty-equivalent pay decreases with firm size. In larger firms, and for more highly ranked executives, weaker signal quality about effort results in higher risk premiums. This risk premium accounts for roughly 80 percent of the firm-size gap in total compensation. Larger firms are also willing to pay more than smaller ones to attract executives. Finally, the estimated coefficients on human capital accumulation from formal education and experience gained from different firms are individually significant, but their collective effect on firm-size pay differentials nets out.","[Gayle, George-Levi; Golan, Limor] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Miller, Robert A.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Carnegie Mellon University,"Gayle, GL (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",glgayle@me.com; lim.golan@gmail.com; ramiller@andrew.cmu.edu,,,"Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation and Performance in Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation [SES0721098]","Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation and Performance in Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the editor of this journal and three anonymous referees for their comments.

Although there is no proven effective method to prevent pre-eclampsia, early identification of women at risk of pre-eclampsia could enhance appropriate application of antenatal care, management and treatment. Very little is known about the cost effectiveness of these and other tests for pre-eclampsia, mainly because there is no clear treatment path. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on the health economics of screening, diagnosis and treatment options in pre-eclampsia. We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) for studies on screening, diagnosis, treatment or prevention of pre-eclampsia, published between 1994 and 2014. Only full papers written in English containing complete economic assessments in pre-eclampsia were included. From an initial total of 138 references, six papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Three studies were on the cost effectiveness of treatment of pre-eclampsia, two of which evaluated magnesium sulphate for prevention of seizures and the third evaluated the cost effectiveness of induction of labour versus expectant monitoring. The other three studies were aimed at screening and diagnosis, in combination with subsequent preventive measures. The two studies on magnesium sulphate were equivocal on the cost effectiveness in non-severe cases, and the other study suggested that induction of labour in term pre-eclampsia was more cost effective than expectant monitoring. The screening studies were quite diverse in their objectives as well as in their conclusions. One study concluded that screening is probably not worthwhile, while two other studies stated that in certain scenarios it may be cost effective to screen all pregnant women and prophylactically treat those who are found to be at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive overview on the economic aspects of pre-eclampsia in its broadest sense, ranging from screening to treatment options. The main limitation of the present study lies in the variety of topics in combination with the limited number of papers that could be included; this restricted the comparisons that could be made. In conclusion, novel biomarkers in screening for and diagnosing pre-eclampsia show promise, but their accuracy is a major driver of cost effectiveness, as is prevalence. Universal screening for pre-eclampsia, using a biomarker, will be feasible only when accuracy is significantly increased.","[Zakiyah, Neily; Postma, Maarten J.; van Asselt, Antoinette D.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the company and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) final decision in October 2014. The clinical evidence for dabrafenib was derived from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BREAK-3) involving 230 patients randomized 2:1 to receive either dabrafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) was reported in the dabrafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. Vemurafenib is considered a more appropriate comparator than is dacarbazine. The clinical evidence for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib, the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted. Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) generated by the company were A 60,980 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and A 11,046 pound per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus vemurafenib. The ERG considered the economic model structure developed by the company to derive the ICERs to be overly complex and based on unsubstantiated assumptions, most importantly in relation to the projection of OS. Applying the latest OS data from BREAK-3 to a less complex model structure increased the estimated ICER for dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine from A 60,980 pound to A 112,727 pound per QALY gained. Since the results from the ITC were considered by the ERG to be neither reliable nor robust, the ERG also considered a cost-effectiveness comparison to be inappropriate due to a lack of meaningful or reliable data. In spite of limitations in the data, the AC took the view that dabrafenib and vemurafenib were likely of similar clinical effectiveness. Since the overall costs of these two drugs were similar, the AC recommended the use of dabrafenib in patients with unresectable, advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.","[Fleeman, Nigel; Bagust, Adrian; Beale, Sophie; Boland, Angela; Dickson, Rumona; Dwan, Kerry; Richardson, Marty; Dundar, Yenal] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Davis, Helen; Banks, Lindsay] North West Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Fleeman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",Nigel.Fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk,"Dundar, Yenal/JZT-0760-2024; Dwan, Kerry/AFK-6469-2022; Dwan, Kerry/AAG-4726-2022; Dundar, Yenal/AAU-8336-2020","Dwan, Kerry/0000-0001-6918-1215; Dwan, Kerry/0000-0001-6918-1215; Dundar, Yenal/0000-0002-9847-1622; Richardson, Marty/0000-0002-7097-8704",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme [12/54],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 12/54).

In this paper, we explore how an alternative reinforcement learning model, where the strategy of each agent is perturbed by a strategy-dependent perturbation (or mutations) function, may exclude convergence to non-Nash pure strategy profiles. This approach extends prior analysis on reinforcement learning in games that addresses the issue of convergence to saddle boundary points. It further provides a framework under which the effect of mutations can be analyzed in the context of reinforcement learning.","[Chasparis, Georgios C.] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg GmbH, Dept Data Anal Syst, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Shamma, Jeff S.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Rantzer, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Automat Control, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Softwarepark Hagenberg; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Lund University,"Chasparis, GC (通讯作者)，Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg GmbH, Dept Data Anal Syst, Softwarepk 21, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria.",georgios.chasparis@scch.at; shamma@gatech.edu; rantzer@control.lth.se,"Chasparis, Georgios/D-5278-2014","Chasparis, Georgios/0000-0003-3059-3575",Swedish Research Council through the Linnaeus Center LCCC; AFOSR MURI [FA9550-09-1-0538],Swedish Research Council through the Linnaeus Center LCCC(Swedish Research Council); AFOSR MURI(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)MURI),This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council through the Linnaeus Center LCCC and the AFOSR MURI project #FA9550-09-1-0538.,,30,8,9,1,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

We consider a dynamic model where traders with heterogeneous deadlines are matched randomly into pairs who then bargain about the division of a fixed surplus. A trader leaves the market when an agreement has been reached or when his deadline expires. Our analysis encompasses both the case of perfect and imperfect information about the partner's deadline. We define, characterize and show the existence of a stationary equilibrium configuration. We characterize when delay occurs and when deadlines are missed in equilibrium and show that the payoffs of traders are strictly increasing and concave in own deadline, unless bargaining takes place under imperfect information and no delay occurs, in which case all pairs immediately agree on an almost even split. We provide comparative statics exercises and illustrate our results by some examples.","[Hurkens, Sjaak] Inst Analisi Econ CSIC, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Hurkens, Sjaak] Barcelona GSE, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Vulkan, Nir] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch & Worcester Coll, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics; University of Oxford,"Hurkens, S (通讯作者)，Inst Analisi Econ CSIC, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",sjaak.hurkens@iae.csic.es; nir.vulkan@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"Hurkens, Sjaak/H-6287-2015","Hurkens, Sjaak/0000-0002-8472-5740","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37065]; AGAUR [2014SGR510, SEV-2011-0075]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)),"Hurkens gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through grant ECO2012-37065, from AGAUR through grant 2014SGR510 and through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R&D (SEV-2011-0075).

In this paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a trade arrival model with variable size orders and a general arrival-time distribution. With simplifications we are led in the jump-free case to a local volatility model defined by a hybrid SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric or CIR Brownian motions, whose solution in the geometric case is given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered by Nagahara, which is a type of 'Pearson diffusion', or, equivalently, a hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type~IV form. Under less-restrictive assumptions, richer dynamics are possible, including time-dependent Johnson-SU distributions and bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a priori been expected, so that '25 sigma' events are significantly more probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market behaviors. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity. We touch briefly on the extent to which such a model is consistent with the dynamics of a 'flash-crash' event, and briefly explore the statistical evidence for our model.","[Shaw, William T.; Schofield, Marcus] UCL, Dept Math, London, England; [Shaw, William T.] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Shaw, WT (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Math, London, England.",w.shaw@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,79,5,6,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Their introduction is motivated by reasons of analytical and computational facilitation. Their definition provides an indirect inference framework for some classical bias correction procedures. We derive higher-order asymptotic properties of these estimators. We demonstrate that under our assumption framework, and in the special case of deterministic weighting and affinity of the binding function, these are second-order unbiased. Moreover, their second-order approximate mean square errors do not depend on the cardinality of the Monte Carlo or bootstrap samples that our definition might involve. Consequently, the second-order mean square error of the auxiliary estimator is not altered. We extend this to a class of multistep indirect inference estimators that have zero higher-order bias without increasing the approximate mean square error, up to the same order. Our theoretical results are also validated by three Monte Carlo experiments.","[Arvanitis, Stelios] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, GR-10434 Athens, Greece; [Demos, Antonis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, GR-10434 Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Arvanitis, S (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Patis Str 80, GR-10434 Athens, Greece.",stelios@aueb.gr; demos@aueb.gr,"Demos, Antonis/ABA-9763-2020",,BRFP II Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB),BRFP II Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB),"The authors would like to thank, without implicating them, the seminar participants at the University of Ioannina and the conference participants of EEQ-ESEM 2012.

This article first reviews alternative methods that obtain the common factors by solving a Procrustes problem. While these matrix decomposition methods do not specify the probabilistic structure of the data and hence do not permit statistical evaluations of the estimates, they can be extended to analyze categorical data. This involves the additional step of quantifying the ordinal and nominal variables. The article then reviews and explores the numerical properties of these methods. An interesting finding is that the factor space can be quite precisely estimated directly from categorical data without quantification. This may require using a larger number of estimated factors to compensate for the information loss in categorical variables. Separate treatment of categorical and continuous variables may not be necessary if structural interpretation of the factors is not required, such as in forecasting exercises.","Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University,"Ng, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 W 118 St, New York, NY 10025 USA.",serena.ng@columbia.edu,"Ng, Serena/AAA-1003-2020","Ng, Serena/0000-0003-2684-364X",National Science Foundation [SES-0962431],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Financial support from the National Science Foundation (SES-0962431) is gratefully acknowledged.,,57,5,5,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Another important generalization of -out-of- games with origin in economics and politics are weighted and roughly weighted majority games. Weighted hierarchical games have been classified by Beimel et al. (SIAM J Discret Math 22(1):360-397, 2008) and Gvozdeva et al.

In this paper we characterize roughly weighted hierarchical games and show that they cannot have more than three nontrivial levels. This shows that hierarchical games are rather far from weighted and even roughly weighted games, and hence provide an interesting set of examples for the theory of simple games.

This is especially important in light of the aggravating risk of longevity and as a result the increasing demand for longevity-linked products. In the literature so far, only parameter error and process error have been considered jointly while the issue of model error has yet been systematically studied. In this paper, we propose a method to account for process error, parameter error and model error in an integrated manner by modifying the semi-parametric bootstrapping technique. We apply the method to two data sets from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) and use the simulated scenarios to price the q-forward contracts via the maximum entropy approach. We find that model selection has a significant impact on the risk-neutral valuation results and thus it is crucial to incorporate model error in mortality projection.

Riskiness of a cooperative equilibrium is based on a pairwise comparison between this equilibrium and the uniquely safe all defect equilibrium. It is a strategic concept heuristically related to Harsanyi and Selten's risk dominance. Riskiness 0 defines the same critical discount factor delta* that was derived with an axiomatic approach for equilibrium selection in Blonski et al. (Am Econ J 3:164-192, 2011). Our theory predicts that the less risky cooperation is the more forgiving can parties afford to be if a deviator needs to be punished.

The objectives of this study were to describe the evaluation process and to examine the movement of drugs through the process. The movement of all drugs submitted to the NCPE (from January 2010 to December 2015 inclusive) was investigated. A total of 230 Rapid Review submissions (each pertaining to one drug for one indication) were made. The Rapid Review process determines the requirement for a full PE. A full PE was deemed unnecessary in 108 cases (47 %). A positive reimbursement recommendation was made in 100 of these (a price reductions was advised in 25 cases and a recommendation to restrict/monitor usage was made in 35). The requirement for a full PE was recognised in 122 cases (53 %). In 12, subsequent payer-led price negotiations negated the requirement for a full PE, and reimbursement was recommended. In 24 cases, a timely full submission was not made; cost effectiveness could not be established. Fifteen interventions are currently going through the submission process. To date, 71 full PEs have been completed by the NCPE. Reimbursement was recommended in 19 and was not recommended in eight. Reimbursement was not recommended 'at the submitted price' in 44. Of these, reimbursement was subsequently approved in 34 (77 %) following price negotiations. To date, negotiations are on-going in a further six cases. In all, negotiations have been informed by the NCPE. A negative recommendation was reached in the remaining four. Over the study period, the NCPE evaluated 230 drugs for which reimbursement was sought.

This paper aims to characterise the burden of nocturia by comparing published data from patients with nocturia with data from patients with any of 12 other common chronic conditions, specifically focusing on its impact on work productivity and activity impairment, as measured by the instrument of the same name (WPAI). A systematic literature review of multiple data sources identified evaluable studies for inclusion in the analysis. Study eligibility criteria included use of the WPAI instrument in patients with one of a predefined list of chronic conditions. We assessed the quality of each included study using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and extracted basic study information, work and activity impairment data. To assess how work and activity impairment from nocturia compares with impairment from other common chronic diseases, we conducted two data syntheses (pooled and unpooled). The number of evaluable studies and the range of overall work productivity impairment reported, respectively, were as follows: nocturia (3; 14-39 %), overactive bladder (5; 11-41 %), irritable bowel syndrome/constipation (14; 21-51 %), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (13; 6-42 %), asthma/allergies (11; 6-40 %), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (7; 19-42 %), sleep problems (3; 12-37 %), arthritis (13; 21-69 %), pain (9; 29-64 %), depression (4; 15-43 %) and gout (2; 20-37 %). The overall work productivity impairment as a result of nocturia is substantial and was found to be similar to impairment observed as a result of several other more frequently researched common chronic diseases. Greater awareness of the burden of nocturia, a highly bothersome and prevalent condition, will help policy makers and healthcare decision makers provide appropriate management of nocturia.","[Miller, Paul S.

Such games are used in modeling abstract economies and other games where players share common constraints. Our approach circumvents the difficulties that arise from the presence of discontinuities by modifying the original problem and allowing the players to use strategies that possibly lie outside their feasible sets. We then show that each modified game has -equilibria points. Under certain conditions, and as the extent of modification becomes smaller and smaller and approaches zero, the -equilibria points of the modified games will converge to a strategy profile that is an equilibrium of the original game. Hence, we obtain a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of pure equilibria of the original game. We apply our results to a number of classic games that have discontinuous payoffs and discontinuous constraint correspondences.","[Bagh, Adib] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Bagh, Adib] Univ Kentucky, Dept Math, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Kentucky; University of Kentucky,"Bagh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.;Bagh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Math, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",aba223@uky.edu,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Our approach, suitable to stable economic regimes as well as stress scenarios, introduces a mathematical framework where the lapse intensity follows a dynamic contagion process, see Dassios and Zhao (2011). This allows to capture both contagion and correlation potentially arising among insureds' behaviors. In this framework, an external market driven jump component drives the lapse intensity process depending on the interest rate trajectory: when the spread between the market interest rates and the contractual crediting rate crosses a given threshold, the insurer is likely to experience more surrenders. A log-normal dynamic for the forward rates is introduced to build trajectories of an observable market variable and mimic the effect of a macroeconomic triggering event based on interest rates on the lapse intensity. Contrary to previous works, our shot-noise intensity is not constant and the resulting intensity process is not Markovian. Closed-form expressions and analytic sensitivities for the moments of the lapse intensity are provided, showing how lapses can be affected by massive copycat behaviors. Further analyses are then conducted to illustrate how the mean risk varies depending on the model's parameters, while a simulation study compares our results with those obtained using standard practices. The numerical outputs highlight a potential misestimation of the expected number of lapses under extreme scenarios when using classical stress testing methodologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The most general approach to performing these computations is that of nested simulations. However, this method is also hardly realistic because of its huge computation resources demand.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the ERG's critical review of the evidence presented in the company submission in the context of a description of the company submission, and the resulting NICE guidance. The main clinical effectiveness data for daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir (daclatasvir + sofosbuvir) were derived from two uncontrolled open-label trials. Among patients with genotype 1 infection, 98-100 % of patients had a sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12), overall. Among genotype 3 patients, between 85 and 100 % had SVR12 across patient populations and regimens. The main evidence for daclatasvir + pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin (PR) came from one randomised controlled trial comparing daclatasvir + PR with PR in patients with genotype 4. This found an SVR12 rate of 82 % in previously untreated patients. Serious adverse event rates associated with daclatasvir were low. The lack of comparative trial evidence for daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and many of the comparators defined in the NICE scope meant that established methods for comparing interventions either directly via head-to-head trial comparisons or via adjusted indirect comparisons were not feasible. Comparisons of SVR rates were therefore largely based on unadjusted estimates drawn from individual trial arms and subgroups of individual trial arms. The ERG concluded that, despite limited evidence, daclatasvir in combination with other treatments appeared to be associated with a high SVR rate. Daclatasvir + sofosbuvir was unlikely to be inferior to comparator treatments in genotype 1 patients; but, due to limited evidence, the relative efficacy of daclatasvir and other treatments in genotype 3 and 4 patients or patients with compensated cirrhosis was uncertain. The economic evaluation compared daclatasvir + sofosbuvir and daclatasvir + PR with a wide range of NICE-approved treatments for hepatitis C. The company submission focused on a series of subgroups defined by disease severity (METAVIR fibrosis stage F3, compensated cirrhosis), genotype and treatment history. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective at a A 20,000-A pound 30,000 pound per QALY threshold in the following F3 populations: genotype 1 treatment naive (Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = A 19,739 pound/QALY) and treatment experienced (A 15,687 pound/QALY) and genotypes 1, 3 and 4 interferon ineligible or intolerant (A 5906-A pound 9607 pound/QALY depending on subgroup). In patients with cirrhosis, daclatasvir-containing regimens were not cost effective. The ERG found the company's economic analyses to be highly uncertain and in places biased. However, the ERG found that daclatasvir-containing regimens were cost effective in certain populations with significant fibrosis, and following new analyses by the company after a price reduction, in certain populations with cirrhosis, including patients who were not eligible for or who were intolerant to interferon therapy. The NICE Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that daclatasvir + sofosbuvir should be available as an option in genotype 1 and 4 patients with significant fibrosis but without cirrhosis, who had either been treated previously or were ineligible or intolerant to interferon. In response to the preliminary recommendation, the manufacturer submitted additional information including comparator SVR rates and a revised confidential price. Following this, the Committee expanded its original recommendation in its Final Appraisal Determination. The recommendation was expanded to include daclatasvir + sofosbuvir as an option for patients with significant fibrosis but without cirrhosis (in previously untreated patients with genotype 1, and genotype 3 patients ineligible or intolerant to interferon) and genotype 1, 3 and 4 cirrhotic patients who were ineligible or intolerant to interferon. Daclatasvir + PR was also recommended as an option for genotype 4 patients who had significant fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis.","[Llewellyn, Alexis; Simmonds, Mark; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Faria, Rita; Woods, Beth; Lomas, James; Griffin, Susan] Univ York, CHE, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Llewellyn, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",alexis.llewellyn@york.ac.uk,"Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019; Griffin, Susan/AAE-8970-2020","Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; Griffin, Susan/0000-0003-2188-8400; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566; Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme [14/148/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 14/148/01).

Starting from d independent Markov processes X-i with killing and an independent d-dimensional time change T, we construct a new process by time, changing each of the Markov processes X-i with a coordinate T-i. When T is a d-dimensional Levy subordinator, the time changed process (Y-i := X-i (T-i(t)) is a time-homogeneous Markov process with state-dependent jumps and killing in the product of the state spaces of X-i. The dependence among jumps of its components is governed by the d-dimensional Levy measure of the subordinator. When T is a d-dimensional additive subordinator, Y is a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. When T-i = integral(t)(0)V(s)(i)ds with V-i forming a multivariate Markov process, (Y-i, V-i) is a Markov process, where each V-i plays a role of stochastic volatility of Y-i. This construction provides a rich modeling architecture for building multivariate models in finance with time-and state-dependent jumps, stochastic volatility, and killing (default). The semigroup theory provides powerful analytical and computational tools for securities pricing in this framework. To illustrate, the paper considers applications to multiname unified credit-equity models and correlated commodity models.","[Mendoza-Arriaga, Rafael] Univ Texas Austin, CBA 5-202,B6500,1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Linetsky, Vadim] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Northwestern University,"Mendoza-Arriaga, R (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Informat Risk & Operat Management Dept IROM, CBA 5-202,B6500,1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",rafael.mendoza-arriaga@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Linetsky, Vadim/B-7474-2009",,National Science Foundation [CMMI-1030486],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant CMMI-1030486.,,75,17,17,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Medical management aims to induce and maintain remission and to avoid complications and the necessity for surgical intervention. Colectomy removes the source of inflammation but is associated with morbidity and mortality. Newer anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies may improve medical outcomes, albeit at an increased cost. Objective Our objective was to assess the incremental cost effectiveness of infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab versus conventional therapy and surgery from a National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective over a lifetime horizon. Methods A Markov model was developed with health states defined according to whether the patient is alive or dead, current treatments received, history of colectomy and level of disease control. Transition probabilities were derived from network meta-analyses (NMAs) of trials of anti-TNF-alpha agents in the moderate-to-severe UC population. Health utilities, colectomy rates, surgical complications and resource use estimates were derived from literature. Unit costs were drawn from standard costing sources and literature and were valued at year 2013/2014 values. Results For patients in whom surgery is an option, colectomy is expected to dominate all medical treatment options. For patients in whom colectomy is not an option, infliximab and golimumab are expected to be ruled out due to dominance, whilst the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for adalimumab versus conventional treatment is expected to be approximately A 50,278 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Conclusions Based on the NMAs, the ICERs for anti-TNF-alpha therapy versus conventional treatment or surgery are expected to be at best, in excess of A 50,000 pound per QALY gained. The cost effectiveness of withdrawing biologic therapy upon remission and re-treating relapse is unknown.","[Tappenden, Paul; Ren, Shijie; Archer, Rachel; Harvey, Rebecca; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Basarir, Hasan; Stevens, John] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Lobo, Alan] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Gastroenterol, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Hoque, Sami] Barts Hlth NHS Trust, London, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; Barts Health NHS Trust,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,"Basarir, Hasan/K-8532-2019","Basarir, Hasan/0000-0002-3202-4563; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [12/51/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme to inform the NICE Technology Appraisal Programme (Project Number 12/51/01).

For very general preferences of the insurer and that all reinsurers use a distortion premium principle, we establish the existence of a representative reinsurer and this in turn facilitates solving the optimal reinsurance problem with multiple reinsurers. The insurer determines its optimal risk that it wants to reinsure via this pricing formula. The risk to be reinsured is then shared by the reinsurers via tranching. The optimal ceded loss functions among multiple reinsurers are derived explicitly under the additional assumptions that the insurer's preferences are given by an inverse-S shaped distortion risk measure and that the reinsurers' premium principles are some functions of the Conditional Value-at-Risk. We also demonstrate that under some prescribed conditions, it is neva-optimal for the insurer to cede its risk to more than two reinsurers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is partially motivated by the desire to reduce capital and reserve requirements while retaining the value of mortality credits; see for example, Piggott et al. (2005) or Donnelly et al. (2014). In this paper, we generalize the natural retirement income tontine introduced by Milevsky and Salisbury (2015) by combining heterogeneous cohorts into one pool. We engineer this scheme by allocating tontine shares at either a premium or a discount to par based on both the age of the investor and the amount they invest. For example, a 55-year old allocating $10, 000 to the tontine might be told to pay $200 per share and receive 50 shares, while a 75-year old allocating $8, 000 might pay $40 per share and receive 200 shares. They would all be mixed together into the same tontine pool and each tontine share would have equal income rights. The current paper addresses existence and uniqueness issues and discusses the conditions under which this scheme can be constructed equitably - which is distinct from fairly - even though it isn't optimal for any cohort. As such, this also gives us the opportunity to compare and contrast various pooling schemes that have been proposed in the literature and to differentiate between arrangements that are socially equitable, vs. actuarially fair vs. economically optimal.","[Milevsky, Moshe A.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Milevsky, Moshe A.] York Univ, IFID Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Salisbury, Thomas S.] York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Milevsky, MA (通讯作者)，York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Milevsky, MA (通讯作者)，York Univ, IFID Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada.",milevsky@yorku.ca; salt@yorku.ca,"Milevsky, Moshe Arye/AAA-3482-2022","Milevsky, Moshe/0000-0002-5176-8904",IFID Centre; NSERC,IFID Centre; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The authors acknowledge funding from the IFID Centre (Milevsky) and from NSERC (Salisbury) as well as helpful comments from two ASTIN reviewers, the editor (Daniel Bauer) as well as seminar participants at University of New South Wales, Macquarie University, the CFA Society of Sydney and in particular Anthony Asher, David Blake, Steven Haberman, Geoff Kingston, Sachi Purcal, John Piggott and Michael Sherris.

Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines contain strains from both lineages. This analysis assesses the cost effectiveness of switching from trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination (TIV) in Finland to quadrivalent vaccination, using inactivated (QIV) or liveattenuated (Q-LAIV) vaccines. Methods A transmission model simulated the dynamics of influenza infection while accounting for indirect (herd) protection. Prior distributions for key transmission parameters were repeatedly sampled and simulations that fitted the available information on influenza in Finland were recorded. The resulting posterior parameter distributions were used in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis in which economic parameters were sampled, simultaneously encompassing uncertainty in the transmission and economic parameters. The cost effectiveness of a range of trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine policies over a 20-year time horizon was assessed from both a societal and payer perspective in 2014 Euros. Results The simulated temporal incidence pattern of symptomatic infections corresponded well with case surveillance data. A switch from the current TIV to Q-LAIV in children (2 to<18 years) and to QIV in other ages was estimated to annually avert approximately 76,100 symptomatic infections (95 % range 36,700-146,700), 11,500 primary care consultations (6100-20,000), 540 hospitalisations (240-1180), and 72 deaths (32-160), and was cost-saving relative to TIV ((sic) 374 million averted [(sic) 161-(sic) 752], in 2014 Euros, discounted at 3 %). This scenario had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective scenario considered. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that quadrivalent vaccination is expected to be highly cost effective, reducing the burden of influenza-related disease.","[Nagy, Lisa; Pitman, Richard] ICON Hlth Econ & Epidemiol, 100 Pk Dr, Milton Pk OX14 4RY, Oxon, England; [Heikkinen, Terho] Univ Turku, Dept Pediat, Turku, Finland; [Heikkinen, Terho] Turku Univ Hosp, Turku, Finland; [Sackeyfio, Alfred] AstraZeneca, Cambridge, England",ICON plc; University of Turku; University of Turku,"Nagy, L (通讯作者)，ICON Hlth Econ & Epidemiol, 100 Pk Dr, Milton Pk OX14 4RY, Oxon, England.",richard.pitman@iconplc.com,,"Heikkinen, Terho/0000-0001-6504-0116",AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),"This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca, of which Alfred Sackeyfio is an employee.

Understanding differences in the modelling methodologies used in these studies is important to assess the accuracy, comparability and generalisability of their results. Objectives The aim of this review was to identify published economic models of HPV vaccination programmes and understand how characteristics of these studies vary by geographical area, date of publication and the policy question being addressed. Methods We performed literature searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Econlit, The Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) and The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). From the 1189 unique studies retrieved, 65 studies were included for data extraction based on a priori eligibility criteria. Two authors independently reviewed these articles to determine eligibility for the final review. Data were extracted from the selected studies, focussing on six key structural or methodological themes covering different aspects of the model(s) used that may influence cost-effectiveness results. Results More recently published studies tend to model a larger number of HPV strains, and include a larger number of HPV-associated diseases. Studies published in Europe and NorthAmerica also tend to include a larger number of diseases and are more likely to incorporate the impact of herd immunity and to use more realistic assumptions around vaccine efficacy and coverage. Studies based on previousmodels often do not include sufficiently robust justifications as to the applicability of the adapted model to the new context. Conclusions The considerable between-study heterogeneity in economic evaluations of HPV vaccination programmes makes comparisons between studies difficult, as observed differences in cost effectiveness may be driven by differences in methodology as well as by variations in funding and delivery models and estimates of model parameters. Studies should consistently report not only all simplifying assumptions made but also the estimated impact of these assumptions on the cost-effectiveness results.","[Pink, Joshua] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Evidence, Div Hlth Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Parker, Ben; Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Pink, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Evidence, Div Hlth Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.pink@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Pink, Joshua/0000-0002-7597-4198","UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme [027/0089]; MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This research was supported by funding from a UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme (027/0089).,,20,11,12,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2016,34,9,,,,,847,861,,10.1007/s40273-016-0407-y,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OM,27178048.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383550900003,0

This model provides a parsimonious way of modeling nonlinearities and has many potential applications in economics and finance. Our framework can be viewed as a generalization of the simple threshold regression framework of Hansen (2000, Econometrica 68, 575-603) and Caner and Hansen (2004, Econometric Theory 20, 813-843) to allow for the endogeneity of the threshold variable and regime-specific heteroskedasticity. Our estimation of the threshold parameter is based on a two-stage concentrated least squares method that involves an inverse Mills ratio bias correction term in each regime. We derive its asymptotic distribution and propose a method to construct confidence intervals. We also provide inference for the slope parameters based on a generalized method of moments. Finally, we investigate the performance of the asymptotic approximations using a Monte Carlo simulation, which shows the applicability of the method in finite samples.","[Kourtellos, Andros] Univ Cyprus, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Stengos, Thanasis] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Tan, Chih Ming] Univ North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA",University of Cyprus; University of Guelph; University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Kourtellos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",andros@ucy.ac.cy,,"KOURTELLOS, ANDROS/0000-0001-9662-0420",University of Cyprus; Greg and Cindy Page Faculty Distribution Fund,University of Cyprus; Greg and Cindy Page Faculty Distribution Fund,"We thank the editor Peter C.

Nonparametric inference has been studied by Ahn and Shyamalkumar (2014) and Peng et al. (2015) when the risk measure is defined at a fixed level. In risk management, the level is usually set to be quite near one by regulators. Therefore, especially when the sample size is not large enough, it is useful to treat the level as a function of the sample size, which diverges to one as the sample size goes to infinity. In this paper, we extend the results in Peng et al. (2015) from a fixed level to an intermediate level. Although the proposed maximum empirical likelihood estimator for the H-G risk measure has a different limit fora fixed level and an intermediate level, the proposed empirical likelihood method indeed gives a unified interval estimation for both cases. A simulation study is conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A tractable example is developed and termed the discounted variance gamma model. Calibrations to market data provide empirical support. Additionally, procedures are presented for the valuation of path dependent stochastic perpetuities. Evidence is provided for long dated equity linked claims paying coupon for time spent by equity above a lower barrier, being underpriced by extant models relative to the new discounted ones.

Model-based studies that include DTDs are also summarised. It was found that the values used within model-based economic evaluations (ranging from 0.00384 to 0.02) were typically smaller than the directly elicited values from the existing literature (0-0.033). Yet even with conservative estimates of DTDs, cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to their inclusion.

By using a Gaussian process prior we propose the posterior mean as an estimator and prove frequentist consistency of the posterior distribution. The latter provides the frequentist validation of our Bayesian procedure. We show that the minimax rate of contraction of the posterior distribution can be obtained provided that either the regularity of the prior matches the regularity of the true parameter or the prior is scaled at an appropriate rate. The scaling parameter of the prior distribution plays the role of a regularization parameter. We propose a new data-driven method for optimally selecting in practice this regularization parameter. We also provide sufficient conditions such that the posterior mean, in a conjugate-Gaussian setting, is equal to a Tikhonov-type estimator in a frequentist setting. Under these conditions our data-driven method is valid for selecting the regularization parameter of the Tikhonov estimator as well. Finally, we apply our general methodology to two leading examples in econometrics: instrumental regression and functional regression estimation.","[Florens, Jean-Pierre] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Simoni, Anna] CNRS, GRECSTA, F-75700 Paris, France; [Simoni, Anna] CREST, F-92240 Malakoff, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Simoni, A (通讯作者)，CREST, 15 Blvd Gabriel Peri, F-92240 Malakoff, France.",simoni.anna@gmail.com,,"SIMONI, Anna/0000-0001-5010-6733",IPANEMA [ANR-13-BSH1-0004]; University of Mannheim through the DFG-SNF Research Group [FOR916],IPANEMA; University of Mannheim through the DFG-SNF Research Group,"A version of this paper circulated under the title On the Regularization Power of the Prior Distribution in Linear Ill-Posed Inverse Problems (September 2008) (see also Florens and Simoni, 2010).

Furthermore, we apply the second order asymptotic expansion method to characterize explicitly the optimal no transaction region when the transaction cost is small and show that the boundary points are asymmetric in relation to the target portfolio position, in contrast to the symmetric relation when only the first order asymptotic expansion method is used, and the leading order is a constant proportion of the cubic root of the small transaction cost.

The results demonstrate that market default risk is positively (negatively) related to the index risk-neutral volatility and skewness (kurtosis). These relations are robust in the presence of other factors relevant to the dynamics and microstructure nature of the spot and option markets. Overall, this study sheds light on a set of economic determinants which help to understand the daily evolution of the S&P 500 Index option-implied risk-neutral distributions. Our findings offer explanations of why theoretical predictions of option pricing models are not consistent with what is observed in practice and provide support that market default risk is important to asset pricing.","[Andreou, Panayiotis C.] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commerce Finance & Shipping, Lemesos, Cyprus; [Andreou, Panayiotis C.] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Adjunct Fac Finance, Durham, England",Cyprus University of Technology; Durham University,"Andreou, PC (通讯作者)，Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Commerce Finance & Shipping, Lemesos, Cyprus.",benz@pandreou.com,"Andreou, Panayiotis C./ABG-7347-2021","Andreou, Panayiotis C./0000-0001-5742-0311",,,,,34,9,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Therefore, diverging results and conclusions may arise because of the different asymptotic theories adopted. Using differencing transformations, we introduce a new class of estimators and test statistics for predictive regression models with Gaussian limit distribution that is instead insensitive to the degree of persistence of the predictors. This desirable feature allows to construct Gaussian confidence intervals for the parameter of interest in stationary, nonstationary, and even locally explosive settings. Besides the limit distribution, we also study the efficiency and the rate of convergence of our new class of estimators. We show that the rate of convergence is root n in stationary cases, while it can be arbitrarily close to n in nonstationary settings, still preserving the Gaussian limit distribution. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the high reliability and accuracy of our test statistics.","[Camponovo, Lorenzo] Univ St Gallen, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Camponovo, L (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",Lorenzo.Camponovo@unisg.ch,,"Camponovo, Lorenzo/0009-0005-5341-7189",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I thank the co-editor and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

In this paper, we study a lifetime investment problem aiming at minimizing the risk of drawdown occurrences. Under the Black-Scholes framework, we examine two financial market models: a market with two risky assets, and a market with a risk-free asset and a risky asset. Closed-form optimal trading strategies are derived under both models by utilizing a decomposition technique on the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We show that it is optimal to minimize the portfolio variance when the fund value is at its historic high-watermark. Moreover, when the fund value drops, the proportion of wealth invested in the asset with a higher instantaneous rate of return should be increased. We find that the instantaneous return rate of the minimum lifetime drawdown probability (MLDP) portfolio is never less than the return rate of the minimum variance (MV) portfolio. This supports the practical use of drawdown-based performance measures in which the role of volatility is replaced by drawdown. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we define and study the properties of the DA premium principle, which builds on the equivalent utility premium principle. We derive various properties of this premium principle, such as non-negative and no unjustified risk loading, translation invariance, monotonicity, convexity, positive (non-)homogeneity, independent (non-)additivity, comonotonic (non-)additivity and monotonicity with respect to the extent of disappointment. A generalized Arrow-Pratt approximation is also established.

By utilizing the entire range of conditional quantile functions, especially higher quantile levels, we detail how quantile regression is capable of providing an accurate estimation of risk margin and an overview of implied capital based on the historical volatility of a general insurers loss portfolio. Two modeling frameworks are considered based around parametric and non-parametric regression models which we develop specifically in this insurance setting. In the parametric framework, quantile functions are derived using several distributions including the flexible generalized beta (GB2) distribution family, asymmetric Laplace (AL) distribution and power-Pareto (PP) distribution. In these parametric model based quantile regressions, we detail two basic formulations. The first involves embedding the quantile regression loss function from the nonparameteric setting into the argument of the kernel of a parametric data likelihood model, this is well known to naturally lead to the AL parametric model case. The second formulation we utilize in the parametric setting adopts an alternative quantile regression formulation in which we assume a structural expression for the regression trend and volatility functions which act to modify a base quantile function in order to produce the conditional data quantile function. This second approach allows a range of flexible parametric models to be considered with different tail behaviors. We demonstrate how to perform estimation of the resulting parametric models under a Bayesian regression framework. To achieve this, we design Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies for the resulting Bayesian posterior quantile regression models. In the non-parametric framework, we construct quantile functions by minimizing an asymmetrically weighted loss function and estimate the parameters under the AL proxy distribution to resemble the minimization process. This quantile regression model is contrasted to the parametric AL mean regression model and both are expressed as a scale mixture of uniform distributions to facilitate efficient implementation. The models are extended to adopt dynamic mean, variance and skewness and applied to analyze two real loss reserve data sets to perform inference and discuss interesting features of quantile regression for risk margin calculations.","[Dong, Alice X.

An evidence base for cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of these developments is needed. Our objective was to perform a review of papers assessing provider-incurred as well as patient-incurred costs of treating both drug-susceptible (DS) and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. Five databases (EMBASE, Medline, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Services Literature) were searched for cost and economic evaluation full-text papers containing primary DS-TB and MDR-TB treatment cost data published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1990 and February 2015. No language restrictions were set. The search terms were a combination of 'tuberculosis', 'multidrug-resistant tuberculosis', 'cost', and 'treatment'. In the selected papers, study methods and characteristics, quality indicators and costs were extracted into summary tables according to pre-defined criteria. Results were analysed according to country income groups and for provider costs, patient costs and productivity losses. All values were converted to $US, year 2014 values, so that studies could be compared. We selected 71 treatment cost papers on DS-TB only, ten papers on MDR-TB only and nine papers that included both DS-TB and MDR-TB. These papers provided evidence on the costs of treating DS-TB and MDR-TB in 50 and 16 countries, respectively. In 31 % of the papers, only provider costs were included; 26 % included only patient-incurred costs, and the remaining 43 % estimated costs incurred by both. From the provider perspective, mean DS-TB treatment costs per patient were US$14,659 in high-income countries (HICs), US$840 in upper middle-income countries (UMICs), US$273 in lower middle-income (LMICs), and US$258 in low-income countries (LICs), showing a strong positive correlation. The respective costs for treating MDR-TB were US$83,365, US$5284, US$6313 and US$1218. Costs incurred by patients when seeking treatment for DS-TB accounted for an additional 3 % of the provider costs in HICs. A greater burden was seen in the other income groups, increasing the costs of DS-TB treatment by 72 % in UMICs, 60 % in LICs and 31 % in LMICs. When provider costs, patient costs and productivity losses were combined, productivity losses accounted for 16 % in HICs, 29 % in UMICs, 40 % in LMICs and 38 % in LICs. Cost data for MDR-TB treatment are limited, and the variation in delivery mechanisms, as well as the rapidly evolving diagnosis and treatment regimens, means that it is essential to increase the number of studies assessing the cost from both provider and patient perspectives. There is substantial evidence available on the costs of DS-TB treatment from all regions of the world. The patient-incurred costs illustrate that the financial burden of illness is relatively greater for patients in poorer countries without universal healthcare coverage.","[Laurence, Yoko V.; Griffiths, Ulla K.; Vassall, Anna] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Laurence, YV (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",yoko.laurence@lshtm.ac.uk,"Griffiths, Ulla Kou/IYS-6126-2023","Laurence, Yoko/0000-0002-5936-8542; Vassall, Anna/0000-0002-2911-1375",AERAS [PHGHVK5610],AERAS,None of the authors have expressed any conflict of interest.

The managers of the pension fund try to find the optimal investment policy (optimal asset allocation) to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth. The market is a combination of financial market and insurance market. The financial market consists of three assets: cashes with stochastic interest rate, stocks and rolling bonds, while the insurance market consists of mortality risk and salary risk. These two non-hedging risks cause incompleteness of the market. By martingale method and dynamic programming principle we first derive the approximate optimal investment policy to overcome the difficulty, then investigate the efficiency of the approximation. Finally, we solve an optimal assets liabilities management(ALM) problem with mortality risk and salary risk under CRRA utility, and reveal the influence of these two risks on the optimal investment policy by numerical illustration.

They promised enormous rewards to the last survivors at the expense of those died early. While this design appealed to the gambling instinct, it is a suboptimal way to generate retirement income. Indeed, actuarially-fair life annuities making constant payments - where the insurance company is exposed to longevity risk - induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines do not have to be structured the historical way, i.e. with a constant cash flow shared amongst a shrinking group of survivors. Moreover, insurance companies do not sell actuarially-fair life annuities, in part due to aggregate longevity risk. We derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime utility. Technically speaking we solve the Euler Lagrange equation and examine its sensitivity to (i) the size of the tontine pool n, and (ii) individual longevity risk aversion gamma. We examine how the optimal tontine varies with gamma and n, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout. Interestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as longevity risk aversion gamma -> infinity. We define the natural tontine as the function for which the payout declines in exact proportion to the survival probabilities, which we show is nearoptimal for all gamma and n. We conclude by comparing the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded life annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find that the life annuity's advantage over the optimal tontine is minimal. In sum, this paper's contribution is to (i) rekindle a discussion about a retirement income product that has been long neglected, and (ii) leverage economic theory as well as tools from mathematical finance to design the next generation of tontine annuities.

Due to ever increasing concerns of longevity risk and the weak economic environment, sponsors are eager to understand their pension-related risks to facilitate optimal enterprise decision-making. Borrowing an analytical framework from the life insurance and annuity industry where the amount of risk is framed in terms of the total assets required to remain solvent over a one-year period with a high level of confidence, i.e., the economic capital approach, this paper develops a benchmark risk measure for pension sponsors by obtaining a total asset requirement for sustaining the pension plan. The difference between the total asset requirement and the actual trust assets thus provides a measure of sponsor assets at risk due to plan sponsorship. Two factor-based approaches are proposed for this calculation. The first approach develops a set of pension-specific factors as if the pension plan were a group annuity. The second approach directly simulates the risk drivers of the pension plan and develops a framework for obtaining factors and calculating the pension risk given a desired confidence level. Our approach is very easy to implement and monitor in practice. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Obesity is a significant risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other clinically significant co-morbidities. This paper estimates the medical care cost savings that can be achieved from a given amount of weight loss by people with different starting values of body mass index (BMI), for those with and without diabetes. This information is an important input into analyses of the cost effectiveness of obesity treatments and prevention programs. Two-part models of instrumental variables were estimated using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for 2000-2010. Models were estimated for all adults as well as separately for those with and without diabetes. We calculated the causal impact of changes in BMI on medical care expenditures, cost savings for specific changes in BMI (5, 10, 15, and 20 %) from starting BMI levels ranging from 30 to 45 kg/m(2), as well as the total excess medical care expenditures caused by obesity. In the USA, adult obesity raised annual medical care costs by $US3,508 per obese individual, for a nationwide total of $US315.8 billion (year 2010 values). However, the relationship of medical care costs over BMI is J-shaped; costs rise exponentially in the range of class 2 and 3 obesity (BMI a parts per thousand yen35). The heavier the obese individual, the greater the reduction in medical care costs associated with a given percent reduction in BMI. Medical care expenditures are higher, and rise more with BMI, among individuals with diabetes than among those without diabetes. The savings from a given percent reduction in BMI are greater the heavier the obese individual, and are greater for those with diabetes than for those without diabetes. The results provide health insurers, employers, government agencies, and health economists with accurate estimates of the change in medical care expenditures resulting from weight loss, which is important information for calculating the cost effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat obesity.","[Cawley, John] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Cawley, John] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Meyerhoefer, Chad; Biener, Adam] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Rauch Business Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Hammer, Mette; Wintfeld, Neil] Novo Nordisk Inc, Plainsboro, NJ 08536 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Lehigh University; Novo Nordisk,"Cawley, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, 2312 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",JHC38@cornell.edu; chm308@lehigh.edu; aib210@lehigh.edu; mthm@novonoridisk.com; nwif@novonoridisk.com,"Cawley, John/E-6734-2010","Cawley, John/0000-0002-4805-9883; Biener, Adam/0000-0001-5510-7284","Novo Nordisk, Inc.","Novo Nordisk, Inc.(Novo Nordisk)","The authors thank Novo Nordisk, Inc. for their financial support of this research.

There is a growing belief that the extra-welfarist approach may not necessarily provide all the information that decisionmakers require in certain contexts, e.g. evaluation of complex interventions. As the number of these interventions being evaluated increases, it is crucial that the most appropriate economic evaluation approach is used to enable decisionmakers to be confident in their adoption decisions. We conducted a literature review to evaluate the potential for the choice of economic evaluation approach to impact on the adoption decisions recommended by economic evaluation studies. We found that for every five studies applying both approaches, one shows limited or no concordance in economic evaluation results: the different approaches suggest conflicting adoption decisions, and there is no pattern to which approach provides the most convincing adoption evidence. Only one study in ten indicates which results will best inform adoption decisions. We conclude that the choice of approach can significantly impact on the adoption decisions recommended by economic evaluation studies, with conflicting results creating confusion over whether or not interventions provide good value for money. Health economists rarely provide sufficient guidance to decisionmakers to alleviate this confusion.","[Buchanan, James; Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford OX3 7LF, England",University of Oxford,"Buchanan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",james.buchanan@dph.ox.ac.uk,"Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019","Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford; Department of Health's NIHR Biomedical Research Centres funding scheme; Wellcome Trust [090532/Z/09/Z, 076113, 085475]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2011-04-021] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2011-04-021] Funding Source: researchfish","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Department of Health's NIHR Biomedical Research Centres funding scheme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","This paper represents independent research arising from a Doctoral Research Fellowship awarded to J.

This article introduces an alternative semiparametric regression approach to a nonlinear ACD model; the use of a semiparametric functional form on the dynamics of the duration process suggests the model being called the Semiparametric ACD (SEMI-ACD) model. Unlike existing alternatives, the SEMI-ACD model allows simultaneous generalizations on both of the above-mentioned components of the ACD framework. To estimate the model, we establish an alternative use of the existing Buhlmann and McNeil's (2002) iterative estimation algorithm in the semiparametric setting and provide the mathematical proof of its statistical consistency in our context. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the semiparametric estimators employed in order to ensure the statistical rigor of the SEMI-ACD estimation procedure. These asymptotic results are presented in conjunction with simulated examples, which provide an empirical evidence of the SEMI-ACD model's robust finite-sample performance. Finally, we apply the proposed model to study price duration process in the foreign exchange market to illustrate its usefulness in practice.","[Saart, Patrick W.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Gao, Jiti] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Joondalup, Australia",University of Canterbury; Monash University; Edith Cowan University,"Gao, JT (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia.",jiti.gao@monash.edu,"Allen, David/JTV-4098-2023; Allen, David/AAM-9744-2021","Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021; Allen, David/0000-0001-7782-0865",Australian Research Council [DP1096374]; Australian Research Council [DP1096374] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors would also like to acknowledge the financial support from the Australian Research Council Discovery Grants Program under Grant Number: DP1096374.,,30,5,6,1,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

However, an empirically nonstationary term spread or rejection of cointegration between long and short term interest rates need not to be considered an empirical rejection of this theoretical relationship. It is likely that the dichotomy between I(1) or I(0) and/or integer values of cointegration are environments which are too restrictive to model the term structure. To overcome this problem, we propose a residual-based approach to test for the null of no cointegration against a fractional alternative which relies on the Exact Local Whittle Estimator (Shimotsu and Philllips, 2005, 2006). We compare its performance to other residual-based tests for fractional cointegration, and then we use it to investigate the term structure in the U.K and the U.S.","[Zhang, Dayong; Tan, Jijun] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Barassi, Marco R.] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Birmingham,"Barassi, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.r.barassi@bham.ac.uk,"Wu, Fei/T-6613-2019; Zhang, Dayong/ABD-4989-2021","Zhang, Dayong/0000-0001-8722-176X; Barassi, Marco/0000-0001-8945-2457",Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [09YJC790182]; National Program of China for Statistics Research [2007LZ018],"Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); National Program of China for Statistics Research",Jijun Tan's research is supported by Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 09YJC790182) and by National Program of China for Statistics Research (Grant No. 2007LZ018).,,30,1,1,0,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

From empirical analysis and theoretical study, both the aggregate consumption and the stock price are unknown in determining jumping times. By using the pricing kernel, we determine both the aggregate consumption jump time and the stock price jump time from the equilibrium interest rate and CCAPM (Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model). Our general jump-diffusion option pricing model gives an explicit formula for how the jump process and the jump times alter the pricing.

Using basic results for birth-and-death processes, we build an analytical formula for the shape (depth) of a continuous order book model which is both founded on market mechanisms and very close to empirically tested formulas. We relate this shape to the probability of execution of a limit order, highlighting a law of conservation of the flows of orders in an order book. We then extend our model by allowing random sizes of limit orders, thereby allowing the study of the relationship between the size of the incoming limit orders and the shape of the order book. Our theoretical model shows that, for a given total volume of incoming limit orders, the fewer limit orders are submitted (i.e. the larger the average size of these limit orders), the deeper is the order book around the spread. This theoretical relationship is finally empirically tested on several stocks traded on the Paris stock exchange.","[Toke, I. Muni] Univ New Caledonia, ERIM, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Toke, I.

We assume that the amount contributed to the pension fund by a pension plan member is coupled with the salary income which fluctuates randomly over time and contains both a hedgeable and non-hedgeable risk component. We consider an economy in which macroeconomic risks are existent. We assume that the economy can be in one of I states (regimes) and switches randomly between those states. The state of the economy affects the dynamics of the tradeable risky asset and the contribution process (the salary income of a pension plan member). To model the switching behavior of the economy we use a counting process with stochastic intensities. We find the investment strategy which maximizes the expected exponential utility of the discounted excess wealth over a target payment, e.g. a target lifetime annuity.","[Chen, An] Univ Ulm, Inst Insurance Sci, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Delong, Lukasz] Inst Econometr, Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Probabilist Methods, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Ulm University; Warsaw School of Economics,"Delong, L (通讯作者)，Inst Econometr, Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Probabilist Methods, Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",an.chen@uni-ulm.de; lukasz.delong@sgh.waw.pl,,"Delong, Lukasz/0000-0002-6609-0462",,,,,23,17,17,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2015,45,2,,,,,397,419,,10.1017/asb.2014.33,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CG8WC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353595000005,0

This product simultaneously deals with financial risk, mortality risk and human behavior. We assume that market is complete in financial risk and mortality risk is completely diversified by selling enough policies and thus the annuity price can be expressed as appropriate expectation. The computing engine employed to solve the optimal stochastic control problem is based on a robust and efficient Gauss-Hermite quadrature method with cubic spline. We present results for three different types of death benefit and show that, under the optimal policyholder behavior, adding the premium for the death benefit on top of the GMWB can be problematic for contracts with long maturities if the continuous fee structure is kept, which is ordinarily assumed for a GMWB contract. In fact for some long maturities it can be shown that the fee cannot be charged as any proportion of the account value there is no solution to match the initial premium with the fair annuity price. On the other hand, the extra fee due to adding the death benefit can be charged upfront or in periodic installment of fixed amount, and it is cheaper than buying a separate life insurance.

It is usually modeled as a stochastic process such as the compound Poisson process, and historical data are collected and employed to estimate the corresponding parameters of probability distributions. However, there exists the case of lack of data such as for a new insurance product. An alternative way is to estimate the parameters based on experts subjective belief and information. Therefore, it is necessary to employ the uncertain process to model the insurance risk process. In this paper, we propose a modified insurance risk process in which both the claim process and the premium process are assumed to be renewal reward processes with uncertain factors. Then we give the inverse uncertainty distribution of the modified process at each time. On this basis, we derive the ruin index which has an explicit expression based on given uncertainty distributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were (i) to compare the MRU and related costs for two treatment approaches; (ii) to identify the main drivers of resource use and costs; and (iii) to assess the effects of various treatment regimen attributes on MRU-related costs in a UK clinical setting. The analysis used data collected alongside the simeprevir (SMV) phase III trials for treatment-na < ve genotype 1 HCV-infected patients; these data covered outpatient consultations with specialists, emergency room visits and hospital admissions. Logistic regressions were constructed to estimate the predictors of resource utilization, and a two-part multivariable analysis model was used to determine the total costs of treatment in the UK. Data on 731 patients receiving SMV plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin (SMV/PegIFN/R) or PegIFN/R were included in the analysis. While MRU was similar between the SMV and PegIFN/R groups, MRU-related costs were significantly lower in the SMV group than in the PegIFN/R group (P < 0.05). High body mass index (P < 0.05), severe fibrosis (P < 0.05), shortened treatment duration to 24 weeks (P < 0.05), and anaemia and rash during treatment (P < 0.001) were identified as predictors of hospitalization and outpatient visits and as drivers of total costs. Univariate sensitivity analyses suggested that shortened treatment duration and lower occurrence of rash lead to large cost savings. This study identified both baseline and on-treatment antiviral therapy characteristics as drivers of MRU-related costs for HCV patients following antiviral therapy. The shortened treatment duration and reduction in rash due to treatment with SMV triple therapy lead to substantial non-drug cost savings, compared with PegIFN/R treatment. This suggests that there are potential patient management and cost-effectiveness implications associated with the choice of specific antiviral treatments.","[Akpo, Esse Ifebi Herve; Kleintjens, Joris] Deloitte, Diegem, Belgium; [Cerri, Karin] Janssen Pharmaceut NV, Beerse, Belgium; [Cerri, Karin] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Personal Social Serv Res Unit, London WC2A 2AE, England",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Akpo, EIH (通讯作者)，Deloitte, Diegem, Belgium.",eakpo@deloitte.com,,,Janssen Pharmaceutica,Janssen Pharmaceutica(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),"The authors E.I.H.A. and J.K. declare no conflict of interest.

The analysed articles reveal great disparity in the economic burden on MRSA patients; this is mainly due to the diversity of the designs of the studies, as well as the variability of the patients and the differences in health care systems. Regarding prophylactic strategies, the studies do not provide conclusive results that could unambiguously orientate health management. The studies addressing treatments noted that linezolid seems to be a cost-effective treatment for MRSA, mostly because it is associated with a shorter length of stay (LOS) in hospital. However, important variables such as antimicrobial susceptibility, infection type and resistance emergence should be included in these analyses before a conclusion is reached regarding which treatment is the best (most efficient). The reviewed studies found that rapid MRSA detection, using molecular techniques, is an efficient technique to control MRSA. As a general conclusion, the management of MRSA infections implicates important economic costs for hospitals, as they result in higher direct costs and longer LOS than those related to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) patients or MRSA-free patients; there is wide variability in those increased costs, depending on different variables. Moreover, the research reveals a lack of studies on other related topics, such as the economic implications of changes in MRSA epidemiology (community patients and lineages associated with farm animals).","[Antonanzas, Fernando; Lozano, Carmen; Torres, Carmen] Univ La Rioja, Logrono, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Antonanzas, F (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Logrono, Spain.",fernando.antonanzas@unirioja.es,"Antonanzas, Fernando/F-4610-2016; Torres, Carmen/C-9027-2013; Lozano, Carmen/M-3264-2014","Antonanzas, Fernando/0000-0001-6122-9130; Torres, Carmen/0000-0003-3709-1690; Lozano, Carmen/0000-0002-0048-9315",,,,,109,45,49,1,38,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2015,33,4,,,,,285,325,,10.1007/s40273-014-0242-y,0.0,,,41,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CF1AQ,25447195.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352276300001,0

A partitioned-survival analysis model with three mutually exclusive health states (pre-progression, post-progression, and dead) was used. The proportion of patients in each state was calculated using survival distributions for progression-free and overall survival derived from pivotal trials of dabrafenib and vemurafenib. For each treatment, expected progression-free, post-progression, overall, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were calculated. Costs were based on list prices, a clinician survey, and published sources. A 5-year time horizon was used in the base case. Costs (in 2012 Canadian dollars [CA$]) and QALYs were discounted at 5 % annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Dabrafenib was estimated to yield 0.2055 more QALYs at higher cost than dacarbazine. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CA$363,136/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, at a threshold of CA$200,000/QALY, there was an 8.2 % probability that dabrafenib is cost effective versus dacarbazine. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, cost effectiveness was sensitive to survival distributions, utilities, and time horizon, with the hazard ratio for overall survival for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine being the most sensitive parameter. Assuming a class effect for efficacy of BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib was dominant versus vemurafenib (less costly, equally effective), reflecting its assumed lower daily cost. Assuming no class effect, dabrafenib yielded 0.0486 more QALYs than vemurafenib. At a threshold of CA$200,000/QALY, dabrafenib is unlikely to be cost effective compared with dacarbazine.

UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A Markov state-transition model was developed, which compared onabotulinumtoxinA + best supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone (comprising behavioural therapy and pads, alone or in combination with clean intermittent catheterization and possibly with ACHDs). Non-responders were eligible for invasive procedures. Health states were defined according to the reduction in UI episodes. Efficacy data and estimates of resource utilization were pooled from 468 patients on onabotulinumtoxinA in two phase III clinical trials. Drug costs (2013) and administration costs (NHS Reference Costs 2011-2012) were obtained from published sources. The time horizon of the model was 5 years, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5 %. Scenario, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were conducted to explore uncertainties around the assumptions. In the base case, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC over 5 years was associated with an increase in costs of A 1,689 pound and an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.4, compared with BSC alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 3,850 pound per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that utility values had the greatest influence on model results. PSA suggests that onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC had a 100 % probability of being cost effective at a willingness to pay of < A 20,000 pound. For adult patients with NDO who are not adequately managed with ACHDs, onabotulinumtoxinA + BSC appears to be a cost-effective use of resources in the UK NHS.","[Hamid, Rizwan] London Spinal Injuries Ctr, Stanmore, Middx, England; [Hamid, Rizwan] Univ Coll London Hosp, London, England; [Loveman, Clara; Millen, Jim] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Neurosci & Urol, Marlow, Bucks, England; [Globe, Denise; Corbell, Catherine; Colayco, Danielle] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Global Hlth Outcomes Strategy & Res, Irvine, CA 92715 USA; [Stanisic, Sanja] Hlth Econ, LA SER Grp, Milan, Italy; [Gultyaev, Dmitry] Hlth Econ, LA SER Grp, Lorrach, Germany",University of London; University College London; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; AbbVie; Allergan; AbbVie; Allergan,"Loveman, C (通讯作者)，Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, Neurosci & Urol, Marlow, Bucks, England.",Loveman_Clara@Allergan.com,,,Allergan Limited (UK); Allergan Limited,Allergan Limited (UK)(AbbVieAllergan); Allergan Limited(AbbVieAllergan),"This study was funded by Allergan Limited (UK).

We show that higher choice aversion, as measured by dislike of bigger menus, also corresponds to an increased preference for putting off decisions as late as possible.","[Fudenberg, Drew; Strzalecki, Tomasz] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Fudenberg, D (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dfudenberg@harvard.edu; tomasz_strzalecki@harvard.edu,,,"Sloan Foundation; NSF [SES-0954162, SES-1123729]; CAREER [SES-1255062]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1258665, 1255062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Estimates exploiting a regression discontinuity design indicate that electronic voting reduced residual (error-ridden and uncounted) votes and promoted a large de facto enfranchisement of mainly less educated citizens. Estimates exploiting the unique pattern of the technology's phase-in across states over time suggest that, as predicted by political economy models, it shifted government spending toward health care, which is particularly beneficial to the poor.

The structured density is only observed on a sub-sample corresponding to historical calendar times. The mortality forecast is obtained by extrapolating the structured density to future calendar times using that the components of the density are identified within sample. The new-method is illustrated on the important practical problem of forecasting mesothelioma for the UK population. Full asymptotic theory is provided. The theory is given in such generality that it also introduces mathematical statistical theory for the recent continuous chain ladder model.

It is now well understood that this measure also reflects randomness in the allocation of individuals to units (i.e. it measures deviations from evenness, not deviations from randomness). This leads to potentially large values of the segregation index when unit sizes and/or minority proportions are small, even if there is no underlying systematic segregation. Our response to this is to produce adjustments to the index, based on an underlying statistical model. We specify the assignment problem in a very general way, with differences in conditional assignment probabilities underlying the resulting segregation. From this, we derive a likelihood ratio test for the presence of any systematic segregation, and bias adjustments to the dissimilarity index. We further develop the asymptotic distribution theory for testing hypotheses concerning the magnitude of the segregation index and show that the use of bootstrap methods can improve the size and power properties of test procedures considerably. We illustrate these methods by comparing dissimilarity indices across school districts in England to measure social segregation.","[Allen, Rebecca] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Burgess, Simon; Windmeijer, Frank] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, CMPO, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England; [Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] Ctr Vieille Charite, AMSE GREQAM, F-13002 Marseille, France",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; University of Bristol; McGill University,"Allen, R (通讯作者)，Univ London, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",r.allen@ioe.ac.uk; simon.burgess@bristol.ac.uk; russell.davidson@mcgill.ca; f.windmeijer@bristol.ac.uk,"Windmeijer, Frank/AAL-5695-2020; Allen, Rebecca/ITV-3905-2023","Allen, Rebecca/0000-0002-1093-665X; Windmeijer, Frank/0000-0002-4232-2783; Burgess, Simon/0000-0001-7206-3674",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-343-28-0001]; European Research Council [DEVHEALTH-269874]; MRC [MC_UU_12013/9] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-343-28-3001] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12013/9] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"S.

Consistent with these predictions, we find that news related to future GDP growth is a significant factor that is priced in the cross section of commodity futures sorted by percentage net basis. The latter is highly correlated with inventories. In particular, it establishes that commodity futures with high inventory levels provide a hedge against risk associated with future GDP growth so that investors are willing to accept lower return. By contrast, those commodity futures with low inventory levels are inversely related to the GDP-related factor so that investors require a higher return.

We present different economic interpretations of the two types of dummy variables for an interval regression model. Particularly, we discuss how they measure the direction and magnitudes of the change of an ITS caused by an economic crisis, and develop the corresponding hypothesis tests. A main advantage of the proposed ITS modelling approach over traditional point-based methods is that it can assess the change in both the trend and volatility of an asset price process simultaneously. This is due to the informational gain of an ITS sample over a point-valued sample, e.g. closing prices, since an interval observation contains both the trend and variation information of a price process in a given period. Using the proposed interval framework, we focus on the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis in the commodity market as a case study based on the ITS of monthly crude oil future price data. Empirical results suggest a strong evidence that the subprime crisis has lowered the level/trend and increased the volatility of crude oil prices. We also show that the trend of crude oil future prices moves towards an equilibrium state driven by the variation of the price process in last period, and the speculation index, as a proxy of crude oil market liquidity, is significant in explaining the dynamics of crude oil prices. Both findings provide quantitative evidence for theoretical results in the previous literature.","[Yang, Wei] Shanxi Univ, Inst Management & Decis, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China; [Han, Ai; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yongmiao] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Ithaca, NY USA","Shanxi University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Cornell University; Cornell University","Han, A (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",hanai@amss.ac.cn,"li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X; Hong, Yongmiao/0000-0002-9711-9061","MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Fund [14YJC630163]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501115, 71201161]; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Fund [grant number 14YJC630163], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71501115] [grant number 71201161]; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of time-varying investor attention allocation for the price discovery process.","[Jacobs, Heiko; Weber, Martin] Univ Mannheim, Finance Area, L5,2, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Jacobs, H (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Finance Area, L5,2, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",jacobs@bank.bwl.uni-mannheim.de,"Weber, Martin/JLL-7207-2023; Weber, Martin/GPW-6095-2022",,Julius Paul Stiegler Memorial Foundation; Deutsches Aktieninstitut; Acatis; Bundesverband Alternative Investments,Julius Paul Stiegler Memorial Foundation; Deutsches Aktieninstitut; Acatis; Bundesverband Alternative Investments,"Parts of this paper are based on a previous draft entitled Losing sight of the trees for the forest?

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA367 issued in November 2015. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. Two phase III randomised controlled trials for a second-line population involving vortioxetine were identified-REVIVE and TAK318. These two trials represent only 972 of over 7000 patients included in trials of vortioxetine. In REVIVE, there was a statistically significant difference in depression scores favouring vortioxetine compared with agomelatine [ mean Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score difference of 2.16 points; 95 % confidence interval 0.81-3.51]. The ERG concluded that, based on all the evidence, rather than the substantially restricted subset of evidence originally considered by the manufacturer, vortioxetine is likely to be similar in efficacy to other analysed antidepressants [ citalopram, sertraline, escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR)], and may be more efficacious than agomelatine and inferior to duloxetine. The ERG concluded that vortioxetine may be more tolerable than other analysed antidepressants (sertraline, venlafaxine XR and bupropion), although the limited data prevent firm conclusions. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vortioxetine reported by the manufacturer was 378 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with venlafaxine. Given considerable concerns about the indirect treatment comparison undertaken by the manufacturer, the use of only a restrictive subset of the available evidence, and concerns regarding comparators and structural model assumptions, the ERG believes that this is not a valid estimate of the cost effectiveness of vortioxetine. Following corrections made to the model made by the ERG, the estimated cost effectiveness of vortioxetine was sensitive to the source of evidence used, in addition to whether certain comparators were excluded. The NICE thus asked the manufacturer to provide a revised economic model, which incorporated the broader evidence base and considered the cost effectiveness of vortioxetine as a third-line treatment. Assuming equal efficacy, vortioxetine was shown to be less costly and generate a higher QALY gain than relevant comparators at the third-line of treatment owing to its tolerability and adverse event profile. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended vortioxetine as an option for treating MDEs in adults whose condition has responded inadequately to two antidepressants within the current episode.","[Lomas, James; Soares, Marta; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, CHE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Llewellyn, Alexis; Simmonds, Mark; Wright, Kath; Eastwood, Alison] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat CRD, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Lomas, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, CHE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",james.lomas@york.ac.uk,"Soares, Marta/HJH-3434-2023; Wright, Kath/P-1516-2019","Soares, Marta Ferreira Oliveira/0000-0003-1579-8513",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [12/66/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 12/66/01) [see the HTA programme website (http://www.hta.ac.uk) for further project information].

We prove that continuity -SPE exists for each if the payoff functions are bounded and lower semicontinuous. A loss tolerance function is a function that assigns to each history a positive real number . A strategy profile is said to be a -tolerance equilibrium if for each history it is a -equilibrium in the subgame starting at .

Most studies emphasize epidemiology and medications, while large observational studies reporting on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with PAH are lacking. Our objective was to study the HRQOL of patients with PAH and to summarize the factors that influence it. We conducted systematic literature searches in English (PubMed, Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect and OVID) and Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP and SinoMed) databases to identify studies published from 2000 to 2015 assessing the HRQOL of patients with PAH. Search results were independently reviewed and extracted by two reviewers. Of 3392 records identified in the initial search, 20 eligible papers (19 English, 1 Chinese) were finally included. Studies used a range of instruments; the generic 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) was the most widely used, and the disease-specific Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Survey (CAMPHOR) was the second mostly widely used. Mean HRQOL scores assessed via the SF-36 (physical component summary [PCS] 25.4-80.1; mental component summary [MCS] 33.2-76.0) and CAMPHOR (symptom scores 3.1-17; total HRQOL 2.8-12.6; activity scores 3.8-18.1) varied across studies, reporting decreased HRQOL in patients. Mental health (depression, anxiety, stress), physical health (exercise capacity, symptoms) and medical therapies were reported to affect HRQOL. We found that PAH places a substantial burden on patients, particularly in terms of HRQOL; however, the paucity of large observational studies in this area requires the attention of researchers, especially in China.","[Gu, Shuyan; Hu, Huimei; Dong, Hengjin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hu, Huimei] Zhejiang Med Coll, Dept Publ Hlth, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Dong, HJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy Studies, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",donghj@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,97,22,25,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2016,34,8,,,,,751,770,,10.1007/s40273-016-0395-y,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DQ4LJ,26951248.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379175100004,0

Contagion can spread well before any default occurs, through the value of the obligations held by counterparties. Moreover, the extent of procyclicality effects depends explicitly on the structure of both the interbank network and the asset bank network.

Previous authors have examined the effects of specific temporal aggregation or sampling schemes, finding conventionally efficient techniques to be efficient only when both the regressand and the regressors are average sampled. Using an alternative method for analyzing aggregation under more general weighting schemes, I derive an efficiency bound that is conditional on the type of aggregation used on the low-frequency series and differs from the unconditional bound defined by the full-information high-frequency data-generating process, which is infeasible due to aggregation of at least one series. I modify a conventional estimator, canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), to accommodate cases in which the aggregation weights are known. The correlation structure may be utilized to offset the potential information loss from aggregation, resulting in a conditionally efficient estimator. In the case of unknown weights, the correlation structure of the error term generally confounds identification of conditionally efficient weights. Efficiency is illustrated using a simulation study and an application to estimating a gasoline demand equation.","[Miller, J.

However, because the use of these techniques has high implementation requirements, recent literature has employed approximate models. This paper proposes a new and simpler spreadsheet implementation procedure which presents lower implementation requirements than the widely used Kalman filtering estimation procedure. The proposal needs to estimate fewer parameters than usual and does not directly estimate sequences but considers the relationship between the states implicitly when defining the regression matrices. This translates into a significant reduction in processing time. We apply the proposal to estimate the parameters of a 4-factor model for four commercial commodities: crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline and natural gas; we then compare the accuracy with results using the Kalman filter method.

The financial market consists of cash, bond and stock. The interest rate in our model is assumed to follow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process while the contribution rate follows a geometric Brownian Motion. Thus, the pension manager has to hedge the risks of interest rate, stock and contribution rate. Different from most works in DC pension plan, the pension manger has to obtain the optimal allocations under loss aversion and Value-at-Risk(VaR) constraints. The loss aversion pension manager is sensitive to losses while the VaR pension manager has to ensure the quality of wealth at retirement. Since these problems are not standard concave optimization problems, martingale method is applied to derive the optimal investment strategies.

In our model we assume that the relative loss developments over time follow a stochastic process with dependent increments, and that the consequently estimated reserves evolve as a stochastic process with discontinuous paths, which all together could be mathematically described as a geometric fractional Brownian motion with random jumps. The dependence between increments reflects the first phase of the reserving cycle, i.e. prudent reserve releases, whereas the second phase of the cycle is captured by the jumps. Remarkably in our model a jump in the reserves occurs after a period of systematic under-estimation of the losses, as happens in reality. As a product of our model we propose practical estimators for the Solvency Capital Requirement and the Risk Margin as defined in the European regulation (Solvency II, EIOPA-14/209, 2014), and analogously in the Swiss regulation (SST, FINMA, 2008), as functions of the ultimate risk.

Financially constrained firms decide on the level of their liquid resources facing cash-flow shocks and time-varying investment opportunities. Firms' liquidity management decisions generate simultaneous waves in aggregate cash holdings and investment, even if technology remains constant. These investment waves are not constrained efficient in general, because the social and private value of liquidity differs. The resulting pecuniary externality affects incentives differentially depending on the state of the economy, and often overinvestment occurs during booms and underinvestment occurs during recessions. In general, policies intended to mitigate underinvestment raise prices during recessions, making overinvestment during booms worse. However, a well-designed price-support policy will increase welfare in both booms and recessions.","[He, Zhiguo] Univ Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Zhiguo] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kondor, Peter] London Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kondor, Peter] CEPR, London, England",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"He, ZG (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;He, ZG (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kondor, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Kondor, P (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",zhiguo.he@chicagobooth.edu; p.kondor@lse.ac.uk,,,Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Paul Woolley Centre at the LSE; European Research Council [336585]; European Research Council (ERC) [336585] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Paul Woolley Centre at the LSE; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to the editor, the referees, Ulf Axelson, Hans Gersbach, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Guido Lorenzoni, Semyon Malamud, John Moore, Tyler Muir, Martin Oehmke, Alp Simsek, Balazs Szentes, Jaume Ventura, Rob Vishny, and numerous seminar participants.

In their work, the total payoff in a stochastic game is defined either as a Cesaro mean or an Abel mean of the stage payoffs. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, it generalizes the result of Bewley and Kohlberg (1976) to a more general class of payoff evaluations, and it proves with an example that this new result is tight. It also investigates the particular case of absorbing games. Second, for the uniform approach of Mertens and Neyman, this paper provides an example of absorbing game to demonstrate that there is no natural way to generalize their result to a wider class of payoff evaluations.","[Ziliotto, Bruno] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Ziliotto, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France.",brunoziliotto01@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,6,5,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

In this paper, we empirically study claims inflation with focus on automobile liability insurance based on a data set provided by a large German non-life insurance company. The aim is to obtain empirical insight regarding the drivers of claims inflation risk and its, impact on reserving. Toward this end, we use stepwise multiple regression analysis to identify relevant drivers based on economic indices related to health costs and consumer prices, amongst others. We further study the impact of (implicitly and explicitly) predicting calendar year inflation effects on claims reserves using stochastic inflation models.

As such, all existing multiple-factor asset pricing models, including the intertermporal CAPM and Ross' APT, are special cases of this formulation. First, similar to the standard models, a traded asset's expected return is linear in a finite number of traded risk-factor returns. Different from standard models, however, this model allows potentially an infinite number of distinct risk-factors in the economy. Different assets will, in general, depend on a different finite set of risk-factors. Second, positive alphas imply arbitrage opportunities or the existence of dominated securities, and not just abnormal expected returns. This generalization is consistent with many of the observed discrepancies between existing multiple-factor asset pricing models and the empirical evidence.","[Jarrow, Robert] Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jarrow, Robert] Kamakura Corp, Honolulu, HI USA; [Protter, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA",Cornell University; Columbia University,"Jarrow, R (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Jarrow, R (通讯作者)，Kamakura Corp, Honolulu, HI USA.",raj15@cornell.edu,,,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1308483] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),,,22,10,11,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed 'Systemic Risk Tax' (SRT) leads to a self-organized restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and SR.","[Poledna, Sebastian; Thurner, Stefan] Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Poledna, Sebastian; Thurner, Stefan] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Thurner, Stefan] Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Medical University of Vienna; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); The Santa Fe Institute,"Thurner, S (通讯作者)，Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;Thurner, S (通讯作者)，IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.;Thurner, S (通讯作者)，Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",stefan.thurner@meduniwien.ac.at,,"Poledna, Sebastian/0000-0002-5838-6570",EC FP7 project CRISIS [288501]; EC FP7 project LASAGNE [318132]; EC FP7 project MULTIPLEX [317532],EC FP7 project CRISIS; EC FP7 project LASAGNE; EC FP7 project MULTIPLEX,"We acknowledge financial support from EC FP7 projects CRISIS, agreement no.

This paper proposes a new technique for volatility extraction, based on a semiparametric version of the optimal Wiener-Kolmogorov filter in the frequency domain. Its main characteristics are its simplicity and generality, because no parametric specification is needed for the volatility component and it remains valid for both stationary and nonstationary signals. The applicability of the proposal is shown in a Monte Carlo and in a daily series of returns from the Dow Jones Industrial index.","[Arteche, Josu] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Arteche, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Econometr & Stat, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",josu.arteche@ehu.es,"Arteche, Josu/HZJ-0572-2023; Arteche, Josu/X-1797-2019; Arteche, Josu/B-7649-2011","Arteche, Josu/0000-0002-6700-3615","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; ERDF [ECO2010-15332, ECO2013-40935-P]; UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group; Basque Government [IT-642-13]; UPV/EHU UFI Sustainable Economics Welfare [11/03]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); ERDF(European Union (EU)); UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group; Basque Government(Basque Government); UPV/EHU UFI Sustainable Economics Welfare,"Research supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and ERDF grants ECO2010-15332 and ECO2013-40935-P, UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group, Basque Government grant IT-642-13 and UPV/EHU UFI 11/03 Sustainable Economics & Welfare.

Examples include structural business cycle estimation, implied volatility smile, the yield curve. Having embedded these quantities into continuous random curves, estimation of the covariance function is needed to extract factors, perform dimensionality reduction, and conduct inference on the factor scores. A series expansion for the covariance function is considered. Under summability restrictions on the absolute values of the coefficients in the series expansion, an estimation procedure that is resilient to overfitting is proposed. Under certain conditions, the rate of consistency for the resulting estimator achieves the minimax rate, allowing the observations to be weakly dependent. When the domain of the functional data is K(>1) dimensional, the absolute summability restriction of the coefficients avoids the so called curse of dimensionality. As an application, a Box-Pierce statistic to test independence of partially observed functional data is derived.

We model how risk-averse retirees optimally withdraw from the products, balancing returns and the embedded longevity protection. Assuming reasonable individual preferences, the resulting cash flow generates a Money's Worth Ratio of around 0.9 for our stylized VA/GLWB in the post-crisis product, considerably lower than what was offered prior to 2008. Sensitivity analyses with respect to portfolio choice, mortality, fees, and guaranteed withdrawal rates show that NIWRs range from 0.80 to 1.0, with the portfolio choice making the biggest difference. For most parameter choices, the utility value of the VA/GLWB exceeds that of a similar mutual fund, but it is less than for a fixed annuity. Interestingly, VA/GLWB withdrawals in early retirement can optimally exceed contract maximum withdrawals, despite the fact that this reduces future withdrawal guarantees. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This model performs gradient descent in a constrained functional space by directly minimizing loss functions customized with different trading performance measurements. To demonstrate its practical applications, a simple trading system was designed with trading signals constructed from pdGBM predictions and fixed holding period in each trade. We tested this trading system on the high-frequency data of SPDR S&P 500 index ETF (SPY). In the out-of-sample period, it generated an average of 0.045% return per trade and an annualized Sharpe ratio close to 20 after transaction costs. Various empirical results also showed the model robustness to different parameters. These superior performances confirm the predictability of short-horizon price movements in the US equity market. We also compared the performance of this trading system with similar trading systems based on other predictive models like the gradient boosting model with L2 loss function and the penalized linear model.

An important reason is that the employed test statistics are nonpivotal, and so critical values are not readily available. This article proposes an omnibus test in the spirit of the ICM tests of Bierens and Ploberger (1997, Econometrica 65, 1129-1151) where the test statistic is based on the minimized value of a quadratic function of the residuals of time series econometric models. The proposed test falls under the category of overidentification restriction tests started by Sargan (1958, Econometrica 26, 393-415). The corresponding projection interpretation leads us to propose a straightforward wild bootstrap procedure that requires only linear regressions to estimate the critical values irrespective of the model functional form. Hence, contrary to other existing ICM tests, the critical values are easily calculated while the test preserves the admissibility property of ICM tests.","[Dominguez, Manuel A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Lobato, Ignacio N.] ITAM, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico",Complutense University of Madrid; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Lobato, IN (通讯作者)，ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Ave Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",ilobato@itam.mx,,,Mexican CONACYT [151624]; Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura; Spanish Ministry of Education [SEJ2007-62908],Mexican CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura; Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),"We thank an associate editor and a referee for useful comments, and Marine Carrasco, Miguel Delgado, and Juan Carlos Escanciano for useful conversations.

This practice implies symmetric effects on the remaining lifetime of the surviving spouse. The new model allows for both asymmetric reactions by means of a Freund model, and risk dependence by means of an unobservable common risk factor (or frailty). These models allow for distinguishing in the lifetime dependence the component due to common lifetime (frailty) from the jump in mortality intensity upon death of spouse (Freund model).

The complex, path-dependent nature of these products means that these sensitivities are typically estimated by Monte Carlo methods. Standard market practice is to use a bump and revalue method in which sensitivities are approximated by finite differences. As well as requiring multiple valuations of the product, this approach is often unreliable for higher-order Greeks, such as gamma, and alternative pathwise (PW) and likelihood-ratio estimators should be preferred. This paper considers a stylized guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit product in which the reference equity index follows a Heston stochastic volatility model in a stochastic interest rate environment. The complete set of first-order sensitivities with respect to index value, volatility and interest rate and the most important second-order sensitivities are calculated using PW, likelihood-ratio and mixed methods. It is observed that the PW method delivers the best estimates of first-order sensitivities while mixed estimation methods deliver considerably more accurate estimates of second-order sensitivities; moreover there are significant computational gains involved in using PW and mixed estimators rather than simple BnR estimators when many Greeks have to be calculated.","[Cathcart, Mark J.] Standard Life Grp, Edinburgh EH1 2DH, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lok, Hsiao Yen; McNeil, Alexander J.] Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Morrison, Steven] Moodys Analyt, Edinburgh EH3 8RD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University,"McNeil, AJ (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",mark.j.cathcart@gmail.com; yhl30@hw.ac.uk; a.j.mcneil@hw.ac.uk; steven.morrison@moodys.com,"McNeil, Alexander/O-9152-2016","McNeil, Alexander/0000-0002-6137-2890",,,,,16,8,9,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2015,45,2,,,,,239,266,,10.1017/asb.2014.31,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CG8WC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353595000001,0

The parameter theta of the FGM distribution governs the strength of dependence, with a smaller value of theta corresponding to a less risky situation. For the subexponential case with -1 < theta <= 1, a general asymptotic formula for the finite-time ruin probability was derived. However, the derivation there is not valid for the least risky case theta = -1. In this paper, we complete the study by extending it to theta = -1. The new formulas for theta = -1 look very different from, but are intrinsically consistent with, the existing one for -1 < theta <= 1, and they offer a quantitative understanding on how significantly the asymptotic ruin probability decreases when theta switches from its normal range to its negative extremum.

Research up to date on VA largely focuses on the valuation of guarantees embedded in a single VA contract. However, methods developed for individual VA contracts based on option pricing theory cannot be extended to large VA portfolios. Insurance companies currently use nested simulation to valuate guarantees for VA portfolios but efficient valuation under nested simulation for a large VA portfolio has been a real challenge. The computation in nested simulation is highly intensive and often prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a clustering technique with a functional data analysis technique to address the issue. We create a highly non-homogeneous synthetic VA portfolio of 100,000 contracts and use it to estimate the dollar Delta of the portfolio at each time step of outer loop scenarios under the nested simulation framework over a period of 25 years. Our test results show that the proposed approach performs well in terms of accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that the two interpretations are not always interchangeable. Presented are two examples which demonstrate that decision maker's (subjective) perception may not be adequately modeled as embodied in his preferences over (objective) alternatives. It is also emphasized that in order to understand choice behavior, one has to take into the account decision maker's perception of the choice problem rather than its objective description by an observer.","Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hudik, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Jilska St 1, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",marek.hudik@gmail.com,"Hudik, Marek/N-1610-2019","Hudik, Marek/0000-0002-1670-2555",,,,,38,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

This approach is motivated by the difficulty of obtaining an accurate estimate through existing algorithms that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) draws, where the draws are typically costly to obtain and highly correlated in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, we use the cross-entropy (CE) method, a versatile adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm originally developed for rare-event simulation. The main advantage of the importance sampling approach is that random samples can be obtained from some convenient density with little additional costs. As we are generating independent draws instead of correlated MCMC draws, the increase in simulation effort is much smaller should one wish to reduce the numerical standard error of the estimator. Moreover, the importance density derived via the CE method is grounded in information theory, and therefore, is in a well-defined sense optimal. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach by two empirical applications involving women's labor market participation and U.S. macroeconomic time series. In both applications, the proposed CE method compares favorably to existing estimators.","[Chan, Joshua C.

Anal. J., 1992, 48, 28-43] provide for a pioneering framework of allowing to incorporate investors' views based on a prior distribution to derive a posterior distribution of portfolio returns and optimal asset allocations. Meucci [Risk and Asset Allocation, 2005] rephrases the model in terms of investors' views on the market, rather than just the market parameters as in the original Black and Litterman [Financ. Anal. J., 1992, 48, 28-43]. This market-based version is believed to be much more parsimonious and allows for a more natural extension to directly input views in a non-Normal market. This paper extends Meucci's market-based version of the Black-Litterman model to the case when returns in the market fall within the class of Elliptical distributions, while also importantly preserving the equilibrium-based assumption in the model. Here, within this class for which the Normal distribution is a special case, we develop the explicit form of the posterior distribution after considering proper conditional conjugate-type prior distributions. This resulting posterior allows us to obtain solutions to optimization problems of asset allocation based on a variety of risk measures (e.g. Mean-Variance, Mean-VaR, Mean-Conditional VaR). Elliptical models of portfolio returns have recently crept into the financial literature because of their greater flexibility to accommodate larger tails. As numerical demonstrations, we examine how these principles work in a portfolio with international stock indices and show why models with more flexible tails can affect the asset allocation.","[Xiao, Yugu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Ctr Appl Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Valdez, Emiliano A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Math, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Renmin University of China; Michigan State University,"Xiao, YG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Ctr Appl Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yuguxiao@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Nature Science Foundation of China [71171193],National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Dr Y.

We discover a stark qualitative contrast in behavior in continuous time as compared to previously studied behavior in discrete-time games: cooperation is easier to achieve and sustain with deterministic horizons than with stochastic ones, and end-game effects emerge, but subjects postpone them with experience. Analysis of individual strategies provides a basis for a simple reinforcement learning model that proves to be consistent with this evidence.

The proposed techniques can be applied in any set-up where parametric conditional distribution of the data is specified and, in particular, to models involving conditional volatility, conditional higher moments, conditional quantiles, asymmetry, Value at Risk models, duration models, diffusion models, etc. Compared to other tests, the new test properly controls the nonlinear dynamic behaviour in conditional distribution and does not rely on smoothing techniques that require a choice of several tuning parameters. The test is based on a new kind of multivariate empirical process of contemporaneous and lagged probability integral transforms. We establish weak convergence of the process under parameter uncertainty and local alternatives. We justify a parametric bootstrap approximation that accounts for parameter estimation effects often ignored in practice. Monte Carlo experiments show that the test has good finite-sample size and power properties. Using the new test and graphical tools, we check the adequacy of various popular heteroscedastic models for stock exchange index data.","New Econ Sch, Moscow 143025, Russia",New Economic School,"Kheifets, IL (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, 100A Novaya St, Moscow 143025, Russia.",ikheifets@nes.ru,"Kheifets, Igor/AAG-7599-2021",", Igor/0000-0001-6566-5845",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad [ECO2012-31748],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad(Spanish Government),"I am grateful to Carlos Velasco for stimulating questions and important suggestions, and to Vanessa Berenguer, Victor Chernozhukov, Miguel Delgado, Manuel Dominguez, Jesus Gonzalo, Oliver Linton, Andrew Patton, Stefan Sperlich, Abderrahim Taamouti and the anonymous referees for helpful comments.

This synthetic outcome, which combines the quantity of life lived with its quality expressed as a preference score, is currently recommended as reference case by some health technology assessment (HTA) agencies. While critics of the QALY approach have expressed concerns about equity and ethical issues, surprisingly, very few have tested the basic methodological assumptions supporting the QALY equation so as to establish its scientific validity. Objectives The main objective of the ECHOUTCOME European project was to test the validity of the underlying assumptions of the QALY outcome and its relevance in health decision making. Methods An experiment has been conducted with 1,361 subjects from Belgium, France, Italy, and the UK. The subjects were asked to express their preferences regarding various hypothetical health states derived from combining different health states with time durations in order to compare observed utility values of the couples (health state, time) and calculated utility values using the QALY formula. Results Observed and calculated utility values of the couples (health state, time) were significantly different, confirming that preferences expressed by the respondents were not consistent with the QALY theoretical assumptions. Conclusions This European study contributes to establishing that the QALY multiplicative model is an invalid measure. This explains why costs/QALY estimates may vary greatly, leading to inconsistent recommendations relevant to providing access to innovative medicines and health technologies. HTA agencies should consider other more robust methodological approaches to guide reimbursement decisions.","[Beresniak, Ariel] Data Min Int, CH-1215 Geneva 15, Switzerland; [Beresniak, Ariel] Paris Descartes Univ, LIRAES, Paris, France; [Medina-Lara, Antonieta] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Medina-Lara, Antonieta] Bocconi Univ, CERGAS, Milan, Italy; [Auray, Jean Paul; Duru, Gerard] Cyklad Grp, Lyon, France; [De Wever, Alain; Praet, Jean-Claude] Univ Libre Bruxelle, Brussels, Belgium; [Tarricone, Rosanna; Torbica, Aleksandra] Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy; [Dupont, Danielle; Lamure, Michel] Univ Lyon 1, F-69365 Lyon, France",Universite Paris Cite; University of Exeter; Bocconi University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Bocconi University; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Beresniak, A (通讯作者)，Data Min Int, Route Aeroport 29-31,CP 221, CH-1215 Geneva 15, Switzerland.",aberesniak@datamining-international.com,"Medina-Lara, Antonieta/AAP-7634-2021","Torbica, Aleksandra/0000-0001-8938-7608; TARRICONE, ROSANNA/0000-0002-2009-9357",European Union [242203],European Union(European Union (EU)),This project has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under agreement no 242203.

When the surplus hits zero, the company can inject capital to keep the surplus positive. In addition, it is assumed that both fixed and proportional costs are incurred upon each capital injection. Our objective is to minimize the expected value of the discounted capital injection costs by controlling the investment policy and the capital injection policy. We first prove the continuity of the value function and a verification theorem for the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We then show that the optimal investment policy is a solution to a terminal value problem of an ordinary differential equation. In particular, explicit solutions are derived in some special cases and a series solution is obtained for the general case. Also, we propose a numerical method to solve the optimal investment and capital injection policies. Finally, a numerical study is carried out to illustrate the effect of the model parameters on the optimal policies.","[Zhou, Ming] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yuen, Kam C.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Hong Kong,"Zhou, M (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",mzhou.act@gmail.com; kcyuen@hku.hk,"Yuen, Kam Chuen/D-3155-2009",,Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project [YETP0958]; Chinese Social Science of State Education Ministry [12YJC790290]; Society of Actuaries [CAE 2013],Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Chinese Social Science of State Education Ministry; Society of Actuaries,"The authors thank three anonymous referees and the editor, Professor Daniel Bauer, for their careful reading and useful comments that greatly improved the presentation of the paper.

However, little is known about current practice and trends in the use of BWS in health care. This study aimed to identify, review and critically appraise BWS in health care, and to identify trends over time in key aspects of BWS. A systematic review was conducted, using Medline (via Pubmed) and EMBASE to identify all English-language BWS studies published up until April 2016. Using a predefined extraction form, two reviewers independently selected articles and critically appraised the study quality, using the Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, Significance (PREFS) checklist. Trends over time periods (aecurrency sign2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015) were assessed further. A total of 62 BWS studies were identified, of which 26 were BWS object case studies, 29 were BWS profile case studies and seven were BWS multi-profile case studies. About two thirds of the studies were performed in the last 2 years. Decreasing sample sizes and decreasing numbers of factors in BWS object case studies, as well as use of less complicated analytical methods, were observed in recent studies. The quality of the BWS studies was generally acceptable according to the PREFS checklist, except that most studies did not indicate whether the responders were similar to the non-responders. Use of BWS object case and BWS profile case has drastically increased in health care, especially in the last 2 years. In contrast with previous discrete-choice experiment reviews, there is increasing use of less sophisticated analytical methods.","[Cheung, Kei Long; Wijnen, Ben F. M.; Evers, Silvia M. A.

The relationship between equilibrium strategies and network centrality measures are investigated in games where there is a common valuation of players as friends. The utility from links is a weighted sum of Cobb-Douglas functions, the weights representing the common valuation. If the Cobb-Douglas functions are bilinear and the link formation cost is not too high, then indegree, eigenvector centrality, and the Katz-Bonacich centrality measure put the players in opposite order than the common valuation. The same result holds for non-negligible link formation costs if the Cobb-Douglas functions are separately concave but not jointly concave. If the Cobb-Douglas functions are strictly concave, then at the interior equilibrium these measures order the players in the same way as the common valuation.","[Salonen, Hannu] Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Turku 20014, Finland",University of Turku,"Salonen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Dept Econ, Turku 20014, Finland.",hansal@utu.fi,,,Academy of Finland; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,"I thank an associate editor and two anonymous referees for comments and criticism.

Under the assumptions that all current and future markets exist and that farmers treat all prices as given, the model simplifies households' simultaneous production and consumption decisions into a recursive form in which production can be treated as independent of preferences of household members. These assumptions, which are the foundation of a large literature in labor and development, have been tested and not rejected in several important studies including Benjamin (1992). Using multiple waves of longitudinal survey data from Central Java, Indonesia, this paper tests a key prediction of the recursive model: demand for farm labor is unrelated to the demographic composition of the farm household. The prediction is unambiguously rejected. The rejection cannot be explained by contamination due to unobserved heterogeneity that is fixed at the farm level, local area shocks, or farm-specific shocks that affect changes in household composition and farm labor demand. We conclude that the recursive form of the farm household model is not consistent with the data. Developing empirically tractable models of farm households when markets are incomplete remains an important challenge.","[LaFave, Daniel] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Thomas, Duncan] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Colby College; Duke University,"LaFave, D (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",drlafave@colby.edu; dthomas@econ.duke.edu,,,National Institutes of Aging [R01 AG020909]; Fogarty International Center at the NIH [D43 TW007699],National Institutes of Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Fogarty International Center at the NIH,"This paper has benefited from helpful comments from four anonymous referees as well as discussions with Peter Arcidiacono, Chris Barrett, Dwayne Benjamin, Pascaline Dupas, Andrew Foster, Amar Hamoudi, V.

Fundamentally, public health policies aim at increasing the uptake of effective and efficient interventions and at subsequently leading to better health benefits (e.g., premature mortality and morbidity averted). In addition, public health policies can provide non-health benefits in addition to the sole wellbeing of populations and beyond the health sector. For instance, public policies such as social and health insurance programs can prevent illness-related impoverishment and procure financial risk protection. Furthermore, public policies can improve the distribution of health in the population and promote the equalization of health among individuals. Extended cost-effectiveness analysis was developed to address health policy assessment, specifically to evaluate the health and financial consequences of public policies in four domains: (1) the health gains; (2) the financial risk protection benefits; (3) the total costs to the policy makers; and (4) the distributional benefits. Here, we present a tutorial that describes both the intent of extended cost-effectiveness analysis and its keys to allow easy implementation for health policy assessment.","[Verguet, Stephane] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, 665 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kim, Jane J.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA USA; [Jamison, Dean T.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Global Hlth Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Jamison, Dean T.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

We propose a cubic spline procedure to estimate the unknown quantities in the semiparametric GARCH model that is intuitively appealing due to its simplicity. The theoretical properties of the procedure are the same as the kernel procedure, while simulated and real data examples show that the numerical performance is either better than or comparable to the kernel method.

However, the most appropriate method to anchor the utility values on the full health to dead quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scale remains uncertain. We test four approaches to anchoring in which dead is valued at zero and full health at one. We use data from two DCEs valuing EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L health states, which presented pairs of health profiles with an associated duration, and a dead option. The approaches to anchoring the results on the required scale were (1) using only preferences between non-dead health profiles; (2) including the dead data, treating it as a health profile with zero duration; (3) explicitly modelling both duration and dead; and (4) using the preferences regarding the dead health state as an external anchor subsequent to the estimation of approach 1. All approaches lead to differences in the scale of utility decrements, but not the ranking of EQ-5D health states. The models differ in their ability to predict preferences around dead health states, and the characteristics of the value sets in terms of their range and the proportion of states valued as worse than dead. Appropriate anchoring of DCEs with or without complementary time trade-off (TTO) data remains unresolved, and the method chosen will impact on health resource allocation decision making employing the value sets.","[Norman, Richard] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia; [Mulhern, Brendan; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Curtin University; University of Technology Sydney,"Norman, R (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia.",Richard.Norman@curtin.edu.au; Brendan.Mulhern@chere.uts.edu.au; Rosalie.Viney@chere.uts.edu.au,"Norman, Richard P/B-4290-2009","Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635; Norman, Richard/0000-0002-3112-3893; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",National Health and Medical Research Council [403303],National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"The authors (Norman, Mulhern, and Viney) declare no conflict of interests.

The School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) Technology Assessment Group was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission (CS), the ERG review and the subsequent decision of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence of LDV/SOF based upon the CS. The clinical effectiveness data for LDV/SOF were taken from ten trials: three phase III trials and seven phase II trials. Trials compared different durations of LDV/SOF, with and without ribavirin (RBV). There were no head-to-head trials comparing LDV/SOF with any comparator listed in the NICE scope. Data from the trials were mostly from populations with genotype 1 (GT1) disease, although some limited data were available for populations with genotypes 3 and 4. For GT1 treatment-na < ve patients, sustained viral response for 12 weeks (SVR12) rates for LDV/SOF ranged from 93.1 to 99.4 % for subgroups of patients with non-cirrhotic disease, whilst SVR rates of 94.1 to 100 % were reported for subgroups of patients with compensated cirrhosis. For GT1 treatment-experienced patients, SVR12 rates ranging from 95.4 to 100 % were reported for subgroups of non-cirrhotic patients, and SVR rates ranging from 81.8 to 100 % were reported within subgroups of patients with compensated cirrhosis. Comparator data were not searched systematically as part of the submission, but were based on the company's previous NICE submission of sofosbuvir, with additional targeted searches. The ERG's critical appraisal of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns. The ERG's base case analyses suggested that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for LDV/SOF (+RBV) are dependent on (a) treatment durations, (b) whether patients have been previously treated and (c) whether patients have liver cirrhosis or not. The AC concluded that it was appropriate to use the approach taken in the ERG's exploratory analyses, in line with the marketing authorisation, which considered people with and without cirrhosis separately, and estimated the cost effectiveness for each recommended treatment duration of LDV/SOF.","[Thokala, P.; Simpson, E.

[Volatility is rough, 2014] previously showed that the logarithm of realized variance behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable timescale. The resulting Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV) model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data. We now show how the RFSV model can be used to price claims on both the underlying and integrated variance. We analyse in detail a simple case of this model, the rBergomi model. In particular, we find that the rBergomi model fits the SPX volatility markedly better than conventional Markovian stochastic volatility models, and with fewer parameters. Finally, we show that actual SPX variance swap curves seem to be consistent with model forecasts, with particular dramatic examples from the weekend of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Flash Crash.","[Bayer, Christian; Friz, Peter] Weierstr Inst Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Friz, Peter] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gatheral, Jim] CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",Technical University of Berlin; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Gatheral, J (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",jim.gatheral@baruch.cuny.edu,,"Bayer, Christian/0000-0002-9116-0039","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BA 5484/1, FR 2943/2]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),C.B. and P.F. gratefully acknowledge financial support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through Research Grant BA 5484/1 and FR 2943/2.,,18,192,199,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Offer and demand of liquidity drives price formation and traders anticipate future evolutions of the orderbook. The natural framework we use is mean field game theory, a class of stochastic differential games with a continuum of anonymous players. Several sources of heterogeneity are considered including the mean size of orders. Thus we are able to consider the coexistence of Institutional Investors and high frequency traders (HFT). We provide both analytical solutions and numerical experiments. Implications on classical quantities are explored: orderbook size, prices, and effective bid/ ask spread. According to the model, in markets with Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient liquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations corresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these situations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price. However this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional Investors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the newsituation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher trading costs.","[Lachapelle, Aime] MFG Labs, Paris, France; [Lasry, Jean-Michel; Lions, Pierre-Louis] CEREMADE, Paris, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] Capital Fund Management, Paris, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] Imperial Coll, London, England; [Lions, Pierre-Louis] Coll France, Paris, France",Imperial College London; Universite PSL; College de France,"Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，Capital Fund Management, Paris, France.;Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, London, England.",charles@lehalle.net,"Lehalle, Charles-Albert/H-5700-2019","Lehalle, Charles-Albert/0000-0002-9978-9501",,,,,40,32,38,2,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

In general, the properties of the conditional distribution of multiple period returns do not follow easily from the one-period data generating process, rendering this a non-trivial task. We outline a framework that forms the basis for setting approximations and study four different approaches. Their performance is evaluated by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on an asymmetric GARCH model, implying conditional skewness and excess kurtosis in the multiple period returns. This simulation-based approach was the best one, closely followed by that of assuming a skewed t-distribution for the multiple period returns. The approach based on a Gram-Charlier expansion was not able to cope with the implied non-normality, while the so-called Root-k approach performed poorly. In addition, we outline how the delta-method may be used to quantify the estimation error in the predictors and in the Monte Carlo study we found that it performed well.

We start from the Cobb-Douglas production and shadow cost system. We show that the shadow cost system has a closed-form likelihood function contrary to what was previously thought. In turn, we use the method of local maximum likelihood applied to a system of equations to obtain firm-specific parameter estimates (which reveal heterogeneity in production) as well as measures of technical and allocative inefficiency and its cost.

We estimate the time-varying risk premia implied by conditional linear asset pricing models where the conditioning includes both instruments common to all assets and asset-specific instruments. The estimator uses simple weighted two-pass cross-sectional regressions, and we show its consistency and asymptotic normality under increasing cross-sectional and time series dimensions. We address consistent estimation of the asymptotic variance by hard thresholding, and testing for asset pricing restrictions induced by the no-arbitrage assumption. We derive the restrictions given by a continuum of assets in a multi-period economy under an approximate factor structure robust to asset repackaging. The empirical analysis on returns for about ten thousand U.S. stocks from July 1964 to December 2009 shows that risk premia are large and volatile in crisis periods. They exhibit large positive and negative strays from time-invariant estimates, follow the macroeconomic cycles, and do not match risk premia estimates on standard sets of portfolios. The asset pricing restrictions are rejected for a conditional four-factor model capturing market, size, value, and momentum effects.","[Gagliardini, Patrick; Ossola, Elisa] USI, Fac Econ, Via Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Gagliardini, Patrick; Scaillet, Olivier] Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Scaillet, Olivier] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, Bd Pont dArve 40, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Gagliardini, P (通讯作者)，USI, Fac Econ, Via Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.;Gagliardini, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.",patrick.gagliardini@usi.ch; elisa.ossola@usi.ch; olivier.scaillet@unige.ch,"Ossola, Elisa/AAV-5767-2021","Ossola, Elisa/0000-0001-5616-5785; Scaillet, Olivier/0000-0002-3948-6891","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PDFM11-114533, 140829]; Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR FINRISK); Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC); SNSF",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR FINRISK)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC); SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank the co-editor and the two referees for constructive criticism and numerous suggestions which have led to substantial improvements over the previous versions.

An important practical problem is to estimate the regulatory capital so the ruin probability is at the regulatory level, typically with less than 0.1% over a finite-time horizon. Estimating probabilities of rare events is challenging, since naive estimations via direct simulations of the surplus process is not feasible. In this paper, we present a stratified sampling algorithm for estimating finite-time ruin probabilities. We further introduce a sequence of measure changes to remove the pathwise discontinuities of the estimator, and compute unbiased first and second-order derivative estimates of the finite-time ruin probabilities with respect to both distributional and structural parameters. We then estimate the regulatory capital and its sensitivities. These estimates provide information to insurance companies for meeting prudential regulations as well as designing risk management strategies.

The discontinuity in the shrinkage factor makes the analysis of the corrected-3S estimator harder to carry out in misspecified models. We propose a slight modification to this factor to control its rate of divergence in case of misspecification. We show that the resulting modified-3S estimator is also higher order equivalent to the maximum empirical likelihood (EL) estimator in well-specified models and root n-convergent and asymptotically Gaussian in misspecified models. Its asymptotic distribution robust to misspecification is also provided. Because of these properties, both the 3S and the modified-3S estimators could be considered as computationally attractive alternatives to the exponentially tilted empirical likelihood estimator proposed by Schennach (2007) which also is higher order equivalent to EL in well-specified models and root n-convergent in misspecified models.","[Dovonon, Prosper] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Dovonon, P (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",prosper.dovonon@concordia.ca,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Despite this, and due to their relatively high acquisition and administration costs, LAIs are still underused in clinical practice in France, thus highlighting the need for pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of paliperidone LAI (or paliperidone palmitate), a once-monthly second-generation LAI antipsychotic, compared with the most common antipsychotic medications for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in France. A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of a cohort of schizophrenic patients through four health states (stable treated, stable non-treated, relapse and death) and to consider up to three lines of treatment to account for changes in treatment management. Paliperidone LAI was compared with risperidone LAI, aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI, haloperidol LAI (or haloperidol decanoate) and oral olanzapine. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and number of relapses were assessed over 5 years based on 3-month cycles with a discount rate of 4 % and from a French health insurance perspective. Patients were considered to be stabilised after a schizophrenic episode and would enter the model at an initiation phase, followed by a prevention of relapse phase if successful. Data (e.g. relapse or discontinuation rates) for the initiation phase came from randomised clinical trials, whereas relapse rates in the prevention phase were derived from hospitalisation risks based on real-life French data to capture adherence effects. Safety and utility data were derived from international publications. Additionally, costs were retrieved from French health insurance databases and publications. Finally, expert opinion was used for validation purposes or in case of gaps in data. The robustness of results was assessed through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. All LAI antipsychotics were found to have similar costs over 5 years: approximatively a,not sign55,000, except for paliperidone LAI which had a discounted cost of a,not sign50,880. Oral olanzapine was less costly than LAIs (i.e. a,not sign50,379 after 5 years) but was associated with fewer QALYs gained and relapses avoided. Paliperidone LAI dominated aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI and haloperidol LAI in terms of costs per QALY, and it was associated with slightly fewer QALYs when compared with risperidone LAI (i.e. 3.763 vs 3.764). This resulted in a high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. a,not sign4,770,018 per QALY gained) for risperidone LAI compared with paliperidone LAI. Paliperidone LAI was more costly than olanzapine oral but associated with more QALYs (i.e. ICER of a,not sign2411 per QALY gained for paliperidone LAI compared with oral olanzapine). Paliperidone LAI had a probability of being the optimal strategy in more than 50 % of cases for a willingness-to-pay threshold of a,not sign8000 per QALY gained. This analysis, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to assess the cost effectiveness of antipsychotics based on French observational data. Paliperidone LAI appeared to be a cost-effective option in the treatment of schizophrenia from the French health insurance perspective.","[Druais, Sylvain] Amaris, 204 Rue St Sacrement,Espace Rezomont 3ieme Etage, Montreal, PQ H2Y 1W8, Canada; [Doutriaux, Agathe; Cognet, Magali] Amaris, London, England; [Godet, Annabelle; Guillon, Pascal] Janssen Cilag, Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Lancon, Christophe] Fac Med Marseille, F-13385 Marseille, France; [Levy, Pierre] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France; [Samalin, Ludovic] Univ Auvergne, CHU Clermont Ferrand, EA 7280, Clermont Ferrand, France",Johnson & Johnson; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; CHU Clermont Ferrand; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Druais, S (通讯作者)，Amaris, 204 Rue St Sacrement,Espace Rezomont 3ieme Etage, Montreal, PQ H2Y 1W8, Canada.",sylvain.druais@gmail.com,"Samalin, Ludovic/AAP-6362-2020","Samalin, Ludovic/0000-0003-0740-4019",Janssen-Cilag,Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc),The study was funded by Janssen-Cilag.,,78,30,31,3,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2016,34,4,,,,,363,391,,10.1007/s40273-015-0348-x,0.0,,,29,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DH6EJ,26883132.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372883500006,0

In order to conduct inference in partially identified econometric models defined by moment (in)equalities, the literature has proposed three methods: bootstrap, sub-sampling, and asymptotic approximation. The objective of this paper is to compare these methods in terms of the rate at which they achieve the desired coverage level, i.e., in terms of the rate at which the error in the coverage probability (ECP) converges to zero. Under certain conditions, we show that the ECP of the bootstrap and the ECP of the asymptotic approximation converge to zero at the same rate, which is a faster rate than that of the ECP of subsampling methods. As a consequence, under these conditions, the bootstrap and the asymptotic approximation produce inference that is more precise than subsampling. A Monte Carlo simulation study confirms that these results are relevant in finite samples.","[Bugni, Federico A.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Bugni, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",federico.bugni@duke.edu,,,,,,,41,5,6,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

In this paper, the design of an optimal retrospective rating plan is analyzed from the perspective of the insured who seeks to minimize its risk exposure in the sense of convex order. In order to reduce the moral hazard, we assume that both the insured and the insurer are obligated to pay more for a larger realization of the loss. Under the further assumptions that the minimum premium is zero, the maximum premium is proportional to the expected indemnity, and the basic premium is the only free parameter in the formula for retrospective premium given by Meyers (2004) and that the basic premium is determined in such a way that the expected retrospective premium equates to the expected indemnity with a positive safety loading, we formally establish the relationship that the insured will suffer more risk for a larger loss conversion factor or a higher maximum premium. These findings suggest that the insured prefers an insurance policy with the expected value premium principle, which is a special retrospective premium principle with zero loss conversion factor. In addition, we show that any admissible retrospective rating plan is dominated by a stop-loss insurance policy. Finally, the optimal retention of a stop-loss insurance is derived numerically under the criterion of minimizing the risk-adjusted value of the insured's liability where the liability valuation is carried out using the cost-of-capital approach based on the conditional value at risk.","[Chen, Xinxiang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Math Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Chi, Yichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tan, Ken Seng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Xiamen University; Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Waterloo,"Chi, YC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",xxchen@xmu.edu.cn; yichun1982@hotmail.com; kstan@uwaterloo.ca,,"Chi, Yichun/0000-0001-9272-6471",Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2014J01022]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11471345]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; CAE Research Grant from Society of Actuaries,Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); CAE Research Grant from Society of Actuaries,The authors thank two reviewers for their helpful comments.

In this paper we investigate the continuous-time limits of well-known actuarial premium principles when such backward iteration procedures are applied. This method is applied to an insurance risk process in the form of a diffusion process and a jump process in order to capture the heavy tailed nature of insurance liabilities. We show that in the case of the diffusion process, the one-period time-consistent Variance premium principle converges to the non-linear exponential indifference price. Furthermore, we show that the Standard-Deviation and the Cost-of-Capital principle converge to the same price limit. Adding the jump risk gives a more realistic picture of the price. Furthermore, we no longer observe that the different premium principles converge to the same limit since each principle reflects the effect of the jump differently. In the Cost-of-Capital principle, in particular the VaR operator fails to capture the jump risk for small jump probabilities, and the time-consistent price depends on the distribution of the premium jump.

To our knowledge, the concept of baseline adjustment in a net benefit (NB) regression has not been studied. The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of different baseline adjustment approaches in an NB framework on the cost effectiveness of an intervention using person-level data. This study used data from a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a multifactorial falls prevention intervention for older home care clients. The outcome was the number of falls at the 6-month follow-up. The cost variable was the total healthcare costs from a societal perspective. Incremental NB values were estimated using four baseline adjustment approaches: (1) the change in NB is the dependent variable; (2) the NB at follow-up is the dependent variable without adjusting for baseline values; (3) the NB at follow-up is the dependent variable adjusting for baseline NB; and (4) the NB at follow-up is also the dependent variable adjusting for baseline cost and effect separately. With adjustment of baseline values (Approach 1, 3, 4), the intervention was not cost effective when compared to usual care. Conversely, without baseline adjustment (Approach 2), the intervention was cost effective if decision-makers' willingness-to-pay per fall prevented was CAN$10,000 or greater.

(i) We develop a simpler analytical characterization and numerical algorithm for Bayesian inference in structural vector autoregressions (VARs) that can be used for models that are overidentified, just-identified, or underidentified. (ii) We analyze the asymptotic properties of Bayesian inference and show that in the underidentified case, the asymptotic posterior distribution of contemporaneous coefficients in an n-variable VAR is confined to the set of values that orthogonalize the population variance-covariance matrix of ordinary least squares residuals, with the height of the posterior proportional to the height of the prior at any point within that set. For example, in a bivariate VAR for supply and demand identified solely by sign restrictions, if the population correlation between the VAR residuals is positive, then even if one has available an infinite sample of data, any inference about the demand elasticity is coming exclusively from the prior distribution. (iii) We provide analytical characterizations of the informative prior distributions for impulse-response functions that are implicit in the traditional sign-restriction approach to VARs, and we note, as a special case of result (ii), that the influence of these priors does not vanish asymptotically. (iv) We illustrate how Bayesian inference with informative priors can be both a strict generalization and an unambiguous improvement over frequentist inference in just-identified models. (v) We propose that researchers need to explicitly acknowledge and defend the role of prior beliefs in influencing structural conclusions and we illustrate how this could be done using a simple model of the U.S. labor market.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Hamilton, James D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 722 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",cjsbaumeister@gmail.com; jhamilton@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,44,150,169,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2015,83,5,,,,,1963,1999,,10.3982/ECTA12356,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CT3VB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362733900010,0

We use queuing theory to construct a new model that needs 4 different parameters: one that describes the rate of addition of new cars on the insurance contract, a second one that models the rate of removal of insured vehicles, a third parameter that models the cancellation rate of the insurance policy, and finally a parameter that describes the rate of renewal. Statistical inference techniques allow us to estimate each parameter of the model, even in the case where there is censorship of data. We also propose to generalize this new queuing process by adding some explanatory variables into each parameter of the model. This allows us to determine which policyholder's profiles are more likely to add or remove vehicles from their insurance policy, to cancel their contract or to renew annually. The estimated parameters help us to analyze the insurance portfolio in detail because the queuing theory model allows us to compute various kinds of useful statistics for insurers, such as the expected number of cars insured or the customer lifetime value that calculates the discounted future profits of an insured. Using car insurance data, a numerical illustration based on a portfolio from a Canadian insurance company is included to support this discussion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Under the criterion of maximizing the expected exponential utility, closed-form expressions for the optimal strategies and value function are derived not only for the compound Poisson risk model but also for the diffusion approximation risk model. In particular, we find that the optimal reinsurance strategies under the expected value premium principle are very different from those under the variance premium principle in the diffusion risk model. The former depends not only on the safety loading, time and interest rate, but also on the claim size distributions and the counting processes, while the latter depends only on the safety loading, time and interest rate. Finally, numerical examples are presented to show the impact of model parameters on the optimal strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is however possible to improve investor log utility by adopting a discrete-time periodic rebalancing strategy. Under the assumptions of geometric Brownian motion for assets and approximate log-normality for a sum of log-normal random variables, we find that the optimum rebalance frequency is a piecewise continuous function of investment horizon. One can construct this rebalance strategy function, called the optimal rebalance frequency function, up to a specified investment horizon given a limited trajectory of the expected log of portfolio growth when the initial portfolio is never rebalanced. We develop the analytical framework to compute the optimal rebalance strategy in linear time, a significant improvement from the previously proposed search-based quadratic time algorithm.","[Das, Sujit R.; Goyal, Mukul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Comp Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Das, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Comp Sci, 2200 East Kenwood Blvd, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",sujitdas@uwm.edu,,,,,,,11,3,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Density ratio ordering is satisfied when the two distributions admit a nonincreasing density ratio. Equivalently, density ratio ordering is satisfied when the ordinal dominance curve associated with the two distributions is concave. To test this property, we consider statistics based on the L-p-distance between an empirical ordinal dominance curve and its least concave majorant. We derive the limit distribution of these statistics when density ratio ordering is satisfied. Further, we establish that, when 1 <= p <= 2, the limit distribution is stochastically largest when the two distributions are equal. When 2 < p <= infinity, this is not the case, and in fact the limit distribution diverges to infinity along a suitably chosen sequence of concave ordinal dominance curves. Our results serve to clarify, extend, and amend assertions appearing previously in the literature for the cases p = 1 and p = infinity.

Play terminates when the searcher is at the node chosen by the hider and searches there. The searcher incurs costs in moving from one node to another and also when a node is searched. The searcher wants to minimize the costs of finding the hider and the hider wants to maximize them. The paper has two main strands.

In this work, the prices of securities, the occurrences of insured events and (possibly a network of) investment flows are used to infer their drifts and intensities by a stochastic filtering technique. We utilize the inferred information to provide the optimal hedging strategy based on the mean-variance (or quadratic) risk criterion.

The new approach avoids the stringent assumptions on the distribution of outcomes made by the classical first-order approach and instead only requires the agent's expected utility to be a rational function of the action. This assumption allows for a reformulation of the agent's utility maximization problem as an equivalent system of equations and inequalities. This reformulation in turn transforms the principal's utility maximization problem into a nonlinear program. Under the additional assumptions that the principal's expected utility is a polynomial and the agent's expected utility is rational in the wage, the final nonlinear program can be solved to global optimality. The paper also shows how to first approximate expected utility functions that are not rational by polynomials, so that the polynomial optimization approach can be applied to compute an approximate solution to nonpolynomial problems. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the polynomial optimization approach extends to principal-agent models with multidimensional action sets.","[Renner, Philipp] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schmedders, Karl] Univ Zurich, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmedders, Karl] Swiss Finance Inst, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland",Stanford University; University of Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Renner, P (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, 434 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",phrenner@gmail.com; karl.schmedders@business.uzh.ch,,"Renner, Philipp/0000-0003-1102-1029",SNSF [148769]; Swiss Finance Institute,SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Finance Institute,"We thank the co-editor and three anonymous referees for insightful reports.

We apply the methodology to a translog cost and share equation system and make a distinction between local, regional, pointwise, and global regularity. We find that the imposition of curvature at a single point does not always assure regularity. We also find that the imposition of global concavity (at all possible, positive input prices), irrespective of the method used, exaggerates the elasticity estimates and rules out the possibility of a complementarity relationship among the inputs. Finally, we find that constrained optimization and the Bayesian methodology with regional (over a neighborhood of data points in the sample) or pointwise (at every data point in the sample) concavity imposed can guarantee inference consistent with neoclassical microeconomic theory, without compromising much of the flexibility of the functional form.","[Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Feng, Guohua] Univ N Texas, Dept Econ, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of Calgary; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",Serletis@ucalgary.ca,"Feng, Guohua/K-7065-2012",,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC); Australian Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Serletis gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC).

However, until now, little has been known about how people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) value aspects of their medical treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate patients' preferences regarding different antiplatelet medication options following an ACS. Method After identification of patient-relevant treatment attributes (a literature review and qualitative interviews), a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) including five patient-relevant attributes was conducted. The DCE used a forced-choice approach in which no opt out was present, as no treatment is not an option after ACS. The attribute and level combinations were created using a fractional-factorial NGene design with priors. Data analysis was performed using a random-effects logit model. An additional generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM) analysis was performed to evaluate subgroup differences. Results ACS patients (N = 683) participated in computer-assisted personal interviews. Preference analysis showed a clear dominance of the attribute mortality risk (coefficient: 0.803). Ranked second was side effect: dyspnea (coefficient: 0.550) followed by risk of a new myocardial infarction (coefficient: 0.464) and side effect: bleeding (coefficient: 0.400). Frequency of intake was less important (coefficient: 0.025). Within the 3-class GLLAMM, the variables marital status (p = 0.008), highest level of education (p = 0.003), and body-mass index (according to World Health Organization cluster; p = 0.014) showed a significant impact on the estimated class probabilities. Conclusion Our study found mortality risk to be of the highest value for patients. Patient-centered care and decision making requires consideration of patient preferences; moreover, the information on preferences can be used to develop effective therapies after an ACS. The data generated will enable healthcare decision makers and stakeholders to understand patient preferences to promote patients' benefit.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Bethge, Susanne] Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Gesundheitsokon & Med Management, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel C.] Gesell Empir Beratung GmbH GEB, Freiburg, Germany",,"Bethge, S (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Gesundheitsokon & Med Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de; bethge@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211","AstraZeneca GmbH, Germany","AstraZeneca GmbH, Germany(AstraZeneca)","This study was funded by AstraZeneca GmbH, Germany.

In particular, each firm wants to determine the optimal price that maximizes its expected discounted lifetime profit. The oligopoly problem can be modeled as nonzero-sum games which can be formulated as systems of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose fully implicit, positive coefficient finite difference schemes that converge to the viscosity solution for the HJB PDE from dynamic Bertrand monopoly and the two-dimensional HJB system from dynamic Bertrand duopoly. Furthermore, we develop fast multigrid methods for solving these systems of discrete nonlinear HJB PDEs. The new multigrid methods are general and can be applied to other systems of HJB and HJB-Isaacs PDEs arising from American options under regime switching and American options with unequal lending/borrowing rates and stock borrowing fees under regime switching, respectively. We provide a theoretical analysis for the smoother, restriction and interpolation operators of the multigrid methods. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by numerical examples from the dynamic Bertrand problem and pricing American options under regime switching.","[Amarala, Swathi; Wan, Justin W.

In this study we reviewed recently published studies on seasonal influenza and early breast cancer in order to gain insight into the reporting of model validation efforts in the overall health economic literature. Methods A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Embase to retrieve health economic modelling studies published between 2008 and 2014. Reporting on model validation was evaluated by checking for the word validation, and by using AdViSHE (Assessment of the Validation Status of Health Economic decision models), a tool containing a structured list of relevant items for validation. Additionally, we contacted corresponding authors to ask whether more validation efforts were performed other than those reported in the manuscripts. Results A total of 53 studies on seasonal influenza and 41 studies on early breast cancer were included in our review. The word validation was used in 16 studies (30 %) on seasonal influenza and 23 studies (56 %) on early breast cancer; however, in a minority of studies, this referred to a model validation technique. Fifty-seven percent of seasonal influenza studies and 71 % of early breast cancer studies reported one or more validation techniques. Cross-validation of study outcomes was found most often. A limited number of studies reported on model validation efforts, although good examples were identified. Author comments indicated that more validation techniques were performed than those reported in the manuscripts. Conclusions Although validation is deemed important by many researchers, this is not reflected in the reporting habits of health economic modelling studies. Systematic reporting of validation efforts would be desirable to further enhance decision makers' confidence in health economic models and their outcomes.","[de Boer, Pieter T.; Vemer, Pepijn] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTEE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Frederix, Geert W.

Ex post, the distribution of wealth across agents affects aggregate demand and output. Ex ante, however, these effects are not internalized in private financial decisions. We provide a simple formula for the required financial interventions that depends on a small number of measurable sufficient statistics. We also characterize optimal monetary policy.

INTRODUCING THE LIVING STANDARDS REPLACEMENT RATE (LSRR),ASTIN BULLETIN,,,English,Article,,,,,,Retirement income adequacy; 70% earnings replacement rate; micro-simulation; standard of living; Living Standards Replacement Rate; LSRR; retirement planning; employer pension plan design; public pension plan design,LIFE-CYCLE; CONSUMPTION; EXPENDITURE; AMERICANS,"Will 70% of a worker's final annual employment earnings sustain living standards after retirement? Despite increasing skepticism, the most dominant measure of retirement income adequacy by financial planners, pensions plan advisors, academics and public policy makers is the final employment earnings replacement rate, where 70% is considered the right target to ensure living standards remain at approximately the same level after retirement. Using Statistics Canada's LifePaths dynamic population micro-simulation model, this paper asks whether those individuals from the 1951-1958 Canadian birth cohort who attain roughly a 70% final employment earnings replacement rate (as conventionally measured) at retirement do, in fact, achieve approximate continuity in their living standards. We find that the conventional final earnings replacement rate measure has little predictive value for living standards continuity between working-life and retirement. The primary reason is that employment earnings in a single year is not a reliable representation of a worker's standard of living-it relies on an inadequate pre-retirement measurement period, does not incorporate important components of consumption sources (such as home equity), and ignores household size (particularly children). As a result, we find that the correlation between the conventional earnings replacement rate and actual living standards continuity is relatively low (0.11). The paper therefore suggests an alternative metric for assessing how well a worker's living standard is maintained after retirement - i.e., the Living Standards Replacement Rate, or the LSRR. The LSRR provides a more accurate, understandable and consistent measure of retirement income adequacy.","[Macdonald, Bonnie-Jeanne] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Math & Computat Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Osberg, Lars] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Moore, Kevin D.] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Prince Edward Island; Dalhousie University; Statistics Canada,"Macdonald, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Math & Computat Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada.",Bonniejeannemacdonald@hotmail.com; lars.Osberg@Dal.Ca; kevin.Moore@statcan.gc.ca,,"Osberg, Lars/0000-0001-9643-9269","Rotman International Center for Pension Management (ICPM) at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto","Rotman International Center for Pension Management (ICPM) at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto","We would like to thank Malcolm Hamilton, James Davis, Deborah Ng, Fred Vettese, Keith Ambachtsheer, Rob Brown, Richard J.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield were the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) who produced a critical review of the company's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the submitted decision analytic model to produce a revised estimate of cost-effectiveness and examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The clinical effectiveness data were taken from two randomised controlled trials that reported a significant advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) for T-DM1 over lapatinib in combination with capecitabine (EMILIA trial), and over the treatment of physician's choice (TH3RESA trial). A network meta-analysis suggested T-DM1 was the best treatment in terms of both overall survival and PFS compared with lapatinib in combination with capecitabine; trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine; and capecitabine monotherapy. Adverse event (AE) data were taken from a pooled analysis of additional trials of T-DM1 as a single agent. The most common grade 3 or greater AEs for T-DM1 were thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity. Following the clarification process, the manufacturer reported a deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for T-DM1 compared with lapatinib in combination with capecitabine of 167,236 pound, the latter of which was estimated to have an ICER of 49,798 pound compared with capecitabine monotherapy. The ERG produced similar values of 166,429 pound and 50,620 pound respectively. All other comparators were dominated. During the appraisal, the manufacturer offered an analysis of a patient access scheme (PAS), which suggested that T-DM1 had a 0 % probability of being cost-effective at an ICER of 30,000 pound per QALY gained. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that while the clinical effectiveness of T-DM1 had been proven, it was not likely to represent a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources and therefore its use could not be recommended.","[Squires, Hazel; Stevenson, Matt; Simpson, Emma; Harvey, Rebecca; Stevens, John] Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Squires, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",h.squires@sheffield.ac.uk,"Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022",", Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [12/65/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 12/65/01 STA) (see the HTA programme website for further project information-http://www.hta.ac.uk).

In this paper we discuss how the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and Wales, the Common Drug Review in Canada and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) in Australia have approached the appraisal of these drugs. We argue that with the exception of the PBAC, assessments of the new drugs have not adequately accounted for their large financial burden. Given the potential health system impact of reimbursing these drugs, the use of lower cost-effectiveness thresholds should be considered. None of the decision-making processes included a comparison of the full range of treatment pathways. In particular, comparisons of using the new drugs as first- versus second-line drugs were omitted from all appraisals, as were comparisons with delayed treatment strategies whereby treatment is withheld until more severe disease stages. Omission of comparators leads to inaccurate estimates of cost effectiveness and potentially sub-optimal decision making. Lessons learned from these appraisals should be considered in future appraisals, particularly the upcoming assessments of the 'blockbuster' PCSK9 inhibitors for hypercholesterolaemia.","[Woods, Beth; Faria, Rita; Griffin, Susan] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Faria, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Beth.woods@york.ac.uk; rita.nevesdefaria@york.ac.uk,"Griffin, Susan/AAE-8970-2020; Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019","Griffin, Susan/0000-0003-2188-8400; Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566; Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); Department of Health via the Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health Care Interventions (EEPRU),National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Department of Health via the Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health Care Interventions (EEPRU),"No specific funding was provided for this work.

A Retrospective Study,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COST-EFFECTIVENESS; REIMBURSEMENT DECISIONS; CHOICE EXPERIMENT; AUSTRALIA; DRUGS; NICE,"Deciding on public funding for pharmaceuticals on the basis of value for money is now widespread. We suggest that evidence-based assessment of value has restricted the availability of medicines in Australia in a way that reflects the relative bargaining power of government and the pharmaceutical industry. We propose a simple informal game-theoretic model of bargaining between the funding agency and industry and test its predictions using a logistic multiple regression model of past funding decisions made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia. The model estimates the probability of a drug being recommended for subsidy as a function of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), as well as other drug and market characteristics. Data are major submissions or resubmissions from 1993 to 2009 where there was a claim of superiority and evidence of a difference in quality of life. Independent variables measure the incremental cost per QALY, the cost to the public budget, the strength and quality of the clinical and economic evidence, need as measured by severity of illness and the availability of alternative treatments, whether or not a resubmission, and newspaper reports as a measure of public pressure. We report the odds ratio for each variable and calculate the ratio of the marginal effect of each variable to the marginal effect of the cost per QALY as a measure of the revealed willingness to pay for each of the variables that influence the decision. The results are consistent with a bargaining model where a 10,000 Australian dollar ($A) fall in value (increase in cost per QALY) reduces the average probability of public funding from 37 to 33 % (95 % CI 34-32). If the condition is life threatening or the drug has no active comparator, then the odds of a positive recommendation are 3.18 (95 % CI 1.00-10.11) and 2.14 (95 % CI 0.95-4.83) greater, equivalent to a $A33,000 and a $A21,000 increase in value (fall in cost per QALY). If both conditions are met, the odds are increased by 4.41 (95 % CI 1.28-15.24) times, equivalent to an increase in value of $A46,000. Funding is more likely as time elapses and price falls, but we did not find clear evidence that public or corporate pressure influences decisions. Evidence from Australia suggests that the determinants of public funding and pricing decisions for medicines reflect the relative bargaining power of government and drug companies. Value for money depends on the quality of evidence, timing, patient need, perceived benefit and opportunity cost; these factors reflect the potential gains from striking a bargain and the risk of loss from not doing so.","[Harris, Anthony; Li, Jing Jing; Yong, Karen] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Harris, A (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",anthony.harris@buseco.monash.edu.au,"harris, anthony h/A-2551-2009","Harris, Anthony/0000-0003-1641-3320",Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),AH received funding from the Australian Research Council.,,23,6,7,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2016,34,4,,,,,393,402,,10.1007/s40273-015-0354-z,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DH6EJ,26610347.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372883500007,0

We applied a grouping algorithm designed for large-scale data sets and multiple prognostic factors to investigate whether it improves cost prediction among older Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with prostate cancer. We analysed the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, which included data from 2000 through 2009 for men diagnosed with incident prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007. We split the survival data into two data sets (D-0 and D-1) of equal size. We trained the classifier of the Grouping Algorithm for Cancer Data (GACD) on D-0 and tested it on D-1. The prognostic factors included cancer stage, age, race and performance status proxies. We calculated the average difference between observed D-1 costs and predicted D-1 costs at 5 years post-diagnosis with and without the GACD. The sample included 110,843 men with prostate cancer. The median age of the sample was 74 years, and 10 % were African American. The average difference (mean absolute error [MAE]) per person between the real and predicted total 5-year cost was US$41,525 (MAE US$41,790; 95 % confidence interval [CI] US$41,421-42,158) with the GACD and US$43,113 (MAE US$43,639; 95 % CI US$43,062-44,217) without the GACD. The 5-year cost prediction without grouping resulted in a sample overestimate of US$79,544,508. The grouping algorithm developed for complex, large-scale data improves the prediction of 5-year costs. The prediction accuracy could be improved by utilization of a richer set of prognostic factors and refinement of categorical specifications.","[Onukwugha, Eberechukwu; Jayasekera, Jinani] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Qi, Ran; Zhou, Shujia] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Catonsville, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Onukwugha, E (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",eonukwug@rx.umaryland.edu,"Jayasekera, Jinani/IUM-2611-2023","Jayasekera, Jinani/0000-0001-9212-7225","California Department of Public Health as part of the state-wide cancer reporting programme [103885]; National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program [N01-PC-35136, N01-PC-35139, N02-PC-15105]; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries [U55/CCR921930-02]","California Department of Public Health as part of the state-wide cancer reporting programme; National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA)","The collection of the California cancer incidence data used in this study was supported by the California Department of Public Health as part of the state-wide cancer reporting programme mandated by California Health and Safety Code Section 103885; the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, under contract N01-PC-35136 awarded to the Northern California Cancer Center, contract N01-PC-35139 awarded to the University of Southern California and contract N02-PC-15105 awarded to the Public Health Institute; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries, under agreement #U55/CCR921930-02 awarded to the Public Health Institute.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and the NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG reviewed the evidence for clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, as submitted by the manufacturer to the NICE. The ERG searched for relevant additional evidence and validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. Clinical effectiveness was obtained from a three-arm, European, randomized, phase III trial among red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with low-/intermediate-1-risk del5q31 MDS. The primary endpoint was RBC independence for a parts per thousand yen26 weeks, and was reached by a higher proportion of patients in the lenalidomide 10 and 5 mg groups compared with placebo (56.1 and 42.6 vs 5.9 %, respectively; both p < 0.001). The option of dose adjustments after 16 weeks due to dose-limiting toxicities or lack of response made long-term effectiveness estimates unreliable, e.g. overall survival (OS). The de novo model of the manufacturer included a Markov state-transition cost-utility model implemented in Microsoft Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the manufacturer was A 56,965 pound. The ERG assessment indicated that the modeling structure represented the course of the disease; however, a few errors were identified and some of the input parameters were challenged. In response to the appraisal documentation, the company revised the economic model, which increased the ICER to A 68,125 pound per quality-adjusted life-year. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) did not recommend lenalidomide as a cost-effective treatment. Subsequently, the manufacturer submitted a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) that provided lenalidomide free of charge for patients who remained on treatment after 26 cycles. This PAS improved the ICER to A 25,300 pound, although the AC considered the proportion of patients who received treatment beyond 26 cycles, and hence the ICER, to be uncertain. Nevertheless, the AC accepted a commitment from the manufacturer to publish, once available, data on the proportion of patients eligible for the PAS, and believed this provided reassurance that lenalidomide was a cost-effective treatment for low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS patients.","[Blommestein, Hedwig M.; Severens, Johan L.; Al, Maiwenn J.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Armstrong, Nigel; Ryder, Steve; Deshpande, Sohan; Worthy, Gill; Noake, Caro; Riemsma, Rob; Kleijnen, Jos] Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, York YO19 6FD, N Yorkshire, England; [Kleijnen, Jos] Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Kleijnen Systematic Reviews; Maastricht University,"Blommestein, HM (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Room J8-23,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",blommestein@bmg.eur.nl,"Riemsma, Rob/E-2319-2016","Riemsma, Rob/0000-0001-8892-0861; Blommestein, Hedwig/0000-0002-5846-0531",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program [11/07/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program (project number 11/07/01) [see the HTA program website for further information-http://www.hta.ac.uk].

The optimal units of the mortality-linked security which maximize hedge effectiveness for a life insurer (an annuity provider) can be derived as closed-form formulas under the risk hedge schemes. Numerical illustrations show that the risk hedge schemes can significantly hedge the downside risk of loss due to mortality (longevity) risk for the life insurer (annuity provider) under some stochastic mortality models. Besides, finding an optimal weight of a portfolio of life and annuity business, the financial intermediary can reduce the sensitivity to mortality rates but the model risk; a security loading may be imposed on the hedge premium for a higher probability of gain to compensate the financial intermediary for the inevitable model risk.

Depending on the defectiveness of this random variable, respectively referred to as 'unforeseeable' (defective) versus 'historical' (non-defective) risks, one obtains different relations between the ruin probability with constant versus adjusted premium rate.

Recurrence is common in ovarian cancer patients and most women require prolonged second-line and higher-line chemotherapy. With newer targeted therapies, modest improvements in survival and quality of life may be attained at substantial cost, but the relative economic efficiency of these newer agents remains unknown. We undertook this systematic review to comprehensively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various chemotherapeutic and targeted therapy alternatives for ovarian cancer. We searched Medline, PubMed, and Embase databases to identify economic evaluations published over the last 18 years (1996-2014). From the 2513 unique papers retrieved, 74 full texts were selected for full-text review based on a priori eligibility criteria. Two authors independently reviewed these articles to determine eligibility for final review. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES). A total of 28 studies were included for reporting. Administration of intravenous cisplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy for first-line treatment was the most cost-effective alternative (2014 US dollars [USD] equivalent incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] similar to US$17,000-US$27,000 per life year gained [LYG]), while the use of bevacizumab did not demonstrate similar value for money (2014 USD equivalent ICER was greater than US$200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). For second-line treatment, the use of platinum-paclitaxel combination or platinum monotherapy was cost-effective compared with platinum monotherapy or best supportive care, respectively, in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. For patients with partial platinum sensitivity, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) plus trabectedin may be cost-effective (2014 USD equivalent ICER was similar to US$57,000-US$62,000 per QALY) compared with PLD alone. For recurrent platinum-resistant cases, there was limited evidence to conclude the most valuable treatment; though one study showed that best supportive care was most cost-effective, while second-line monotherapy with doxorubicin (2014 USD equivalent ICER was similar to US$90,000 per LYG) may also be cost-effective compared with best supportive care. Despite varying methodological approaches and multiple sources for cost and effectiveness inputs, this systematic review demonstrated that standard platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy for first-line treatment was most cost-effective. There was unanimous agreement that bevacizumab was not a cost-effective front-line therapy compared with platinum-taxane combination for the overall ovarian cancer population, though its use in the high-use population may yield better value. For second-line treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy remained cost-effective among patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease, while there was limited evidence to conclude the most valuable treatment alternative among patients with recurrent platinum-resistant disease. Future research incorporating real-world data is essential to corroborate findings from trial-based economic evaluations. In addition, for improving consistency in reporting and quality of studies, incorporating QALYs in this population is important, especially since chemotherapy is administered for lengthy periods of time.","[Poonawalla, Insiya B.; Du, Xianglin L.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Parikh, Rohan C.; Du, Xianglin L.; Lairson, David R.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Management Policy & Community Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [VonVille, Helena M.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Lib, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health,"Lairson, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Management Policy & Community Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",David.R.Lairson@uth.tmc.edu,"VonVille, Helena/JRX-3824-2023; VonVille, Helena/HTP-0682-2023","VonVille, Helena/0000-0001-5193-2391; Parikh, Rohan/0000-0003-4516-9996",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R01-HS018956],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),This study was supported in part by a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (R01-HS018956).

The test statistics are based on L-1-type functionals of uniformly consistent nonparametric kernel estimators of conditional expectations that characterize the null hypotheses. We show that our tests using the standard normal critical values have asymptotically correct size. We also show that the proposed nonparametric tests are consistent against general fixed alternatives and have non-negligible powers against some n(-1/2) local alternatives to the null hypothesis with inequality constraints and n(-1/2)h(-d/4) local alternatives to the null hypothesis with equality constraints, where h is a bandwidth, n is the sample size and d is the dimension of continuous covariates.

Hereby, our motivation is the obtention of an optimal selling strategy minimizing the relative distance between the liquidation value of the portfolio and its highest possible value before it reaches zero. This paper unifies optimal selling rules observed for the quadratic absolute distance criteria in this stationary framework with bang-bang type ones observed for monetary invariant criteria but in finite horizon. More precisely, we provide a verification result for the general stopping problem of interest and derive the exact solution for two classical criteria f of the literature. For the power utility criterion f : y -> -y(lambda) with lambda > 0, instantaneous selling is always optimal, which is consistent with previous observations for the Black-Scholes model in finite observation. On the contrary, for a relative quadratic error criterion, f : y -> (1 - y)(2), selling is optimal as soon as the process X crosses a specified function phi of its running maximum X*. These results reinforce the idea that optimal stopping problems of similar type lead easily to selling rules of very different nature. Nevertheless, our numerical experiments suggest that the practical optimal selling rule for the relative quadratic error criterion is in fact very close to immediate selling.","[Elie, Romuald] Univ Paris 09, F-75116 Paris, France; [Elie, Romuald] CREST, Kyoto, Japan; [Espinosa, Gilles-Edouard] ETH, Dept Math, Zurich, Switzerland",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Elie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CNRS, CEREMADE, UMR 7534, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75116 Paris, France.",elie@ceremade.dauphine.fr,,,European Research Council [228053-FiRM]; Chair Finance and sustainable development,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Chair Finance and sustainable development,The authors wish to thank two anonymous referees as well as Mete Soner and Nizar Touzi for fruitful discussions.

More specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the distribution of the sum S = X-1 + X-2, the TVaR of S and the contributions of each risk under the TVaR-based allocation rule. The first family considered is a subset of the class of bivariate combinations of exponentials, more precisely, bivariate combinations of exponentials with exponential marginals. We show that several well-known bivariate exponential distributions are special cases of this family. The second family we investigate is a subset of the class of bivariate mixed Erlang distributions, namely bivariate mixed Erlang distributions with exponential marginals. For this second class of distributions, we propose a method based on the compound geometric representation of the exponential distribution to construct bivariate mixed Erlang distributions with exponential marginals. Notably, we show that this method not only leads to Moran-Downton's bivariate exponential distribution, but also to a generalization of this bivariate distribution. Moreover, we also propose a method to construct bivariate mixed Erlang distributions with exponential marginals from any absolutely continuous bivariate distributions with exponential marginals. Inspired from Lee and Lin (2012), we show that the resulting bivariate distribution approximates the initial bivariate distribution and we highlight the advantages of such an approximation.

We derive the asymptotic distribution of the profiled least squares (LS) estimator under the diminishing threshold effect assumption that the size of the threshold effect converges to zero. Depending on how rapidly this sequence converges, the model may be identified or only weakly identified and asymptotic theorems are developed for both cases. As the convergence rate is unknown in practice, a model-selection procedure is applied to determine the model identification strength and to construct robust confidence intervals, which have the correct asymptotic size irrespective of the magnitude of the threshold effect. The model is then generalized to incorporate endogeneity and serial correlation in error terms, under which, we design a Cochrane-Orcutt feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimator which enjoys efficiency gains and robustness against different error specifications, including both I (0) and I (1) errors. Based on this FGLS estimator, we further develop a sup-Wald statistic to test for the existence of the threshold effect.

Rising chronic disease prevalence is responsible for much of this growth. The first goal of this study is to estimate the percentage of Medicare spending growth that is attributable to increasing disease prevalence rates of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and heart disease. Second, we estimate how much of this prevalence-related spending growth is attributable to rising obesity rates. We employ spending decomposition equations to estimate the percentage of Medicare spending growth that is attributable to rising chronic disease prevalence, and we use two-part models to estimate the portion of prevalence-related spending that is potentially due to obesity. For our four conditions of interest, growing disease prevalence accounted for between 13.6 % (in heart disease) and 58.9 % (in hyperlipidaemia) of Medicare expenditure growth. Up to 17.0 % (in diabetes) of the expenditure growth due to prevalence increases may be attributable to obesity and therefore may be modifiable. Rising obesity rates contribute to chronic disease prevalence, which, in turn, can lead to higher Medicare expenditures. To slow the growth in spending, policy makers should consider targeting obesity, using approaches such as improving pharmacotherapy coverage and providing intensive care coordination services to Medicare enrollees.","[Allen, Lindsay; Thorpe, Ken; Joski, Peter] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Allen, L (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, 1518 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",lindsay.allen@emory.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)),"The authors thank the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for its generous support of this work, and the anonymous peer reviewers for their helpful comments.

Existing tests based on quadratic forms such as the Wald statistic often suffer from low powers due to the accumulation of errors in estimating high-dimensional parameters. More powerful tests for sparse alternatives such as thresholding and extreme value tests, on the other hand, require either stringent conditions or bootstrap to derive the null distribution and often suffer from size distortions due to the slow convergence. Based on a screening technique, we introduce a power enhancement component, which is zero under the null hypothesis with high probability, but diverges quickly under sparse alternatives. The proposed test statistic combines the power enhancement component with an asymptotically pivotal statistic, and strengthens the power under sparse alternatives. The null distribution does not require stringent regularity conditions, and is completely determined by that of the pivotal statistic. The proposed methods are then applied to testing the factor pricing models and validating the cross-sectional independence in panel data models.","[Fan, Jianqing; Yao, Jiawei] Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fan, Jianqing] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fan, Jianqing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liao, Yuan] Univ Maryland, Dept Math, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Princeton University; Capital University of Economics & Business; Sun Yat Sen University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Fan, JQ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jqfan@princeton.edu; yuanliao@umd.edu; jiaweiy@princeton.edu,"Fan, Jianqing/B-2115-2008; Yao, JW/HJA-7097-2022",,"National Science Foundation [DMS-1206464, DMS-1406266]; National Institute of Health [R01GM100474-01, R01-GM072611]; University of Maryland; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1206464] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Maryland; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank the co-editor and anonymous referees for many insightful comments and suggestions, which have greatly improved the paper.

In this paper we propose a method based on Bayesian learning to determine model-specific posterior distributions of the sample sizes. In particular, the sample size is included as an extra parameter in the parameter space of the mortality model, and its posterior distribution is obtained based on historical performance for different forecast horizons up to 20 years. Age- and gender-specific posterior distributions of sample sizes are computed. Our method is applicable to a large class of linear mortality models. As illustration, we focus on the first generation of the Lee-Carter model and the Cairns-Blake-Dowd model. Our method is applied to US and Dutch data. For both countries we find highly concentrated posterior distributions of the sample size that are gender- and age-specific. In the out-of-sample forecast analysis, the Bayesian model outperforms the original mortality models with fixed sample sizes in the majority of cases. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As the quality of the tracking portfolio (TP) depends highly on the stock selection procedure, we propose picking the stocks using a model selection technique based on optimizing the cointegration level of the TP and the benchmark index instead of selecting, as in previous papers the assets by ad hoc decisions. To illustrate an empirical application of these techniques we use daily closing prices in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index over two different periods; one period which goes from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2001 previously used by other authors, and the bear and a turmoil period, which goes from January 2007 to May 2012, inside the current financial crisis. Using only five assets we are able to successfully track the DJIA index and our results improve the IT technique based on cointegration that chooses stocks with maximum capitalization level. We also have compared our results with a more traditional procedure based on correlation and again our results reveal superiority. The empirical illustration not only has been focused on the TP itself, but has also been extended to tracking the index with an added profitability of 5, 10, 15 or 20% and to long-short strategies, producing profitable results.","[Acosta-Gonzalez, Eduardo; Armas-Herrera, Reinaldo; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Fernando] Univ De Las Palmas De Gran Canaria, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos Econ & Gest, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Fernández-Rodríguez, F (通讯作者)，Univ De Las Palmas De Gran Canaria, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos Econ & Gest, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",ffernandez@dmc.ulpgc.es,"Fernández-Rodríguez, Fernando/ABC-9584-2021","Fernandez-Rodriguez, Fernando/0000-0002-8808-9286; Armas Herrera, Reinaldo/0000-0002-3477-5838",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-21318],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the research project ECO2010-21318.,,37,9,9,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Recently, much attention has been drawn to the nonparametric models with nonstationary data. Wang and Phillips (2009a) studied the asymptotic property of a local constant estimator of a nonparametric regression model with a nonstationary I(1) regressor. Sun and Li (2011) show a surprising result that for a semiparamtric varying coefficient model with nonstationary I(1) regressors, the local linear estimator has a faster rate of convergence than the local constant estimator. In this article, we study the asymptotic behavior of the local linear estimator for the same nonparametric regression model as considered by Wang and Phillips (2009a). We focus on the derivation of the joint asymptotic result of both the unknown regression function and its derivative function. We also examine the performance of the local linear estimator with the bandwidth selected by the data driven least squares cross validation (LS-CV) method. Simulation results show that the local linear estimator, coupled with the LS-CV selected bandwidth, enjoys substantial efficiency gains over the local constant estimator.","[Liang, Zhongwen] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Lin, Zhongjian] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hsiao, Cheng] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Hsiao, Cheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hsiao, Cheng] Xiamen Univ, WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Emory University; University of Southern California; City University of Hong Kong; Xiamen University,"Hsiao, C (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",chsiao@usc.edu,,,National Science Foundation of China [71131008],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Cheng Hsiao wishes to thank the National Science Foundation of China, project #: 71131008, for research support.",,22,4,4,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

However, little is known about how interbank networks are formed and about their sensitivity to changes in key bank parameters (for example, induced by common exogenous shocks or by regulatory initiatives). This paper aims to shed light on these issues by modelling endogenously the formation of interbank networks, which in turn allows for checking the sensitivity of interbank network structures and hence, their underlying contagion risk to changes in market-driven parameters as well as to changes in regulatory measures such as large exposures limits. The sequential network formation mechanism presented in the paper is based on a portfolio optimization model, whereby banks allocate their interbank exposures while balancing the return and risk of counterparty default risk and the placements are accepted taking into account funding diversification benefits. The model offers some interesting insights into how key parameters may affect interbank network structures and can be a valuable tool for analysing the impact of various regulatory policy measures relating to banks' incentives to operate in the interbank market.","[Halaj, Grzegorz; Kok, Christoffer] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Halaj, G (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",grzegorz.halaj@ecb.int,,,,,,,30,36,40,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Furthermore, it attains the tightest known bounds on the regret, or the log-wealth difference relative to the best constant rebalanced portfolio. We prove that the regret of the algorithm is bounded by O(logQ), where Q is the quadratic variation of the stock prices. This is the first improvement upon Cover's (1991) seminal work that attains a regret bound of O(logT), where T is the number of trading iterations. Average-case guarantee: in the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model of stock prices, our algorithm attains tighter regret bounds, which are provably impossible in the worst-case. Hence, when the GBM model is a good approximation of the behavior of market, the new algorithm has an advantage over previous ones, albeit retaining worst-case guarantees. We derive this algorithm as a special case of a novel and more general method for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions.","[Hazan, Elad] Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Kale, Satyen] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; International Business Machines (IBM),"Hazan, E (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",ehazan@ie.technion.ac.il,,"Hazan, Elad/0000-0002-1566-3216",ISF [810/11],ISF(Israel Science Foundation),Elad Hazan is supported by ISF grant 810/11.

Our main result is a utility representation of all preferences over monetary lotteries that satisfy negative certainty independence together with basic rationality postulates. Such preferences can be represented as if the agent were unsure of how to evaluate a given lottery p; instead, she has in mind a set of possible utility functions over outcomes and displays a cautious behavior: she computes the certainty equivalent of p with respect to each possible function in the set and picks the smallest one. The set of utilities is unique in a well defined sense. We show that our representation can also be derived from a cautious completion of an incomplete preference relation.","[Cerreia-Vioglio, Simone] Univ Bocconi, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy; [Cerreia-Vioglio, Simone] Univ Bocconi, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Dillenberger, David] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ortoleva, Pietro] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of Pennsylvania; Columbia University,"Cerreia-Vioglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy.",simone.cerreia@unibocconi.it; ddill@sas.upenn.edu; pietro.ortoleva@columbia.edu,,"CERREIA VIOGLIO, SIMONE/0000-0001-7383-9139","ERC (advanced Grant BRSCDP-TEA); NSF [SES-1156091]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1156090] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1414342] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","ERC (advanced Grant BRSCDP-TEA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Faruk Gul, Yoram Halevy, Fabio Maccheroni, Massimo Marinacci, Efe Ok, Wolfgang Pesendorfer, Gil Riella, and Todd Sarver for very useful comments and suggestions.

Sixteen cycling, Merino ewes were synchronized for 12 days with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) devices (300 mg P-4). Ewes were classified by estrous behavior as exhibited estrus (n= 12) or did not exhibit estrus (n= 4). Blood samples were collected at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after CIDR removal to measure glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and P-4 concentrations. Follicular size was examined by transrectal ultrasonography on the day of CIDR removal. Ewes exhibiting estrus had greater concentrations of glucose at 24 and 48 h after CIDR withdrawal than ewes that did not exhibit estrus. Ewes exhibiting estrus had decreased concentrations of P-4 at 24 and 48 h after CIDR withdrawal compared with ewes that did not exhibit estrus. At the time of CIDR withdrawal, the diameter of largest follicle was observed greater in ewes exhibiting estrus than that in ewes not exhibiting estrus. By 48 h after CIDR removal, 91.7% of ewes that displayed estrous behavior had exhibited estrus. In all ewes, a significant positive relationship was observed between feed intake and glucose concentration. Follicle diameter was positively correlated with glucose and P4 concentrations but was negatively correlated with time to onset of estrus in ewes exhibiting estrus. No relationship was detected between BUN and other parameters in all ewes. In conclusion, increased estrous activity in ewes synchronized to estrus may result from increased size of follicle, low P-4 levels, and sufficient production of glucose during the follicular development. Thus, these data highlight the importance of follicle diameter, glucose concentration, and time to onset of estrus in ewes exhibiting estrus under tropical conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

These tests control size under weak identification and have a number of optimality properties in a conditional problem. We show that the conditional likelihood ratio test of Moreira, 2003 is a conditional linear combination test in models with one endogenous regressor, and that the class of conditional linear combination tests is equivalent to a class of quasi-conditional likelihood ratio tests. We suggest using minimax regret conditional linear combination tests and propose a computationally tractable class of tests that plug in an estimator for a nuisance parameter. These plug-in tests perform well in simulation and have optimal power in many strongly identified models, thus allowing powerful identification-robust inference in a wide range of linear and nonlinear models without sacrificing efficiency if identification is strong.","[Andrews, Isaiah] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr,E52-526, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Andrews, I (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr,E52-526, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",iandrews@mit.edu,,,NSF [1122374],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author is grateful to Anna Mikusheva, Whitney Newey, and Jerry Hausman for their guidance and support, and to Don Andrews, Arun Chandrasekhar, Victor Chernozhukov, Denis Chetverikov, Kirill Evdokimov, Benjamin Feigenberg, Patricia Gomez-Gonzalez, Patrik Guggenberger, Bruce Hansen, Sally Hudson, Peter Hull, Conrad Miller, Scott Nelson, Jose Montiel Olea, Miikka Rokkanen, Adam Sacarny, Annalisa Scognamiglio, Brad Shapiro, Ashish Shenoy, Stefanie Stantcheva, the participants of the MIT Econometrics Lunch and the Chicago Econometrics working group, and seminar participants at Brown, Cambridge, Colegio Carlo Alberto, Columbia, Cornell, FGV, INSEAD, Northwestern, NYU, Penn State, Princeton, Wisconsin, Yale, and the 2014 Winter meetings of the Econometric Society for helpful comments.

The work is motivated by some observations on how Canadians de-accumulate financial wealth during retirement - which seem rather puzzling. While the Modigliani lifecycle model can justify a variety of (pre-tax) de-accumulation or draw down rates depending on risk preferences, the existence of asymmetric taxes implies that certain financial accounts should be depleted faster than others. Our analysis of data from the Survey of Financial Security indicates that Canadian retirees maintain approximately two-thirds of their financial wealth in tax-sheltered accounts and a third in taxable accounts regardless of age. The ratio of taxable to tax-sheltered wealth increases slightly or remains relatively constant depending on household income which is not what one would expect from the lifecycle model. Indeed, using our model we cannot locate a plausible tax function that justifies a constant account ratio regardless of age. For example under flat rates taxable accounts should be depleted well before tax-sheltered accounts are ever touched. The account ratio should go to zero quite rapidly in the absence of government mandated withdrawals. We also demonstrate that under progressive income taxes withdrawals are made from both accounts but at different rates depending on account size, pension income and longevity risk preferences. Again, the account ratio should eventually decline. We postulate that this sort of behavior is likely due to irrational considerations linked to mental accounting, etc. It remains to be seen whether this will persist over time and under a more careful analysis of Canadian cohorts or if retirees in other countries exhibit the same behavior.

The method is capable of characterizing complex dynamical systems, in this case financial market dynamics, in an equation-free manner by decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. By extracting key temporal coherent structures (portfolios) in its sampling window, it provides a regression to a best fit linear dynamical system, allowing for a predictive assessment of the market dynamics and informing an investment strategy. The data-driven analytics capitalizes on stock market patterns, either real or perceived, to inform buy/sell/hold investment decisions. Critical to the method is an associated learning algorithm that optimizes the sampling and prediction windows of the algorithm by discovering trading hot-spots. The underlying mathematical structure of the algorithms is rooted in methods from nonlinear dynamical systems and shows that the decomposition is an effective mathematical tool for data-driven discovery of market patterns.","[Mann, Jordan] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kutz, J.

The collective investment decision and the allocation rule together form a risk sharing scheme. Such a scheme defines a contingent claim for each participant. Given a proposed risk sharing scheme and an agreed-upon pricing functional, the values of these claims can be determined and can be compared to the values of the contributions made by the agents. A risk sharing scheme is said to be financially fair if, for each agent, the value of the agent's claim as defined by the scheme is equal to the value of the agent's contribution. The paper provides conditions under which there exists a unique risk sharing scheme that is both Pareto efficient (in the sense of expected utility) and financially fair. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is presented by which this scheme can be computed. The theory is illustrated by a simple example which shows that, in an incomplete financial rnarket, agents may benefit substantially from forming a collective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, it is reasonable to include the exchange rules in the argument of the risk measure and so consider risk measures of set-valued portfolios. This situation includes the classical Kabanov's transaction costs model, where the set-valued portfolio is given by the sum of a random vector and an exchange cone, but also a number of further cases of additional liquidity constraints. We suggest a definition of the risk measure based on calling a set-valued portfolio acceptable if it possesses a selection with all individually acceptable marginals. The obtained selection risk measure is coherent (or convex), law invariant, and has values being upper convex closed sets. We describe the dual representation of the selection risk measure and suggest efficient ways of approximating it from below and from above. In the case of Kabanov's exchange cone model, it is shown how the selection risk measure relates to the set-valued risk measures considered by Kulikov (2008, Theory Probab. Appl. 52, 614-635), Hamel and Heyde (2010, SIAM J. Financ. Math. 1, 66-95), and Hamel, Heyde, and Rudloff (2013, Math. Financ.

Price admissibility is necessary to preclude cash-and-carry arbitrage, a market imperfection that can happen even with a risk-neutral diffusion process and positive bond prices. We assure price admissibility by (i) defining the state variables to be scaled partial sums of weighted coefficients of the exponential terms in the bond pricing function, (ii) identifying a simplex within which these state variables remain price admissible, and (iii) choosing a general functional form for the diffusion that selectively diminishes near the simplex boundary. By assuring that prices, yields, and forward rates remain positive with tractable diffusions for the physical and risk-neutral measures, an obstacle is removed from the wider acceptance of interest rate methods that are linear in prices.","[Siegel, Andrew F.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Siegel, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Dept Stat, Dept Finance,Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",asiegel@u.washington.edu,,,Grant I.

The new ordering captures the effects of loss aversion and can be used as a semi parametric approach in the comparison of risks with reference points. It is analytically amenable and possesses a variety of intuitively appealing properties, including the abilities to identify both increase in risk and increase in downside risk, to resolve the Allais-type anomalies, to capture the violation of translational invariance and scaling invariance, and to accommodate the endowment effect for risk. The generalization to third-order dominance reveals that loss aversion can either reinforce or weaken prudence, depending on the location of the reference point.

The key element of the model is the feedback effect between the absolute value of jumps and the intensity of their arrival process. In this setting, we obtain a closed-form solution for the characteristic function for interest rates and their integral. We introduce a class of equivalent measures under which the features of the process are preserved. We infer the prices of bonds and their dynamics under a risk-neutral measure. The question of derivatives pricing is developed under a forward measure, and a numerical algorithm is proposed to evaluate caplets and floorlets. The model is fitted to EONIA rates from 2004 to 2014 using a peaks-over-threshold procedure. From observation of swap curves over the same period, we filter the evolution of risk premiums for Brownian and jump components. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of implied caplet volatility to parameters defining the level of self-excitation.","[Hainaut, Donatien] ESC Rennes Business Sch, Rennes, France; [Hainaut, Donatien] CREST, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,"Hainaut, D (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes Business Sch, Rennes, France.;Hainaut, D (通讯作者)，CREST, Rennes, France.",donatien.hainaut@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,27,21,21,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Our objective is extending the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by defining a standard formula for quantifying the premium for certain idiosyncratic risks as a function of a new set of firm-specific quantitative information. We define two econometric models, for listed and non-listed firms respectively, which consider five idiosyncratic risk factors: firm size, value factor, operating risks, financial structure and stock market price volatility. The models were tested on a sample of European non-financial companies. The empirical results show that while the CAPM systematically underestimates the cost of equity, the proposed models correctly estimate its expected value; furthermore, they show a slight improvement also in terms of estimates' volatility. Due to their efficacy and ease of use, the proposed models represent a valid practical tool for investors, analysts and professional evaluators. This work contributes to the existing literature by proposing a typologically innovative extension of the CAPM set of explanatory variables, defining and testing new models for the estimation of the unsystematic risks' spread of the cost of equity based on an original set of firm-specific accounting and market information.","[Laghi, Enrico] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Law & Econ Prod Act, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Di Marcantonio, Michele] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, Viale Regina Elena 295, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Di Marcantonio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, Viale Regina Elena 295, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",michele.dimarcantonio@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,51,6,6,0,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Prior work considers this question mainly for 2 x 2 games and potential games; here we characterize convergence times for general weakly acyclic games, including coordination games, dominance solvable games, games with strategic complementarities, potential games, and many others with applications in economics, biology, and distributed control. If players' better replies are governed by idiosyncratic shocks, the convergence time can grow exponentially in the population size; moreover, this is true even in games with very simple payoff structures. However, if their responses are sufficiently correlated due to aggregate shocks, the convergence time is greatly accelerated; in fact, it is bounded for all sufficiently large populations. We provide explicit bounds on the speed of convergence as a function of key structural parameters including the number of strategies, the length of the better reply paths, the extent to which players can influence the payoffs of others, and the desired degree of approximation to Nash equilibrium.","[Arieli, Itai] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Young, H.

We show that insurers should incorporate the specificity of the periodic payment of variable annuities fees to best hedge embedded guarantees and should focus on hedging the net liability. We develop a new hedging strategy based on semi-static hedging techniques, which takes into account the periodically collected fees, and confirm that it is more effective than delta-hedging with same rebalancing dates, as well as traditional semi-static hedging strategies that do not consider the specificity of the payments of fees in their optimization. It is also verified that short-selling or using put options as hedging instruments allows more effective hedging. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Systematic risk and diversification are shown to vary across layers of component losses according to local dependence and volatility structures. Systematic risk is high and diversification is weak overall if high risk layers are heavily dependent on the aggregate loss. This result explains weak diversification observed in financial markets despite weak to moderate correlations overall.

Our starting point is the method proposed by Smith and Wilson, which is used by the European insurance supervisor EIOPA. We use the characterization of the Smith Wilson class of interpolating functions as the solution to a functional optimization problem to extend their approach in such a way that forward rates will converge to a value which is an outcome of the optimization process. Precise conditions are stated which guarantee that the optimization problems involved are well-posed on appropriately chosen function spaces. As a result, a well-defined optimal asymptotic forward rate can be derived directly from prices and cashflows of traded instruments. This allows practitioners to use raw market data to extract information about long term forward rates, as we will show in a study which analyzes historical EURIBOR swap data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To date, NDAR is considered the largest neuroscience and genomic data repository for autism research. In addition to biomedical data, NDAR contains a large collection of clinical and behavioral assessments and health outcomes from novel interventions. Importantly, NDAR has a global unique patient identifier that can be linked to aggregated individual-level data for hypothesis generation and testing, and for replicating research findings. As such, NDAR promotes collaboration and maximizes public investment in the original data collection. As screening and diagnostic technologies as well as interventions for children with autism are expensive, health services research (HSR) and health technology assessment (HTA) are needed to generate more evidence to facilitate implementation when warranted. This article describes NDAR and explains its value to health services researchers and decision scientists interested in autism and other mental health conditions.

A semi-Markov model (3-month cycle length) used survival curves to govern progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Efficacy and safety data and health-state utility values were estimated from the COMPLEMENT-1 trial. Post-progression treatment patterns were based on clinical guidelines, Canadian treatment practices and published literature. Total and incremental expected lifetime costs (in Canadian dollars [$Can], year 2013 values), life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed. Uncertainty was assessed via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The discounted lifetime health and economic outcomes estimated by the model showed that, compared with chlorambucil, first-line treatment with OChl led to an increase in QALYs (0.41) and total costs ($Can27,866) and to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $Can68,647 per QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to the modelling time horizon and to the extrapolation of OS treatment effects beyond the trial duration. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can100,000 per QALY gained was 59 %. Base-case results indicated that improved overall response and PFS for OChl compared with chlorambucil translated to improved quality-adjusted life expectancy. Sensitivity analysis suggested that OChl is likely to be cost effective subject to uncertainty associated with the presence of any long-term OS benefit and the model time horizon.","[Herring, William; Purser, Molly] RTI Hlth Solut, Durham, NC 27709 USA; [Pearson, Isobel; Wolowacz, Sorrel] RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Nakhaipour, Hamid Reza; Jayasundara, Kavisha] GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Haiderali, Amin] GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA USA",Research Triangle Institute; Research Triangle Institute; GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline,"Herring, W (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Off Dr,Res Triangle Pk, Durham, NC 27709 USA.",wherring@rti.org,,"Pearson, Isobel/0000-0003-3931-8457; Wolowacz, Sorrel/0000-0001-5497-612X; Purser, Molly/0000-0002-6394-9905; Herring, William L/0000-0001-8222-9914",,,,,48,13,13,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2016,34,1,,,,,77,90,,10.1007/s40273-015-0332-5,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DA9XL,26518293.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368163000008,0

The adopted method is a distribution-free approximation which allows to construct the extremal random variables with respect to the stochastic dominance order and the stop-loss order. We derive the optimal retention such that the risk measure used in this paper attains the minimum.

Our aim was to assess the study methods used and outcomes reported in the published literature to address the question of comparative effectiveness of newer antipsychotic agents and the adequacy and availability of evidence to support HTA agencies. A systematic search of the PubMed database from 1 January 2009 to 30 September 2013 was conducted to identify studies evaluating new atypical antipsychotics reporting on comparative effectiveness. The systematic review comprised of studies on schizophrenia patients where at least two drugs were being compared and at least one treatment group received one of the following second-generation antipsychotics: risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, and quetiapine. The included studies were also required to have an efficacy, safety or economic outcome, such as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score, weight gain, resource utilization, or costs. Two reviewers (BW and GK) independently applied the inclusion criteria. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus, referring to the original sources. Information on the methodology and outcomes was collected for each included study. This included study description, head-to-head drug comparison, patient population, study methodology, statistical methods, reported outcomes, study support, and journal type. A total of 198 studies were identified from electronic search methods. The largest category of studies was randomized controlled trials [RCTs] (N = 73; 36.9 %), which were largely directed at the regulatory endpoint. Fewer studies were undertaken for HTA-purposes cohort studies (N = 53; 26.8 %), meta-analyses (N = 32; 16.2 %), economic studies (N = 14; 7.1 %), and cross-sectional studies (N = 13; 6.6 %). Direct head-to-head comparisons preferred by HTA were dominated by the comparison involving olanzapine and risperidone, representing 149 (75.3 %) and 119 (60.1 %) studies, respectively. RCTs, which are the primary study type for regulatory submissions, showed a lack of bias. Studies aimed at HTA were not as well performed. Cohort studies suffered from bias in the selection of comparison groups, lack of control for confounders, and differential dropout rates. As a group, cross-sectional studies scored poorly for bias, with a primary failure to identify a representative sample. Economic studies showed highly variable bias, with bias in the representation of effectiveness data, model assumptions without validation, and lack of sensitivity analyses. One limitation of this systematic review is that it only included studies from 2009 to 2013, potentially excluding some earlier comparator studies, particularly those involving first-generation antipsychotics. This review of comparative effectiveness studies of second-generation antipsychotic agents for schizophrenic patients revealed a wide range of study types, study methodologies, and outcomes. For traditional efficacy outcomes and select safety outcomes, there is strong evidence from many well-conducted studies; however, there are fewer studies of types preferred by HTA with limited head-to-head comparisons and a higher risk of bias in the execution of these studies.","[Kruse, Gregory] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wong, Bruce J.

We assume the firm finances its risky assets by mainly issuing short-and long-term debt. Short-term debt can have either a discrete or a more realistic staggered tenor structure. At rollover dates of short-term debt, creditors face a dynamic coordination problem. We show that a unique threshold strategy (i.e., a debt run barrier) exists for short-term creditors to decide when to withdraw their funding, and this strategy is closely related to the solution of a non-standard optimal stopping time problem with control constraints. We decompose the total credit risk into an insolvency component and an illiquidity component based on such an endogenous debt run barrier together with an exogenous insolvency barrier.","[Liang, Gechun] Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Luetkebohmert, Eva] Univ Freiburg, Dept Quantitat Finance, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Wei, Wei] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Freiburg; University of Oxford,"Liang, GC (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Math, London WC2R 2LS, England.",gechun.liang@kcl.ac.uk; eva.luetkebohmert@finance.uni-freiburg.de; wei.wei@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Luetkebohmert, Eva/S-6116-2016; Liang, Gechun/O-9671-2017","Liang, Gechun/0000-0003-0752-0773",,,,,27,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Based on our results, we conjecture that autocorrelation amplification is one of the reasons why such trading rules are popular. Using simulated results, we show that the MA rule may be popular because it can identify price momentum and is a simple way of assessing and exploiting the price autocorrelation structure without necessarily knowing its precise structure.

We account for the universally observed square-root impact law, and predict non-trivial trajectories when trading is interrupted or reversed. We prove that our framework is free of price manipulation and that prices can be made diffusive (albeit with a generic short-term mean-reverting contribution).

To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) for health-related quality of life improvements. Estimates are based on cost and quality of life outcomes from a 56-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial undertaken in 93 health centers in the US. Participants were overweight and obese adults (aged 18-70 years) with a body-mass index of 27-45 kg/m(2) and two or more comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes or pre-diabetes or abdominal obesity). The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo. The study was from the payer perspective. Costs included the prescription cost, medication cost offsets and physician appointment costs. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained (QALYs). The main outcome measure was incremental cost per QALY gained of the intervention relative to control. Our base-case model, in which participants take Qsymia for 1 year with benefits linearly decaying over the subsequent 2 years, generates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $48,340 per QALY gained. Using the base-case assumptions, probabilistic sensitivity analyses reveal that the ICER is below $50,000 per QALY in 54 % of simulations. However, results are highly dependent on the extent to which benefits are maintained post medication cessation. If benefits persist for only 1 year post cessation, the ICER increases to $74,480. Although base-case results suggest that Qsymia is cost-effective, this result hinges on the time on Qsymia and the extent to which benefits are maintained post medication cessation. This should be an area of future research.","[Finkelstein, Eric A.; Kruger, Eliza] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Finkelstein, Eric A.] Duke Univ, Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Karnawat, Sunil] VIVUS Inc, Mountain View, CA USA",National University of Singapore; Duke University,"Finkelstein, EA (通讯作者)，Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore, Singapore.",eric.finkelstein@duke-nus.edu.sg,,"Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686","VIVUS, Inc.","VIVUS, Inc.","VIVUS, Inc.",,34,25,25,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2015,33,7,,,,,699,706,,10.1007/s40273-014-0182-6,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CL6EN,24986038.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357060500008,0

Using limit experiment theory we derive a sharp power envelope. We also demonstrate that, among others, one of the likelihood ratio based tests in Moon et al.

In equilibrium, counterfeiters produce better quality at higher notes, but verifiers try sufficiently harder that verification still improves. We develop a graphical framework for deducing comparative statics. Passed and counterfeiting rates vanish for low and high notes.

The null asymptotics for the proposed nonparametric test statistic have been well developed in the existing literature. In this paper, we study the local asymptotics of the test statistic (i.e. the asymptotic properties of the test statistic under a sequence of general nonparametric local alternatives) and show that the asymptotic distribution depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the distance function, which is the local deviation from the parametrically specified model in the null hypothesis. In order to implement the proposed test in practice, we introduce a bootstrap procedure to approximate the critical values of the test statistic and establish a new Edgeworth expansion, which is used to justify the use of such an approximation. Based on the approximate critical values, we develop a bandwidth selection method, which chooses the optimal bandwidth that maximizes the local power of the test while its size is controlled at a given significance level. The local power is defined as the power of the proposed test for a given sequence of local alternatives. Such a bandwidth selection is made feasible by an approximate expression for the local power of the test as a function of the bandwidth. A Monte Carlo simulation study is provided to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed test.","[Chen, Jia] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Gao, Jiti] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Li, Degui] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Lin, Zhengyan] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Math, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China",University of York - UK; Monash University; University of York - UK; Zhejiang University,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",,,"Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021; Li, Degui/0000-0001-6802-308X","Australian Research Council [DP1096374, DP130104229]; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Australian Research Council [DP1096374] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors are grateful to the co-editor, Professor Michael Jansson, and to two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions, which have helped to substantially improve the former version of the paper.

We characterize the long-run outcomes of Markov perfect equilibrium that are robust to the mistakes and show that if one player is sufficiently patient whereas the other players are not so patient, the efficient state can be the unique robust outcome even if it is risk-dominated.

As endogenous factors, we consider returns and volatility, whereas the exogenous factors are the total daily number of news articles and a semantic variable based on a sentiment analysis of the news. Linear regression and partial correlation analysis of the data show that different categories of investors are differently correlated to these factors. Governmental and non-profit organizations are weakly sensitive to news and returns or volatility, and, typically, they are more correlated with the former than with the latter. Households and companies, on the contrary, are very sensitive to both endogenous and exogenous factors, and volatility and returns are, on average, much more relevant than the number of news articles and sentiment, respectively. Financial institutions and foreign organizations are intermediate between these two cases, in terms of both the total explanatory power of these factors and their relative importance. We explicitly consider the role of overnight news and overnight returns on the successive trading activity and trading balance of the different categories of investors. We observe the role of the overnight news, which is weaker than the ones observed between synchronous variables. By performing a vector autoregression (VAR) analysis, we show that the flux of news of the previous day affects the trading activity of companies, households and foreign investors and the dynamics of volatility. VAR is not detecting any role of the lagged sentiment in the successive values of the difference between the number of buying and selling investors for each category of investors.","[Lillo, Fabrizio] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Lillo, Fabrizio; Micciche, Salvatore; Mantegna, Rosario N.] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Lillo, Fabrizio] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Tumminello, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Stat, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Piilo, Jyrki] Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, Turku Ctr Quantum Phys, FI-20014 Turun, Finland; [Mantegna, Rosario N.] Cent European Univ, Ctr Network Sci, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Mantegna, Rosario N.] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; University of Palermo; The Santa Fe Institute; University of Palermo; University of Turku; Central European University; Central European University,"Mantegna, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",mantegnar@ceu.hu,"Mantegna, Rosario N/H-3652-2014; Tumminello, Michele/G-4492-2011; Miccichè, Salvatore/B-6575-2008; Piilo, Jyrki/D-3043-2011","Mantegna, Rosario N/0000-0003-4177-171X; Tumminello, Michele/0000-0001-6045-6761; Miccichè, Salvatore/0000-0003-3779-592X; Piilo, Jyrki/0000-0002-5595-873X",Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Palermo University; Institute for New Economic Thinking; [SNS11LILLB],Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation; Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Palermo University; Institute for New Economic Thinking;,"Authors acknowledge Thomson Reuters for providing the NewScope archive data and Euroclear for granting access to the ownership data of single investors.

The computational kernel of the pricing model is the solution of integral equations. We obtain a sparse and accurate representation of the kernel of such equations in wavelet function bases. It is worth pointing out that the execution time of our procedure is almost constant with respect to the number of monitoring dates. Thus, our pricing procedure is particularly competitive when the number of monitoring dates is large. We moreover discuss the parallelization of the algorithm. Numerical results that show the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure are reported in the paper.","[Corsaro, S.; Marino, Z.] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dipartimento Studi Aziendali & Quantitat, Naples, Italy; [Corsaro, S.] ICAR Natl Res Council Italy, Naples, Italy; [Marazzina, D.] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Calcolo e Reti ad Alte Prestazioni (ICAR-CNR); Polytechnic University of Milan,"Marazzina, D (通讯作者)，ICAR Natl Res Council Italy, Naples, Italy.",daniele.marazzina@polimi.it,"Marazzina, Daniele/AAP-8379-2021; Marino, Zelda/AAI-9467-2021","Marazzina, Daniele/0000-0001-6107-9822; Marino, Zelda/0000-0001-9026-041X; Corsaro, Stefania/0000-0002-6451-8373",,,,,30,4,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In the empirical application with oil, gold and equity data from 1990 to 2010, the conditional t copulas portfolios achieve better performance than those based on more conventional strategies. The specification of higher moments in the marginal distributions and the type of tail dependence in the copula has significant implications for the out-of-sample portfolio performance.","[Gonzalez-Pedraz, Carlos; Ignacio Pena, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Moreno, Manuel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Toledo 45071, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"González-Pedraz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",cugonzal@emp.uc3m.es,"Pena, Juan Ignacio/I-3570-2015","Pena, Juan Ignacio/0000-0003-2435-3583",[P08-SEJ-03917]; [JCCM PPII11-0290-0305],;,"The authors are grateful to Michael Brennan, Alvaro Cartea, Claude Crampes, Jacinto Marabel, Rod McCrorie, Javier F.

In this experiment, sixteen Angus crossbred cattle, eight from each crossbred type, were randomly selected at an average age 20-24 month for slaughter under standard condition. Slaughter weight, carcass quality and proportions of commercial prime retail cuts were determined. The Longissimus dorsi muscle (LD) was selected to evaluate meat quality. Carcass yield (proportion of live weight) was higher (P<0.01) with the AxH than the AxW crossbred. No significant differences were observed between AxH and AxW for hot and chilled carcass weight, carcass length, back fat thickness and loin eye area. The AxW crossbred was superior (P<0.05) compared with AxH in chuck, shot rib and sir loin percentage. The lightness (L*) of the LD of AxW was higher (P<0.01) and redness (a*) as well as protein content was lower (P<0.05) than in AxH. Drip loss, yellowness (b*), fat, and moisture content were not significantly different between the two crossbred types. Thiobarbitiric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were increased with storage period in every group, but this at a lower level with the AxW. In conclusion, AxW was superior to AxH incarcass and meat quality, with similar carcass weights at lower dressing percentage. So, promoting of AxW, is a promising first step in creating improved genotypes suitable to cover the demands of the livestock industry of Thailand at concomitantly lower production costs for the farmers.

Due to the long-term guarantees often embedded in these contracts, life insurers typically invest a considerable portion of their capital in long-term assets such as corporate and government bonds. Besides interest rate risk, the value of these bond investments is thus particularly influenced by credit risk. Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the impact of market risk associated with the asset composition on fair valuation and risk assessment with focus on credit risk and its interaction with equity risk and interest rate risk. Our analysis emphasizes that the consideration of credit risk associated with bonds has a strong impact on the fair valuation and risk measurement in the context of participating life insurance contracts, even in case of higher grade bond exposures.

Focused attention is given to semiparametric and nonparametric models that incorporate mixture distributions, where important issues about model specifications arise. For example, there is a significant difference between a finite mixture and a continuous mixture in terms of model identifiability. Likewise, the dimension of the latent mixing variables is a critical issue, in particular when a continuous mixture is used. We present applications of mixture models to address various problems in econometrics, such as unobserved heterogeneity and multiple equilibria. New nonparametric identification results are developed for finite mixture models with testable exclusion restrictions without relying on an identification-at-infinity assumption on covariates. The results apply to mixtures with both continuous and discrete covariates, delivering point identification under weak conditions.","[Compiani, Giovanni] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kitamura, Yuichi] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University; Yale University,"Compiani, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",giovanni.compiani@yale.edu; yuichi.kitamura@yale.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1156266],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Y.

The objective is to sell a single lot of an asset in a short time horizon T, using the imbalance of the top of book bid and ask sizes as a price predictor. The optimization problem takes into account the latency L of the trading algorithm, which affects the prices at which the asset is traded. The solution divides the state space into a trade' and a no-trade' region. We calculate the cost of latency per lot traded and demonstrate that the advantage of observing the limit order book can dissipate quickly as execution latency increases. In the empirical section, we show that our optimal policy significantly outperforms a TWAP algorithm in liquidating on-the-run US treasury bonds, saving on average approximately 1/3 of the spread per share if trades are executed with low latency (approximate to 1ms).","[Stoikov, Sasha] CFEM, New York, NY 10004 USA; [Waeber, Rolf] Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn ORIE, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Stoikov, S (通讯作者)，CFEM, New York, NY 10004 USA.",sfs33@cornell.com,,,,,,,13,12,14,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, we develop a general self-duality theorem to develop valuation schemes for barrier options in stochastic volatility models with correlation.","[Alos, Elisa] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Chen, Zhanyu] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Rheinlaender, Thorsten] Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria",Pompeu Fabra University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Technische Universitat Wien,"Rheinländer, T (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Financial & Actuarial Math, Wiedner Hauptstr 8-10-E105-1, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",rheinlan@fam.tuwien.ac.at,"Chen, Yu/JLL-0171-2023",,"MINECO/FEDER [ECO2011-28875, MTM2009-08869]",MINECO/FEDER,Elisa Alos is supported by grants ECO2011-28875 and MTM2009-08869 by MINECO/FEDER.,,18,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We determine conditions under which, in equilibrium, price impact and price volatility are both stochastic, driven by shocks to uninformed volume even though the fundamental value is constant. The volatility of price volatility appears 'excessive' because insiders choose to trade more aggressively (and thus more information is revealed) when uninformed volume is higher and price impact is lower. This generates a positive relation between price volatility and trading volume, giving rise to an endogenous subordinate stochastic process for prices.","[Collin-Dufresne, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, SFI, CDM, SFI PCD EXTRA 209, Batiment Extranef UNIL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fos, Vyacheslav] Boston Coll, Dept Finance, Carroll Sch Management, Fulton Hall 338,140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Boston College,"Collin-Dufresne, P (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, SFI, CDM, SFI PCD EXTRA 209, Batiment Extranef UNIL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",pierre.collin-dufresne@epfl.ch; fos@bc.edu,,,,,,,29,62,71,3,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JUL,2016,84,4,,,,,1441,1475,,10.3982/ECTA10789,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DR8GI,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380136000004,0

The population moment conditions take the form of temporally integrated functionals of state-variable processes that include the latent stochastic volatility process of an asset. In the first step, we nonparametrically recover the volatility path from high-frequency asset returns. The nonparametric volatility estimator is then used to form sample moment functions in the second-step GMM estimation, which requires the correction of a high-order nonlinearity bias from the first step. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically mixed Gaussian and propose a consistent estimator for the conditional asymptotic variance. We also construct a Bierens-type consistent specification test.

Many authors have commented on the clinical and competitive implications of companion diagnostics, but there has been relatively little formal analysis of the cost implications of companion diagnostics, although cost reduction is often cited as a significant benefit of precision medicine. We investigate the potential impact on costs of precision medicine implemented through the use of companion diagnostics. We develop a framework in which the costs of companion diagnostic tests are determined by considerations of profit maximization and cost effectiveness. We analyze four scenarios that are defined by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the new drug in the absence of a companion diagnostic test. We find that, in most scenarios, precision medicine strategies based on companion diagnostics should be expected to lead to increases in costs in the short term and that costs would fall only in a limited number of situations.","[Zaric, Gregory S.] Univ Western Ontario, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Zaric, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",gzaric@ivey.uwo.ca,,,Canada Research Chairs program,Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs),The author is supported through the Canada Research Chairs program.

The large financial market under consideration does not satisfy the standard assumptions of the theory of AA. For this reason, we follow a constructive approach to show first that a strong AA (SAA) exists in the frictionless case. Indeed, with the help of an appropriate version of the law of large numbers and a stopping time procedure, we construct a sequence of self-financing trading strategies leading to the desired result. Next, we introduce, in each small market, proportional transaction costs, and we show that a slight modification of the previous trading strategies leads to a SAA when the transaction costs converge fast enough to 0.","[Cordero, Fernando] Univ Bielefeld, Fac Technol, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Perez-Ostafe, Lavinia] ETH, Dept Math, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bielefeld; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Perez-Ostafe, L (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Math, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",fcordero@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de; lavinia.perez@math.ethz.ch,,"Cordero, Fernando/0000-0001-5959-0787",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J 3453] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,23,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Also based on a nonparametric comparison, we find that extending the independent Weibull distribution by a squared third order polynomial shows the best performance. We illustrate our model by calculating remaining life expectancies and annuity values. We find that the husbands life expectancy at birth is generally increasing with his wifes age of death and the wifes life expectancy at birth is generally increasing with her husbands age of death.

First, neural networks are often hard to estimate due to their highly nonlinear structure. To alleviate the problem, White (2006) presented a solution (QuickNet) that converts the specification and nonlinear estimation problem into a linear model selection and estimation problem. We shall compare its performance to that of two other procedures building on the linearization idea: the Marginal Bridge Estimator and Autometrics.

We propose a method that captures group affiliation or, equivalently, estimates the block structure of a neighboring matrix embedded in a Spatial Econometric model. The main results of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) estimator shows that off-diagonal block elements are estimated as zeros with high probability, property defined as zero-block consistency. Furthermore, we present and prove zero-block consistency for the estimated spatial weight matrix even under a thin margin of interaction between groups. The tool developed in this article can be used as a verification of block structure by applied researchers, or as an exploration tool for estimating unknown block structures.

Identification-robust statistics based on the plug-in principle have been developed for testing hypotheses specified on subsets of the structural parameters. However, their robustness to instrument exclusion has not been investigated. This paper proposes an analysis of the asymptotic distributions of the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator and plug-in statistics when potential instruments are omitted. Our results provide several new insights and extensions of earlier studies. We show that the exclusion of instruments can eliminate the first-stage, thus weakening identification and invalidating the plug-in subset inference. However, when instrument omission does not affect LIML consistency, it preserves the plug-in subset test validity, although LIML is no longer asymptotically efficient. Unlike the instrumental variable (IV) estimator, the LIML estimator of the identified linear combination of the nuisance parameter is not asymptotically a Gaussian mixture, even without instrument exclusion.","[Tchatoka, Firmin Doko] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Tchatoka, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",firmin.dokotchatoka@adelaide.edu.au,,,Reserve Bank of New Zealand; New Zealand Econometric Study Group,Reserve Bank of New Zealand; New Zealand Econometric Study Group,"I am grateful to Professor Guido Kuersteiner, Co-Editor Econometric Theory, and three anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions.

Instead of treating this time-inconsistent problem as pre-committed, we aim to find time-consistent equilibrium strategy within a game theoretic framework. In particular, proportional reinsurance, acquiring new business, investing in financial market are available in the market. The surplus process of insurer is depicted by classical Lundberg model, and the financial market consists of one risk free asset and one risky asset with unobservable Markov-modulated regime switching drift process. By using reduction technique and solving a generalized extended HJB equation, we derive closed-form time-consistent investment-reinsurance strategy and corresponding value function. Moreover, we compare results under partial information with optimal investment-reinsurance strategy when Markov chain is observable. Finally, some numerical illustrations and sensitivity analysis are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Applying a Bayesian statistical approach, we compute a forward-looking estimate of this variance, an option-implied integrated variance. Simultaneously, we obtain estimates of the correlation coefficient between stock price and volatility shocks, and of the parameters of the volatility process. Due to the convexity of the Black-Scholes formula with respect to the volatility, pricing and hedging with Black-Scholes-type formulas and the implied volatility often lead to inaccuracies if the volatility is stochastic. Theoretically, this problem can be avoided by using Hull-White-type option pricing and hedging formulas and the integrated variance. We use the implied integrated variance and Hull-White-type formulas to hedge European options and certain volatility derivatives.","Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University,"Kaila, R (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Espoo 02150, Finland.",ruth.kaila@aalto.fi,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The modelling undertaken uses a dynamic programming approach in conjunction with Monte-Carlo simulations of future experience of an individual to make optimal choices. We find that the type of objective targetted can have a significant impact on the optimal choices made, with optimal equity allocations being up to 30% higher and contribution amounts also being significantly higher under a retirement income objective as compared to a terminal wealth objective.

Every player chooses a route from his origin to his destination. The cost of a route is the sum of the costs of the arcs on it. The arc cost is a function of the number of players who use it. Rosenthal proved that such a game always has a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. Here we pursue a systematic study of the classes of networks for which a strong equilibrium is guaranteed to exist, under two opposite monotonicity assumptions on the arc cost functions. Our main results are: (a) If costs are increasing, strong equilibrium is guaranteed on extension-parallel networks, regardless of whether the players' origins and destinations are the same or may differ. (b) If costs are decreasing, and the players have the same origin but possibly different destinations, strong equilibrium is guaranteed on series-parallel networks. (c) If costs are decreasing, and both origins and destinations may differ, strong equilibrium is guaranteed on multiextension-parallel networks. In each case, the network condition is not only sufficient but also necessary in order to guarantee strong equilibrium. These results extend and improve earlier ones by Holzman and Law-Yone in the increasing case, and by Epstein et al. in the decreasing case.","[Holzman, Ron] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Math, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Monderer, Dov] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Holzman, R (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Math, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",holzman@tx.technion.ac.il; dov@ie.technion.ac.il,,,Israel Science Foundation [1013/08]; Electronic Commerce Technion-Microsoft Research Center,Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Electronic Commerce Technion-Microsoft Research Center,"This research was supported by the FIRST program of the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 1013/08).

We are interested in the question whether the regression function has the same shape over a given time span. To tackle this testing problem, we propose a kernel-based L-2-test statistic. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the statistic both under the null and under fixed and local alternatives. To improve the small sample behavior of the test, we set up a wild bootstrap procedure and derive the asymptotic properties thereof. The theoretical analysis of the paper is complemented by a simulation study and a real data example.","[Vogt, Michael] Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Vogt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Math & Stat, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",michael.vogt@uni-konstanz.de,,,ERC,ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"I would like to thank Oliver Linton and Enno Mammen for numerous helpful discussions and comments.

These effects must therefore be derived from indirect comparisons of results from different studies. The feasibility of comparisons relies on the network linking treatments through common comparators; the reliability of these may also be impacted when the studies are heterogeneous or when multiple intermediate comparisons are needed to link two specific treatments of interest. Simulated treatment comparison and matching-adjusted indirect comparison have been developed to address these challenges. These focus on comparisons of outcomes for two specific treatments of interest by using patient-level data for one treatment (the index) and published results for the other treatment (the comparator) from compatible studies, taking into account possible confounding due to population differences. This paper provides an overview of how and when these approaches can be used as an alternative or to complement standard MTC approaches.","[Ishak, K.

It is shown that the implicit null of the cross-sectional dependence (CD) test depends on the relative expansion rates of N and T. When T = O(N (epsilon)), for some 0 < epsilon <= 1, then the implicit null of the CD test is given by 0 <= alpha < (2 - epsilon)/4, which gives 0 <= alpha < 1/4, when N and T tend to infinity at the same rate such that T/N -> kappa, with kappa being a finite positive constant. It is argued that in the case of large N panels, the null of weak dependence is more appropriate than the null of independence which could be quite restrictive for large panels. Using Monte Carlo experiments, it is shown that the CD test has the correct size for values of alpha in the range [0, 1/4], for all combinations of N and T, and irrespective of whether the panel contains lagged values of the dependent variables, so long as there are no major asymmetries in the error distribution.","[Pesaran, M.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA307 issued in March 2014. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The clinical effectiveness data were derived from one good-quality double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), the VELOUR trial, which compared aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with placebo plus FOLFIRI. This RCT found a small but statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS); the difference in median OS was 1.44 months (13.5 months in the aflibercept group and 12.06 months in the placebo group). There was also a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) with aflibercept; the difference in median PFS was 2.23 months (6.9 months in the aflibercept group and 4.67 months in the placebo group). However, grade 3-4 adverse events were more frequent in the aflibercept group than the placebo group: 83.5 % compared with 62.5 %. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8 % of patients in the aflibercept group and 12.1% of patients in the placebo group. The manufacturer's submission included an estimation of mean OS benefit based on extrapolation of the data, which was considerably longer than the median OS benefit reported (4.7 vs. 1.44 months). The ERG considered this to be an over estimate. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the overall population was reported by the manufacturer to be A 36,294 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). After correcting the model programming and updating the model to include the ERG's preferred parameter estimates, the ICER from the ERG's alternative base case was A 54,368 pound per QALY. The extrapolation of the OS curves was the key cost-effectiveness driver and a major source of uncertainty in the model. Additional scenarios related to the extrapolation of OS undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs between A 62,894 pound and A 92,089 pound per QALY. After consideration of the manufacturer's submission and the ERG's critique, and submissions from other stakeholders, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy could not be considered a cost effective use of National Health Service resources for treating metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy is not recommended for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen in NICE guidance TA307.","[Wade, Ros; Simmonds, Mark; Rodriguez-Lopez, Rocio; Duffy, Steven; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Duarte, Ana; Spackman, Eldon] Univ York, CHE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Wade, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ros.wade@york.ac.uk,"Duffy, Steven/E-2327-2016; Wade, Ros/AAB-7268-2019; Wade, Rosalind Fay/AAB-5808-2019","Duffy, Steven/0000-0001-7335-8167; Wade, Rosalind Fay/0000-0002-8666-8110; Duarte, Ana/0000-0002-0528-4773; Spackman, David Eldon/0000-0001-8558-5973; Rodriguez Lopez, Rocio/0000-0003-2460-8128",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme [11/80/01]; ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment,This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 11/80/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

This fee charging method is studied recently by Bernard et al. (2014) and Delong (2014) in which the fees deducted from the policyholder's account depend on the account value. However, both of them have not considered the problem of analyzing probabilistic properties of the total time of deducting fees. We approximate the maturity of a general variable annuity contract by combinations of exponential distributions which are (weakly) dense in the space that is composed of all probability distributions on the positive axis.

A Systematic Review of Inclusion and Impact of Informal Care in Cost-Effectiveness Studies,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,SEVERE ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; TREATMENT STRATEGIES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; OBJECTIVE BURDEN; MARKOV MODEL; CAREGIVERS; MEMANTINE; DONEPEZIL; DEMENTIA,"Background Informal care makes an important contribution to societal welfare. However, it may involve substantial time costs and can have a considerable negative effect on the health and well-being of informal caregivers. These costs and effects of informal caregiving are often excluded in economic evaluations of healthcare interventions. The impact of this exclusion on the outcomes of these evaluations is largely unknown. Objectives This study aimed to explore the inclusion of informal care in economic evaluations and the potential impact of the costs and effects of informal caregiving on cost-effectiveness outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of interventions in four distinct disease areas where informal care is potentially important: Alzheimer's disease, metastatic colorectal cancer, Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It was recorded how often economic evaluations included informal caregiving. Next, for the studies including informal care, the impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes was determined by removing informal care costs and effects of the cost-effectiveness calculations and recalculating the outcomes. The new cost-effectiveness outcomes were then compared with the original reported outcomes. Results The study identified 100 economic evaluations investigating interventions targeted at Alzheimer's disease (n = 25), metastatic colorectal cancer (n = 24), Parkinson's disease (n = 8) and rheumatoid arthritis (n = 43). Twenty-three of these evaluations (23 %) included costs and/or effects of informal caregiving: 64 % of the Alzheimer's disease studies, 0 % of the metastatic colorectal cancer studies, 13 % of Parkinson's disease studies and 14 % of rheumatoid arthritis studies. When informal care was included, this mostly concerned time costs. Studies rarely included both costs and effects. The effect of including or excluding informal care costs or effects on cost-effectiveness outcomes in most studies was modest, but in some studies the impact was strong. Conclusion Most economic evaluations in the area of Alzheimer's disease include costs and/or effects related to informal caregiving. However, in other disease areas where informal caregiving is common it seems that the majority of economic evaluations ignore informal caregiving. The inclusion of informal care can have a strong impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes. Future economic evaluations should therefore consider the relevance of informal care in the context of their study, and either include these costs and effects or justify why they were excluded.","[Krol, Marieke; van Exel, Job] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Krol, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",krol@bmg.eur.nl,"Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022; van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013","van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828",AstraZeneca; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen; MSD BV; Novartis; Pfizer,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Janssen(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); MSD BV; Novartis(Novartis); Pfizer(Pfizer),"This study is part of a larger project investigating the broader societal benefits of healthcare, which was financially supported by AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, MSD BV, Novartis and Pfizer.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarises the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) initial decision. At the time of writing, final guidance had not been published by NICE. The clinical evidence was mainly derived from an ongoing phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled international multicentre clinical trial (CLEOPATRA), designed to evaluate efficacy and safety in 808 patients, which compared pertuzumab + trastuzumab + docetaxel (pertuzumab arm) with placebo + trastuzumab + docetaxel (control arm). Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed at two data cut-off points-May 2011 (median follow-up of 18 months) and May 2012 (median follow-up of 30 months). At both time points, PFS was significantly longer in the pertuzumab arm (18.5 months compared with 12.4 months in the control arm at the first data cut-off point and 18.7 versus 12.4 months at the second data cut-off point). Assessment of OS benefit suggested an improvement for patients in the pertuzumab arm with a strong trend towards an OS benefit at the second data cut-off point; however, due to the immaturity of the OS data, the magnitude of the OS benefit was uncertain. Importantly, cardiotoxicity was not increased in patients treated with a combination of pertuzumab + trastuzumab + docetaxel. The ERG's main concern with the clinical effectiveness data was the lack of mature OS data. An additional concern of the AC was that the majority of patients in the randomised controlled trial were trastuzumab na < ve, which does not reflect current clinical practice. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) generated by the manufacturer's model are considered to be commercial in confidence data and therefore cannot be published. Nevertheless, the results of the manufacturer's probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggest that pertuzumab + trastuzumab + docetaxel has a 0 % probability of being cost effective at a willingness-to-pay of A 30,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained when compared with trastuzumab + docetaxel. The ERG believes that more realistic estimates of the ICERs are considerably higher, almost double those presented by the manufacturer. This is because the ERG believes that due to the manner in which the economic model is constructed, the additional survival benefit following disease progression that is generated for patients treated with pemetrexed + trastuzumab + docetaxel is unrealistic. At the time of writing, NICE had not made a final decision regarding this technology but had instead referred the issue of the assessment of technologies that are not effective at a zero price to their Decision Support Unit for advice.","[Fleeman, Nigel; Bagust, Adrian; Beale, Sophie; Dwan, Kerry; Dickson, Rumona; Dundar, Yenal] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Proudlove, Chris] North West Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Fleeman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",Nigel.Fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk,"Dundar, Yenal/AAU-8336-2020; Dwan, Kerry/AFK-6469-2022; Dwan, Kerry/AAG-4726-2022; Dundar, Yenal/JZT-0760-2024","Dundar, Yenal/0000-0002-9847-1622; Dwan, Kerry/0000-0001-6918-1215; Dwan, Kerry/0000-0001-6918-1215;",National Institute for Health Research [11/139/01],National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 11/139/01).

A survey using the random sampling method was carried out in 3 villages consisting of 2 different tribes, Hmong and Mien. Data were recorded of 320 chickens; 160 male and 160 female. Effects of supplemented indigenous microorganism on growth performance of crossbred Thai indigenous chickens were performed using 200 birds. The results showed that Thai indigenous chicken in highland region forms a very heterogeneous character; they exhibited wide variation in color, plumage, comb type, skin color, eye color, shank color, and beak color. The predominant plumage color of Thai native chicken in the region was black followed by red brownish, white and multicolor. The overall means indicated that about 73.5, 55.6, 65.8 and 61.4% of the chickens had pea comb types, black shank color, eye color, and black beak color, respectively. The mean of flock size was less than 10 chickens per household (63.3%). The production systems in the study region were classified into three system; free-ranges, semi free-ranges and semi-intensive. Only 13.3% of the farmers knew about proper vaccination programs, while 88.7% never vaccinated their chicken. Thai indigenous crossbreed chickens that were fed diets containing indigenous microorganisms had a significantly (P<0.05) higher body weight at week 1 and 6 compared to commercial probiotics. The major use of chicken by both Hmong and Mien people is not only for food but also for socio-cultural values. The study also identified that women were more involved in chicken management activities than men. Further research is needed, especially on breeding plans and management practices.

Data collection were done among 149 households in Chai Prakan, Fang and Mae Ai districts, Chiang Mai, Thailand. A weighted multi-goal programming was employed with eight model objectives/goals covering economic, social and environmental aspects. These were maximization of annual equivalent value (AEV) of cropping systems, employment and revenue from non-timber forest products and minimization of revenue variance, dependence from external inputs, expenditure on pesticides, nitrogen use, soil erosion. This study looked at trade-offs between decisions at the farm and watershed level, economic and environmental objectives, economic and social objectives, and social and environmental objectives. If decisions on optimal land use were done at the farm level, farm land in the watershed would be allocated to mixed fruit trees and annual crops while if they were done at the watershed level, land would be planted to fruit trees and some forests and not so much annual crops. Trade-off analysis between different objectives revealed that expenditure on pesticides or nitrogen use as well as soil erosion could be substantially reduced for only a relatively small decrease in the annual equivalent value and employment.

This approach provides a transparent introduction of dependence through a common shock structure. In addition, it also has a number of ideal properties, including marginal flexibility, transparency, and tractability including moments that can be obtained in closed form.

The model casts mortality as a complex-valued process where the real and imaginary parts correspond to female and male mortalities, respectively. Calculations proceed similarly to the usual Lee-Carter model, via the singular value decomposition, albeit in complex form. Initial applications suggest that the complex Lee-Carter gives fits that are broadly comparable to independent real fits, while offering the advantage of explicit modeling of the relationship between the sexes.

This study aimed to produce reporting criteria for two types of study design to use expert judgement in model-based EE: (i) an expert elicitation (quantitative) study; and (ii) a Delphi study to collate (qualitative) expert opinion. Methods A two-round online Delphi process identified the degree of consensus for four core definitions (expert; expert parameter values; expert elicitation study; expert opinion) and two sets of reporting criteria in a purposive sample of experts. The initial set of reporting criteria comprised 17 statements for reporting a study to elicit parameter values and/or distributions and 11 statements for reporting a Delphi survey to obtain expert opinion. Fifty experts were invited to become members of the Delphi process panel by e-mail. Data analysis summarised the extent of agreement (using a pre-defined 75 % 'consensus' threshold) on the definitions and suggested reporting criteria. Free-text comments were analysed using thematic analysis. Results The final panel comprised 12 experts. Consensus was achieved for the definitions of expert (88 %); expert parameter values (83 %); and expert elicitation study (83 %). The panel recommended criteria to use when reporting an expert elicitation study (16 criteria) and a Delphi study to collate expert opinion (11 criteria). Conclusion This study has produced guidelines for reporting two types of study design to use expert judgement in model-based EE: (i) an expert elicitation study requiring 16 reporting criteria; and (ii) a Delphi study to collate expert opinion requiring 11 reporting criteria.,"[Iglesias, Cynthia P.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Hlth Sci, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Iglesias, Cynthia P.] Univ York, Hull & York Med Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Thompson, Alexander; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, 4th Floor,Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Rogowski, Wolf H.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Rogowski, Wolf H.] Univ Bremen, Inst Publ Hlth & Nursing Res, Dept Hlth Care Management, Hlth Sci, Bremen, Germany",University of York - UK; University of Hull; University of York - UK; University of Manchester; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Bremen,"Payne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, 4th Floor,Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Rogowski, Wolf/D-9334-2013","Rogowski, Wolf/0000-0003-1625-4171; Thompson, Alexander/0000-0003-4930-5107; Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350","Medical Research Council [G0501814, G0501892] Funding Source: Medline; MRC [G0501892] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0501892] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,34,48,53,1,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2016,34,11,,,,,1161,1172,,10.1007/s40273-016-0425-9,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EA6RE,27364887.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386755700008,0

Yet these techniques have been criticized as they make it difficult to assess insurers' true financial status. We develop stylized and realistically-calibrated models of a participating life annuity, an insurance product that pays retirees guaranteed lifelong benefits along with variable non-guaranteed surplus. Our goal is to illustrate how accounting and actuarial techniques for this type of financial contract shape policyholder wellbeing, along with insurer profitability and stability. Smoothing adds value to both the annuitant and the insurer, so curtailing smoothing could undermine the market for long-term retirement payout products. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Our theoretical results provide new insight for the theory of semiparametric efficiency bounds literature and open the door to new applications.

Our estimation strategy is applicable to both parametric and nonparametric stochastic volatility models, and can handle both jumps and market microstructure noise. The resulting estimators of the stochastic volatility model will carry additional biases and variances due to the first-step estimation, but under regularity conditions we show that these vanish asymptotically and our estimators inherit the asymptotic properties of the infeasible estimators based on observations of the volatility process.

The Seel and Strack model consists of n-agents each of whom privately observes a transient diffusion process and chooses when to stop it. The player with the highest stopped value wins the contest, and each player's objective is to maximize her probability of winning the contest. We give a new derivation of the results of Seel and Strack based on a Lagrangian approach. Moreover, we consider an extension of the problem to a behavioral finance context in the sense of regret theory. In particular, an agent is penalized when her chosen strategy does not win the contest, but there existed an alternative strategy that would have resulted in victory.","[Feng, Han; Hobson, David] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Feng, H (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",H.Feng@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,8,5,5,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

However, most existing studies have mainly emphasised epidemiology and medications, while large observational studies reporting on the economic burden are currently lacking. To review and evaluate evidence on the costs of PAH and the cost effectiveness of PAH treatments, and to summarise the corresponding cost drivers. Systematic literature searches were conducted in English-language databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect) and Chinese-language databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP) to identify studies (published from 2000 to 2014) assessing the costs of PAH or the cost effectiveness of PAH treatments. The search results were independently reviewed and extracted by two reviewers. Costs were converted into 2014 US dollars. Of 1959 citations identified in the initial search, 19 papers were finally included in this analysis: eight on the economic burden of PAH and 11 on economic evaluation of PAH treatments. The economic burden on patients with PAH was rather large, with direct healthcare costs per patient per month varying from $2476 to $11,875, but none of the studies reported indirect costs. Sildenafil was universally reported to be a cost-effective treatment, with lower costs and better efficacy than other medications. Medical costs were reported to be the key cost drivers.

Our proposed method first estimates the unknown functions by combining polynomial spline series approximations with least squares, and then uses the fitted residuals together with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty to identify the error structure and estimate the unknown autoregressive coefficients. Based on the polynomial spline series estimator and the fitted error structure, a two-stage local polynomial improved estimator for the unknown functions of the mean is further developed. Our procedure applies a prewhitening transformation of the dependent variable, and also takes into account the contemporaneous correlations across equations. We show that the resulting estimator possesses an oracle property, and is asymptotically more efficient than estimators that neglect the autocorrelation and/or contemporaneous correlations of errors. We investigate the small sample properties of the proposed procedure in a simulation study.","[Wan, Alan T.

A standard approach relies on statistical loss functions. Another approach bases the evaluation of the volatility predictions on utility functions or Value at Risk (VaR) measures. This work aims to combine the two approaches, using the VaR measures within the loss functions. By means of this method, the VaR measures obtained from a set of competing models are plugged into two loss functions, the magnitude loss function and a proposed new one. This latter loss function more heavily penalizes the models with a number of VaR violations greater than the expected one. The loss function values are evaluated against a benchmark obtained from the inclusion of a consistent estimate of the VaR measures in the loss function. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed method and the new loss function, a Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical analysis of a stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange are provided. The proposed strategy helps with the selection of a superior model, in terms of forecast accuracy, when the cited approaches do not clearly and uniquely identify it. Moreover, the new asymmetric loss function allows a greater discrimination with regard to models, helping to find the best volatility model.","[Amendola, A.; Candila, V.] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy",University of Salerno,"Candila, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy.",vcandila@unisa.it,"Amendola, Alessandra/E-6037-2018","Amendola, Alessandra/0000-0002-0152-9307",Italian Ministry of Education University and Research MIUR through PRIN project [2010J3LZEN],Italian Ministry of Education University and Research MIUR through PRIN project,"The authors thank two anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

This approach might be useful as a conceptual process underlying complex valuation tasks. The objective of the study was to explore the applicability of such a framework using a single case study (valuing the ICECAP-Supportive Care Measure) and considering three key uncertainties: the number of response categories for the measure; experimental design; and the potential for using slightly different variants of the measure with the same value set. Three on-line pilot studies (n = 204, n = 100, n = 102) were undertaken during 2012 and 2013 with adults from the UK general population. Each used variants of discrete choice and best-worst scaling tasks; respondents were randomly allocated to different groups to allow exploration of the number of levels for the instrument (four or five), optimal experimental design and the values for alternative wording around prognosis. Conditional logit regression models were used in the analysis and variance scale factors were explored. The five-level version of the measure seemed to result in simplifying heuristics. Plotting the variance scale factors suggested that best-worst scaling answers were approximately four times more consistent than the discrete choice answers. The likelihood ratio test indicated there was virtually no difference in values between the differently worded versions. Rigorous piloting can improve the design of valuation studies. Thinking in terms of a 'complex valuation framework' may emphasise the importance of conducting and funding such rigorous pilots.","[Coast, Joanna; Kinghorn, Philip] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Huynh, Elisabeth] Univ S Australia, Inst Choice, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Flynn, Terry] TF Choices Ltd, Nottingham, England",University of Bristol; University of South Australia,"Coast, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",jo.coast@bristol.ac.uk,"; Huynh, Elisabeth/M-5970-2015","Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166; Huynh, Elisabeth/0000-0002-1855-3143; Kinghorn, Philip/0000-0002-9333-1962",European Research Council [261098EconEndLife]; Medical Research Council [MR/K025643/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0514-10114] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/K025643/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was supported by the European Research Council (261098EconEndLife).

This generalization is suitable for comparing vectors with heterogeneous components and extends some well-known properties of the univariate increasing convex order. For example, comparisons of vectors with the same copula can be characterized in terms of the multivariate tail conditional expectations introduced by Cousin and Di Bernardino (2014). Moreover, if the copula reflects a particular positive dependence structure, the order among the vectors can be easily verified simply by checking the univariate increasing convex order of the marginals.

For such options, there is no convenient closed-form formula for the prices. Previously, Rogers and Shi, Vecer, and Dubois and Lelievre have derived partial differential equations with one state variable, with the stock price as numeraire, for the option prices. In this paper, we derive a whole family of partial differential equations, each with one state variable with the stock price as numeraire, from which Asian options can be priced. Any one of these partial differential equations can be transformed into any other. This family includes four partial differential equations which have a particularly simple form including the three found by Rogers and Shi, Vecer, and Dubois and Lelievre. Our analysis includes the case of a dividend yield; we also include the case of in progress Asian options with floating strike, whereby we discuss the new equation proposed by Vecer, which uses the average asset as numeraire. We perform an error analysis on the four special partial differential equations and Vecer's new equation and find that their truncation errors are all of the same order. We also perform numerical comparisons of the five partial differential equations and conclude, as expected, that Vecer's equations and that of Dubois and Lelievre do better when the volatility is low but that with higher volatilities the performance of all five equations is similar. Vecer's equations are unique in possessing a certain martingale property and as they perform numerically well or better than the others, must be considered the preferred choice.","[Brown, C.] Monash Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Caulfield, Vic, Australia; [Handley, J.

Thereby we take into account and model the basis risk that arises due to the fact that the insurance company cannot perfectly hedge its exposure by investing in a hedging instrument that is based on the longevity index, not on the insurance portfolio itself.

We show that an economy in which agents have consumption commitments is approximately equivalent to a habit formation model in which the habit stock is a weighted average of past consumption if idiosyncratic risk is large relative to aggregate risk. Consumption commitments can thus explain the empirical regularity that consumption is excessively sensitive and excessively smooth, findings that are typically attributed to habit formation. Unlike habit formation and other theories, but consistent with empirical evidence, the consumption commitments model also predicts that excess sensitivity and smoothness vanish for large shocks. These results suggest that behavior previously attributed to habit formation may be better explained by adjustment costs. We develop additional testable predictions to further distinguish the commitment and habit models and show that the two models have different welfare implications.","[Chetty, Raj] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chetty, Raj] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Szeidl, Adam] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, Nador Utca 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Szeidl, Adam] CEPR, London, England",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Central European University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Chetty, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Szeidl, A (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Econ, Nador Utca 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.;Szeidl, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",chetty@stanford.edu; szeidla@ceu.edu,,"Szeidl, Adam/0000-0001-9750-4843","National Science Foundation [SES 0522073]; European Research Council under the European Union, ERC [283484]; European Research Council (ERC) [283484] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council under the European Union, ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","For helpful comments, we thank John Campbell, Gary Chamberlain, Tom Davidoff, Drew Fudenberg, Elhanan Helpman, Miklos Koren, Hanno Lustig, Todd Sinai, Jeremy Stein, and Moto Yogo.

We develop a framework to estimate markups from production data with multi-product firms. This approach does not require assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by firms, nor assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products. We exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices by the estimated markups. We use India's trade liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance measures. Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least immediately after the reforms.","[De Loecker, Jan] Princeton Univ, Fisher Hall,Prospect Ave, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Goldberg, Pinelopi K.] Yale Univ, 37 Hillhouse, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Khandelwal, Amit K.] Columbia Business Sch, Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pavcnik, Nina] Dartmouth Coll, 6106 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Princeton University; Yale University; Columbia University; Dartmouth College,"De Loecker, J (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Fisher Hall,Prospect Ave, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;Goldberg, PK (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, 37 Hillhouse, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Khandelwal, AK (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Pavcnik, N (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, 6106 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jdeloeck@princeton.edu; penny.goldberg@yale.edu; ak2796@columbia.edu; nina.pavcnik@dartmouth.edu,"De Loecker, Jan/N-6973-2014",,,,,,59,361,428,15,166,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2016,84,2,,,,,445,510,,10.3982/ECTA11042,0.0,,,66,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8DQ,,"Bronze, Green Published, Green Submitted",Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000373024100002,0

It has been argued that 'Big Data' will provide the necessary catalyst to advance both biomedical research and health economics and outcomes research. However, it is important that we do not succumb to being data rich but information poor. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of building Big Data, analysing Big Data and making appropriate inferences in order to advance cancer care, using Cancer 2015 (a prospective, longitudinal, genomic cohort study in Victoria, Australia) as a case study. Cancer 2015 has been linked to State and Commonwealth reimbursement databases that have known limitations. This partly reflects the funding arrangements in Australia, a country with both public and private provision, including public funding of private healthcare, and partly the legislative frameworks that govern data linkage. Additionally, linkage is not without time delays and, as such, achieving a contemporaneous database is challenging. Despite these limitations, there is clear value in using linked data and creating Big Data. This paper describes the linked Cancer 2015 dataset, discusses estimation issues given the nature of the data and presents panel regression results that allow us to make possible inferences regarding which patient, disease, genomic and treatment characteristics explain variation in health expenditure.","[Lorgelly, Paula K.; Doble, Brett; Knott, Rachel J.] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Lorgelly, PK (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",paula.lorgelly@monash.edu,"Lorgelly, Paula K/B-5400-2012; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; McNeil, John/L-6440-2019; Fox, Stephen/G-9719-2016","McNeil, John/0000-0002-1049-5129; Knott, Rachel/0000-0001-5715-0139; Doble, Brett/0000-0002-4948-8831; Dobrovic, Alexander/0000-0003-3414-112X; Lorgelly, Paula/0000-0002-8990-9514; Thomas, David/0000-0002-2527-5428; John, Thomas/0000-0003-3399-5342; Fox, Stephen/0000-0002-7648-8896; James, Paul/0000-0002-4361-4657",,,,,31,10,11,1,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2016,34,2,,,,,139,154,,10.1007/s40273-015-0343-2,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DE7UU,26547307.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370843000007,0

The relationship between substitution of consumption and risk aversion is highlighted, and clarified by the introduction of this type of preferences. We illustrate how recursive utility can be used to explain the empirical consumption puzzle for aggregates. This indicates a plausible choice for the parameters of the utility function, relevant for the consumer in the life cycle model. Optimal life insurance is considered, as well as the portfolio choice problem related to optimal exposures in risky securities. A major finding is that it is optimal for the typical insurance buyer to smooth adverse shocks to the financial market, unlike what is implied by the conventional model.

The motivation of this study hinges on the growing popularity of the use of Twitter and the increasing prevalence of its influence among the financial investment community. This paper presents empirical evidence of the existence of a financial community on Twitter in which users' interests align with financial market-related topics. We establish a methodology to identify relevant Twitter users who form the financial community, and we also present the empirical findings of network characteristics of the financial community. We observe that this financial community behaves similarly to a small-world network, and we further identify groups of critical nodes and analyse their influence within the financial community based on several network centrality measures. Using a novel sentiment analysis algorithm, we construct a weighted sentiment measure using tweet messages from these critical nodes, and we discover that it is significantly correlated with the returns of the major financial market indices. By forming a financial community within the Twitter universe, we argue that the influential Twitter users within the financial community provide a proxy for the relationship between social sentiment and financial market movement. Hence, we conclude that the weighted sentiment constructed from these critical nodes within the financial community provides a more robust predictor of financial markets than the general social sentiment.","[Yang, Steve Y.; Mo, Sheung Yin Kevin; Liu, Anqi] Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn Div, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA",Stevens Institute of Technology,"Yang, SY (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn Div, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",syang14@stevens.edu,,"Liu, Anqi/0000-0002-9224-084X",,,,,30,61,75,0,83,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Because the number of factor loading parameters goes to infinity as the sample size grows, conventional tests cannot be used. Based on the fact that the presence of a structural change in factor loadings yields a structural change in second moments of factors obtained from the full sample principal component estimation, we reduce the infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one and our statistic compares the pre- and postbreak subsample second moments of estimated factors.

We apply exponential tilts to (i) the distribution of the natural sufficient statistics of the systematic risk factors and (ii) conditional default probabilities, given the simulated values of the systematic risk factors, and select parameter values by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the resulting parametric family from the ideal (zero-variance) importance density. Optimal parameter values are shown to satisfy intuitive moment-matching conditions, and the asymptotic behaviour of large portfolios is used to approximate the requisite moments. In a sense we generalize the algorithm of Glasserman and Li (2005) so that it can be applied in a wider variety of models. We show how to implement our algorithm in the t copula model and compare its performance there to the algorithm developed by Chan and Kroese (2010). We find that our algorithm requires substantially less computational time (especially for large portfolios) but is slightly less accurate. Our algorithm can also be used to estimate more general risk measures, such as conditional tail expectations, whereas Chan and Kroese (2010) is specifically designed to estimate loss probabilities.

For non-balanced games however, the core is empty, and other solution concepts have to be found. We propose the use of general solutions, that is, to distribute the total worth of the game among groups rather than among individuals. In particular, the -additive core proposed by Grabisch and Miranda is a general solution preserving coalitional rationality which distributes among coalitions of size at most , and is never empty for . The extended core of Bejan and Gomez can also be viewed as a general solution, since it implies to give an amount to the grand coalition. The -additive core being an unbounded set and therefore difficult to use in practice, we propose a subset of it called the minimal negotiation set. The idea is to select elements of the -additive core mimimizing the total amount given to coalitions of size greater than 1. Thus the minimum negotiation set naturally reduces to the core for balanced games. We study this set, giving properties and axiomatizations, as well as its relation to the extended core of Bejan and Gomez. We give a method of computing the minimum bargaining set, and lastly indicate how to eventually get classical solutions from general ones.","[Gonzalez, Stephane; Grabisch, Michel] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75013 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Gonzalez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112,Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",Stephane.Gonzalez@univ-paris1.fr; michel.grabisch@univ-paris1.fr,,"Gonzalez, Stephane/0000-0002-3433-4274",,,,,13,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The medical history of the sample subjects was segmented into different glycemic stages via diagnosis codes, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c or fasting plasma glucose laboratory results, and use of antidiabetic drugs. Healthcare resource utilization captured by the claims and associated costs (in 2013 values) were examined for each glycemic stage. The association between costs and body mass index (BMI) was estimated by regressions, and adjusted for sociodemographics. We predicted the adjusted incremental annual costs associated with high BMI, relative to normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). We identified 48,344 adults in normal glycemic stage, 3,085 in the PreD stage, and 9,526 in the T2D stage (mean age 46, 58, and 60 years, respectively; mean BMI 29, 32, and 33 kg/m(2), respectively). The adjusted incremental annual costs associated with high BMI relative to normal BMI ranged from $336 for overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) to $1,850 for class III obesity (a parts per thousand yen40 kg/m(2)) during normal glycemic stage; were only significant for class III ($2,434) during the PreD stage; and ranged from $1,139 for overweight to $4,649 for class III during the T2D stage (all p < 0.05). Positive associations between healthcare costs and BMI levels were observed within each glycemic stage. Management of body weight is important in reducing the overall healthcare costs, especially for subjects with PreD or T2D.","[Li, Qian; Blume, Steven W.] Evidera, Retrospect Observat Studies, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Huang, Joanna C.; Hammer, Mette] Novo Nordisk Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Graf, Thomas R.] Geisinger Hlth Syst, Populat Hlth, Danville, PA USA",Evidera; Novo Nordisk; Geisinger Health System,"Li, Q (通讯作者)，Evidera, Retrospect Observat Studies, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",qian.li@evidera.com,,,,,,,36,25,25,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2015,33,7,,,,,735,748,,10.1007/s40273-014-0248-5,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CL6EN,25564434.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357060500011,0

This study refits the UKPDS 68 event equations, using contemporary data describing low- and intermediate-risk patients. Research Design and Methods Anonymized patient data describing demographics, risk factors and incidence of cardiovascular and microvascular events were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database over the 10-year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009. Following multiple imputation of missing values, accelerated failure-time Weibull regression equations were refitted to produce new coefficients for each risk group. Discriminatory performance was assessed and compared with both UKPDS 68 and UKPDS 82 risk equations, and the implication of coefficient choice within an economic evaluation was assessed using the Cardiff type 2 diabetes model. Results When applied to patient-level data, the three sets of coefficients (UKPDS, THIN low-risk and intermediate-risk) lead to fairly consistent predictions of the 5-year risk of events. Exceptions include lower predicted rates of myocardial infarction and higher rates of ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease with both sets of revised THIN coefficients compared with UKPDS. Over a modelled lifetime, the coefficients derived from the low-risk data predict fewer total cardiovascular events compared with UKPDS, while those from the intermediate-risk data predict a greater number. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves demonstrated a marginal improvement in the discriminatory performance of the refitted equations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with dapagliflozin versus sulphonylurea in addition to metformin changed from 7,708 pound to 7,519 pound and 6,906 pound per QALY gained, using the THIN intermediate- and low-risk coefficients, respectively. Conclusion The results suggest that while the UKPDS equations perform best in newly diagnosed patients, they may overpredict the lifetime risk in this group and underpredict it in patients with more advanced diabetes. Implementation of the revised coefficients will result in different absolute numbers of predicted diabetes-related events; however, they are not expected to significantly affect the conclusions of economic modelling.","[McEwan, P.] Swansea Univ, Swansea Ctr Hlth Econ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [McEwan, P.; Bennett, H.; Ward, T.] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Monmouth NP25 5JA, England; [Bergenheim, K.] AstraZeneca, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Molndal, Sweden",Swansea University; AstraZeneca,"Bennett, H (通讯作者)，Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Singleton Court Business Pk,Wonastow Rd, Monmouth NP25 5JA, England.",hayley.bennettwilton@heor.co.uk,,,AstraZeneca plc; Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,AstraZeneca plc(AstraZeneca); Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,This study and the writing of the manuscript were sponsored by an unrestricted grant from AstraZeneca plc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,,47,21,23,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2015,33,2,,,,,149,161,,10.1007/s40273-014-0225-z,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AZ7FJ,25344660.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348384300007,0

Themodel contains a credit market with biometric risk, and market risk via risky securities. This idealized framework enables us to clarify important aspects of life insurance and pension contracts. We find optimal pension plans and life insurance contracts where the benefits are state dependent. We compare these solutions both to the ones of standard actuarial theory, and to policies offered in practice. Implications of this include what role the insurance industry may play to improve welfare. The relationship between substitution of consumption and risk aversion is highlighted in the presence of a consumption puzzle. One problem related portfolio choice is discussed the horizon problem.

We argue that aggregate durable expenditures respond more sluggishly to economic shocks during recessions because microeconomic frictions lead to declines in the frequency of households' durable adjustment. We show this by first using indirect inference to estimate a heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model with fixed costs of durable adjustment to match consumption dynamics in PSID microdata. We then show that aggregating this model delivers an extremely procyclical Impulse Response Function (IRF) of durable spending to aggregate shocks. For example, the response of durable spending to an income shock in 1999 is estimated to be almost twice as large as if it occurred in 2009. This procyclical IRF holds in response to standard business cycle shocks as well as in response to various policy shocks, and it is robust to general equilibrium. After estimating this robust theoretical implication of micro frictions, we provide additional direct empirical evidence for its importance using both cross-sectional and time-series data.","[Berger, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Vavra, Joseph] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Vavra, Joseph] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Berger, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2003 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",david.berger@northwestern.edu; joseph.vavra@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,37,53,81,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2015,83,1,,,,,101,154,,10.3982/ECTA11254,0.0,,,54,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CB9PB,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349962900005,0

This article presents a predictive model for fraud and abuse detection in health insurance based on a training dataset of manually reviewed claims. The goal of the analysis is to predict different fraud and abuse probabilities for new invoices. The prediction is based on a wide framework of fraud and abuse reports which examine the behavior of medical providers and insured members by measuring systematic deviation from usual patterns in medical claims data. We show that models which directly use the results of the reports as model covariates do not exploit the full potential in terms of predictive quality. Instead, we propose a multinomial Bayesian latent variable model which summarizes behavioral patterns in latent variables, and predicts different fraud and abuse probabilities. The estimation of model parameters is based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm using Bayesian shrinkage techniques. The presented approach improves the identification of fraudulent and abusive claims compared to different benchmark approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We assume the insurer can purchase proportional reinsurance and invest its wealth in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky asset, where the dynamics of the latter is assumed to be correlated with the insurance surplus. By solving the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation via a dual argument, an explicit expression for the optimal reinsurance-investment strategy is obtained. We find that the optimal strategy of objective (1) (objective (2) resp.) is always more aggressive (conservative resp.) than the strategy of minimizing the infinite-time ruin probability of Promislow and Young (2005). Due to the presence of the time factor ex, the optimal strategy under objective (1) or (2) may lead to more aggressive positions as the wealth level increases, a behavior which may be more consistent with industry practices.

Previous reviews have consistently found substantial variations in the costs of OA across studies and countries. The comparability between studies was poor and limited the detection of the true differences between these studies. Objective To review large sample studies on measuring the economic and/or humanistic burden of OA published since May 2006. Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases using comprehensive search strategies to identify studies reporting economic burden and HRQoL of OA. We included large sample studies if they had a sample size >= 1000 and measured the cost and/or HRQoL of OA. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate, performing a cross-check between groups to verify agreement. Within-and between-group consolidation was performed to resolve discrepancies, with outstanding discrepancies being resolved by an arbitrator. The Kappa statistic was reported to assess the agreement between the reviewers. All costs were adjusted in their original currency to year 2015 using published inflation rates for the country where the study was conducted, and then converted to 2015 US dollars. Results A total of 651 articles were screened by title and abstract, 94 were reviewed in full text, and 28 were included in the final review. The Kappa value was 0.794. Twenty studies reported direct costs and nine reported indirect costs. The total annual average direct costs varied from US$ 1442 to US$ 21,335, both in USA. The annual average indirect costs ranged from US$ 238 to US$ 29,935. Twelve studies measured HRQoL using various instruments. The Short Form 12 version 2 scores ranged from 35.0 to 51.3 for the physical component, and from 43.5 to 55.0 for the mental component. Health utilities varied from 0.30 for severe OA to 0.77 for mild OA. Conclusion Per-patient OA costs are considerable and a patient's quality of life remains poor. Variations in costing methods are a barrier to understanding the true differences in the costs of OA between studies. Standardizing healthcare resource items, the definition of OA-relevant costs, and productivity loss measures would facilitate the comparison.","[Xie, Feng; Kovic, Bruno; Jin, Xuejing; He, Xiaoning; Wang, Mengxiao; Silvestre, Camila] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Silvestre, Camila] Univ Waterloo, Dept Kinesiol, Waterloo, ON, Canada",McMaster University; University of Waterloo,"Xie, F (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",fengxie@mcmaster.ca,"zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023",,,,,,51,143,153,1,24,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2016,34,11,,,,,1087,1100,,10.1007/s40273-016-0424-x,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EA6RE,27339668.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386755700003,0

Following further screening, 26 were excluded upon full-text review on the basis of no framework presented (n = 13), redundancy (n = 11) or abstract only (n = 2). Frameworks that captured criteria developed for or utilised by the pharmaceutical industry (n = 5) and reimbursement guidance (n = 10) were reviewed. The most commonly identified criteria-unmet need/patient burden, safety, efficacy, quality-of-life outcomes, environment, evidence quality, budget impact and comparator-were incorporated into the summary framework. For ease of communication, the following mnemonic was developed: BEACON (Burden/target population, Environment, Affordability/value, Comparator, Outcomes, Number of studies/quality of evidence). Conclusions The BEACON framework aims to capture the 'essence' of payer requirements by addressing the most commonly described criteria requested by payers regarding the introduction of a new pharmaceutical.","[Dunlop, William C.

A large literature has developed in an attempt to ascertain whether or not the long memory finding in many economic series is spurious. Yet to date, no study has analyzed the consequences of using long memory methods to test for unit roots when the truth derives from regime switching, structural breaks, or other types of mean reverting nonlinearity. In this article, I conduct a comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis to investigate the consequences of using tests designed to have power against fractional integration when the actual data generating process is unknown. I additionally consider the use of tests designed to have power against breaks and threshold nonlinearity. The findings are compelling and demonstrate that the use of long memory as an approximation to nonlinearity yields tests with relatively high power. In contrast, misspecification has severe consequences for tests designed to have power against threshold nonlinearity, and especially for tests designed to have power against breaks.","[Smallwood, Aaron D.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Smallwood, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Econ, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",smallwood@uta.edu,,,,,,,32,6,6,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Portfolio transitions can be viewed as natural experiments for measuring transaction costs, and individual orders can be treated as proxies for bets. Empirical tests based on a data set of 400,000+ portfolio transition orders support the invariance hypotheses.

Surrender charges are important in practice and are imposed as a way of discouraging early termination of variable annuity contracts. We formulate the valuation framework and focus on the surrender option as an American put option pricing problem and derive the corresponding pricing partial differential equation by using hedging arguments and Ito's Lemma. Given the underlying stochastic evolution of the fund, we also present the associated transition density partial differential equation allowing us to develop solutions. An explicit integral expression for the pricing partial differential equation is then presented with the aid of Duhamel's principle. Our analysis is relevant to risk management applications since we derive an expression of the delta for the sensitivity analysis of the guarantee fees with respect to changes in the underlying fund value. We provide algorithms for implementing the integral expressions for the price, the corresponding early exercise boundary and the delta of the surrender option. We quantify and assess the sensitivity of the prices, early exercise boundaries and deltas to changes in the underlying variables including an analysis of the fair insurance fees.

However, their prices have been widely debated. Decision-analytic models can project the long-term value of HCV treatment. Therefore, understanding of the methods used in these models and how they could influence results is important. Our objective was to describe and systematically review the methodological approaches in published cost-effectiveness models of chronic HCV treatment with DAAs. We searched several electronic databases, including Medline, Embase and EconLit, from 2011 to 2015. Study selection was performed by two reviewers independently. We included any cost-effectiveness analysis comparing DAAs with the old standard of care for HCV treatment. We excluded non-English-language studies and studies not reporting quality-adjusted life-years. One reviewer collected data and assessed the quality of reporting, using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement. Another reviewer crosschecked the abstracted information. The development methods of the included studies were synthetized on the basis of good modelling practice recommendations. Review of 304 citations revealed 36 cost-effectiveness analyses. The reporting quality scores of most articles were rated as acceptable, between 67 and 100 %. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (50 %), followed by the USA (44 %). Fifty-six percent of the 36 studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of HCV treatment in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, 97 % included genotype 1 patients and 53 % evaluated the cost effectiveness of second-generation or oral DAAs in comparison with the previous standard of care or other DAAs. Twenty-one models defined health states in terms of METAVIR fibrosis scores. Only one study used a discrete-event simulation approach, and the remainder used state-transition models. The time horizons varied; however, 89 % of studies used a lifetime horizon. One study was conducted from a societal perspective. Thirty-three percent of studies did not conduct any model validation. We also noted that none of the studies modelled HCV treatment as a prevention strategy, 86 % of models did not consider the possibility of re-infection with HCV after successful treatment, 97 % of studies did not consider indirect economic benefits resulting from HCV treatment and none of the studies evaluating oral DAAs used real-world data. The search was limited by date (from 1 January 2011 to 8 September 2015) and was also limited to English-language and published reports. Most modelling studies used a similar modelling structure and could have underestimated the value of HCV treatment. Future modelling efforts should consider the benefits of HCV treatment in preventing transmission, extra-hepatic and indirect economic benefits of HCV treatment, real-world cost-effectiveness analysis and cost effectiveness of HCV treatment in low- and middle-income countries.","[Chhatwal, Jagpreet] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Inst Technol Assessment, 101 Merrimac St,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [He, Tianhua] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lopez-Olivo, Maria A.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gen Internal Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Tsinghua University; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Chhatwal, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Inst Technol Assessment, 101 Merrimac St,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",jagchhatwal@mgh.harvard.edu,"Lopez-Olivo, Maria/AAD-6510-2019","Lopez-Olivo, Maria/0000-0002-5165-8393",,,,,65,57,66,0,26,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2016,34,6,,,,,551,567,,10.1007/s40273-015-0373-9,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DM1KS,26748919.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376104800003,0

We develop the theoretical basis for our optimal hedging approach, extending results obtained in our previous work. Specifically, we derive a no-arbitrage option price interval and establish properties of the non-self-financing strategies and their residuals. Based on the theoretical foundation, we develop a computational algorithm for optimizing an investor relevant criterion over the set of admissible non-self-financing hedging strategies.

Rational agents imitate the demands of obstinate behavioral types and engage in brinkmanship in the face of uncertainty about the deadline's arrival. I also identify how surplus is divided when the prior probability of behavioral types is vanishingly small. If behavioral types are committed to fixed demands, outcomes converge to the Nash bargaining solution regardless of agents' respective impatience. If behavioral types can adopt more complex demand strategies, outcomes converge to the solution of an alternating offers game without behavioral types for the deadline environment.","[Fanning, Jack] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B,Robinson Hall,64 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Fanning, J (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B,Robinson Hall,64 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",jack_fanning@brown.edu,,,,,,,33,19,21,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2016,84,3,,,,,1131,1179,,10.3982/ECTA12628,0.0,,,49,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DR8FW,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380134800006,0

Patient-level data from three randomized clinical trials-ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II and GLACIAL-were analysed. Health states were derived from the Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS7); higher scores denote greater activity. The health state score ranges were urticaria free: 0; well-controlled urticaria: 1-6; mild urticaria: 7-15; moderate urticaria: 16-27; and severe urticaria: 28-42. The mean EQ-5D utilities were calculated for each health state. A mixed model was used to predict the EQ-5D according to UAS7 health states in a pooled data set containing all treatment arms and time points from the three trials. Pooled trial data were validated through visual comparisons and interaction terms. Fixed and random effects for trials and patients were included, along with the following covariates: UAS7 health state at baseline (moderate or severe); presence of angioedema at baseline and during follow-up; duration of CSU; number of previous CSU medications; visit; current treatment; and patient age and sex. There was a consistent improvement in EQ-5D utilities as urticaria activity decreased. The mean utilities ranged from 0.710 (severe urticaria) to 0.780 (moderate urticaria), 0.829 (mild urticaria), 0.862 (well-controlled urticaria) and 0.894 (urticaria free). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. The results suggest that EQ-5D utility scores increase with decreasing urticaria activity. EQ-5D utility scores enable the health-related quality of life of CSU patients to be compared with that of patients with other diseases.","[Hawe, Emma; McBride, Doreen] RTI Hlth Solut, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Balp, Maria-Magdalena] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Tian, Haijun] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Halliday, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Frimley, England; [Stull, Donald E.] RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Offices Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Novartis; Research Triangle Institute,"Stull, DE (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Offices Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",dstull@rti.org,,"Stull, Donald/0000-0001-9808-5417; Hawe, Emma/0000-0001-7043-4646",Novartis Pharma AG,Novartis Pharma AG,This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.,,16,12,12,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2016,34,5,,,,,521,527,,10.1007/s40273-015-0375-7,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DJ4HO,26792790.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374166200009,0

To address this relationship, a regime-switching process with an intensity function is adopted in this paper. In addition, the dynamics of both interest rates and asset values are modelled with a Markov-modulated jump-diffusion model, and a 2-factor hazard rate model is also considered. Based on this more suitable model setting, a closed-form model of pricing risky bonds is derived. The difference in yield between a risky bond and risk-free zero coupon bond is used to model a term structure of credit spreads (CSs) from which a closed-form pricing model of a call option on CSs is obtained. In addition, the degree to which the explicit regime shift affects CSs and credit-risky bond prices is numerically examined using three forward-rate functions under various business-cycle patterns.","[Chen, Son-Nan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Adv Inst Finance, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Pao-Peng] Yuanpei Univ, Dept Appl Finance, Coll Management & Language, 306 Yuanpei St, Hsinchu 30015, Taiwan; [Li, Chang-Yi] Xiamen Univ, Dept Finance, Int Coll, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Xiamen University,"Hsu, PP (通讯作者)，Yuanpei Univ, Dept Appl Finance, Coll Management & Language, 306 Yuanpei St, Hsinchu 30015, Taiwan.",penghp@mail.ypu.edu.tw,"Li, Changyi/GVS-6654-2022",,Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-264-004-],"Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China Taiwan [grant number NSC 100-2410-H-264-004-].,,49,2,3,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Based on a measurable objective function, it is shown that the estimated change-point converges weakly to the location of the maxima of a double-sided random walk and other estimated parameters are asymptotically normal. When the magnitude d of changed parameters is small, it is shown that the limiting distribution can be approximated by the known distribution as in Yao (1987, Annals of Statistics 15, 1321-1328). This provides a channel to connect our results with those in Picard (1985, Advances in Applied Probability 17, 841-867) and Bai, Lumsdaine, and Stock (1998, Review of Economic Studies 65, 395-432), where the magnitude of changed parameters depends on the sample size n and tends to zero as n -> infinity. The theory is applied for the self-weighted QMLE and the local QMLE of change-points in ARMA-GARCH/IGARCH models.

Regardless of the great amount of research, some issues are still open to debate. In this vein, this paper focuses on the evolution of the relationship between oil prices and dollar exchange rates of 12 oil exporting and oil importing countries based on a dynamic copula approach. We use daily data for two 5-year periods between 2003 and 2013, taking the collapse of Lehman Brothers as the dividing point. Our results have four main implications: first, the intensity of relationship between oil prices and FX-rates has increased over time even if the peak of the financial crisis is included. Second, the increased tail dependency shows that extreme events are likelier to occur simultaneously for both series. Third, the dependency has become more dynamic after the financial crisis and is therefore better characterized by time-varying copulas. Finally, currencies of oil importers and oil exporters display a different dependency structure against the US dollar in the case of rising oil prices with the latter appreciating and the former depreciating.","[Beckmann, Joscha; Czudaj, Robert] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Essen, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Kiel Inst World Econ, Hindenburgufer 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Berger, Theo] Univ Bremen, Dept Business Adm, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Bremen,"Czudaj, R (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Essen, Germany.",robert.czudaj@uni-due.de,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019; Czudaj, Robert L./I-2286-2019","Czudaj, Robert L./0000-0002-3313-8204",,,,,41,38,39,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In every period, a principal finances a project, choosing the scale of the project and a contingent payment plan for an agent, who has the opportunity to appropriate the returns of a successful project unbeknownst the principal. The absence of commitment is reflected both in the solution concept (perfect Bayesian equilibrium) and in the ability of the principal to freely revise the project's scale from one period to the next. We show that removing commitment from the equilibrium concept is relatively innocuous-if the players are sufficiently patient, there are equilibria with payoffs low enough to effectively endow the players with the requisite commitment, within the confines of perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In contrast, the frictionless choice of scale has a significant effect on the project's dynamics. Starting from the principal's favorite equilibrium, the optimal contract eventually converges to the repetition of the stage-game Nash equilibrium, operating the project at maximum scale and compensating the agent (only) via immediate payments.","[Hoerner, Johannes; Samuelson, Larry] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Samuelson, L (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",johannes.horner@yale.edu; larry.samuelson@yale.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1153893, SES-1459158]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Bruno Biais and Thomas Mariotti for helpful conversations and comments and we thank Yi Chen for valuable research assistance.

The first is adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) of Zou (2006), recently extended by Liao (2013) to possibly invalid moments in GMM. In this method, we select the valid instruments with ALASSO. The second method is based on the J test, as in Andrews and Lu (2001). The third one is using a Continuous Updating Objective (CUE) function. This last approach is based on Hong et al. (2003), who propose a penalized generalized empirical likelihood-based function to pick up valid moments. They use empirical likelihood, and exponential tilting in their simulations. However, the J-test-based approach of Andrews and Lu (2001) provides generally better moment selection results than the empirical likelihood and exponential tilting as can be seen in Hong et al. (2003). In this article, we examine penalized CUE as a third way of selecting valid moments.Following a determination of valid moments, we run unpenalized generalized method of moments (GMM) and CUE and model averaging technique of Okui (2011) to see which one has better postselection estimator performance for structural parameters. The simulations are aimed at the following questions: Which moment selection criterion can better select the valid ones and eliminate the invalid ones? Given the chosen instruments in the first stage, which strategy delivers the best finite sample performance?We find that the ALASSO in the model selection stage, coupled with either unpenalized GMM or moment averaging of Okui delivers generally the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) for the second stage coefficient estimators.","[Caner, Mehmet; Riquelme, Juan Andres] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, 4168 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Maasoumi, Esfandiar] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",North Carolina State University; Emory University,"Caner, M (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, 4168 Nelson Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",mcaner@ncsu.edu,,"Riquelme, Andres/0000-0003-1220-0926",,,,,22,2,2,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The aim of this study was to propose a proof-of-concept method of assessing the generalisability of the clinical and cost-effectiveness findings of a given RCT. We developed a generalisability index (Gix), informed by centre-level characteristics, as a measure of centre and trial representativeness. The centre-level Gix quantifies how representative a centre is in relation to its jurisdiction, e.g. a country or health authority. The trial-level Gix quantifies how representative trial recruitment is in relation to clinical practice in the jurisdiction. Taking a real-world RCT as a case study and assuming trial-wide results to represent 'true jurisdiction values', we used simulation methods to recreate 5000 RCTs and investigate the relationship between trial representativeness, reflected by the standardised trial-Gix, and the deviation of simulated trial results from the 'true values'. The simulation study provides evidence that trial results (odds ratio for the primary outcome and incremental quality-adjusted life-years) were influenced by the representativeness of the sample of recruiting centres. Simulated RCTs with the closest results to the 'true values' were those whose recruitment closely mirrored the jurisdiction-wide context. Results appeared robust to six alternative specifications of the Gix. Our findings suggest that an unrepresentative selection of centres limits the external validity of trial results. The Gix may be a valuable tool to help facilitate rational selection of trial centres and ensure the generalisability of results at the jurisdiction level.","[Gheorghe, Adrian; Calvert, Melanie] Univ Birmingham, Primary Care Clin Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Gheorghe, Adrian; Calvert, Melanie] Univ Birmingham, MRC Midlands Hub Trials Methodol Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Roberts, Tracy] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Hemming, Karla] Univ Birmingham, Publ Hlth Epidemiol & Stat, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Gheorghe, Adrian] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Gheorghe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Primary Care Clin Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",adrian.e.gheorghe@gmail.com,"Calvert, Melanie/F-7055-2011; Hemming, karla/AAB-3391-2021; Roberts, Tracy/AAO-4610-2021","Hemming, karla/0000-0002-2226-6550; Roberts, Tracy/0000-0002-0624-0537; Calvert, Melanie/0000-0002-1856-837X","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); MRC Midland Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK (MRC) [G0800808]; MRC [G0800808] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0800808] Funding Source: researchfish","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC Midland Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","Financial support for this study was provided in part by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research Support Facility PhD Studentship for Adrian Gheorghe, and in part by a grant from the MRC Midland Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK (MRC Grant ID G0800808) for Melanie Calvert.

An optimal portfolio decomposes as a constant mix of a few preference-free funds, which are common to all investors. The weight in each fund is a constant that may depend on an investor's risk aversion, but not on the state variable, which changes over time. Vice versa, the composition of each fund may depend on the state, but not on the risk aversion, since a fund appears in the portfolios of different investors. We prove these results for two classes of models with a single state variable, and several assets with constant correlations with the state. In the linear class, the state is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, risk premia are affine in the state, while volatilities and the interest rate are constant. In the square root class, the state follows a square root diffusion, expected returns and the interest rate are affine in the state, while volatilities are linear in the square root of the state.","[Guasoni, Paolo] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Guasoni, Paolo] Dublin City Univ, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Robertson, Scott] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Boston University; Dublin City University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Guasoni, P (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Math & Stat, 111 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",guasoni@bu.edu,"Guasoni, Paolo/J-3464-2013; Robertson, Scott/L-3926-2016","Guasoni, Paolo/0000-0002-8562-3658; Robertson, Scott/0000-0003-4258-6508","ERC [278295]; NSF [DMS-0807994, DMS-1109047]; SFI [07/MI/008, 07/SK/M1189, 08/SRC/FMC1389]; FP7 [RG-248896]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1109047] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) [07/SK/M1189] Funding Source: Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)",ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); SFI(Science Foundation Ireland); FP7; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland),"This study was partially supported by the ERC (278295), NSF (DMS-0807994, DMS-1109047), SFI (07/MI/008, 07/SK/M1189, 08/SRC/FMC1389), and FP7 (RG-248896).

We consider the case where firms use a distortion risk measure (also called dual utility) to evaluate risk. The paper first characterizes all Pareto optimal redistributions.

In this model, it is usually supposed that a portfolio is at risk for a time period of length t. The occurrences of the claims are governed by a Poisson process of intensity mu so that the number of claims in [0, t] is a Poisson random variable with parameter lambda = mu t. Each single claim is an independent replication of the random variable X, representing the claim severity. The aggregate claim or total claim amount process in [0, t] is represented by the random sum of N independent replications of X, whose cumulative distribution function (cdf) is the object of study. Due to its computational complexity, several approximation methods for this cdf have been proposed. In this paper, we consider 15 approximations put forward in the literature that only use information on the lower order moments of the involved distributions. For each approximation, we consider the difference between the true distribution and the approximating one and we propose to use expansions of this difference related to Edgeworth series to measure their accuracy as lambda = mu t diverges to infinity. Using these expansions, several statements concerning the quality of approximations for the distribution of the aggregate claim process can find theoretical support. Other statements can be disproved on the same grounds. Finally, we investigate numerically the accuracy of the proposed formulas.","[Seri, Raffaello] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Econ, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Choirat, Christine] IQSS Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Insubria,"Seri, R (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",raffaello.seri@uninsubria.it; cchoirat@iq.harvard.edu,"Seri, Raffaello/C-5121-2012; Seri, Raffaello/AAC-7792-2021","Seri, Raffaello/0000-0003-1646-3547; Seri, Raffaello/0000-0003-1646-3547; Choirat, Christine/0000-0002-3745-9718",,,,,58,8,10,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2015,45,3,,,,,601,637,,10.1017/asb.2015.7,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CP5UC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359949100005,0

To build the proposed model we investigate to what extent a common age effect can be found among the mortality experiences of several countries and use a common principal component analysis to estimate a common age effect in an age period model for multiple populations. The fit of the proposed model is then compared to age period models fitted to each country individually, and to the fit of the model proposed by Li and Lee (2005). Although we do not consider stochastic mortality projections in this paper, we argue that the proposed. common age effect model can be extended to a stochastic mortality model for multiple populations, which allows to generate mortality scenarios simultaneously for all considered populations. This is particularly relevant when mortality derivatives are used to hedge the longevity risk in an annuity portfolio as this often means that the underlying population for the derivatives is not the same as the population in the annuity portfolio.

The numerical examples demonstrate that these hedging costs have a significant impact on the hedging decision. The hedge ratio (total pension cost) decreases (increases) with the transaction cost, the counter-party default probability and the underfunding ratio.

The AAI concerns about model uncertainty and seeks for an optimal robust decision. We consider a Brownian motion with drift for the surplus of the AAI who invests in a risky asset following a multiscale stochastic volatility (SV) model. We formulate the robust optimal investment and reinsurance problem for a general class of utility functions under a general SV model. Applying perturbation techniques to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation associated with our problem, we derive an investment-reinsurance strategy that well approximates the optimal strategy of the robust optimization problem under a multiscale SV model.

We investigate the asymmetric property of the value by focusing on the invariance of payoff after the change in the worths of singleton coalitions. We show that if the worths change by the same amount, then the Shapley value is invariant. On the other hand, if the worths change with multiplying by a positive weight, then the weighted Shapley value with the positive weight is invariant. Based on the invariance, we formulate a new axiom, -Weak Addition Invariance. We prove that the weighted Shapley value is the unique solution function which satisfies -Weak Addition Invariance and Dummy Player Property. In the proof, we introduce a new basis of the set of all games. The basis has two properties. First, when we express a game by a linear combination of the basis, coefficients coincide with the weighted Shapley value. Second, the basis induces the null space of the weighted Shapley value. By generalizing the new axiomatization, we also axiomatize the family of weighted Shapley values.","Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Yokote, K (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",sidehand@toki.waseda.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14J03362] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,16,11,11,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

I show that the risky asset share exhibits cyclical behavior and it is significantly (and positively) affected by unexpected variation in wealth. Therefore, the empirical evidence suggests that risk aversion is counter-cyclical. I also find that the portfolio share of housing wealth falls when the agent is faced with a positive wealth shock, i.e. housing is a hedge against unfavorable wealth fluctuations. Finally, considering a variety of wealth definitions, the results show that: (i) wealth effects are stronger for direct holdings of risky assets than for indirect holdings, which highlights that investors do not typically trade some assets such as pension or mutual funds; (ii) although significant, wealth effects on asset allocation are mainly temporary as agents quickly rebalance the asset portfolio composition (i.e. there is weak evidence of inertia or slow adjustment in asset allocation); and (iii) changes in expected returns partially explain the variation in risky asset allocation.","[Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] London Sch Econ, FMG, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universidade do Minho; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sousa, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, Braga, Portugal.",rjsousa@alumni.lse.ac.uk,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/12985/2003]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/12985/2003] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"I am extremely grateful to Alexander Michaelides and Christian Julliard for helpful comments and discussions.

Then, a more general formulation of the above scaling properties allows to extend the model to the afternoon trading session. We finally outline an application in which conditioned forecasting is used to implement a trend-following trading strategy capable of exploiting linear correlations present in the S&P data-set and absent in the model. Trading signals are model based and not derived from chartist criteria. In-sample and out-of-sample tests indicate that the model-based trading strategy performs better than a benchmark one established on an asymmetric GARCH process, and show the existence of small arbitrage opportunities. We remark that in the absence of linear correlations the trading profit would vanish and discuss why the trading strategy is potentially interesting to hedge volatility risk for S&P index-based products.","[Baldovin, F.; Camana, F.; Caraglio, M.; Stella, A.

The seeds were packed in aluminum foil and stored at room temperature and 15, 4 and -4 degrees C compared with seal plastic bag condition kept at room temperature. The seed was sampling and tested the qualities before and each month after storage for 12 months. The result found that hemp varieties, storage conditions, time and the interaction between them had significant affect on hemp seed qualities. Before storage, the seed moisture content (mc) of cv. RPF 1, RPF 2, RPF 3 and RPF 4 were 7.7, 8.62, 6.52 and 7.68%, respectively and the germinations were 92, 85, 90 and 91%. During storage, the mc of seed stored in plastic bag was varies due to seed moisture equilibrium. The germination and vigor of seed cv. RPF 1, RPF 3 and RPF 4 packed in both materials type at room temperature was unchanged during 6 months storage, while the seed contained in plastic bag showed the most adverse effect on decrease of viability. During first 3 months, the conditions also significantly affected on decline of germination and vigor of hemp seed cv. RPF 2 which decline to be lesser than 30% during 8 - 12 months. The change of germination and vigor of hemp seed cv. RPF 1, RPF 3 and RPF 4 stored at 15, 4 and - 4 degrees C were not significantly difference during a year of storage.

These results are then used to develop an econometric framework for the forensic analysis of fire sales episodes, using observations of market prices. We give conditions for the identifiability of model parameters from time series of asset prices, propose a statistical test for the presence of fire sales, and an estimator for the magnitude of fire sales in each asset class. Pathwise consistency and large sample properties of the estimator are studied in the high-frequency asymptotic regime.

As a special case we consider the normal, Student-t and Laplace distributions, important and popular in actuarial science and finance. The motivation behind taking the multivariate TCE for the elliptical family comes from the fact that unlike the traditional tail conditional expectation, the MTCE measure takes into account the covariation between dependent risks, which is the case when we are dealing with real data of losses.

Along the way it is shown that the sum of a Sprig and its negative is equivalent to 0 in the universe of misSre-play dicots, answering a question of Allen.","[McKay, Neil A.; Milley, Rebecca; Nowakowski, Richard J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Nowakowski, RJ (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS, Canada.",rjn@mathstat.dal.ca,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was partially supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,10,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

His solution consists in representing games in effectiveness form, which explicitly describes the set of possible outcomes that each coalition can enforce by a unilateral deviation from each proposed outcome. The present paper detects some non-appropriateness of the effectiveness representation with respect to the stability of outcomes against coalitional deviations. In order to correct such inadequacies, we propose a new model, called deviation function form. The novelty is that, besides providing a detailed description of an outcome, the model captures new kinds of coalitional interactions that support the agreements proposed by deviating coalitions and that cannot be identified via the effectiveness form. Furthermore, it can be used to model the existent matching markets. Its formulation allows defining a new solution concept, which characterizes the cooperative equilibria and extends the stability concept of the existent matching models. The connection between the core and the cooperative equilibrium concepts is established.","[Sotomayor, Marilda] Grad Sch Econ FGV, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Sotomayor, Marilda] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Sotomayor, M (通讯作者)，Grad Sch Econ FGV, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;Sotomayor, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",marildas@usp.br,,,CNPq-Brazil,CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"M.

This paper aims to provide a practical guide to costing approaches across a wide range of care inputs and illness consequences relevant to the treatment of mental health. The resources needed to deliver mental health interventions are highly variable and depend on treatment settings (institutional, community), treatment providers (medical, non-medical) and formats (individual, group, electronic). Establishing the most appropriate perspective is crucial when assessing the costs associated with a particular mental health problem or when evaluating interventions to treat them. We identify five key cost categories (social care, informal care, production losses, crime and education) impacted by mental health and discuss contemporary issues in resource use measurement and valuation, including data sources and resource use instruments.","[Shearer, James; McCrone, Paul; Romeo, Renee] Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Shearer, James; McCrone, Paul; Romeo, Renee] Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London,"McCrone, P (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England.;McCrone, P (通讯作者)，Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.",paul.mccrone@kcl.ac.uk,/E-3261-2010,"/0000-0003-3871-9697; McCrone, Paul/0000-0001-7001-4502; Shearer, James/0000-0002-1658-9767",,,,,96,15,15,1,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2016,34,7,,,,,651,664,,10.1007/s40273-016-0390-3,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DO7CT,26922076.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377940500005,0

We show that the time-consistent strategy is identical to the optimal open-loop strategy. Also, under the exponential utility preference, we develop the optimal strategy for multi-period investment, which is time-consistent. We show that the above two time-consistent strategies are equivalent in some cases. We compare the pre-commitment and time-consistent strategies under different situations with some numerical simulations.

It extends the Hodges and Neuberger [Rev. Futures Markets, 1989, 8, 222-239] framework in two ways. First, to reduce the occurrence of extreme losses, the expected utility is replaced by the conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) coherent risk measure as the objective function. Second, the normality assumption for the underlying asset returns is relaxed: general distributions are considered to improve the realism of the model and to be consistent with fat tails observed empirically. Dynamic programming is used to solve the hedging problem. The CVaR minimization objective is shown to be part of a time-consistent framework. Simulations with parameters estimated from the S&P 500 financial time series show the superiority of the proposed hedging method over multiple benchmarks from the literature in terms of tail risk reduction.","[Godin, F.] HEC Montreal, Dept Management Sci, 3000 Cote Ste Catherine Rd, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Godin, F (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Management Sci, 3000 Cote Ste Catherine Rd, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",frederic.godin@hec.ca,"Godin, Frédéric/HKE-8203-2023",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [BESC D3],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [BESC D3].,,34,13,13,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Employing a panel data set across 262 prefectures and exploring the variations in the quotas on the entry-level exam candidates, we find that higher quotas per capita were associated with a higher probability of revolution participation after the abolition and a higher incidence of uprisings in 1911 that marked the end of the 2,000 years of imperial rule. This finding is robust to various checks including using the number of small rivers and short-run exam performance before the quota system as instruments. The patterns in the data appear most consistent with the interpretation that in regions with higher quotas per capita under the exam system, more would-be elites were negatively affected by the abolition. In addition, we document that modern human capital in the form of those studying in Japan also contributed to the revolution and that social capital strengthened the effect of quotas on revolution participation.","[Bai, Ying] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Esther Lee Bldg, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jia, Ruixue] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92122 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Bai, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Esther Lee Bldg, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Jia, RX (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92122 USA.",ybai@cuhk.edu.hk; rxjia@ucsd.edu,,"Jia, Ruixue/0000-0002-4381-4640",Canadian Institute for Advanced Research,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)),"We are grateful to Daron Acemoglu, anonymous referees, Philippe Aghion, Hoyt Bleakley, Ethan Bueno de Mesquita, Davide Cantoni, Heng Chen, Julie Cullen, Gordon Dahl, Georgy Egorov, Joseph Esherick, Roger Gordon, Avner Greif, Gordon Hanson, James Kung, Shuo Liu, Helene Lundqvist, Xue Meng, Torsten Persson, Nancy Qian, Marit Rehavi, James Robinson, Gerard Roland, Guido Tabellini, Alan Taylor, Joachim Voth, Noam Yuchtman, Fabrizio Zilibotti, and seminar/workshop participants at the All-UC economic history conference, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum, BREAD pre-conference, CIFAR, NBER, NEUDC, Northwestern University, Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, Tsinghua-UCSD conference, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UCLA, UC Merced, University of Chicago, University of Hong Kong, and University of Zurich for their helpful discussions.

In the noiseless case, this process is governed by the standard (deterministic) replicator dynamics; in the presence of noise however, the induced stochastic dynamics are different from previous versions of the stochastic replicator dynamics (such as the aggregate-shocks model of Fudenberg and Harris in J Econ Theory 57(2):420-441, 1992). In this context, we show that strict equilibria are always stochastically asymptotically stable, irrespective of the magnitude of the shocks; on the other hand, in the high-noise regime, non-equilibrium states may also become stochastically asymptotically stable and dominated strategies may survive in perpetuity (they become extinct if the noise is low). Such behavior is eliminated if players are less myopic and revise their strategies based on their cumulative payoffs. In this case, we obtain a second order stochastic dynamical system where non-equilibrium states are no longer attracting and dominated strategies become extinct (a.s.), no matter the noise level.","[Mertikopoulos, Panayotis] CNRS, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Mertikopoulos, Panayotis] Univ Grenoble Alpes LIG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Viossat, Yannick] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, PSL, UMR7534, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI),"Mertikopoulos, P (通讯作者)，CNRS, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, F-38000 Grenoble, France.;Mertikopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes LIG, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",panayotis.mertikopoulos@imag.fr; viossat@ceremade.dauphine.fr,"Mertikopoulos, Panayotis/KCK-3786-2024","Mertikopoulos, Panayotis/0000-0003-2026-9616",French National Research Agency [GAGA-13-JS01-0004-01]; French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) [PEPS-GATHERING-2014],French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)),Supported in part by the French National Research Agency under Grant No. GAGA-13-JS01-0004-01 and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) under Grant No. PEPS-GATHERING-2014.

In this short comment, I will try and place the need for such a rule (lack of trust and pluralism), potential for adoption (negotiation and power), pros (transparency), and cons (metric failure and loss of institutional memory), within both an historical context and a broader strategic management literature. Ultimately, the adoption of such a rule will depend on its ability to convince the relevant community, via negotiation, that subjective assessments can be appropriately summarized numerically.

Extensive literature on scenario generation methods aims at describing some underlying stochastic processes with the least number of scenarios to overcome the 'curse of dimensionality'. There is, however, an important requirement that is usually overlooked when one departs from the application domain of security pricing: the no-arbitrage condition. We formulate a moment matching model to generate multi-factor scenario trees for stochastic optimization satisfying no-arbitrage restrictions with aminimal number of scenarios and without any distributional assumptions. The resulting global optimization problem is quite general. However, it is non-convex and can grow significantly with the number of risk factors, and we develop convex lower bounding techniques for its solution exploiting the special structure of the problem. Applications to some standard problems from the literature show that this is a robust approach for tree generation. We use it to price a European basket option in complete and incomplete markets.","[Consiglio, Andrea; Carollo, Angelo] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Stat, Palermo, Italy; [Zenios, Stavros A.] Univ Cyprus, Dept Accounting & Finance, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Zenios, Stavros A.] Univ Penn, Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Palermo; University of Cyprus; University of Pennsylvania,"Consiglio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Stat, Palermo, Italy.",andrea.consiglio@unipa.it,"Zenios, Stavros A/F-3346-2013; Consiglio, Andrea/K-2953-2014; Consiglio, Andrea/AFV-1996-2022; Carollo, Angelo/B-1118-2012","Zenios, Stavros A/0000-0001-7576-4898; Carollo, Angelo/0000-0002-4402-2207",,,,,38,24,24,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Loosely speaking, it involves a statistical arbitrage tool for identifying and exploiting the inefficiencies of two long-term, related financial assets. When a significant deviation from this equilibrium is observed, a profit might result. In this paper, we propose a pairs trading strategy entirely based on linear state space models designed for modelling the spread formed with a pair of assets. Once an adequate state space model for the spread is estimated, we use the Kalman filter to calculate conditional probabilities that the spread will return to its long-term mean. The strategy is activated upon large values of these conditional probabilities: the spread is bought or sold accordingly. Two applications with real data from the US and Brazilian markets are offered, and even though they probably rely on limited evidence, they already indicate that a very basic portfolio consisting of a sole spread outperforms some of the main market benchmarks.","[de Moura, Carlos Eduardo; Zubelli, Jorge] Associacao Inst Nacl Matemat Pura & Aplicada IMPA, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Pizzinga, Adrian] Univ Fed Fluminense, Inst Math & Stat, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Pizzinga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Fluminense, Inst Math & Stat, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",adrianhp@est.uff.br,"Zubelli, Jorge P/B-6166-2008; Zubelli, Jorge/GVU-6903-2022; Zubelli, Jorge/AAA-1468-2022","Zubelli, Jorge P/0000-0003-1581-9505; Zubelli, Jorge/0000-0003-1581-9505",,,,,60,18,18,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In 2012, an agreement between government and the pharmaceutical industry that provided substantial savings on existing medications set the threshold at a,not sign45,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). This replaced a previously unofficial threshold of a,not sign20,000/QALY. According to the agreement, drugs within the threshold will be granted reimbursement, whereas those exceeding it may still be approved following further negotiation. A number of drugs far exceeding the threshold have been approved recently. The agreement only applies to pharmaceuticals. There are four reasons for concern regarding Ireland's threshold. The absence of an explicit threshold for non-drug interventions leaves it unclear if there is parity in willingness to pay across all interventions. As the threshold resembles a price floor rather than a ceiling, in principle it only offers a weak barrier to cost-ineffective interventions. It has no empirical basis. Finally, it is probably too high given recent estimates of a threshold for the UK based on the cost effectiveness of services forgone of approximately A 13,000 pound/QALY. An excessive threshold risks causing the Irish health system unintended harm. The lack of an empirically informed threshold means the policy recommendations of cost-effectiveness analysis cannot be considered as fully evidence-based rational rationing. Policy makers should consider these issues and recent Irish legislation that defined cost effectiveness in terms of the opportunity cost of services forgone when choosing what threshold to apply once the current industry agreement expires at the end of 2015.","[O'Mahony, James F.] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Coughlan, Diarmuid] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Trinity College Dublin; Newcastle University - UK,"O'Mahony, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, 2-4 Foster Pl, Dublin 2, Ireland.",jfomahon@tcd.ie,,"O'Mahony, James/0000-0003-3414-7388; Coughlan, Diarmuid/0000-0002-5348-3750",,,,,47,31,31,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2016,34,1,,,,,5,11,,10.1007/s40273-015-0336-1,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DA9XL,26497002.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368163000002,0

The system is trained and tested on depth-of-book data from the BATS and Chi-X exchanges and performance is benchmarked using ensembles of other popular regression algorithms including: linear regression, neural networks and support vector regression. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of RFs produce over 15% greater prediction accuracy on out-of-sample data, for 5 out of 6 timeframes studied, compared with all benchmarks. Feature importance ranking is used to explore the significance of various market features on the price impact, finding them to be highly variable through time.

In DB all risks are borne by the provider, while in plain vanilla DC all risks are borne by the beneficiary. However, for DC to provide income security some kind of guarantee is required. A minimum guarantee clause can be modeled as a put option written on some underlying reference portfolio and we develop a discrete model that selects the reference portfolio to minimize the cost of a guarantee. While the relation DB-DC is typically viewed as a binary one, the model shows how to price a wide range of guarantees creating a continuum between DB and DC. Integrating guarantee pricing with asset allocation decision is useful to both pension fund managers and regulators. The former are given a yardstick to assess if a given asset portfolio is fit-for-purpose; the latter can assess differences of specific reference funds with respect to the optimal one, signaling possible cases of moral hazard. We develop the model and report numerical results to illustrate its uses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is recommended for health technology assessment by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Because the EQ-5D plays such an important role in economic evaluations, useful information on its responsiveness to detect meaningful change in health status is required. This study systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on the responsiveness of the EQ-5D to detect meaningful change in health status for clinical research and economic evaluations. We searched the EuroQol website, PubMed, PsychINFO, and EconLit databases to identify studies published in English from the inception of the EQ-5D until August 15, 2014 using keywords that were related to responsiveness. Studies that used only the EQ-VAS were excluded from the final analysis. Narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize evidence on the responsiveness of the EQ-5D by conditions or physiological functions. Of 1401 studies, 145 were included in the narrative synthesis and categorized into 19 categories for 56 conditions. The EQ-5D was found to be responsive in 25 conditions (45 %) with the magnitude of responsiveness varying from small to large depending on the condition. There was mixed evidence of responsiveness in 27 conditions (48 %). Only four conditions (7 %) (i.e., alcohol dependency, schizophrenia, limb reconstruction, and hearing impairment) were identified where the EQ-5D was not responsive. The EQ-5D is an appropriate measure for economic evaluation and health technology assessment in conditions where it has demonstrated evidence of responsiveness. In conditions with mixed evidence of responsiveness, researchers should consider using the EQ-5D with other condition-specific measures to ensure appropriate estimates of effectiveness. These conditions should be a main focus for future research using the new EQ-5D version with five response levels.","[Payakachat, Nalin; Tilford, J.

In this paper, we take the actuarial long-term view and base our prediction on yearly data from 1872 through 2014. While many authors favor the historical mean or other parametric methods, this article focuses on nonlinear relationships between a set of covariates. A bootstrap test on the true functional form of the conditional expected returns confirms that yearly returns on the S&P500 are predictable. The inclusion of prior knowledge in our nonlinear model shows notable improvement in the prediction of excess stock returns compared to a fully nonparametric model.

However, the direction of the bias is not known a priori. We characterized mathematically the conditions that lead to upward or downward bias. We used a standard three-state disease progression model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention. We solved the model analytically and derived expressions for life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted lifetime costs and incremental net monetary benefits (INMB). An outcome was calculated using the mean of the input under the cohort-based approach and the whole input distribution for all persons under the individual-based approach. We investigated the impact of heterogeneity on outcomes by varying one parameter at a time while keeping all others constant. We evaluated the curvature of outcome functions and used Jensen's inequality to determine the direction of the bias. Both life expectancy and QALYs were underestimated by the cohort-based approach. If there was heterogeneity only in disease progression, total costs were overestimated, whereas QALYs gained, incremental costs and INMB were under- or overestimated, depending on the progression rate. INMB was underestimated when only efficacy was heterogeneous. Both approaches yielded the same outcome when the heterogeneity was only in cost or utilities. A cohort-based approach that does not adjust for heterogeneity underestimates life expectancy and may underestimate or overestimate other outcomes. Characterizing the bias is useful for comparative assessment of models and informing decision making.","[Elbasha, Elamin H.] Merck & Co Inc, Hlth Econ Stat, Merck Res Labs, N Wales, PA 19454 USA; [Chhatwal, Jagpreet] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA",Merck & Company; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Elbasha, EH (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Hlth Econ Stat, Merck Res Labs, UG1C 60,POB 1000, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",elamin_elbasha@merck.com,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2015,33,8,,,,,857,865,,10.1007/s40273-015-0273-z,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CN8FP,25851486.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358675200006,0

Analogous reasoning is then applied to an infinite horizon game to provide equilibrium selection in two-person repeated games with contracts. In this setting, issues about enforcement of threats are much less problematic than in Nash's static setting.

Whether, and to what extent, effective prevention interventions may offer the opportunity to 'bend the curve' of rising healthcare costs is still an object of debate. This study evaluates the potential economic impact of a set of prevention programmes, including education, counselling, long-term drug treatment, regulation (e.g. of advertising or labelling) and fiscal measures, on national healthcare expenditure and use of healthcare services in the USA. The study was carried out as a retrospective evaluation of alternative scenarios compared with a 'business as usual' scenario. An advanced econometric approach involving the use of logistic regression and generalized linear models was used to calculate the number of contacts with key healthcare services (inpatient, outpatient, drug prescriptions) and the associated cost. Analyses were carried out on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (1997-2010). In 2010, prevention interventions had the potential to decrease total healthcare expenditure by up to $US2 billion. This estimate does not include the implementation costs. The largest share of savings is produced by reduced use and costs of inpatient care, followed by reduced use of drugs. Reduction in expenditure for outpatient care would be more limited. Private insurance schemes benefit from the largest savings in absolute terms; however, public insurance schemes benefit from the largest cost reduction per patient. People in the lowest income groups show the largest economic benefits. Prevention interventions aimed at tackling obesity and associated risk factors may produce a significant decrease in the use of healthcare services and expenditure. Savings become substantial when a long-term perspective is taken.","[Cecchini, Michele] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Global Hlth Innovat, London, England; [Cecchini, Michele; Sassi, Franco] OECD, Hlth Div, Paris, France",Imperial College London; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Cecchini, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Global Hlth Innovat, London, England.",michele.cecchini@oecd.org,,"Sassi, Franco/0000-0001-9773-2117",,,,,65,14,16,1,39,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2015,33,7,,,,,765,776,,10.1007/s40273-015-0301-z,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CL6EN,26054326.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357060500013,0

A few two-population mortality models have been proposed to date. They are typically based on the assumption that the forecasted mortality experiences of two or more related populations converge in the long run. This assumption might be justified by the long-term mortality co-integration and thus be applicable to longevity risk modeling. However, it seems too strong to model the short-term mortality dependence. In this paper, we propose a two-stage procedure based on the time series analysis and a factor copula approach to model mortality dependence for multiple populations. In the first stage, we filter the mortality dynamics of each population using an ARMA-GARCH process with heavy-tailed innovations. In the second stage, we model the residual risk using a one-factor copula model that is widely applicable to high dimension data and very flexible in terms of model specification. We then illustrate how to use our mortality model and the maximum entropy approach for mortality risk pricing and hedging. Our model generates par spreads that are very close to the actual spreads of the Vita III mortality bond. We also propose a longevity trend bond and demonstrate how to use this bond to hedge residual longevity risk of an insurer with both annuity and life books of business. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recent advances in the clustering literature allow for fast and efficient computation.

(2012, 2013), in a regime-switching economy. Contrary to their proposed discounted density approach, we adopt the Laplace transform to value the contingent options. By this alternative approach, closed-form expressions for the Laplace transforms of the values of various contingent options, such as call/put options, lookback options, barrier options, dynamic fund protection and the dynamic withdrawal benefits, have been obtained. The value of each contingent option can then be recovered by the numerical Laplace inversion algorithm, and this efficient approach is documented by several numerical illustrations. The strength of our methodology becomes apparent when we tackle the valuations of exotic contingent options in the cases when (1) the contracts have a finite expiry date; (2) when the time-until-death variable is uniformly distributed in accordance with De Moivre's law.","[Siu, Chi Chung] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Business, Finance Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Yam, Sheung Chi Phillip] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hailiang] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Technology Sydney; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Yang, HL (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hlyang@hku.hk,,"Yam, Sheung Chi Phillip/0000-0002-4380-0919","Quantitative Finance Research Center (QFRC) at the University of Technology, Sydney; Hong Kong RGC GRF [404012]; Chinese University of Hong Kong Direct Grant [2060444]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKU 705313P]; Society of Actuaries' Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant","Quantitative Finance Research Center (QFRC) at the University of Technology, Sydney; Hong Kong RGC GRF(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Chinese University of Hong Kong Direct Grant(Chinese University of Hong Kong); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Society of Actuaries' Centers of Actuarial Excellence Research Grant","The authors appreciate the editor and two anonymous referees for the detailed comments.

We derive the analytical solution for the optimal relativities under a financial equilibrium constraint. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called effectiveness of transition rules to compare the different specifications of transition rules.

We focus primarily on reverse stress testing - finding the most likely scenarios leading to losses exceeding a given threshold. We approach this problem using a nonparametric empirical likelihood estimator of the conditional mean of the underlying market factors given large losses. We then scale confidence regions for the conditional mean by a coefficient that depends on the tails of the market factors to estimate the most likely loss scenarios. We provide rigorous justification for the confidence regions and the scaling procedure when the joint distribution of the market factors and portfolio loss is elliptically contoured. We explicitly characterize the impact of the heaviness of the tails of the distribution, contrasting a broad spectrum of cases including exponential tails and regularly varying tails. The key to this analysis lies in the asymptotics of the conditional variances and covariances in extremes. These results also lead to asymptotics for marginal expected shortfall and the corresponding variance, conditional on a market stress; we combine these results with empirical likelihood significance tests of systemic risk rankings based on marginal expected shortfall in stress scenarios.","[Glasserman, Paul] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA; [Kang, Chulmin] Natl Inst Math Sci, Taejon, South Korea; [Kang, Wanmo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Columbia University; National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (NIMS), Republic of Korea; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST)","Kang, W (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",wanmo.kang@kaist.edu,"Kang, Wanmo/C-1670-2011",,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST) [2009-0068043],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST)(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government)","The authors thank Mark Flood, Matthew Pritsker and Til Schuermann for their comments and suggestions.

The relevance of including health-related productivity costs (or benefits) in these evaluations is increasingly recognized and, as such, reliable and valid instruments to quantify productivity costs are needed. Over the years, a number of work productivity instruments have emerged in the literature, along with a growing body of psychometric evidence. The overall aim of this paper is to provide a review of available instruments with potential for estimating health-related productivity costs. This included the Health and Labor Questionnaire, Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, Health-Related Productivity Questionnaire Diary, Productivity and Disease Questionnaire, Quantity and Quality method, Stanford Presenteeism Scale 13, Valuation of Lost Productivity, Work and Health Interview, Work Limitations Questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire, and Work Productivity Short Inventory. Critical discussions on the instruments' overall strengths and limitations, applicability for health economic evaluations, as well as the methodological quality of existing psychometric evidence were provided.

Using the dynamic programming principle, we establish a lattice dependence structure between the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated with the default states of the portfolio. We show existence and uniqueness of a classical solution to each equation and characterize them in terms of solutions to inhomogeneous Bernoulli type ordinary differential equations. We provide a precise characterization for the directionality of the CDS investment strategy and perform a numerical analysis to assess the impact of default contagion. We find that the increased intensity triggered by default of a very risky entity strongly impacts size and directionality of the investor strategy.

In the end, a numerical example is given to illustrate the results and compare the values in the two cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As remarked by Forsyth and Vetzal (2014) the Black and Scholes framework seems to be inappropriate for such a long maturity products. They propose to use a regime switching model. Alternatively, we propose here to use a stochastic volatility model (Heston model) and a Black-Scholes model with stochastic interest rate (Hull-White model). For this purpose we present four numerical methods for pricing GLWB variables annuities: a hybrid tree-finite difference method and a Hybrid Monte Carlo method, an ADI finite difference scheme, and a Standard Monte Carlo method. These methods are used to determine the no-arbitrage fee for the most popular versions of the GLWB contract, and to calculate the Greeks used in hedging. Both constant withdrawal and optimal withdrawal (including lapsation) strategies are considered. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate the sensitivity of the no-arbitrage fee to economic, contractual and longevity assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their analysis is made for the case where the time-until death is exponentially distributed, i.e., under the assumption of a constant force of mortality. The main purpose of our study is to show that the discounted density approach can also be used to obtain similar explicit results on life-contingent options under the assumption of piecewise constant forces of mortality. Moreover, we study a term insurance product with the payoff at the time of death being equity-linked and inflation-indexed, and investigate two types of annuity-immediate products whose annual payments are equity-indexed with a minimum guaranteed amount.

In the context of financial risk management, the clustering of high-severity risks has a devastating effect on the well-being of firms and is thus of pivotal importance in risk analysis. When it comes to quantifying the extent of tail dependence, it is generally agreed that measures of tail dependence must be independent of the marginal distributions of the risks but rather solely copula-dependent. Indeed, all classical measures of tail dependence are such, but they investigate the amount of tail dependence along the main diagonal of copulas, which has often little in common with the concentration of extremes in the copulas' domain of definition. In this paper we urge that the classical measures of tail dependence may underestimate the level of tail dependence in copulas. For the Gaussian copula, however, we prove that the classical measures are maximal. The implication of the result is two-fold: On the one hand, it means that in the Gaussian case, the (weak) measures of tail dependence that have been reported and used are of utmost prudence, which must be a reassuring news for practitioners. On the other hand, it further encourages substitution of the Gaussian copula with other copulas that are more tail dependent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The test can be seen as a generalization of the Breusch-Pagan test against random individual effects to all regression coefficients. While the original test procedure assumes a likelihood framework under normality, several useful variants of the LM test are presented to allow for non-normality, heteroscedasticity and serially correlated errors. Moreover, the tests can be conveniently computed via simple artificial regressions. We derive the limiting distribution of the LM test and show that if the errors are not normally distributed, the original LM test is asymptotically valid if the number of time periods tends to infinity. A simple modification of the score statistic yields an LM test that is robust to non-normality if the number of time periods is fixed. Further adjustments provide versions of the LM test that are robust to heteroscedasticity and serial correlation. We compare the local power of our tests and the statistic proposed by Pesaran and Yamagata. The results of the Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the LM-type test can be substantially more powerful, in particular, when the number of time periods is small.","[Breitung, Joerg] Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr, Meister Ekkehart Str 9, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Roling, Christoph] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Salish, Nazarii] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Calle Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain",University of Cologne; Deutsche Bank; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Breitung, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr, Meister Ekkehart Str 9, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",breitung@statistik.uni-koeln.de; christoph.roling@bundesbank.de; nsalish@eco.uc3m.es,"Breitung, Jörg/ABC-7734-2021","Salish, Nazarii/0000-0002-0682-1753",,,,,16,10,10,3,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Key parameters are defined as treatment effects, adverse effects, costs, resource use, health state utility values (HSUVs) and baseline risk of events. The recommended minimum requirement for treatment effects is comprehensive searching according to available methodological guidance. For other parameter types, the minimum is the searching of one bibliographic database plus, where appropriate, specialist sources and non-research-based and non-standard format sources. The recommendations draw on the search methods literature and on existing analyses of how evidence is used to support decision-analytic models. They take account of the range of research and non-research-based sources of evidence used in cost-effectiveness models and of the need for efficient searching. Consideration is given to what constitutes best evidence for the different parameter types in terms of design and scientific quality and to making transparent the judgments that underpin the selection of evidence from the options available. Methodological issues are discussed, including the differences between decision-analytic models of cost effectiveness and systematic reviews when searching and selecting evidence and comprehensive versus sufficient searching. Areas are highlighted where further methodological research is required.","[Paisley, Suzy] Univ Sheffield, HEDS, ScHARR Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Paisley, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, HEDS, ScHARR Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",s.paisley@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,9,10,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2016,34,6,,,,,597,608,,10.1007/s40273-015-0372-x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DM1KS,26861793.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376104800006,0

We document that, although the Monday low-return anomaly disappeared, the subsequent reversal of Monday returns remains robust to date. The reversals, measured over a five-day horizon, are pervasive across international stock markets, reasonably stable over time, significant following both positive and negative Monday returns, and not confined to extreme Monday returns. Trading strategies designed to exploit these reversals earn economic profits. We examine potential explanations for the reversal of Monday returns using trading flows data of investor types from Korea. All predictions of the Foster and Viswanathan [J. Finance, 1993, 48, 187-211] model are confirmed: volatility is higher, trading volume is lower, market depth is lower and price impact costs are higher on Mondays. The model implies lower price quality on Mondays, but does not specifically predict reversal of Monday returns. We show that the trading intensity of international/institutional investors is lower on Mondays. This appears to make the market relatively more susceptible to individual investors' trading, which is negatively correlated with international/institutional investors.

Dybvig (J Bus 61(3):369-393, 1988; Rev Financ Stud 1(1):67-88, 1988) showed that the cheapest way to acquire a certain distribution of a consumption bundle (or security) is when this bundle is anti-comonotonic with the state-price density, i.e., arranged in reverse order of the state-price density. In this paper, we look at extending Dybvig's ideas to complete markets with imperfections represented by a nonlinear pricing rule (e.g., due to bid-ask spreads). We consider an investor in a securities market where the pricing rule is law-invariant with respect to a capacity (e.g., Choquet pricing as in Araujo et al. in Econ Theory 49(1):1-35, 2011; Chateauneuf et al. in Math Financ 6(3):323-330, 1996; Chateauneuf and Cornet in Submodular financial markets with frictions, 2015; Cerreia-Vioglio et al. in J Econ Theory 157:730-762, 2015). The investor holds a security with a random payoff X and his problem is that of buying the cheapest contingent claim Y on X, subject to some constraints on the performance of the contingent claim and on its level of risk exposure. The cheapest such claim is called cost-efficient. If the capacity satisfies standard continuity and a property called strong diffuseness introduced in Ghossoub (Math Op Res 40(2):429-445, 2015), we show the existence and monotonicity of cost-efficient claims, in the sense that a cost-efficient claim is anti-comonotonic with the underlying security's payoff X. Strong diffuseness is satisfied by a large collection of capacities, including all distortions of diffuse probability measures. As an illustration, we consider the case of a Choquet pricing functional with respect to a capacity and the case of a Choquet pricing functional with respect to a distorted probability measure. Finally, we consider a simple example in which we derive an explicit analytical form for a cost-efficient claim.","[Ghossoub, Mario] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Ghossoub, M (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",mario.ghossoub@gmail.com,,"Ghossoub, Mario/0000-0002-6718-783X",,,,,36,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

These provisions generally comprise most of the liabilities of a non-life insurance company. The global provisions are often determined under an assumption of independence between the lines of business. Recently, Shi and Frees (2011) proposed to put dependence between lines of business with a copula that captures dependence between two cells of two different runoff triangles. In this paper, we propose to generalize this model in two steps. First, by using an idea proposed by Barnett and Zehnwirth (1998), we will suppose a dependence between all the observations that belong to the same calendar year (CY) for each line of business. Thereafter, we will then suppose another dependence structure that links the CYs of different lines of business. This model is done by using hierarchical Archimedean copulas. We show that the model provides more flexibility than existing models, and offers a better, more realistic and more intuitive interpretation of the dependence between the lines of business. For illustration, the model is applied to a dataset from a major US property-casualty insurer, where a bootstrap method is proposed to estimate the distribution of the reserve.","[Abdallah, Anas; Cossette, Helene] Univ Laval, Eole Actuariat, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Boucher, Jean-Philippe] UQAM Montreal, Dept Math, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Boucher, JP (通讯作者)，UQAM Montreal, Dept Math, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",anas.abdallah.1@ulaval.ca; boucher.jean-philippe@uqam.ca; helene.cossette@act.ulaval.ca,,,Cooperators General Insurance Company; Mitacs Accelerate program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Cooperators General Insurance Company; Mitacs Accelerate program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The authors wish to thank Mario V.

In line with a distinguished psychological literature, we consider modes of self-control that involve the self-imposed use of contingent punishments and rewards. We study settings in which consumers with quasi-hyperbolic preferences confront an otherwise standard intertemporal allocation problem with credit constraints. Our main result demonstrates that low initial assets can limit self-control, trapping people in poverty, while individuals with high initial assets can accumulate indefinitely. Thus, even temporary policies that initiate accumulation among the poor may be effective. We examine implications concerning the effect of access to credit on saving, the demand for commitment devices, the design of financial accounts to promote accumulation, and the variation of the marginal propensity to consume across income from different sources. We also explore the nature of optimal self-control, demonstrating that it has a simple and behaviorally plausible structure that is immune to self-renegotiation.","[Bernheim, B.

Although the impact of uncertainty around the choice of model structure and making incorrect structural assumptions on model predictions is noted, relatively little attention has been paid to characterising this type of uncertainty in guidelines developed by national funding bodies such as the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The absence of a detailed description and evaluation of structural uncertainty can add further uncertainty to the decision-making process, with potential impact on the quality of funding decisions. This paper provides a summary of key elements of structural uncertainty describing why it matters and how it could be characterised. Five alternative approaches to characterising structural uncertainty are discussed, including scenario analysis, model selection, model averaging, parameterization and discrepancy. We argue that the potential effect of structural uncertainty on model predictions should be considered in submissions to national funding bodies; however, the characterisation of structural uncertainty is not well defined within the guidelines of these bodies. There has been little consideration of the forms of structural sensitivity analysis that might best inform applied decision-making processes, and empirical research in this area is required.","[Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Karnon, Jonathan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Afzali, HHA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Level 7,178 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",hossein.hajialiafzali@adelaide.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,36,19,19,0,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2015,33,5,,,,,435,443,,10.1007/s40273-015-0256-0,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CG5OI,25601288.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353341100002,0

Apart from IBNR calculation, common pricing methods require volume measures for accident years in the observation period, and for the quotation period. In practice, in most cases restated premiums are used as the volume measures. The prediction error of the chain ladder method is an important part of the prediction uncertainty of these pricing approaches. There are, however, two sources of uncertainty that are not addressed by the chain ladder model: the stochastic volatility of the claims in the first development year; and the restatement uncertainty, the risk that the restated premium is not a good volume measure. We extend Mack's chain ladder model to cover these two sources of uncertainty, and calculate the mean-squared error of chain ladder pricing approaches with arbitrary weights for the accident years in the observation period. Then we focus on the problem of finding optimal weights for the accident years. First, we assume that the parameters for restatement uncertainty are given, and provide recursion formulas to calculate approximately-optimalweights. Second, we describe a maximum likelihood approach that can be used to estimate the restatement uncertainty.","Swiss Re Europe SA, Niederlassung Deutsch, D-81911 Munich, Germany",,"Riegel, U (通讯作者)，Swiss Re Europe SA, Niederlassung Deutsch, D-81911 Munich, Germany.",Ulrich_Riegel@swissre.com,"Riegel, Ulrich/AAH-2465-2021","Riegel, Ulrich/0000-0002-3563-3225",,,,,11,4,4,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2015,45,2,,,,,267,307,,10.1017/asb.2015.2,0.0,,,41,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CG8WC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353595000002,0

We consider test statistics for parameter hypotheses based on the IV estimator and generalized method of trimmed moments (GMTM) estimator introduced by iek (2008, 2009), and compare the pairs and implied probability bootstrap approximations for these statistics by applying the finite sample breakdown point theory. In particular, we study limiting behaviors of the bootstrap quantiles when the values of outliers diverge to infinity but the sample size is held fixed. The outliers are defined as anomalous observations that can arbitrarily change the value of the statistic of interest. We analyze both just- and overidentified cases and discuss implications of the breakdown point analysis to the size and power properties of bootstrap tests. We conclude that the implied probability bootstrap test using the statistic based on the GMTM estimator shows desirable robustness properties. Simulation studies endorse this conclusion. An empirical example based on Romer's (1993) study on the effect of openness of countries to inflation rates is presented.

Guidance on their use in the UK National Health Service (NHS) has so far focused on patients who are biologic naive, yet a minority of patients have poor response and require further treatment. Objectives To assess the potential cost effectiveness of sequential biologic therapies in patients with psoriasis who have been exposed to previous biologic therapy. Methods A two-part model with a 10-year time horizon was built to model an initial 13.5-week trial phase and a longer-term treatment period with annual Markov cycles. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response rates from subgroup analyses of three randomised placebo-controlled trials evaluating biologic agents were considered. A meta-analysis of these data provided probabilities of achieving PASI response (50/75/90) in the short term, and published evidence and assumptions were used to predict outcomes over the longer term. Benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs (2013-14) to the UK NHS included drugs, administration, monitoring, and hospitalisation. Costs and benefits were discounted 3.5 % per annum. Cost effectiveness of sequential biologic therapy was measured using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to best supportive care (BSC). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of alternative assumptions on the results. Results Results indicate that over 10 years, switching to a second biologic following intolerance to or failure of a first is likely to generate more QALYs than BSC, but at a higher cost. Base case results suggest the ICER of the second biologic compared to BSC is A 17,681 pound per QALY; however, sensitivity analyses indicate that changes in the efficacy of BSC, drug costs, dropout rates, and rates of hospitalisation have a significant impact, causing the ICER to range from less than A 10,000 pound to over A 50,000 pound per QALY. Conclusions Further biologic therapy for patients with psoriasis who have previously been treated with biologic therapy may be cost effective, although there is considerable uncertainty in the results. Future studies should be designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of biologic therapies in this subgroup with particular attention given to short-term and longer-term responses.","[Sawyer, Laura M.] Symmetron Ltd, Kinet Ctr, Borehamwood WD6 4PJ, Herts, England; [Wonderling, David; Samarasekera, Eleanor J.] Royal Coll Physicians, Natl Clin Guideline Ctr, London NW1 4LE, England; [Jackson, Karina; Smith, Catherine H.] Guys Hosp, St Johns Inst Dermatol, Div Med & Mol Genet, London SE1 9RT, England; [Murphy, Ruth] Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Queens Med Ctr, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",Royal College of Physicians; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; King's College London; Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust; University of Nottingham,"Sawyer, LM (通讯作者)，Symmetron Ltd, Kinet Ctr, Theobald St, Borehamwood WD6 4PJ, Herts, England.",lsawyer@symmetron.net,"Smith, Catherine H./G-5268-2012","Smith, Catherine H./0000-0001-9918-1144; Wonderling, David/0000-0003-0315-6273",National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.,,32,9,10,0,23,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2015,33,2,,,,,163,177,,10.1007/s40273-014-0226-y,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AZ7FJ,25526841.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348384300008,0

The method of applying keyword search queries to bibliographic databases using Boolean logic dominates literature reviews due to its easy application to the major online databases. However, it is recognised increasingly as being problematic where the research question cannot be clearly defined or requires an element of exploration, due to its reliance on author's use of titling and keywords and is unable to identify topics other than those defined in the search query. This paper discusses the relative merits of a systematic citation searching approach as both an alternative and a concurrent method to keyword searching. A method of citation searching, both forwards and backwards, which is iterated to form a closed loop solution, is discussed. An illustrative example is presented of both methods, applying them to the topic of the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold. The case study finds the citation searching approach dominates the traditional keyword searching approach, finding 76 papers of relevance, including all 15 found by the alternative approach. Conceptually, and in the example presented, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can represent a dominant strategy to the more traditional approach in some situations, highlighting that, wherever possible, it is preferential to employ multiple methods of searching. However, it is clear that a better understanding is required as to how we can most efficiently search the ever-growing sea of literature.","[Hinde, Sebastian; Spackman, Eldon] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Hinde, S (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",sebastian.hinde@york.ac.uk,,"Hinde, Sebastian/0000-0002-7117-4142; Spackman, David Eldon/0000-0001-8558-5973",Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research [G0901498/1]; MRC [G0901498] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0901498] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [EH-08-01-204] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Research was conducted as part of funding received from the Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research through its Methodology Research Programme (Award G0901498/1), both researchers having received funding from the sponsor for the duration of the project.",,13,65,91,2,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2015,33,1,,,,,5,11,,10.1007/s40273-014-0205-3,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AX8IG,25145803.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347152700002,0

A structured workshop was held with a predefined group of experts (n = 47), and was run using a modified nominal group technique. Workshop findings were recorded using extensive note taking, and summarized using thematic data analysis. The workshop was complemented by structured literature searches. The key finding emerging from the workshop, using an economic perspective, was that two distinct, but linked, interpretations of the concept of PM exist (personalization by 'physiology' or 'preferences'). These interpretations involve specific challenges for the design and conduct of economic evaluations. Existing evaluative (extra-welfarist) frameworks were generally considered appropriate for evaluating PM. When 'personalization' is viewed as using physiological biomarkers, challenges include representing complex care pathways; representing spillover effects; meeting data requirements such as evidence on heterogeneity; and choosing appropriate time horizons for the value of further research in uncertainty analysis. When viewed as tailoring medicine to patient preferences, further work is needed regarding revealed preferences, e.g. treatment (non)adherence; stated preferences, e.g. risk interpretation and attitude; consideration of heterogeneity in preferences; and the appropriate framework (welfarism vs. extra-welfarism) to incorporate non-health benefits.

Both Mack and cross-classified forms of the chain ladder are considered. Both cases are examined in the context of error terms distributed according to a member of the exponential dispersion family. Tweedie and over-dispersed Poisson errors follow as special cases. Bayesian cross-classified chain ladder models may randomise row, column or diagonal parameters. Column and diagonal randomisation has been largely absent from the literature until recently. The present paper allows randomisation of row and column parameters. The Bayes estimator, the linear Bayes (credibility) estimator, and the MAP estimator are shown to be identical in the Mack case, and in the cross-classified case provided that the error terms are Tweedie distributed. In the Mack case the variance structure is generalised considerably from the existing literature. In the cross-classified case the model structure differs somewhat from the existing literature, and a comparison is made between the two. MAP estimators for the cross-classified case are often given by implicit equations that require numerical solution. Recursive formulas are given for these in the general case of error terms from the exponential dispersion family. The connection between the cross-classified case and Bornhuetter-Ferguson prediction is explored.","UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Unsw Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Taylor, G (通讯作者)，UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Level 6,UNSW Business Sch Bldg E12, Unsw Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",gregory.taylor@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,27,10,10,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2015,45,1,,,,,75,99,,10.1017/asb.2014.25,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AY5MK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347616200003,0

Even if T approaches infinity but at a rate not faster than the cross sectional sample size n, the fixed effects estimator is still asymptotically biased. This paper proposes using the standard bootstrap and k-step bootstrap to correct the bias. We establish the asymptotic validity of the bootstrap bias corrections for both model parameters and average marginal effects. Our results apply to static models as well as some dynamic Markov models.

The objective of this study was to assess patient preferences for addressing various MS symptoms. This study was conducted at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts. We developed a national online survey of MS patients and neurologists to estimate the value each group places on treating specific MS symptoms. Each respondent was presented with two randomly selected scenarios with different symptoms and treatments. MS patients were asked about their own preferences, whereas neurologists were asked to consider what a patient of theirs would do or think in each scenario. We used a bidding game approach to elicit respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for the treatments. To treat mobility alone, WTP for MS patients averaged US$410-US$520 per month, depending on the scenario. For paired symptoms, MS patients would pay most to treat mobility and upper limb function (US$525/month) or mobility and cognition (US$514/month), somewhat less to treat mobility and eyesight (US$445/month), and least to treat mobility and fatigue (US$371/month). Patient WTP values increased with income and education. Neurologists believed their patients would be willing to pay US$216-US$249 per month to treat mobility alone, depending on the scenario. For paired symptoms, neurologists believed patients would pay most to treat mobility and fatigue (US$263/month) and least to treat mobility and upper limb function (US$177/month). Our findings suggest MS patients may value one outcome (e.g., improved arm and hand coordination) over another (e.g., less fatigue). Further, MS patients and neurologists may rank the importance of treating various symptoms differently. Given this potential mismatch, it is crucial for MS patients and their clinicians to discuss treatment priorities that take into account patient preferences.","[Lin, Pei-Jung; Saret, Cayla J.; Neumann, Peter J.; Sandberg, Eileen A.; Cohen, Joshua T.] Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Tufts Med Ctr, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts Medical Center,"Lin, PJ (通讯作者)，Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Tufts Med Ctr, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",plin@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,,Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),This study was supported by research funding from Biogen to Tufts Medical Center.,,43,7,6,2,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2016,34,12,,,,,1255,1265,,10.1007/s40273-016-0435-7,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EC4ZK,27461538.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388142700005,0

The method of maximum entropy has proven to be a powerful tool to determine probability densities from a few values of its Laplace transform. This is so even when the amount of data to compute numerically the Laplace transform is small. But in this case, the variability of the reconstruction due to the sample variability in the available data can lead to quite different results. It is the purpose of this note to quantify as much as possible the variability of the densities reconstructed by means of two maxentropic methods: the standard maximum entropy method and its extension to incorporate data with errors. The issues that we consider are of special interest for the advanced measurement approach in operational risk, which is based on loss data analysis to determine regulatory capital, as well as to determine the loss distribution of risks that occur with low frequency.

The CSS estimator is popular in empirical work due, at least in part, to its simplicity and its feasibility, even in very complicated nonstationary models. We consider a process, X-t, for which data exist from some point in time, which we call - N-0 + 1, but we only start observing it at a later time, t = 1. The parameter (d, mu, sigma(2)) is estimated by CSS based on the model Delta(d)(0) (X-t - mu) =epsilon(t), t = N + 1,..., N + T, conditional on X-1,..., X-N. We derive an expression for the second-order bias of (d) over cap as a function of the initial values, Xt, t = -N-0 + 1,..., N, and we investigate the effect on the bias of setting aside the first N observations as initial values. We compare (d) over cap with an estimator, (d) over cap (c), derived similarly but by choosing mu = C. We find, both theoretically and using a data set on voting behavior, that in many cases, the estimation of the parameter mu picks up the effect of the initial values even for the choice N = 0. If N-0 = 0, we show that the second-order bias can be completely eliminated by a simple bias correction. If, on the other hand, N-0 > 0, it can only be partly eliminated because the second-order bias term due to the initial values can only be diminished by increasing N.","[Johansen, Soren] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Johansen, Soren; Nielsen, Morten Orregaard] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark; [Nielsen, Morten Orregaard] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Copenhagen; CREATES; Queens University - Canada,"Nielsen, MO (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Dunning Hall, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",mon@econ.queensu.ca,,"Nielsen, Morten Orregaard/0000-0002-1337-9844; Johansen, Soren/0000-0002-9285-8236",Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [CREATES - DNRF78]; Canada Research Chairs program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation; Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful to three anonymous referees, the co-editor, and seminar participants at various universities and conferences for comments and to James Davidson for sharing the opinion poll data set with us.

This paper addresses the question of consistency and asymptotic distributions of instrumental variables estimates as the number of products increases in some commonly used models of demand under conditions on economic primitives. I show that, in a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium, product characteristics lose their identifying power as price instruments in the limit in certain cases, leading to inconsistent estimates. The reason is that product characteristic instruments achieve identification through correlation with markups, and, depending on the model of demand, the supply side can constrain markups to converge to a constant quickly relative to sampling error. I find that product characteristic instruments can yield consistent estimates in many of the cases I consider, but care must be taken in modeling demand and choosing instruments. A Monte Carlo study confirms that the asymptotic results are relevant in market sizes of practical importance.","[Armstrong, Timothy B.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, 30 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Armstrong, Timothy B.] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, 30 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University; Yale University,"Armstrong, TB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, 30 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Armstrong, TB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, 30 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",timothy.armstrong@yale.edu,,,,,,,31,17,25,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2016,84,5,,,,,1961,1980,,10.3982/ECTA10600,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DW3WO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383574000011,0

The complex structure of VA products and computational complexity of their accurate evaluation have compelled insurance companies to adopt Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to value their large portfolios of VA products. Because the MC simulations are computationally demanding, especially for intraday valuations, insurance companies need more efficient valuation techniques. Recently, a framework based on traditional spatial interpolation techniques has been proposed that can significantly decrease the computational complexity of MC simulation (Gan and Lin, 2015). However, traditional interpolation techniques require the definition of a distance function that can significantly impact their accuracy. Moreover, none of the traditional spatial interpolation techniques provide all of the key properties of accuracy, efficiency, and granularity (Hejazi et al., 2015). In this paper, we present a neural network approach for the spatial interpolation framework that affords an efficient way to find an effective distance function. The proposed approach is accurate, efficient, and provides an accurate granular view of the input portfolio. Our numerical experiments illustrate the superiority of the performance of the proposed neural network approach compared to the traditional spatial interpolation schemes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Over the last two decades, applications of Markovian regime switching models to finance and macroeconomics have received strong attention from researchers, and particularly market practitioners. However, relatively little research has so far been carried out in relation to insurance. This paper attempts to consider how a linear Markovian regime switching system in discrete-time could be applied to model the medium-and long-term reserves and the premiums (abbreviated here as the P-R process) for an insurer. Some recently developed techniques from linear robust control theory are applied to explore the stability, stabilisation and robust H-infinity-control of a P-R system, and the potential effects of abrupt structural changes in the economic fundamentals, as well as the insurer's strategy over a finite time period. Sufficient linear matrix inequality conditions are derived for solving the proposed sub-problems. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results.","[Yang, Lin; Pantelous, Athanasios A.; Assa, Hirbod] Univ Liverpool, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Pantelous, Athanasios A.; Assa, Hirbod] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Pantelous, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Pantelous, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",lin.yang@xjtlu.edu.cn; A.Pantelous@liverpool.ac.uk; assa@liverpool.ac.uk,"Pantelous, Athanasios/B-3721-2014","Pantelous, Athanasios/0000-0001-5738-1471",,,,,33,2,3,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2016,46,3,,,,,746,777,,10.1017/asb.2016.13,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DX5YM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384458600007,0

First, a simplified version of the test suggested by Wooldridge (2002) and Drukker (2003) is considered. The second test is based on the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) statistic suggested by Baltagi and Li (1995), and the third test is a modification of the classical Durbin Watson statistic. Under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation, all tests possess a standard normal limiting distribution as N tends to infinity and T is fixed. Analyzing the local power of the tests, we find that the LM statistic has superior power properties. Furthermore, a generalization to test for autocorrelation up to some given lag order and a test statistic that is robust against time dependent heteroskedasticity are proposed.","[Born, Benjamin] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Breitung, Joerg] Univ Cologne, D-50623 Cologne, Germany",University of Mannheim; University of Cologne,"Breitung, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Ctr Econometr & Stat, Meister Ekkehart Str 9, D-50623 Cologne, Germany.",breitung@statistik.uni-koeln.de,"Breitung, Jörg/ABC-7734-2021",,,,,,11,82,89,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

J,"Frew, E",,,,"Frew, Emma",,,Economic Evaluation of Childhood Obesity Interventions: Reflections and Suggestions,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; OVERWEIGHT,"Rising levels of childhood obesity present a serious global public health problem amounting to 7 % of GDP in developed countries and affecting 14 % of children. As such, many countries are investing increasingly large quantities of resource towards treatment and prevention. Whilst it is important to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of any intervention, it is equally as important to demonstrate cost effectiveness as policy makers strive to get the best value for money from increasingly limited public resources. Economic evaluation assists with making these investment decisions and whilst it can offer considerable support in many healthcare contexts, applying it to a childhood obesity context is not straightforward. Childhood obesity is a complex disease with interventions being multi-component in nature. Furthermore, the interventions are implemented in a variety of settings such as schools, the community, and the home, and have costs and benefits that fall outside the health sector. This paper provides a reflection from a UK perspective on the application of the conventional approach to economic evaluation to childhood obesity. It offers suggestions for how evaluations should be designed to fit better within this context, and to meet the needs of local decision makers. An excellent example is the need to report costs using a micro-costing format and for benefit measurement to go beyond a health focus. This is critical as the organisation and commissioning of childhood obesity services is done from a Local Authority setting and this presents further challenges for what is the most appropriate economic evaluation approach to use. Given that adult obesity is now of epidemic proportions, the accurate assessment of childhood obesity interventions to support public health decision making is critical.","[Frew, Emma] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Frew, E (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",e.frew@bham.ac.uk,"Frew, Emma/AAO-5141-2021","Frew, Emma/0000-0002-5462-1158",Department of Health [CDF-2015-08-013] Funding Source: Medline; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [CDF-2015-08-013] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [CDF-2015-08-013] Funding Source: researchfish,Department of Health; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),,,65,18,20,0,34,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2016,34,8,,,,,733,740,,10.1007/s40273-016-0398-8,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DQ4LJ,26968705.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379175100002,0

Then, we provide a counterexample to show that there is no such characterization when the agent space is an arbitrary atomless probability space (in particular, Lebesgue unit interval) and both actions and payoffs are uncountable. Nevertheless, if the agent space is a saturated probability space, the characterization result is still valid. Next, we show that the characterizing distributions for the equilibria exist in a quite general framework. This leads to the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria in three different settings of large games. Finally, we notice that our characterization result can also be used to characterize saturated probability spaces.","[Fu, Haifeng] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou 215103, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ying; Zhang, Luyi] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; National University of Singapore,"Fu, HF (通讯作者)，Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou 215103, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",haifeng.fu02@xjtlu.edu.cn,,"Fu, Haifeng/0000-0003-3637-1471",,,,,19,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Routine adoption of pharmacogenetic tests requires evidence of their cost effectiveness. The present review aims to systematically review published economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic tests that aim to prevent or reduce the incidence of ADRs. We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic tests aimed to reduce the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Literature was searched using Embase, MEDLINE and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database with search terms relating to pharmacogenetic testing, adverse drug reactions, economic evaluations and pharmaceuticals. Titles were screened independently by two reviewers. Articles deemed to meet the inclusion criteria were screened independently on abstract, and full texts reviewed. We identified 852 articles, of which 47 met the inclusion criteria. There was evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of testing for HLA-B*57:01 (prior to abacavir), HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 (prior to carbamazepine), HLA-B*58:01 (prior to allopurinol) and CYP2C19 (prior to clopidogrel treatment). Economic evidence was inconclusive with respect to TPMT (prior to 6-mercaptoputine, azathioprine and cisplatin therapy), CYP2C9 and VKORC1 (to inform genotype-guided dosing of coumarin derivatives), MTHFR (prior to methotrexate treatment) and factor V Leiden testing (prior to oral contraception). Testing for A1555G is not cost effective before prescribing aminoglycosides. Our systematic review identified robust evidence of the cost effectiveness of genotyping prior to treatment with a number of common drugs. However, further analyses and (or) availability of robust clinical evidence is necessary to make recommendations for others.","[Plumpton, Catrin O.; Roberts, Daniel; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Pirmohamed, Munir; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Mol & Clin Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3GL, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; University of Liverpool,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.;Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Mol & Clin Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3GL, Merseyside, England.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Pirmohamed, Munir/H-6004-2011; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Pirmohamed, Munir/0000-0002-7534-7266; Plumpton, Catrin/0000-0003-2710-9199; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459","National Institute for Health Research Invention for Innovation Programme [II-LB-0313-20008]; MRC [MR/L006758/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/L006758/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0512-10064, II-LB-0313-20008] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [II-LB-0313-20008] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)",National Institute for Health Research Invention for Innovation Programme; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This report is independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research Invention for Innovation Programme (A biomarker panel to predict, diagnose and prevent HLA-mediated ADRs; reference number II-LB-0313-20008).

Given that these are three key terms in the literature, their appropriate and clear use is important. This paper reviews the history and definitions of the terms and considers how they have been used. It is argued that the definitions of HRQoL in the literature are problematic because some definitions fail to distinguish between HRQoL and health or between HRQoL and QoL. Many so-called HRQoL questionnaires actually measure self-perceived health status and the use of the phrase QoL is unjustified. It is concluded that the concept of HRQoL as used now is confusing. A potential solution is to define HRQoL as the way health is empirically estimated to affect QoL or use the term to only signify the utility associated with a health state.","[Karimi, Milad; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Karimi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",mkarimi@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Karimi, Milad/0000-0002-5298-174X",HEOM Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR CLAHRC YH),HEOM Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR CLAHRC YH),"Professor John Brazier was supported in the preparation/submission of this paper by the HEOM Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR CLAHRC YH). http://www.clahrc-yh.nir.ac.uk.

However, T1DM is a separate disease, and it is therefore important to appraise modelling methods in T1DM. This review identified published economic models in T1DM and provided an overview of the characteristics and capabilities of available models, thus enabling a discussion of best-practice modelling approaches in T1DM. A systematic review of Embase(A (R)), MEDLINEA (R), MEDLINEA (R) In-Process, and NHS EED was conducted to identify available models in T1DM. Key conferences and health technology assessment (HTA) websites were also reviewed. The characteristics of each model (e.g. model structure, simulation method, handling of uncertainty, incorporation of treatment effect, data for risk equations, and validation procedures, based on information in the primary publication) were extracted, with a focus on model capabilities. We identified 13 unique models. Overall, the included studies varied greatly in scope as well as in the quality and quantity of information reported, but six of the models (Archimedes, CDM [Core Diabetes Model], CRC DES [Cardiff Research Consortium Discrete Event Simulation], DCCT [Diabetes Control and Complications Trial], Sheffield, and EAGLE [Economic Assessment of Glycaemic control and Long-term Effects of diabetes]) were the most rigorous and thoroughly reported. Most models were Markov based, and cohort and microsimulation methods were equally common. All of the more comprehensive models employed microsimulation methods. Model structure varied widely, with the more holistic models providing a comprehensive approach to microvascular and macrovascular events, as well as including adverse events. The majority of studies reported a lifetime horizon, used a payer perspective, and had the capability for sensitivity analysis. Several models have been developed that provide useful insight into T1DM modelling. Based on a review of the models identified in this study, we identified a set of 'best in class' methods for the different technical aspects of T1DM modelling.","[Henriksson, Martin] PAREXEL Int, Stockholm, Sweden; [Henriksson, Martin] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Jindal, Ramandeep] PAREXEL Int, Chandigarh, India; [Sternhufvud, Catarina; Bergenheim, Klas; Sorstadius, Elisabeth] AstraZeneca, Global Med Dev, Global Payer Evidence & Pricing, SE-43183 Molndal, Sweden; [Willis, Michael] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, IHE, Lund, Sweden",Parexel International; Linkoping University; Parexel International; AstraZeneca,"Sternhufvud, C (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca, Global Med Dev, Global Payer Evidence & Pricing, SE-43183 Molndal, Sweden.",Catarina.Sternhufvud@astrazeneca.com,"Henriksson, Martin/HDN-3507-2022","Henriksson, Martin/0000-0003-1699-3185; Willis, Michael/0000-0002-6565-7025",AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),"Martin Henriksson and Ramandeep Jindal were employees of PAREXEL International when the study was conducted, which received funding from AstraZeneca to conduct the systematic literature review and manuscript preparation.

The GLWB offers a lifelong withdrawal benefit, even when the policy account value becomes zero, while the policyholder remains alive. Upon death, the remaining account value will be paid to the beneficiary as a death benefit. The bang-bang control strategy analysed under the assumption of maximization of the policyholder's expected cash flow reduces the strategy space of optimal withdrawal policies to three choices: zero withdrawal, withdrawal at the contractual amount or complete surrender. The impact on the GLWB value under various withdrawal behaviours of the policyholder is examined. We also analyse the pricing properties of GLWB subject to different model parameter values and structural features.","[Huang, Yao Tung; Kwok, Yue Kuen] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Kwok, YK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maykwok@ust.hk,,"Kwok, Yue Kuen/0000-0002-3474-445X",,,,,30,18,20,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We sought to establish the potential of real-world data available within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to determine comprehensive healthcare utilisation and costs as input variables for economic modelling. A cohort of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who first saw a gastroenterologist in 2008 or 2009, and with 3 years of data before and after their appointment, was created in the CPRD. Primary care, outpatient, inpatient, prescription and colonoscopy data were extracted from the linked CPRD and HES. The appropriate cost to the NHS was attached to each event. Total and stratified annual healthcare utilisation rates and costs were calculated before and after the gastroenterology appointment with distribution parameters. Absolute differences were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals. Total annual healthcare costs over 3 years increase by A 935 pound (95 % CI A 928-941) pound following a gastroenterology appointment for IBS. We derived utilisation and cost data with parameter distributions stratified by demographics and time. Women, older patients, smokers and patients with greater comorbidity utilised more healthcare resources, which generated higher costs. These linked datasets provide comprehensive primary and secondary care data for large numbers of patients, which allows stratification of outcomes. It is possible to derive input parameters appropriate for economic models and their distributions directly from the population of interest.","[Canavan, Caroline; West, Joe; Card, Timothy] Univ Nottingham, Div Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Clin Sci Bldg,City Hosp Campus,Hucknall Rd, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England",University of Nottingham; Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust; Nottingham City Hospital,"Canavan, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Div Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Clin Sci Bldg,City Hosp Campus,Hucknall Rd, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England.",caroline.canavan@nottingham.ac.uk,"West, Joe/I-6637-2012; Card, Timothy/J-8651-2013","West, Joe/0000-0002-1135-9356; Card, Timothy/0000-0003-2555-2250",Medical Research Council; MRC [G1002360] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G1002360] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"All authors have completed competing interest forms, and declare that Caroline Canavan received support from the Medical Research Council for the submitted work; Caroline Canavan, Joe West and Timothy Card have no relationships with any companies that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous 3 years, or any nonfinancial interests that may be relevant to the submitted work.",,60,22,22,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2016,34,2,,,,,181,194,,10.1007/s40273-015-0339-y,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DE7UU,26497004.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370843000011,0

This means that it estimates parameters consistently, selects the correct sparsity pattern, and estimates the coefficients belonging to the relevant variables at the same asymptotic efficiency as if only these had been included in the model from the outset. In particular, this implies that it is able to discriminate between stationary and nonstationary autoregressions and it thereby constitutes an addition to the set of unit root tests. Next, and important in practice, we show that choosing the tuning parameter by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) results in consistent model selection. However, it is also shown that the adaptive Lasso has no power against shrinking alternatives of the form c/T if it is tuned to perform consistent model selection. We show that if the adaptive Lasso is tuned to perform conservative model selection it has power even against shrinking alternatives of this form and compare it to the plain Lasso.","[Kock, Anders Bredahl] Aarhus Univ, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Kock, Anders Bredahl] CREATES, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Kock, AB (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",akock@creates.au.dk,,,Danish National Research Foundation,Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"I am indebted to Svend Erik Graversen, Niels Haldrup and Jorgen Hoffmann-Jorgensen, and Timo Terasvirta for help and suggestions.

Recent notable advances that perform well include the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model which can approximate long memory, is very parsimonious, is easy to estimate, and features good out-of-sample performance. We prove that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) recovers the lags structure of the HAR model asymptotically if it is the true model, and we present Monte Carlo evidence in finite samples. The HAR model's lags structure is not fully in agreement with the one found using the Lasso on real data. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that there are two clear breaks in structure for most of the assets we consider. These results bring into question the appropriateness of the HAR model for realized volatility. Finally, in an out-of-sample analysis, we show equal performance of the HAR model and the Lasso approach.","[Audrino, Francesco; Knaus, Simon D.] Univ St Gallen, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Audrino, F (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",francesco.audrino@unisg.ch,"Audrino, Francesco/ABF-3239-2020",,,,,,45,51,57,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

This result is valid with arbitrary preferences and endowments, contingent or noncontingent promises, many assets and consumption goods, production, and multiple periods. We also show that only no-default equilibria would be selected if there were the slightest cost of using collateral or handling default. Our Binomial Leverage Theorem shows that equilibrium Loan to Value (LTV) for noncontingent debt contracts is the ratio of the worst-case return of the asset to the riskless gross rate of interest. In binomial economies, leverage is determined by down risk and not by volatility.","[Fostel, Ana] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Geanakoplos, John] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Geanakoplos, John] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",University of Virginia; Yale University; The Santa Fe Institute,"Fostel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",anafostel@virginia.edu; john.geanakoplos@yale.edu,,,,,,,34,32,41,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2015,83,6,,,,,2191,2229,,10.3982/ECTA11618,0.0,,,39,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DB3IW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368405400003,0

J,"Shields, GE; Beard, SM",,,,"Shields, Gemma E.; Beard, Stephen M.",,,A Systematic Review of the Economic and Humanistic Burden of Gout,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; QUESTIONNAIRE DISABILITY INDEX; HEALTH-CARE COSTS; INTERNATIONAL BURDEN; RESOURCE USE; RHEUMATOLOGY GUIDELINES; SERUM URATE; URIC-ACID; MANAGEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Gout is a chronic and inflammatory form of arthritis that is often overlooked despite the associated pain caused by acute flares and associated joint damage caused by the development of debilitating tophi. The increasing burden of gout, due to an aging population and the increased prevalence of known risk factors for hyperuricaemia, means that there is a continued need for new and effective urate-lowering treatments. The evaluation of these treatments will require a comprehensive and comparative evidence base describing the economic and humanistic burden of gout, taken from the perspective of patients, the healthcare system, and wider society. The objective of this study is to review and summarise the current evidence of the disease burden related to chronic gout, assessed in terms of both cost and health-related quality of life (HRQL), and to identify key factors correlated with an increased burden. The overall aim is to support the economic evaluation of new treatments for gout, and to highlight key data gaps that may need further study and exploration. Relevant literature dating from January 2000 to July 2014 was sourced through searches of the MEDLINE database via PubMed and The Cochrane Library. Articles published in English and reporting either the economic burden (cost) or the humanistic burden (HRQL/utility) of gout were identified, and key data were extracted and summarised, with key themes and data gaps identified and discussed. Of the 323 studies identified, 39 met the inclusion criteria, of which 17 and 26 were relevant to the economic and humanistic burden, respectively. The economic burden of gout varied according to numerous factors, most notably serum urate acid levels and number of flares and tophi, resulting in higher healthcare resource use most often attributed to hospitalisation and inpatient stay. The incremental direct cost of gout has been suggested in the range of US$3165 to US$5515 (2004 and 2005 values, respectively) climbing to US$10,222 to US$21,467 (2008 values) per annum where patients are experiencing regular acute flares and have tophi present. The humanistic burden of gout was largely due to physical disability and pain resulting from chronic clinical manifestations. Short Form 6 dimensions (SF-6D) assessed utility weights are estimated at 0.53 for a patient with severe gout (a parts per thousand yen3 flares/year and tophi) compared with 0.73 for an asymptomatic gout patient with serum acid levels < 6 mg/dl. The evidence confirms that gout has a growing overall prevalence and represents a significant burden in terms of both direct healthcare cost and HRQL outcomes. In light of this, effective urate-lowering treatments are likely to be valued if they can be clearly demonstrated to be both clinically effective and cost effective. Published data to support healthcare decision making in non-US countries with regards to treatments for gout are currently limited, which is a key limitation of the current evidence base. More research is also required to extend our understanding of the impact of gout on indirect costs, and a need also exists to develop a more comprehensive set of comparative HRQL utility assessments.","[Shields, Gemma E.; Beard, Stephen M.] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England",,"Beard, SM (通讯作者)，BresMed Hlth Solut, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",sbeard@bresmed.co.uk,"Shields, Gemma/F-2042-2018","Shields, Gemma/0000-0003-4869-7524",,,,,79,40,43,0,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2015,33,10,,,,,1029,1047,,10.1007/s40273-015-0288-5,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CR8TE,25969152.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361626100004,0

This involves the extension of the Gompertz and non-mean reverting models as well as the adoption of a pure Markov model for the force of mortality. A continuous-time finite-state Markov chain is employed to describe the evolution of mortality model parameters which are then estimated using the filtered-based and least-squares methods. The adequacy of the regime-switching Gompertz model for the US mortality data is demonstrated via the goodness-of-fit metrics and likelihood-based selection criteria. A GAO is valued assuming the interest and mortality risk factors are switching regimes in accordance with the dynamics of two independent Markov chains. To obtain closed-form valuation formulae, we employ the change of measure technique with the pure endowment price as the numeraire. Numerical implementations are included to compare the results of the proposed approaches and those from the Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There is, however, a lack of practical guidance on how to conduct an economic evaluation based on registry data and how this evidence can be used in actual decision making. This paper explains the required steps on how to perform a sound economic evaluation using examples from an economic evaluation conducted with real-world data from the Dutch Population based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies. There are three main issues related to using registry data: confounding by indication, missing data, and insufficient numbers of (comparable) patients. If encountered, it is crucial to accurately deal with these issues to maximize the internal validity and generalizability of the outcomes and their value to decision makers. Multivariate regression modeling, propensity score matching, and data synthesis are well-established methods to deal with confounding. Multiple imputation methods should be used in cases where data are missing at random. Furthermore, it is important to base the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new treatment compared with its alternative on comparable groups of (matched) patients, even if matching results in a small analytical population. Unmatched real-world data provide insights into the costs and effects of a treatment in a real-world setting. Decision makers should realize that real-world evidence provides extremely valuable and relevant policy information, but needs to be assessed differently compared with evidence derived from a randomized clinical trial.","[Blommestein, Hedwig M.; Franken, Margreet G.; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Uyl-de Groot, CA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",uyl@bmg.eur.nl,"Franken, Margreet MG/H-3200-2013","Franken, Margreet/0000-0003-4207-510X; Blommestein, Hedwig/0000-0002-5846-0531",ZonMW [80-82500-98-01007]; Bayer; Roche; Janssen; Celgene; Sanofi; MSD; Novartis; GSK; Mundipharma; BMS,ZonMW(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development); Bayer(Bayer AG); Roche(Roche Holding); Janssen(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Celgene(Bristol-Myers SquibbCelgene Corporation); Sanofi; MSD; Novartis(Novartis); GSK(GlaxoSmithKline); Mundipharma; BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"PHAROS, the Population-based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies, is a cooperation of HOVON (Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology), the Institute of Medical Technology Assessment at Erasmus University Rotterdam, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Netherlands (IKNL).

We demonstrate that the corresponding premium principle enjoys a minimal representation. Uniqueness - in a sense specified in the paper - of this premium principle is derived from this initial result. The representations are derived from a result by Kusuoka, which is usually given for nonatomic probability spaces. We extend this setting to premium principles for spaces with atoms, as this is of particular importance for insurance. Further, stochastic order relations are employed to identify the minimal representation. It is shown that the premium principles in the minimal representation are extremal with respect to the order relations. The tools are finally employed to explicitly provide the minimal representation for premium principles, which are important in actuarial practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These markets are among the most liquid markets in the financial system. However, liquidity of interbank markets dropped during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and such a lack of liquidity influenced the entire economic system. In this paper, we analyse transaction data from the e-MID market which is the only electronic interbank market in the Euro Area and US, over a period of 11 years (1999-2009). We adapt a method developed to detect statistically validated links in a network, in order to reveal preferential trading in a directed network. Preferential trading between banks is detected by comparing empirically observed trading relationships with a null hypothesis that assumes random trading among banks doing a heterogeneous number of transactions. Preferential trading patterns are revealed at time windows of 3-maintenance periods. We show that preferential trading is observed throughout the whole period of analysis and that the number of preferential trading links does not show any significant trend in time, in spite of a decreasing trend in the number of pairs of banks making transactions. We observe that preferential trading connections typically involve large trading volumes. During the crisis, we also observe that transactions occurring between banks with a preferential connection occur at larger interest rates than the complement set-an effect that is not observed before the crisis.","[Hatzopoulos, Vasilis; Iori, Giulia] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Sch Social Sci, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Iori, Giulia] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, System Risk Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Mantegna, Rosario N.] Cent European Univ, Ctr Network Sci, Dept Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Mantegna, Rosario N.; Micciche, Salvatore] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim, Viale Sci,Edificio 18, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Tumminello, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Stat, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",City University London; University of Greenwich; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Central European University; University of Palermo; University of Palermo,"Miccichè, S (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Fis & Chim, Viale Sci,Edificio 18, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",salvatore.micciche@unipa.it,"Miccichè, Salvatore/B-6575-2008; Iori, Giulia/G-4078-2012; Mantegna, Rosario N/H-3652-2014; Tumminello, Michele/G-4492-2011; Iori, Giulia/JOK-8664-2023","Miccichè, Salvatore/0000-0003-3779-592X; Mantegna, Rosario N/0000-0003-4177-171X; Tumminello, Michele/0000-0001-6045-6761; Iori, Giulia/0000-0001-9443-9353",FP7 research project CRISIS 'Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic InstabilitieS'; INET research project NetHet 'New Tools in Credit Network Modeling with Heterogenous Agents'; FP7 research project FOC 'Forecasting Financial Crises ',FP7 research project CRISIS 'Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic InstabilitieS'; INET research project NetHet 'New Tools in Credit Network Modeling with Heterogenous Agents'; FP7 research project FOC 'Forecasting Financial Crises ',"G.I., S.M. and R.N.M. acknowledge support from the FP7 research project CRISIS 'Complexity Research Initiative for Systemic InstabilitieS'.

This result departs from the general belief that ambiguity aversion induces conservative behavior.

The primary statistic of marginal analysis is the marginal effect (ME). The ME facilitates the examination of outcomes for defined patient profiles or individuals while measuring the change in original units (e.g., costs, probabilities). The ME has a long history in economics; however, it is not widely used in health services research despite its flexibility and ability to provide unique insights. This article, the second in a two-part series, discusses practical issues that arise in the estimation and interpretation of the ME for a variety of regression models often used in health services research. Part one provided an overview of prior studies discussing ME followed by derivation of ME formulas for various regression models relevant for health services research studies examining costs and utilization. The current article illustrates the calculation and interpretation of ME in practice and discusses practical issues that arise during the implementation, including: understanding differences between software packages in terms of functionality available for calculating the ME and its confidence interval, interpretation of average marginal effect versus marginal effect at the mean, and the difference between ME and relative effects (e.g., odds ratio). Programming code to calculate ME using SAS, STATA, LIMDEP, and MATLAB are also provided. The illustration, discussion, and application of ME in this two-part series support the conduct of future studies applying the concept of marginal analysis.","[Onukwugha, E.] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Bergtold, J.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Jain, R.] HealthCore Inc, Wilmington, DE 19801 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Kansas State University; HealthCore, Inc","Onukwugha, E (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",eonukwug@rx.umaryland.edu,"Bergtold, Jason/AAA-1041-2022",,,,,,19,43,47,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2015,33,2,,,,,97,103,,10.1007/s40273-014-0224-0,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,AZ7FJ,25358482.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348384300003,0

However, as this control is motivated by the existing relationship between mutual fund flows and market returns, we first analyse this relationship, considering previous and concurrent market returns. However, unlike existing studies, we do not consider future returns, since investors do not observe them when making investment decisions. Thus, we feel it is more appropriate to consider expected market returns. We construct the expected market returns by running an AR model and considering the available public information about the macro-economy. The relationship is analysed under different conditions, considering a variety of different mutual fund flow measures, and considering (or not) the sensitivity of mutual fund flows to positive and negative market returns. We also propose different controls for the traditional timing models, and we further analyse the reverse-causality problem. The study demonstrates, for a sample of equity mutual funds registered for sale in the USA, that the poor market timing performance found in this and other prior studies can be completely attributed to the perverse effect of the fund managers' liquidity service.","[Alda, Mercedes] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Social & Human Sci, Finance & Accounting Dept, Teruel 44003, Spain; [Vargas, Maria; Ferruz, Luis] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Finance & Accounting Dept, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Alda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Social & Human Sci, Finance & Accounting Dept, C Ciudad Escolar S-N, Teruel 44003, Spain.",mvargas@unizar.es,"Ferruz, Luis/AAF-7886-2019","Alda Garcia, Mercedes/0000-0002-2525-9049",,,,,24,0,0,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The Ordinary Least Square method was applied to establish the relationships between climatic factors and rice yields in two different growing seasons. The climatic factors are average maximum temperature (avemaxT), average minimum temperature (aveminT) and average rainfall (averain). The rice growing seasons are known as the Winter-Spring (WS) and Summer-Autumn (SA) season. The data of climate factors and rice yield during these two growing seasons were collected from District Meteorological Station and District Statistical Office over 27 years. The data used was from the years 1986 to 2012. A focus group discussion also was held with local rice farmers. The information gathered during this discussion was processed by using the timeline trend, which is a Participatory Rural Approach (PRA) tool. The farmers were invited to share their thoughts, experiences and opinions related to the impact of climate variability on their individual rice production. Moreover, an in-depth interview was conducted with local extension and agricultural officers to discuss the past losses of rice production caused by climate variability that occurred in Nam Dong district. The results from Ordinary Least Square show that seasonal averain, avemaxT, and aveminT had significant effect on rice yield. While, it was found that the seasonal averain factor had a positive relationship with rice yield and that the seasonal avemaxT affected adversely on rice yield of the two growing seasons. In addition, rice yield in the SA season did not relate to seasonal aveminT. This climate variable had positive impact on WS rice yield at statistical significant level. Moreover, participants in the focus group discussion reported that many climate events were irregular and unpredictable. An example of this is that droughts occurred more frequently, which caused negative impact on rice production. The result of in-depth interview also confirmed that drought, storm, pest and disease were the main cause losses of rice production under climate variability. The research results provide valuable information to assist local governments in rural socioeconomic development plans to minimize the impacts of adverse climate conditions. Moreover, Meteorological Stations, agricultural and extension units will also benefit from this data to help improve their communication methods when disseminating to the farmers current or accurate climate conditions, climate predictions and climate patterns.

We extend the transformation method in the literature and apply the theoretical fluctuation techniques to derive an explicit expression of the joint Laplace transform under consideration. Further, with the presence of a constant dividend barrier, we derive explicit expressions for the Laplace transforms of the time of ruin and the non-dividend paying duration, namely the total length of non-dividend paying periods prior to ruin. This quantity is of practical interest but has not been studied in the literature to date.

Methods Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated using utility values based on UK and Dutch values of EQ-5D, two UK mappings and one Dutch mapping of EQ-5D and two condition-specific instruments: the UK eight-dimensional Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-8D) and the Dutch Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale Preference-Based Measure (MSIS-PBM). Deterministic and Monte-Carlo simulation-based ICERs were estimated for glatiramer acetate versus symptom management using a lifetime Markov model. Results For both UK and Dutch perspectives, mapped and condition-specific utility values expressed significantly higher quality of life for the worst health state of the model than did EQ-5D. The ICER of glatiramer acetate with EQ-5D was US$182,291 for The Netherlands and US$153,476 for the UK. Ratios for mapped and condition-specific utilities were between 20 and 60 % higher. Conclusion The overestimation of quality of life of patients with MS by mapped EQ-5D or condition-specific utility values, relative to observed EQ-5D, increases the ICER substantially in a lifetime Markov model.","[Versteegh, Matthijs] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Versteegh, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",versteegh@imta.eur.nl,,"Versteegh, Matthijs/0000-0003-4804-235X",,,,,31,12,12,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2016,34,11,,,,,1133,1144,,10.1007/s40273-016-0421-0,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EA6RE,27282692.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386755700006,0

We investigate a multivariate Pareto distribution that allows for the exploration of a variety of applications, from portfolios of standard annuities to joint-life annuity products for couples. Given the anticipated continued increase of supercentenarians, the heavy-tailed nature of the Pareto distribution is appropriate for this application. In past work, it has been shown that even a little dependence between lives can lead to much higher uncertainty. Therefore, the ability to assess and incorporate the appropriate dependence structure, whilst allowing for extreme observations, significantly improves the pricing and risk management of life-benefit products.

The individual consumes at a constant rate c, so the level of wealth required for risldessly meeting consumption equals c/r, in which r is the rate of return of the riskless asset. Our problem is related to, but different from, the goal-reaching problems of Browne (1997). First, Browne (1997, Section 3.1) maximizes the probability that wealth reaches b < c/r before it reaches a < b. Browne's game ends when wealth reaches b. By contrast, for the problem we consider, the game continues until the individual dies or until wealth reaches 0; reaching b and then falling below it before death does not count. Second, Browne (1997, Section 4.2) maximizes the expected discounted reward of reaching b > c/r before wealth reaches c/r. If one interprets his discount rate as a hazard rate, then our two problems are mathematically equivalent for the special case for which b > c/r, with ruin level c/r. However, we obtain different results because we set the ruin level at 0, thereby allowing the game to continue when wealth falls below c/r. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting credible risk measures are more informative than the usual risk measures (i.e. VaR, CM) in capturing the risk of individual insurer's contract (or returns of an individual asset) as well as the portfolio risk consisting of several similar but not identical contracts (or returns of a portfolio of similar assets), which are grouped together to share the risk. These credible risk measures are: the credible value at risk, the credible conditional tail expectation, the credible tail conditional median and the credible quantile tail expectation. Two examples of credible risks measures are presented, one with insurance loss data and the other with industry financial data. The advantages and disadvantages of these new credible measures are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The paper generalizes and improves the results on static replication and approximation in the literature.","[Ma, Jingtang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ Math, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Deng, Dongya] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Harry] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, Huxley Bldg, London SW7 2BZ, England",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Imperial College London,"Zheng, H (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, Huxley Bldg, London SW7 2BZ, England.",h.zheng@imperial.ac.uk,,,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-12-0922],Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),The work was supported by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [grant number NCET-12-0922].,,19,5,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In simulations we show the unbiasedness of the proposed estimator and its superiority to different approaches introduced in the literature. Simulation results are confirmed in applications to real inflation data with the goal of forecasting long-term bond risk premia.

In this paper, it is shown that premium and liability transfers could be optimally made in such a way as to reduce the amount of Technical Provisions and Minimum Capital Requirement for the entire insurance conglomerate. These levels of required capital represent the minimal amount that needs to be held by the insurance group without regulator intervention, according to the Solvency II regulation. We assume that only proportional risk transfers are feasible, since such transfers are not difficult to administer for a large scaled insurance group, as is always the case. In addition, any risk shifting should be made for commercial purposes in order to be considered acceptable by the local regulators that impose restrictions on how much the assets within an insurance group are fungible. Our numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the optimal proportional risk transfers which can easily be implemented, in terms of computation, in any well-known solver even for an insurance conglomerate with many subsidiaries. We found that our proposed optimal proportional allocations are more beneficial for large insurance group, since the relative reduction in capital requirement tends to be small, whereas the gain in absolute terms is quite significant for large scaled insurance group.

To boost the concentration parameter, we propose to increase the number of instruments to a large number or even up to a continuum. However, in finite samples, the inclusion of an excessive number of moments may be harmful. To address this issue, we use regularization techniques as in Carrasco (2012) and Carrasco and Tchuente (2014). We show that normalized regularized two-stage least squares (2SLS) and limited maximum likelihood (LIML) are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Moreover, our estimators are asymptotically more efficient than most competing estimators. Our simulations show that the leading regularized estimators (LF and T of LIML) work very well (are nearly median unbiased) even in the case of relatively weak instruments.

We model the stock returns and the parameters for the term structure with a vector autoregressive model, thus considering time-varying investment opportunities. To find the optimal solution we use a multi-stage stochastic programming approach, which allows for including complex surrender charges on pure endowments and annuities, as well as transaction costs on stocks and bonds.

With fixed agent types, full separation is not possible when continuation equilibrium payoffs following revelation are on the Pareto frontier of attainable payoffs. This result is related to the ratchet effect in that: (1) a type imitating a less productive type receives an information rent, and (2) with full separation, one imitating a more productive type receives the same future payoff as that more productive type. However, the reason for (2) is fundamentally different than with the ratchet effect. It arises from the dynamic enforcement requirement in relational contracts, not from the principal having all the bargaining power, and applies whatever the distribution between principal and agent of the future gains from the relationship (i.e., whatever the point on the Pareto frontier).

The main objective of this paper is to model the provision (or claim reserve) against the risk of borrowers defaulting. Unlike traditionally used models, our model depends on specific information concerning the borrowers (amount borrowed and term of loan). Our approach will also take into account three kinds of dependence: the dependence between each claim amount (by taking into account the real estate price), the dependence between the date of default and the claim amount, and the dependence between the number of defaults and the claim amount. Both theoretical and applied, our model allows the calculation of the mean, the variance, and the law of the provision.

To date, the measurement of value has focused on equity weights to reflect societal preferences for the allocation of QALY gains. Another approach is to use a non-QALY-based measure of value, such as an outcome 'equivalent to saving the life of a young person' (a SAVE). This paper assesses the feasibility and validity of using the SAVE as a measure of value for the economic evaluation of health care technologies. A web-based person trade-off (PTO) survey was designed and implemented to estimate equivalent SAVEs for outcome events associated with the progression and treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The estimated equivalent SAVEs were applied to the outputs of an existing decision analytic model for early breast cancer. The web-based PTO survey was undertaken by 1094 respondents. Validation tests showed that 68 % of eligible responses revealed consistent ordering of responses and 32 % displayed ordinal transitivity, while 37 % of respondents showing consistency and ordinal transitivity approached cardinal transitivity. Using consistent and ordinally transitive responses, the mean incremental cost per SAVE gained was A 3.72 pound million. Further research is required to improve the validity of the SAVE, which may include a simpler web-based survey format or a face-to-face format to facilitate more informed responses. A validated method for estimating equivalent SAVEs is unlikely to replace the QALY as the globally preferred measure of outcome, but the SAVE may provide a useful alternative for localized decision makers with relatively small, constrained budgets-for example, in programme budgeting and marginal analysis.","[Karnon, Jonathan; Partington, Andrew] Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Karnon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Populat Hlth, Level 7,178 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jonathan.karnon@adelaide.edu.au,"Partington, Andrew/H-9884-2019","Partington, Andrew/0000-0003-2580-3355; Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,23,3,3,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2015,33,12,,,,,1281,1288,,10.1007/s40273-015-0308-5,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,CX5BW,26100285.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365717000005,0

To this end, various flexible distributions that are capable of modelling the asymmetric and tailed behaviour of returns have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the generalized lambda distribution (GLD) to capture the skewed and leptokurtic behaviour of exchange rate returns. We do this by conducting a comprehensive numerical study to compare the performance of the GLD against the performances of the skewed t distribution, the unbounded Johnson family of distributions and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution. Our results suggest that in terms of the value-at-risk and expected shortfall, the GLD shows at least similar performance to the skewed t distribution and the NIG distribution. Considering the ease in GLD's use for random variate generation in Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that the GLD can be a good alternative in various financial applications where modelling of the heavy tail behaviour is critical.","[Corlu, Canan G.] Boston Univ, Metropolitan Coll, Boston, MA 02109 USA; [Corlu, Alper] RBS Citizens, Boston, MA 02109 USA",Boston University,"Corlu, CG (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Metropolitan Coll, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",canan@bu.edu,,,TUBITAK (Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council) [111M425],TUBITAK (Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This work was supported in part by TUBITAK (Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council) Grant [111M425].,,43,23,27,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Particularly, it analyzes the model and parameter risk from the provider's perspective. We compare two different forms of investment guarantees: Interest Rate Guarantees (IRG) and Lookback Guarantees (LBG). Via Monte Carlo simulation, the prices of the embedded investment guarantees are estimated assuming the underlying to evolve according to a normal or double-exponential jump diffusion model. The input parameters are derived from empirical data for various asset classes. In a first step, the parameters of the IRG and the LBG are adjusted such the prices of these two guarantees are equal. In a second step, a detailed comparison is made between the price sensitivities of both guarantee forms when the initial modelling parameters are changed. Finally, we investigate how parameter changes affect the investor payoff under the different guarantee forms and model assumptions used for the dynamic of the underlying. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We determine the asset prices in equilibrium in the economy with regime switching, and derive a system of partial differential equations for the asset prices and the short interest rate. The solutions for the endogenous short interest rate, the bond price and the yield of the bond are obtained. We also consider applications of the equilibrium model and show that the model implies a rich framework for the term structure of interest rates. We demonstrate how the regime switching economy helps to improve the model-implied annual excess rate of return. This assists in explaining the famous equity premium puzzle.","[Shen, Jia; Elliott, Robert J.] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Finance Div, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Elliott, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Finance Div, Calgary, AB, Canada.",relliott@ucalgary.ca,,"Elliott, Robert/0000-0002-5486-6999",,,,,32,0,0,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

These two classes of problems include many existing and contemporary optimal insurance problems as interesting examples being prevalent in the literature. To solve these problems, we apply the Karlin-Novikoff-Stoyan-Taylor multiple-crossing conditions, which is a useful sufficient criterion in the theory of convex ordering, to replace an arbitrary insurance indemnity by a more favorable one in convex order sense. The convex ordering established provides a unifying approach to solve the special cases of the problem classes.

The objective is to maximize the total expected discounted utility of dividend payment until financial ruin. Using dynamic programming principle, the value function is the solution of a second-order nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The subsolution supersolution method is used to verify the existence of classical solutions of the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation. The explicit solution of the value function is derived and the corresponding optimal debt ratio and dividend payment strategies are obtained in some special cases.

The equilibrium is constrained efficient, assigning more bidders to auctioneers with larger gains from trade. The choice of the trading mechanism is crucial for the result. Most notably, the use of second-price auctions (equivalently, ex post bidding) leads to the nonexistence of any informative equilibrium.

Optimal payoffs have their lowest outcomes when the economy is in a downturn, and this feature is often at odds with the needs of many investors. We introduce a framework for portfolio selection within which state-dependent preferences can be accommodated. Specifically, we assume that investors care about the distribution of final wealth and its interaction with some benchmark. In this context, we are able to characterize optimal payoffs in explicit form. Furthermore, we extend the classical expected utility optimization problem of Merton to the state-dependent situation.

A growing body of evidence supports the need for a multi-pronged, clinic-based approach that leverages the synergy between pharmaceutical and lifestyle modification. Recent US policy changes-namely, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act coupled with recognition of obesity as a disease by the American Medical Association-suggest that financial incentives and attitudes towards obesity management are changing. This paradigm shift has implications for current and future obesity pharmacotherapy. However, barriers to pharmacotherapy utilization include patient and physician perceptions of modest efficacy, historical safety issues, regulatory obstacles, and lack of reimbursement. The shifting attitudes and challenges associated not only with a multi-payer system, but also the lack of clearly defined cross-payer reimbursement strategies, prompted a survey to determine coverage for obesity treatment. Participants indicated that federal/state mandates and growth of quality-driven healthcare initiatives will eventually drive wider pharmacotherapy reimbursement within 1-5 years. There are signs that federal/state programs are already moving towards reimbursement by improving quality measures to track obesity outcomes and reduce costs. Future research on clinical and economic outcomes of combination weight-management programs coupled with innovative approaches (e.g., eHealth) in the real-world setting that demonstrate value to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and employers will help reshape obesity management by reducing barriers and broadening reimbursement coverage for anti-obesity pharmacotherapy.","[Baum, Charles; Wittbrodt, Eric; Szymanski, Keith; Turpin, Robin] Takeda Pharmaceut USA, US Med Affairs, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Andino, Katherine] Takeda Pharmaceut USA, Obes Mkt, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Stewart, Shelley] Takeda Pharmaceut Amer Inc, Fed Govt & External Affairs, Washington, DC USA",Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

The first step involves estimation of a GARCH model using quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and the second step uses model filtered returns with the skewed t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio [J. R. Stat. Soc. B, 2003, 65, 367-389]. The predictive performance of this method is compared to the single-step joint estimation of the same data generating process, to the well-known GARCH-Evt model and to a comprehensive set of other market risk models. Backtesting results show that the proposed two-step method outperforms most benchmarks including the classical joint estimation method of same data generating process and it performs competitively with respect to the GARCH-Evt model. This paper recommends two robust models to risk managers of emerging market stock portfolios. Both models are estimated in two steps: the GJR-GARCH-Evt model and the two-step GARCH-St model proposed in this study.","Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Risk & Policy Anal, Supervis Regulat & Credit, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Ergen, I (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Risk & Policy Anal, Supervis Regulat & Credit, 502 S Sharp St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",ibrahim.ergen@rich.frb.org,"ergen, ibrahim/R-4233-2019",,,,,,45,15,15,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This article aims to provide some insight into the question by drawing lessons from the literature. The definition of economic theory' includes a broad range of examples, such as accounting identities, disaggregation and spatial restrictions when forecasting aggregate variables, cointegration and forecasting with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. We group the lessons into three themes. For the first, we discuss the importance of using the correct econometric tools when answering the question. For the second, we present examples of theory-based forecasting that have not proven useful, such as theory-driven variable selection and some popular DSGE models. For the third set of lessons, we discuss types of theoretical restrictions that have shown some usefulness in forecasting, such as accounting identities, disaggregation and spatial restrictions, and cointegrating relationships. We conclude by suggesting that economic theory might help in overcoming the widespread instability that affects the forecasting performance of econometric models by guiding the search for stable relationships that could be usefully exploited for forecasting.","[Giacomini, Raffaella] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England; [Giacomini, Raffaella] Inst Fiscal Studies, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 7AE, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University College London,"Giacomini, R (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, 30 Gordon St, London WC1H 0AX, England.",r.giacomini@ucl.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant [RES-589-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/L500343/1, ES/H021221/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, ES/L500343/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I thank the editor, Richard Smith, and an anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions, and I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant RES-589-28-0001.",,63,12,13,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

Yet, bilateral linkages are often unobserved, and maximum entropy serves as the leading method for estimating counterparty exposures. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that combines information-theoretic arguments with economic incentives to produce more realistic interbank networks that preserve important characteristics of the original interbank market. The method loads the most probable links with the largest exposures consistent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank, yielding networks with minimum density. When used in a stress-testing context, the minimum-density solution overestimates contagion, whereas maximum entropy underestimates it. Using the two benchmarks side-by-side defines a useful range that bounds the cost of contagion in the true interbank network when counterparty exposures are unknown.","[Anand, Kartik] Bank Canada, Financial Stabil Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Craig, Ben] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Craig, Ben] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44101 USA; [Von Peter, Goetz] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",Bank of Canada; Deutsche Bank; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Von Peter, G (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Cent Bahnpl 2, Basel, Switzerland.",Goetz.von.Peter@bis.org,,"Anand, Kartik/0000-0002-3081-3470",,,,,32,129,141,5,83,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

There is a clear need for such an analysis, since any discussion about nonstationarity presumes we know when component models are stationary.

In the present paper, we construct efficient conformal deformations of the contours of integration in the pricing formulas for barrier options and CDS in the setting of spectrally one-sided Levy models, taking advantage of Rogers's trick [J. Appl. Prob., 2000, 37, 1173-1180] that greatly simplifies calculation of the Wiener-Hopf factors. We extend the trick to wide classes of Levy processes of infinite variation with zero diffusion component. In the resulting formulas (both in the finite variation and the infinite variation cases), we make quasi-parabolic deformations as in Boyarchenko and Levendorskii [Int. J. Theor. Appl. Finance, 2013, 16 (3), 1350011], which greatly increase the rate of convergence of the integrals. We demonstrate that in many cases the proposed method is more accurate than the standard realization of Laplace inversion. We also exhibit examples in which the standard realization is so unstable that it cannot be used for any choice of the error control parameters. This may lead to a ghost calibration: a situation where a parameter set of a model is declared to be a 'good fit' to the data only because the errors of calibration and of the numerical method used for pricing (almost) cancel each other out.","[Boyarchenko, Mitya] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levendorskii, Sergei] Univ Leicester, Dept Math, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Leicester,"Levendorskii, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Math, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",sl278@leicester.ac.uk,,,"NSF [DMS-1001769, DMS-1302162]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Supported by the NSF grants DMS-1001769 and DMS-1302162.,,39,14,14,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The financial market consists of cash, bond and stock. Similar to Guan and Liang (2014), we assume that the instantaneous interest rate is an affine process including the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and Vasicek model. However, we assume that the expected return of the stock follows a completely different mean-reverting process, which can well display the bear and bull features of the market, and the market price of the stock index is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The pension manager thus has to undertake the risks of interest rate and market price of stock index. Besides, a special stochastic contribution rate is formulated. The goal of the pension manager is to maximize the expected terminal value and minimize the variance of terminal value. We will use the technique developed by Guan and Liang (2014) to tackle this problem and derive the closed-forms of efficient frontier and strategies.

It provides detail on three rounds of choosing a research director for CC in 1937-38, in 1939 and, particularly, at the end of 1942. Haavelmo's work in the early 1940s came to play a major role for the econometric research at the Cowles Commission under Jacob Marschak as research director 1943-48. The article points to the importance of Abraham Wald and Jacob Marschak for the success of Haavelmo's venture and its influence and tells the story of how it came about that Haavelmo's ideas were adopted, applied, and disseminated by the Cowles Commission. Thus the mention of Trygve Haavelmo in the title is referring also to his econometric ideas. The ideas themselves and their further evolvement at the CC have been a dominating theme in the history of econometrics literature, e.g., Hildreth (1986), Epstein (1987), Morgan (1990), Qin (1993), and Christ (1994). The article discusses the recruitment, the inner workings, and various other concerns of the Cowles econometricians, from Marxism to Black Magic. It recounts at some length the efforts made by Marschak to recruit Abraham Wald to the University of Chicago and the Cowles Commission.

The School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) and produced a critical review of the evidence of the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The GEMINI II and III trials formed the main supporting evidence for the intervention. Both studies were phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab. They included patients who were na < ve to tumour necrosis factor alpha antagonist (anti-TNF-alpha) therapy and patients who had an inadequate response to, loss of response to or intolerance of immunomodulators or anti-TNF-alpha agents. GEMINI II was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab as an induction treatment (dosing at weeks 0 and 2, with assessment at week 6) and maintenance treatment (during weeks 6-52). In contrast, GEMINI III was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab as an induction treatment only, with doses at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and assessment at weeks 6 and 10. In the absence of any direct head-to-head, randomised, controlled trials comparing vedolizumab with other relevant biologic therapies (adalimumab and infliximab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, the company conducted a network meta-analysis, which compared vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab and placebo for the outcomes of clinical response, enhanced clinical response, clinical remission and discontinuation due to adverse events. The company model estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vedolizumab compared with the standard of care (consisting of 5-aminosalicylic acids, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) to be A 21,620 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained within the anti-TNF-alpha-failure population (which included a confidential patient access scheme for vedolizumab). The ICERs were above A 30,000 pound per QALY gained for the mixed intention-to-treat population (including both anti-TNF-alpha-na < ve and anti-TNF-alpha-failure populations) and in patients who were anti-TNF-alpha na < ve only. The ERG identified a number of limitations that were believed to limit the robustness of the results presented by the company. These limitations could not be addressed by the ERG without major restructuring of the economic model. Therefore, the ERG concluded that the results from the company's model needed to be interpreted with caution and that it was unclear whether the ICERs would increase or decrease following amendment of the identified structural issues.","[Rafia, Rachid; Scope, Alison; Harnan, Sue; Stevens, John W.; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Lobo, Alan] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Gastroenterol Serv, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Rafia, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.rafia@sheffield.ac.uk,"Scope, Alison/E-5368-2010","Scope, Alison/0000-0003-1604-1758; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [13/128/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project Number 13/128/01).

The developments of autologous and characterised chondrocyte implantation have provided new treatment options but have large upfront costs. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of characterised chondrocyte implantation in the UK National Health Service. Methods An economic model was constructed in Microsoft Excel((R)), with patients undergoing either microfracture or chondrocyte implantation. Following treatment failure, patients can undergo a series of interventions, ultimately ending in knee replacement. Effectiveness and utility were modelled using clinical trial data, which were supplemented with synthesised registry data, and costs were taken from published sources. Results were expressed in clinical events, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and British pounds. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5 % per year. Results Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to reduce the lifetime probability of knee replacement by 50 % in comparison with microfracture, and to increase QALYs by 0.72 (16.57 vs. 15.85). Costs were estimated to be 23,307 pound for chondrocyte implantation, and 8008 pound for microfracture, with the incremental cost of 15,299 pound for chondrocyte implantation reflecting reduced resource use offsetting some of the procedure cost. These values gave a cost per QALY gained of 21,245 pound. Conclusion Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to provide substantial patient benefits over a lifetime horizon, with a considerable increase in QALYs. Despite the increase in costs, the procedure is cost effective at standard thresholds used in the UK.","[Elvidge, Jamie; Bullement, Ash; Hatswell, Anthony J.] BresMed, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，BresMed, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.;Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Stat Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",ahatswell@bresmed.co.uk,"Bullement, Ash/IVV-3411-2023; Bullement, Ash/AEO-3423-2022","Bullement, Ash/0000-0001-7091-0972; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",,,,,35,13,14,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2016,34,11,,,,,1145,1159,,10.1007/s40273-016-0423-y,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EA6RE,27318837.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386755700007,0

This is important for decision makers when reviewing reimbursement decisions, prices, and considering other drugs for the same condition. Differences can arise from differences in patient characteristics, but also from the availability of new evidence and evolving treatment practices. This paper examines these issues using a case study. Methods In 2001, the Australian Government funded trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer through the Herceptin Program. The administrative arrangements of the Program resulted in rich observational data that captured information about patients treated with trastuzumab between 2001 and 2010 (n = 3830). The dataset included patient characteristics, dispensed medicines, medical service use and date of death. Results Compared to participants in the clinical trials, patients were older, received more prior chemotherapies and a broader range of co-administered chemotherapies. Treatment practices differed from the clinical trials, but also changed over time. For example, in situ hybridization testing, rather than immunohistochemistry testing, and a three weekly administration schedule, rather than one weekly, were increasingly used. Compared to the clinical trials, patients administered trastuzumab with a concomitant chemotherapy generally experienced longer overall survival (151.3 weeks, 95 % CI: 142.6, 163.4), while those who received trastuzumab as a monotherapy experienced shorter overall survival (94.4 weeks, 95%CI: 86.4, 102.9). These findings may be due to a differing relative treatment effect in clinical practice, but may also be due to a range of other factors. Conclusion This analysis demonstrates the challenges for decision makers that arise because new evidence and evolving treatment practices create a gap between clinical trial data and real-world clinical practice and outcomes.","[Parkinson, Bonny] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Room 540,5th Floor,Bldg E4A, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Parkinson, Bonny; Viney, Rosalie; Haas, Marion; Goodall, Stephen] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pearson, Sallie-Anne] Univ New South Wales, Med Policy Res Unit, Ctr Big Data Res Hlth, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Srasuebkul, Preeyaporn] Univ New South Wales, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pearson, Sallie-Anne] Univ Sydney, Fac Pharm, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Technology Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Parkinson, B (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Room 540,5th Floor,Bldg E4A, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;Parkinson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",bonny.parkinson@mq.edu.au,"Parkinson, Bonny/F-6445-2010; Srasuebkul, Preeyaporn/HNI-5834-2023; Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017","Srasuebkul, Preeyaporn/0000-0002-6252-1368; Parkinson, Bonny/0000-0002-2137-0962; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Capacity Building Grant in Health Services Research (NHMRC) [571926]; Australian NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Medicines and Ageing Grant [1060407]; Cancer Australia Grant [568773]; National Breast Cancer Foundation [PD-13-01] Funding Source: researchfish,Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Capacity Building Grant in Health Services Research (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Medicines and Ageing Grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Cancer Australia Grant; National Breast Cancer Foundation,"The research reported in this paper is supported by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Capacity Building Grant in Health Services Research (NHMRC ID: 571926), an Australian NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Medicines and Ageing Grant (ID: 1060407) and a Cancer Australia Grant (ID: 568773).",,45,12,12,0,21,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2016,34,10,,,,,1039,1050,,10.1007/s40273-016-0411-2,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OR,27207252.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383551500008,0

A major issue for portfolio managers of liability driven institutions is that no benchmark is given to them, although they face mid-term objectives with short term constraints. No performance attribution methodology may then be used to serve as a reference. Assessing the performance of the asset manager as an agent, represents a major stake for the institution as a principal delegating a mandate of asset management. We propose an optimal asset allocation approach taking into account liability constraints to build a benchmark. This benchmark will be used to compare the ex-post effective performance of the asset manager to the effective performance of the ex-ante optimal dynamic asset allocation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a two-stage strategy is developed to characterize the underlying risk attitude involved in a risk evaluation, when executed by the family of distortion risk measures. First, we show that aggregation indicators defined for Choquet integrals provide information about the implicit global risk attitude of the agent. Second, an analysis of the distortion function offers a local description of the agent's stance on risk in relation to the occurrence of accumulated losses. Here, the concepts of absolute risk attitude and local risk attitude arise naturally. An example is provided to illustrate the usefulness of this strategy for characterizing risk attitudes in an insurance company. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of variance targeting estimation, recent research has pointed out that at least finite fourth moments of the data generating process is required, if one wants to perform inference in GARCH models by relying on asymptotic normality of the estimator. Such moment conditions may not be satisfied in practice for financial returns, highlighting a potential drawback of variance targeting estimation. In this paper, we consider the large-sample properties of the variance targeting estimator for the multivariate extended constant conditional correlation GARCH model when the distribution of the data generating process has infinite fourth moments. Using nonstandard limit theory, we derive new results for the estimator stating that, under suitable conditions, its limiting distribution is multivariate stable. The rate of consistency of the estimator is slower than root T and depends on the tail shape of the data generating process. A simulation study illustrates the derived properties of the targeting estimator.","[Pedersen, Rasmus Sondergaard] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Pedersen, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oester Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",rsp@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,47,7,7,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

This is the first study that explicitly considers the separability condition which has been ignored in previous literature. Under this pricing structure, the price changes when consumption exceeds a certain threshold and the consumer faces a utility maximization problem subject to a piecewise-linear budget constraint. Solving this maximization problem leads to a statistical model in which model parameters are strongly restricted by the separability condition. In this article, by taking a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we implement a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to properly estimate the demand function. We find, however, that the convergence of the distribution of simulated samples to the posterior distribution is slow, requiring an additional scale transformation step for parameters to the Gibbs sampler. These proposed methods are then applied to estimate the Japanese residential water demand function.","[Miyawaki, Koji] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Omori, Yasuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Hibiki, Akira] Sophia Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 102, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; University of Tokyo; Sophia University,"Omori, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",omori@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Hibiki, Akira/AAE-3851-2019","Hibiki, Akira/0000-0001-5955-492X; Omori, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-7896-6177","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology [18330039, 21243018]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26245028, 21243018, 25245035, 18330039] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work is supported by the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research 18330039, 21243018 from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology as well as by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship.",,35,1,1,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

However, it has considerable short-run risk since the utility is logarithmic, with essentially zero Arrow-Pratt risk aversion. It is common to control risk with a Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint defined on the end of horizon wealth. A more effective approach is to impose a VaR constraint at each time on the wealth path. In this paper, we provide a method to obtain the maximum growth while staying above an ex-ante discrete time wealth path with high probability, where shortfalls below the path are penalized with a convex function of the shortfall. The effect of the path VaR condition and shortfall penalties is a lower growth rate than the Kelly strategy, but the downside risk is under control.

Using the elastic net penalty, of which the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) is a special case, we establish a finite sample oracle inequality which bounds the loss of our estimator from above with high probability. If the unknown target is linear, this inequality also provides an upper bound of the estimation error of the estimated parameter vector. Next, we use the non-asymptotic results to show that the excess loss of our estimator is asymptotically of the same order as that of the oracle. If the target is linear, we give sufficient conditions for consistency of the estimated parameter vector. We briefly discuss how a thresholded version of our estimator can be used to perform consistent variable selection. We give two examples of loss functions covered by our framework.","[Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 452 Arps Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kock, Anders Bredahl] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kock, Anders Bredahl] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 452 Arps Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",caner.12@osu.edu,,,Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78],Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),Financial support from the Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF78) is gratefully acknowledged.,,30,2,2,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Traditionally, funded and unfunded pension schemes have been viewed as opposite solutions for the first pillar of public pensions. However, more recently countries as Sweden and Poland have explored mixed solutions that combine pay-as-you-go (PAYG) with funding mechanisms. The aims of this paper are to examine the rationality of such a combination using portfolio theory arguments and to find the optimal split of the contributions between the two systems. We first introduce the classical deterministic model leading to the well-known Samuelson-Aaron rule according to which diversification is never optimal. We then introduce different stochastic models in which the main processes (wage growth, population growth, financial rate of return) are random. In particular, we obtain conditions on parameters to justify diversification and explicit optimal sharing between PAYG and funding. We also introduce the possibility of investing in several financial assets and explore the impact of introducing systematic longevity risk.","[Devolder, Pierre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Actuarial Sci ISBA, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Melis, Roberta] Univ Mercatorum, Dept Econ, I-00178 Rome, Italy; [Melis, Roberta] CRENoS Ctr North South Econ Res, Cagliari, Italy",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universita Telematica Mercatorum,"Devolder, P (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Actuarial Sci ISBA, 20 Voie Roman Pays, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",pierre.devolder@uclouvain.be; r.melis@unimercatorum.it,,"Melis, Roberta/0000-0002-1066-8683",,,,,15,11,12,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2015,45,3,,,,,551,575,,10.1017/asb.2015.14,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CP5UC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359949100003,0

It answers the general question of optimal scheduling but the very question of the actual way to proceed with liquidation is rarely dealt with. Our model, which incorporates both price risk and nonexecution risk, is an attempt to tackle this question using limit orders. The very general framework we propose to model liquidation with limit orders generalizes existing ones in two ways. We consider a risk-averse agent, whereas the model of Bayraktar and Ludkovski only tackles the case of a risk-neutral one. We consider very general functional forms for the execution process intensity, whereas Gueant, Lehalle and Fernandez-Tapia are restricted to exponential intensity. Eventually, we link the execution cost function of Almgren-Chriss models to the intensity function in our model, providing then a way to see Almgren-Chriss models as a limit of ours.","[Gueant, Olivier] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Jacques Louis Lions, UFR Math, F-75013 Paris, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] Capital Fund Management, Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Guéant, O (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Jacques Louis Lions, UFR Math, 5 Rue Thomas Mann, F-75013 Paris, France.",gueant@ljll.univ-paris-diderot.fr,"Lehalle, Charles-Albert/H-5700-2019","Lehalle, Charles-Albert/0000-0002-9978-9501",Research Initiative Microstructure des marches financiers under the aegis of the Europlace Institute of Finance,Research Initiative Microstructure des marches financiers under the aegis of the Europlace Institute of Finance,"This research was partially supported by the Research Initiative Microstructure des marches financiers under the aegis of the Europlace Institute of Finance.

In this model, individuals belong to two unobserved types: the endogenous type, which may move in response to the neighborhood effect on their education; or the exogenous type, which may move for reasons unrelated to education. The Heckman sample selection model becomes a special case of the current model in which the probability of one type of individuals is zero. Although we cannot find any significant neighborhood effect in the usual Heckman sample selection model, we do find heterogeneous effects in our two-type model. In particular, there is a substantial neighborhood effect for the movers who belong to the endogenous type. No significant effects exist for other groups. We also find that the endogenous type has more education and moves more often than the exogenous type. On average, we find that the neighborhood variable, the percentage of high school graduates in the neighborhood, accounts for about 28.96% of the education gap between blacks and whites.","[Dong, Yan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Gan, Li] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Wang, Yingning] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Hlth & Aging, San Francisco, CA USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Gan, L (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",gan@econmail.tamu.edu,,,,,,,59,1,3,0,53,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We propose a test statistic under a set of identification conditions considered by Hoderlein et al.

The test statistic is motivated from the observation that, under the additive error structure, the partial derivative of the nonparametric structural function with respect to the error term is one under identification. The asymptotic distribution of the test is established, and a bootstrap version is proposed to enhance its finite sample performance. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test has proper size and reasonable power in finite samples.","[Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Tu, Yundong] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Tu, Yundong] Peking Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Aman] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Singapore Management University; Peking University; Peking University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Su, LJ (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",ljsu@smu.edu.sg,"SU, Liangjun/D-1445-2009; ullah, aman/JQW-5104-2023","ullah, aman/0000-0002-7822-9222; Su, Liangjun/0000-0002-0565-6928","Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2012-T2-2-021]; UCR, Academic Senate","Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); UCR, Academic Senate","The first author acknowledges financial support from the Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund under grant number MOE2012-T2-2-021.

The disorder results in high societal costs. Policymakers increasingly use health economic evaluations to inform decisions on competing treatments of ADHD. Yet, health economic evaluations of first-choice medication of ADHD in children and adolescents are scarce and generally do not include broader societal effects. Objectives This study presents a probabilistic model and analysis of methylphenidate osmotic-release oral system (OROS) versus methylphenidate immediate-release (IR). We investigate and include relevant societal aspects in the analysis so as to provide cost-effectiveness estimates based on a broad societal perspective. Methods We enhanced an existing Markov model and determined the cost effectiveness of OROS versus IR for children and adolescents responding suboptimally to treatment with IR. Enhancements included screening of a broad literature base, updated utility values, inclusion of costs and effects on caregivers and a change of the model type from deterministic to probabilistic. Results The base case scenario resulted in lower incremental costs (a,not signa'5815) of OROS compared with IR and higher incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains (0.22). Scenario analyses were performed to determine sensitivity to changes in transition rates, utility of caregivers, medical costs of caregivers and daily medication dose. Conclusions The results indicate that, for children responding suboptimally to treatment with IR, the beneficial effect of OROS on compliance may be worth the additional costs of medication. The presented model adds to the health economic information available for policymakers and to considerations on a broader perspective in cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Schawo, Saskia; Bouwmans, Clazien; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Schawo, Saskia; Bouwmans, Clazien; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Kolk, Annemarie] Janssen Cilag BV, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Econ Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Annemans, Lieven] Univ Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmaco Epidemiol & Pharmaco Econ, Groningen, Netherlands; [Buitelaar, Jan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Nijmegen Ctr Evidence Based Med, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Buitelaar, Jan] Karakter Child & Adolescent Psychiat Univ Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Agthoven, Michel] Gilead Sci Netherlands BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Johnson & Johnson; Ghent University; University of Groningen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Gilead Sciences,"Schawo, S (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Room J5-055,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",hakkaart@bmg.eur.nl,"Buitelaar, Jan Koenraad/AAY-7522-2020; Schawo, Saskia J/D-9805-2013","Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona/0000-0003-0635-7388; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653","Janssen-Cilag B.V., Tilburg (the Netherlands); Johnson Johnson","Janssen-Cilag B.V., Tilburg (the Netherlands); Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA)","The study was funded by Janssen-Cilag B.V., Tilburg (the Netherlands), a pharmaceutical company of Johnson & Johnson.

Stochastic volatility in this model is driven by an observed duration process and a latent autoregressive process. Parameter estimation in the model is carried out by using a method of simulated moments (MSM) due to its analytical tractability and numerical stability for the proposed model. Simulations are conducted to validate the choice of moments used in the formulation of MSM. Both simulation and empirical results indicate that the proposed MSM works well for the model. The main empirical findings from the analysis of IBM transaction return data include: (i) the return distribution conditional on the duration process is not Gaussian, even though the duration process itself can marginally serve as a directing process; (ii) the return process is highly leveraged; (iii) longer trade duration tends to be associated with higher return volatility; and (iv) the proposed model is capable of reproducing a return process whose marginal density function is close to that of the empirical return process.","[Feng, Dingan] CIBC, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Song, Peter X. -K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wirjanto, Tony S.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Wirjanto, Tony S.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Accounting & Finance, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Wirjanto, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",twirjant@uwaterloo.ca,,"Wirjanto, Tony/0000-0003-1324-9131",,,,,35,2,2,1,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The experimental analogy forms the linchpin of the methodology for passive observation that he develops in his famous monograph, The Probability Approach in Econometrics (1944). Contrary to some recent interpretations of Haavelmo's method, the experimental analogy does not commit Haavelmo to a strong apriorism in which econometrics can only test and reject theoretical hypotheses, rather it supports the acquisition of knowledge through a two-way exchange between theory and empirical evidence. Once the details of the analogy are systematically understood, the experimental analogy can be used to shed light on theory-consistent cointegrated vector autoregression (CVAR) scenario analyses. A CVAR scenario analysis can be interpreted as a clear example of Haavelmo's 'experimental' approach; and, in turn, it can be shown to extend and develop Haavelmo's methodology and to address issues that Haavelmo regarded as unresolved.","[Hoover, Kevin] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Juselius, Katarina] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",Duke University; University of Copenhagen,"Hoover, K (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",kd.hoover@duke.edu,,,,,,,47,9,9,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The disease is associated with increased healthcare resource use and costs, therefore cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) can be used to assist decision makers with determining which treatments are optimal within a constrained healthcare system budget. Our aim was to systematically review the current literature on the CEA of existing treatment options for psoriasis, assess the quality of these studies, and summarize the evidence on the drivers of cost effectiveness. A literature search using Medical Subject Headings and keywords was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Health Technology Assessment databases, as well as the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database; the CEA Registry was searched using keywords only. All references within the relevant review articles were examined manually. Two researchers independently determined the final articles and a third researcher resolved any discrepancies. We evaluated study quality in terms of the study perspective, effectiveness measures, cost measures, economic model, and time horizon. Any sensitivity analyses conducted in the studies were examined to identify the drivers of cost effectiveness, which included any variables leading to changes in the study conclusions. Fifty-three articles were included in our final review: 70 % did not explicitly include costs related to adverse events; approximately one-quarter used quality-adjusted life-years; and 34 % applied a time horizon under 1 year. In 18 of the 38 studies that conducted a sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness results were impacted by uncertainty. The main key drivers of cost effectiveness were the costs related to the treatment, values and choice of efficacy, utility values, hospitalization for non-responders, time horizon, model structure, and utility mapping method. High-quality cost-effectiveness studies are required to facilitate resource allocation decision making. To improve study quality, future research should provide evidence on the long-term experience with psoriasis treatments, and resolve the uncertainty associated with key drivers of cost effectiveness.","[Zhang, Wei; Islam, Nazrul; Ma, Canice; Anis, Aslam H.] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Zhang, Wei; Islam, Nazrul; Anis, Aslam H.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",St. Paul's Hospital; University of British Columbia,"Anis, AH (通讯作者)，St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, 588-1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.",aslam.anis@ubc.ca,"Islam, Nazrul/E-8592-2015; Zhang, Wei/P-3692-2016","Islam, Nazrul/0000-0003-3982-4325; Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-7988-1979",Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship Award; Canadian Institutes of Health Research through Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship,Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship Award; Canadian Institutes of Health Research through Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),Wei Zhang is a recipient of the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship Award.

Numerical tests illustrate the accuracy of the approximation, and highlight its computational advantages over a direct Monte Carlo simulation of the original stochastic system.","[Giesecke, Kay; Sirignano, Justin A.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Spiliopoulos, Konstantinos] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Sowers, Richard B.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA",Stanford University; Boston University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Spiliopoulos, K (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Math & Stat, 111 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kspiliop@math.bu.edu,,"Sowers, Richard/0000-0002-0531-7918",Directorate For Engineering; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities [1024837] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Directorate For Engineering; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),,,31,37,42,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Pangasius is currently highly demanded in the world market. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of slaughter weight on carcass and meat quality of Punga fish. Two hundred and forty Punga fish from a commercial farm were divided into three groups, 80 fish for each group, based on average target body weights of 700, 900 and 1200 g, respectively. Meat quality was investigated in two muscle sections, the dorsal and the ventral fillet. Carcass quality (dressing and fillet percentage) did not change with slaughter weight. Fillet pH measured at 45 min and 24 h gradually decreased from 6.68 to 5.98 and 6.66 to 5.97 in dorsal and ventral fillet, respectively. Drip loss was larger in the dorsal fillet of the groups weighing 900 and 1200 g. The highest fat percentage was found in the ventral section of fish group weighing 1200 g. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were increased in every group and meat section with storage. It was highest in the ventral section of the group weighing 1200 g. In addition, a greater collagen concentration was found in ventral than in the dorsal fillet. Otherwise, slaughter weight and muscle section did not have significant effects on thawing loss, moisture and protein percentage. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding how fundamental drivers impact the probability of extreme price occurrences in the German day-ahead electricity market. We develop models using fundamental variables to predict the probability of extreme prices. The dynamics of negative prices and positive price spikes differ greatly. Positive spikes are related to high demand, low supply and high prices the previous days, and mainly occur during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Negative prices occur mainly during the night and are closely related to low demand combined with high wind production levels. Furthermore, we do a closer analysis of how renewable energy sources, hereby photovoltaic and wind power, impact the probability of negative prices and positive spikes. The models confirm that extremely high and negative prices have different drivers, and that wind power is particularly important in relation to negative price occurrences. The models capture the main drivers of both positive and negative extreme price occurrences and perform well with respect to accurately forecasting the probability with high levels of confidence. Our results suggest that probability models are well suited to aid in risk management for market participants in day-ahead electricity markets.","[Hagfors, Lars Ivar; Kamperud, Hilde Horthe; Sator, Alma; Westgaard, Sjur] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Alfred Getz Vei 3, N-7041 Trondheim, Norway; [Paraschiv, Florentina] Univ St Gallen, Inst Operat Res & Computat Finance, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Prokopczuk, Marcel] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Sch Econ & Management, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of St Gallen; Leibniz University Hannover,"Hagfors, LI (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Alfred Getz Vei 3, N-7041 Trondheim, Norway.",lars.i.hagfors@iot.ntnu.no,,,E.ON Stipendienfonds,E.ON Stipendienfonds,Marcel Prokopczuk and Sjur Westgaard gratefully acknowledge financial support from E.ON Stipendienfonds.,,36,37,37,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We present a modification with a new spin: building nim. With given finite numbers of tokens and stacks, this two-player game is played in two stages (thus belonging to the same family of games as e.g. nine-men's morris): first building, where players alternate to put one token on one of the, initially empty, stacks until all tokens have been used. Then, the players play nim. Of course, because the solution for the game of nim is known, the goal of the player who starts nim play is a placement of the tokens so that the Nim-sum of the stack heights at the end of building is different from 0. This game is trivial if the total number of tokens is odd as the Nim-sum could never be 0, or if both the number of tokens and the number of stacks are even, since a simple mimicking strategy results in a Nim-sum of 0 after each of the second player's moves.

This heterogeneous framework enables us to capture dynamics at multiple timescales, expanding the model's applications and improving precision. We study the heterogeneous model theoretically and empirically to highlight essential mechanisms underlying certain market behaviours, such as transitions between bull and bear markets and the self-similar behaviour of price changes. Most importantly, we apply this model to show that the stock market is nearly efficient on intraday timescales, adjusting quickly to incoming news, but becomes inefficient on longer timescales, where news may have a long-lasting nonlinear impact on dynamics, attributable to a feedback mechanism acting over these horizons. Then, using the model, we design algorithmic strategies that utilize news flow, quantified and measured, as the only input to trade on market return forecasts over multiple horizons, from days to months. The backtested results suggest that the return is predictable to the extent that successful trading strategies can be constructed to harness this predictability.","[Kroujiline, Dimitri] LGT Capital Partners, Pfaffikon, Switzerland; [Gusev, Maxim; Govorkov, Boris] IBC Quantitat Strategies, Tarnaby, Sweden; [Ushanov, Dmitry] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Mech & Math, Moscow, Russia; [Sharov, Sergey V.] Lobachevsky State Univ, Adv Sch Gen & Appl Phys, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Kroujiline, D (通讯作者)，LGT Capital Partners, Pfaffikon, Switzerland.",dimitri.kroujiline@lgt.com,,,LGT Capital Partners,LGT Capital Partners,"We are grateful to LGT Capital Partners for partially funding this project and to Dow Jones & Company for providing access to the Factiva.com news archive.

To achieve this we analyse two real-life cases in which the market conditions are different, namely during the 2008 credit crisis where risks are high and a period after the crisis in 2014, where volatility levels are low. The Heston model is extended by adding two Hull-White components which are calibrated to fit the EURUSD volatility surfaces. We then present future exposure profiles and credit value adjustments (CVAs) for plain vanilla cross-currency swaps (CCYS), barrier and American options and compare the different results when Heston-Hull-White-Hull-White or Black-Scholes dynamics are assumed. It is observed that the stochastic volatility has a significant impact on all the derivatives. For CCYS, some of the impact can be reduced by allowing for time-dependent variance. We further confirmed that Barrier options exposure and CVA is highly sensitive to volatility dynamics and that American options' risk dynamics are significantly affected by the uncertainty in the interest rates.","[Simaitis, S.; de Graaf, C.

The quantification of these costs using claims data may be affected by the method for defining diagnoses. Objectives The aims were to use panel data analysis to estimate diabetes-related healthcare costs and to comparatively evaluate the effects of diagnostic definitions on cost estimates. Research design Monthly panel data analysis of Japanese claims data. Subjects The study included a maximum of 141,673 patients with type 2 diabetes who received treatment between 2005 and 2013. Measures Additional healthcare costs associated with diabetes and diabetes-related complications were estimated for various diagnostic definition methods using fixed-effects panel data regression models. Results The average follow-up period per patient ranged from 49.4 to 52.3 months. The number of patients identified as having type 2 diabetes varied widely among the diagnostic definition methods, ranging from 14,743 patients to 141,673 patients. The fixed-effects models showed that the additional costs per patient per month associated with diabetes ranged from US$180 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 178-181] to US$223 (95 % CI 221-224). When the diagnostic definition excluded rule-out diagnoses, the diabetes-related complications associated with higher additional healthcare costs were ischemic heart disease with surgery (US$13,595; 95 % CI 13,568-13,622), neuropathy/extremity disease with surgery (US$4594; 95 % CI 3979-5208), and diabetic nephropathy with dialysis (US$3689; 95 % CI 3667-3711). Conclusions Diabetes-related healthcare costs are sensitive to diagnostic definition methods. Determining appropriate diagnostic definitions can further advance healthcare cost research for diabetes and its applications in healthcare policies.","[Fukuda, Haruhisa] Kyushu Univ, Dept Hlth Care Adm & Management, Grad Sch Med Sci, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Ikeda, Shunya] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Sch Pharm, 2600-1 Kitakanemaru, Otawara, Tochigi 3248501, Japan; [Shiroiwa, Takeru; Fukuda, Takashi] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, 2-3-6 Minami, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan",Kyushu University; International University of Health & Welfare; National Institute of Public Health - Japan,"Fukuda, H (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Hlth Care Adm & Management, Grad Sch Med Sci, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.",h_fukuda@hcam.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [25713029]; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan [H25-Seisaku-Shitei-011]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25713029] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (Grant Number 25713029) and a Grant-in-Aid for Health Sciences Research by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (Grant Number H25-Seisaku-Shitei-011).",,26,7,7,1,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2016,34,10,,,,,1005,1014,,10.1007/s40273-016-0402-3,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,DW3OR,27016372.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383551500005,0

However, some countries combine funding and pay-as-you-go within the first pillar. This article studies a mixed system where a part of the individual's contribution accrues funded rights whereas the other part accrues pay-as-you-go rights. Diversification conditions between these two financing techniques are derived in a mean-variance framework for two distinct contexts: for a cohort entering the system (named ex-ante case) and for multiple cohorts coexisting at the same period of time (named ex-post case). The diversification benefits in presence of a liquidity constraint which ensures that the income from contributions is sufficient to cover the pension expenditures are also studied. We show that, on the one hand, diversification benefits individuals when the economy is dynamically efficient for the ex-ante case. On the other hand, diversification is unattractive when pay-as-ou-go and funding are positively correlated for the ex-post case. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article also developed a new uniform Bayesian framework for quantile function modelling and illustrated the developed approach through different quantile function models. Many distributions are defined explicitly only via their quanitle functions as the corresponding distribution or density functions do not have an explicit mathematical expression. Such distributions are rarely used in economic and financial modelling in practice. The developed methodology makes it more convenient to use these distributions in analyzing economic and financial data. Empirical applications to economic and financial time series and comparisons with other types of models and methods show that the developed method can be very useful in practice.,"[Cai, Yuzhi] Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Cai, YZ (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",y.cai@swansea.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Moreover, we provide an analytic expression of the obtained projection. The range of applications where conditional density projections are used is wide. The derived results are potentially useful in a variety of areas including: semiparametric efficient estimation and optimal testing in (conditional) moment models, Bayesian prior determination and inference in semiparametric models, density forecasting, and simulation-based econometric analysis. Regarding existence, we propose three different combinations of assumptions that are all sufficient to show that the projection exists and is unique. The proposed conditions exhibit a clear trade off between restrictions put on the divergence between the conditional densities and on the moment function which defines the projection set. Depending on the nature of the application, the researcher can pick and choose which set of conditions to use. Our second set of results characterizes the projection. The expression for the projected density is new though not surprising given the previously obtained results for the unconditional case. The projection is characterized by the dual of the original projection problem. In establishing the strong duality, however, we work with a constraint qualification condition that is weaker than that used by Borwein and Lewis (1991a, 1992a, 1993) in their seminal work concerning the unconditional case.","[Komunjer, Ivana] Univ Calif San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr MC 0508, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ragusa, Giuseppe] Luiss Univ, Rome, Italy",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Komunjer, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr MC 0508, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",komunjer@ucsd.edu,,"Ragusa, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6964-6278",,,,,54,3,3,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Precisely, age is distorted making individuals younger or older before performing the computations with the reference life table. This is in line with standard actuarial practice, specifically with the so-called Rueff s adjustments. It is shown that the statistical inference can be conducted with the help of a suitably modified version of the standard IRWLS algorithm in a Poisson GLM/GAM setting.

However, this requires the statistical analysis of large panels of time series, and hence faces the usual challenges associated with high-dimensional data. Factor model methods in such a context are an ideal tool, but they do not readily apply to the analysis of volatilities. Focusing on the reconstruction of the unobserved market shocks and the way they are loaded by the various items (stocks) in the panel, we propose an entirely non-parametric and model-free two-step general dynamic factor approach to the problem, which avoids the usual curse of dimensionality. Applied to the Standard & Poor's 100 asset return data set, the method provides evidence that a non-negligible proportion of the market-driven volatility of returns originates in the volatilities of the idiosyncratic components of returns.","[Barigozzi, Matteo] London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Hallin, Marc] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP114-4, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Barigozzi, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Hallin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP114-4, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",m.barigozzi@lse.ac.uk; mhallin@ulb.ac.be,"Barigozzi, Matteo/B-7145-2017","Barigozzi, Matteo/0000-0001-9090-5708",,,,,39,33,38,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

This link is important as financial returns drive investment in medical research and development (R&D), which, in turn, affects real spending growth. We document a medical innovation premium of 4-6% annually for equity returns of firms in the health care sector. We interpret this premium as compensating investors for government-induced profit risk, and we provide supportive evidence for this hypothesis through company filings and abnormal return patterns surrounding threats of government intervention. We quantify the implications of the premium for the growth in real health care spending by calibrating our model to match historical trends, predicting the share of gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to health care to be 32% in the long run. Policies that had removed government risk would have led to more than a doubling of medical R&D and would have increased the current share of health care spending by more than 3% of GDP.","[Koijen, Ralph S.

This paper measures their effect on the dynamics of the business cycle. We put forward a model that merges the standard incomplete-markets model of consumption and inequality with the new Keynesian model of nominal rigidities and business cycles, and that includes most of the main potential stabilizers in the U.S. data and the theoretical channels by which they may work. We find that the conventional argument that stabilizing disposable income will stabilize aggregate demand plays a negligible role in the dynamics of the business cycle, whereas tax-and-transfer programs that affect inequality and social insurance can have a larger effect on aggregate volatility. However, as currently designed, the set of stabilizers in place in the United States has had little effect on the volatility of aggregate output fluctuations or on their welfare costs despite stabilizing aggregate consumption. The stabilizers have a more important role when monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound, and they affect welfare significantly through the provision of social insurance.","[McKay, Alisdair] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Reis, Ricardo] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2 2AE, England; [Reis, Ricardo] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA",Boston University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University,"McKay, A (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Reis, R (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2 2AE, England.;Reis, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",amckay@bu.edu; r.a.reis@lse.ac.uk,,,Russell Sage Foundation's visiting scholar program,Russell Sage Foundation's visiting scholar program,"We are grateful to Alan Auerbach, Susanto Basu, Mark Bils, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Narayana Kocherlakota, Karen Kopecky, Toshihiko Mukoyama, a co-editor, and the referees, together with many seminar participants for useful comments.

This growth is an increasing concern for governments and other third-party payers seeking to provide equitable and comprehensive healthcare within sustainable budgets. In order to create headroom for increasing utilisation, and to fund new high-cost therapies, there is an active push to 'disinvest' from low-value drugs. The aim of this article is to review how reimbursement policy decision makers have sought to partially or completely disinvest from drugs in a range of OECD countries (UK, France, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) where they are publicly funded or subsidised. We employed a systematic literature search strategy and the incorporation of grey literature known to the authorship team. We canvass key policy instruments from each country to outline key approaches to the identification of candidate drugs for disinvestment assessment (passive approaches vs. more active approaches); methods of disinvestment and value-based purchasing (de-listing, restricting treatment, price or reimbursement rate reductions, encouraging generic prescribing); lessons learnt from the various approaches; the potential role of coverage with evidence development; and the need for careful stakeholder management. Dedicated sections are provided with detailed coverage of policy approaches (with drug examples) from each country. Historically, countries have relied on 'passive disinvestment'; however, due to (1) the availability of new cost-effectiveness evidence, or (2) 'leakage' in drug utilisation, or (3) market failure in terms of price competition, there is an increasing focus towards 'active disinvestment'. Isolating low-value drugs that would create headroom for innovative new products to enter the market is also motivating disinvestment efforts by multiple parties, including industry. Historically, disinvestment has mainly taken the form of price reductions, especially when market failures are perceived to exist, and restricting treatment to subpopulations, particularly when a drug is no longer considered value for money. There is considerable experimentation internationally in mechanisms for disinvestment and the opportunity for countries to learn from each other. Ongoing evaluation of disinvestment strategies is essential, and ought to be reported in the peer-reviewed literature.","[Parkinson, Bonny; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Sermet, Catherine] IRDES, Paris, France; [Clement, Fiona] Univ Calgary, Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Hlth Technol Assessment Unit, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Crausaz, Steffan] Pharmaceut Management Agcy PHARMAC, Wellington, New Zealand; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian] Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Garner, Sarah; Choudhury, Moni] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence NICE, London, England; [Pearson, Sallie-Anne] Univ Sydney, Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmaceut Policy Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Lopert, Ruth] Management Sci Hlth, Ctr Pharmaceut Management, Pharmaceut Policy & Strategy, Arlington, VA USA; [Lopert, Ruth] George Washington Univ, Dept Hlth Policy, Washington, DC USA; [Elshaug, Adam G.] Univ Sydney, Menzies Ctr Hlth Policy, Value Hlth Care Div, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Elshaug, Adam G.] Lown Inst, Boston, MA USA; Univ Sydney, Menzies Ctr Hlth Policy, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Calgary; Karolinska Institutet; University of Strathclyde; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of Sydney; George Washington University; University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Elshaug, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Menzies Ctr Hlth Policy, Value Hlth Care Div, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",bonny.parkinson@chere.uts.edu.au; sermet@irdes.fr; fclement@ucalgary.ca; steffan.crausaz@pharmac.govt.nz; brian.Godman@ki.se; sarah.Garner@nice.org.uk; moni.choudhury@nice.org.uk; sallie.pearson@sydney.edu.au; rosalie.viney@chere.uts.edu.au; ruth.lopert@gmail.com; elshaug@sydney.edu.au,"Elshaug, Adam G/A-5714-2008; Parkinson, Bonny/F-6445-2010; Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019","Godman, Brian/0000-0001-6539-6972; Lopert, Ruth/0000-0002-0882-4288; Parkinson, Bonny/0000-0002-2137-0962; Elshaug, Adam/0000-0002-4939-5379; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635","PHARMAC, the New Zealand Government agency; Cancer Australia; Capital Markets Cooperative Research Centre-Health Quality Program; NPS MedicineWise; Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care","PHARMAC, the New Zealand Government agency; Cancer Australia; Capital Markets Cooperative Research Centre-Health Quality Program(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); NPS MedicineWise; Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care","Bonny Parkinson, Catherine Sermet, Fiona Clement, Brian Godman and Ruth Lopert have no conflicts of interest to declare.

If time inconsistency is observable, both a planner and a monopolist provide devices that help each person commit to the efficient level of flexibility. However, the combination of unobservable time inconsistency and preference for flexibility causes an adverse-selection problem. To solve this problem, the monopolist and (possibly) the planner curtail flexibility in the device for a more inconsistent person at both ends of the efficient choice range; moreover, they may have to add unused options to the device for a less inconsistent person and also distort his actual choices. This theory has normative and positive implications for private and public provision of commitment devices.","UCSD, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Galperti, S (通讯作者)，UCSD, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",sgalperti@ucsd.edu,,,WCAS Center of Economic Theory of Northwestern University,WCAS Center of Economic Theory of Northwestern University,"I am indebted to Eddie Dekel and Alessandro Pavan for many discussions that greatly improved the paper.

We show that trade creditors experience significant trade credit losses due to trade debtor failures and that creditors' bankruptcy risks increase in the size of incurred losses. By exploring the roles of financial constraints and creditor-debtor dependences, we infer that the trade credit failure propagation mechanism is driven by both credit losses and demand shrinkage.

Without explicit consideration of heterogeneity, it is necessary to reduce the period of observation at the intersection of the different populations observation periods. This reduction of the available history can arm the determination of the mortality trend and its extrapolation. We propose a model taking explicitly into account the heterogeneity, so as to preserve the entire history available for all populations. We use local kernel-weighted log-likelihood techniques to graduate the observed mortality. The extrapolation of the smoothed surface is performed by identifying the mortality components and their importance over time using singular values decomposition. Then time series methods are used to extrapolate the time-varying coefficients. We investigate the divergences in the mortality surfaces generated by a number of previously proposed models on three levels. These concern the proximity between the observations and the model, the regularity of the fit as well as the plausibility and consistency of the mortality trends. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We aggregate near-overlapping trades into metaorders and consider information, market impact and metaorder size. We find that during the execution, the functional form and scale of market impact are similar for cash flows and other metaorders. Differences arise in the price reversion following the end of a metaorder. For cash flows, presumed to have no true information content, the impact reverts almost completely on average in two to five days. For other metaorders, we find that reversion erases about one-third of the peak impact: for each size, price reverts to the average execution price, leaving no immediate profits after accounting for trading costs. Observed mark-to-market profits on metaorders that aggregate multiple portfolio manager orders, new metaorders and Nasdaq-listed stocks suggest that these metaorders are more informed than the average. Vice-versa, we find mark-to-market losses are more likely to occur on cash flows, metaorders in large-cap stocks, metaorders that follow momentum and additions to a prior position seeking to take advantage of an improved price. The complete price reversion for cash flows suggests that the mechanical permanent impact that is considered in no-quasi-arbitrage arguments would be much smaller than the information in typical institutional metaorders.","[Gomes, C.; Waelbroeck, H.] Portware LLC, New York, NY 10279 USA",,"Waelbroeck, H (通讯作者)，Portware LLC, 233 Broadway,24th Floor, New York, NY 10279 USA.",hwaelbroeck@portware.com,,,,,,,61,18,20,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

J,"Pellegrino, T; Sabino, P",,,,"Pellegrino, T.; Sabino, P.",,,Enhancing Least Squares Monte Carlo with diffusion bridges: an application to energy facilities,QUANTITATIVE FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Markov bridges; Computational finance; Energy derivatives; Least Squares Monte Carlo; Stochastic optimization; Q4; C6,BESSEL; SIMULATION,"The aim of this study is to present an efficient and easy framework for the application of the Least Squares Monte Carlo methodology to the pricing of gas or power facilities as detailed in Boogert and de Jong [J. Derivatives, 2008, 15, 81-91]. As mentioned in the seminal paper by Longstaff and Schwartz [Rev. Financ. Stud. 2001, 113-147], the convergence of the Least Squares Monte Carlo algorithm depends on the convergence of the optimization combined with the convergence of the pure Monte Carlo method. In the context of the energy facilities, the optimization is more complex and its convergence is of fundamental importance in particular for the computation of sensitivities and optimal dispatched quantities. To our knowledge, an extensive study of the convergence, and hence of the reliability of the algorithm, has not been performed yet, in our opinion this is because the apparent infeasibility and complexity uses a very high number of simulations. We present then an easy way to simulate random trajectories by means of diffusion bridges in contrast to Dutt and Welke [J. Derivatives, 2008, 15 (4), 29-47] that considers time-reversal Ito diffusions and subordinated processes. In particular, we show that in the case of Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Heston models, the bridge approach has the advantage to produce exact simulations even for non-Gaussian processes, in contrast to the time-reversal approach. Our methodology permits performing a backward dynamic programming strategy based on a huge number of simulations without storing the whole simulated trajectory. Generally, in the valuation of energy facilities, one is also interested in the forward recursion. We then design backward and forward recursion algorithms such that one can produce the same random trajectories by the use of multiple independent random streams without storing data at intermediate time steps. Finally, we show the advantages of our methodology for the valuation of virtual hydro power plants and gas storages.","[Pellegrino, T.; Sabino, P.] EON Global Commod SE, Quantitat Risk Modelling & Analyt, RQPR, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Sabino, P (通讯作者)，EON Global Commod SE, Quantitat Risk Modelling & Analyt, RQPR, Holzstr 6, Dusseldorf, Germany.",piergiacomo.sabino@eon.com,,,,,,,25,7,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.
