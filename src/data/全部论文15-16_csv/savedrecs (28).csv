Transmission of macro effects through the banking system and the economic environment also leads to higher levels of discouragement.

Using a firm heterogeneity model calibrated to match data on Japanese multinational firms, we simulate how multinationals respond to a decline in investment procedure days. We find that such policy reforms in investment procedures significantly increase the aggregate entries and sales of multinational firms in developing economies, with the more pronounced impact at the extensive margin than at the intensive margin. At the firm level, declining entry costs encourage more productive firms to invest in a wider range of markets although such impacts are modest for the most productive firms that already penetrate many markets. The impacts on foreign sales per multinational firm are less clear-cut in magnitude across productivity levels in part because falling entry costs directly increase multinational entry to developing economies, but only indirectly encourage their existing production in these markets.","[Tanaka, Kiyoyasu] JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Arita, Shawn] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Tanaka, K (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Chiba, Japan.",kiyoyasu_tanaka@ide.go.jp,,,"Institute of Developing Economies; JSPS [26285058, 24730232]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730232, 26285058] Funding Source: KAKEN","Institute of Developing Economies; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Institute of Developing Economies; JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) [grant number 26285058] and Young Scientists (B) [grant number 24730232].,,24,0,0,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The key idea is that equality of opportunity not only deals with ex-ante inequalities, something that the name already suggests, but also with ex-post inequalities which makes the analysis quite different from that of the capability approach. The article is structured in three parts. First, we review the main theoretical issues about inequality of opportunity. We then follow by looking at the measurement issues and by presenting some empirical results. We finally provide an overview about the challenges faced by policies aiming at enhancing equality of opportunity.","[Trannoy, Alain] CNRS, AMU AMSE, F-75700 Paris, France; [Trannoy, Alain] EHESS, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Trannoy, A (通讯作者)，CNRS, AMU AMSE, F-75700 Paris, France.;Trannoy, A (通讯作者)，EHESS, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,77,1,1,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

How a Civil Society-led Coalition Influences the Implementation of the Forest Rights Act in India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,civil society; advocacy coalitions; forest policy; India; policy implementation; Forest Rights Act,POWER; LEGITIMACY; POLICY; BUREAUCRACY; GOVERNANCE; TRANSITION; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS,"Forest policy implementation is a political endeavor involving both state and non-state actors. We observe that civil society organizations (CSOs) often federate into civil society-led coalitions (CSCs) in order to shape forest policies in their favor. They appear to be successful in doing this during the policy design phase but we know little about whether they are able to see through to implementation the changes they have put in motion. Analyzing CSC strategies during policy implementation could help to explain variation in the extent to which forest policies are successfully implemented. This paper analyzes the strategy choices and potential impact during policy implementation of a loose CSC comprised of CSOs, activists, people's movements, researchers, and lawyers that advocates for the full implementation of the Forest Rights Act in India. Drawing from the Advocacy Coalition Framework's focus on belief systems, complemented by insights from political ecology and civil society/social movements literature, we develop a framework to analyze CSC strategy choices. Our analysis is conducted at the national level and in two states, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. We employ qualitative research methods, including 38 interviews with CSC and non-CSC members, and a comprehensive analysis of the main CSC listsery and 1000 relevant English language newspaper articles. Our study reveals that the CSC employs a range of conflictive and collaborative strategies in its attempts to influence state-led implementation processes, at both national and state levels. It draws on a loose, heterogeneous network with ability to connect internally and a clear moral justification of its involvement in FRA implementation. However the diverse range of views on the implementation issues held by CSC members, lack of dedicated funding for coordination, limited legitimacy in the eyes of some state actors and a constricting wider institutional setting, impedes the CSC's ability to make coalition-level strategy decisions. Our results lead us to argue that CSCs are undoubtedly active in forest policy implementation at the national level and in the two states analyzed, though limited coordination of strategies potentially restricts their impact on the policy implementation process.

CEO ownership increases and CEO incentive alignment improves for Not-meet firms. But CEO ownership and incentives are unchanged for Meet firms following guideline adoption. We find no evidence that CEO compensation changes abnormally after adoption. Not-meet firms have larger improvement in operating performance and better stock performance than Meet firms.

We use granular information on all German banks and all sovereign debt exposures in the years 2005-2013. As regards the determinants of sovereign bond holdings of banks, we find that these are larger for weakly capitalized banks, banks that are active on capital markets, and for large banks. Yet, only around two thirds of all German banks hold sovereign bonds. Macroeconomic fundamentals were significant drivers of sovereign bond holdings only after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. With the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis, German banks reallocated their portfolios toward sovereigns with lower debt ratios and bonds with lower yields. With regard to the implications for bank risk, we find that low-risk government bonds decreased the risk of German banks, especially for savings and cooperative banks. Holdings of high-risk government bonds, in turn, increased the risk of commercial banks during the sovereign debt crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using data on the Japanese nonlife insurance industry between 1907 and 1940, we demonstrate that a firm's performance in a focal market decreases with more experience in other markets (i.e., nonfocal markets). This cumulative nonfocal market experience causes managers to transfer preexisting routines extensively and inappropriately to the focal market. We show that the negative effect deteriorates when the firms have already entered such nonfocal markets prior to their entry into the focal markets, and such nonfocal markets are populated by performance-comparable peers. We also find that the negative effect increases when firms transfer knowledge from nonfocal markets in which the focal market has low realized financial synergies, and when firms' experience prior to entry into the focal market was successful. These findings explicate mechanisms by which negative performance effects of within-industry diversification occur, and advance our understanding of within-industry diversification by applying the idea of transfer problems from the literature on organizational learning.","[Min, Jungwon] Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-19-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Mitsuhashi, Hitoshi] Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, Mita 2-15-45, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Kyushu University; Keio University,"Min, J (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-19-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",jwmin@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp; mitsuhashi@fbc.keio.ac.jp,,"Min, Jungwon/0000-0002-7420-2807","Social Science Grants from Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI Grant [25285121]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780207, 25285121] Funding Source: KAKEN","Social Science Grants from Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by Social Science Grants from Nomura Foundation and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25285121.,,57,3,3,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Here we show that the diffusion of profit rates applies across all surviving corporations, irrespective of their size or industry, which is not true for growth rates. The diffusion process is empirically consistent with both the cross-sectional distribution of profit rates and the individual time series of corporate profit rates, leading to the notion of a statistical equilibrium. This has stark and unexpected implications for our understanding of individual destinies, since the model and data suggest that idiosyncratic efforts have no impact on the aggregate distributional outcome. Instead, idiosyncratic efforts merely affect the individual persistence of abnormal profits from the system-wide norm. Put differently, corporations have to participate in the same game and can merely choose the speed at which they play it, but they cannot bend the rules.","[Mundt, Philipp; Milakovic, Mishael] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany; [Alfarano, Simone] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, E-12071 Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Universitat Jaume I,"Mundt, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",philipp.mundt@uni-bamberg.de; alfarano@uji.es; mishael.milakovic@uni-bamberg.de,"Milakovic, Mishael/ABA-9718-2020; Alfarano, Simone/JNE-2129-2023","Mundt, Philipp/0000-0002-4106-1809; Milakovic, Mishael/0000-0002-3114-204X; Alfarano, Simone/0000-0002-8690-7978",European Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [619255]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2011-23634]; project Ajudes complementaries a projectes d'I+D; Generalitat Valenciana; project Riesgo sistemico e informacion publica en el sector financiero: experimentos y simulaciones; Jaume I,European Seventh Framework Programme (FP7); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); project Ajudes complementaries a projectes d'I+D; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); project Riesgo sistemico e informacion publica en el sector financiero: experimentos y simulaciones; Jaume I,"S.A. is grateful for funding from the European Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), grant number 619255, and Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, project number ECO2011-23634, and the project Ajudes complementaries a projectes d'I+D 2012, financed by Generalitat Valenciana, and the project Riesgo sistemico e informacion publica en el sector financiero: experimentos y simulaciones, financed by Jaume I.",,50,9,11,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Old market theories that describe the food market mechanisms as a simple three point process: to produce - to sell - to buy are now growing into elaborated models based on more determinants that have one common challenge: quality. Thus, the present study aims to highlight the importance of producers' accountability in ensuring the quality of food products, by implementing standardize methods of production and by informing the consumers in a correctly and completely manner. In other words, the research focuses on quality management systems as defining instruments that can assure high-quality food products are being delivered at competitive prices to domestic and international markets. In this sense, food quality management principles are analyzed from the point of view of one of the biggest actors in the food industry, Mondelez International. Having as a starting point the interview results with the Procurement Innovation Manager in Quality, this paper manages to outline a consumer preference based model in developing new food products. The present conceptual model takes into consideration both quality specialist and consumer's demands, in order to maintain the requirements of food management and safety systems and, simultaneously, to be flexible and optimize new food products according to modern consumer's quality requirements: design.","[Pamfilie, Rodica; Bobe, Magdalena; Cristescu, Lavinia; Toma, Maria Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pamfilie, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",rodica.pamfilie@com.ase.ro,,,,,,,17,8,8,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2016,18.0,43,,,,,663,674,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU5MP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382256100012,0

This paper is a first attempt to experimentally elicit the min and the max of multiple priors directly. In an ambiguous scenario we measure a participant's single prior, her min and max of multiple priors, and the valuation of an ambiguous asset with the same underlying states as the ambiguous scenario. We use the min and the max of multiple priors to directly test two popular multiple priors models: the maxmin model and the alpha maxmin model. We find more support for the alpha maxmin model: although people put about twice the weight on the minimum of multiple priors, they also consider the maximum. Furthermore, we indirectly elicit confidence weights over the whole set of multiple priors and test two additional models: variational preferences and the smooth model of ambiguity. Two particular versions of the variational preferences model explain less than the alpha maxmin but more than the maxmin model. Overall, the smooth model of ambiguity performs best among all models tested.","[Qiu, Jianying; Weitzel, Utz] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ, Thomas van Aquinostr 5, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Qiu, Jianying] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Weitzel, Utz] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Kriekenpitpl 21-22, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Nanjing University of Science & Technology; Utrecht University,"Qiu, JY (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ, Thomas van Aquinostr 5, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands.;Qiu, JY (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",j.qiu@fm.ru.nl,,"Weitzel, Utz/0000-0003-0493-9333",,,,,22,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We perform the analysis within the context of a model that integrates data on bilateral exposures in the interbank market with information about the liquidity profile of each financial institution. Asset prices in the model are determined endogenously as a function of the total volume of fire sales, thus creating the possibility that marking to market may trigger new rounds of fire sales and downward asset price spirals. The simulation results show that the Brazilian banking system is robust, as relatively large increases in the NPL ratio lead to only modest losses in the system. We also compute the contribution of each financial institution to systemic losses under severe shocks and find that contributions from medium-sized banks can be significant. However, if shocks become more severe, only large banks will contribute significantly to systemic losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In its place, it offered new hires a choice between a conventional defined contribution plan and a hybrid plan option, where the latter has both a guaranteed benefit component and a defined contribution plan where employees bear investment risk. We show that around 60% of new hires failed to make any active choice and, as a result, were automatically defaulted into the hybrid plan. Slightly more than half of those who made an active choice elected the hybrid plan. Post-reform, employees who failed to actively elect a primary retirement plan were also far less likely to enroll in a supplemental retirement account, compared with new hires who actively selected a plan. We also find that employees hired following the reform were more likely to leave public employment, resulting in higher separation rates. This could reflect a reduction in the desirability of public employment under the new pension design and an improving economic climate in the state. Our results imply that public pension reformers must consider employee responses in addition to potential cost savings, when developing and enacting major pension plan changes.","[Clark, Robert L.] N Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Box 7229, Raleigh, NC 27696 USA; [Hanson, Emma] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27696 USA; [Mitchell, Olivia S.] Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,3000 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mitchell, Olivia S.] NBER, 3620 Locust Walk,3000 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Clark, RL (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Box 7229, Raleigh, NC 27696 USA.",Robert_Clark@ncsu.edu,,,Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,"The research described in this paper began with a conversation with Richard Ellis, State Treasurer of Utah, who provided introductions to the leaders of the Utah Retirement System (URS) and supported our examination of the impact of pension reform in Utah.

Firms that report no need for credit are significantly less levered, more liquid, older, and of higher credit quality than are firms that report a need for credit, and their owners are older, are more likely to be white, are more creditworthy, and have fewer bank and nonbank relationships. Firms reporting that they were discouraged from applying for credit significantly outnumber and are significantly different from firms that applied for and were denied credit on a number of dimensions such as size, profitability, owner age, and the number of sources of financial services.

Some studies have considered the confounding effect of attitudes in the connections between rail transit and travel behavior. However, they often focused on the average effect of rail transit and assumed that individuals' responses to transit improvements do not vary by their tastes. Using the 2014 data from Xi'an in China, this study explores the interaction effect between metro transit (heavy rail) and the propensity (i.e., predicted probability) of living in neighborhoods with metro transit on transit use. The propensity is positively associated with commute by metro transit and bus. Further, individuals with a strong propensity use transit equivalently no matter whether they live near metro transit, but metro transit tends to promote transit commute for those with a weak propensity of living near metro transit. Overall, building a rail line helps enhance transit ridership. Planners should also consider the variation in responses by individuals with different tastes when using policies to shape urban travel.

Notably, according to experimental studies, senior citizens tend to discount future payoffs more heavily than working-age individuals. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that demographic change has contributed to the cut-back in government financed investment that many advanced economies experienced over the last four decades. We demonstrate for a panel of 19 OECD countries between 1971 and 2007 that the share of elderly people and public investment rates are cointegrated, indicating a long-run relationship between them. Estimating this cointegration relationship via dynamic OLS (DOLS) we find a negative and significant effect of population aging on public investment. Moreover, the estimation of an error correction model reveals long-run Granger causality running exclusively from aging to investment. Our results are robust to the inclusion of additional control variables typically considered in the literature on the determinants of public investment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There is a clear policy interest in how much land values increase following a new transport investment so as to establish if there is sufficient land value uplift to capture and to help pay or contribute to investment plans. Identifying an uplift for residential land has been well studied in the context of new light rail systems and bus rapid transit (BRT) systems in developing countries but there is little evidence for BRT in developed countries. This paper has two objectives. First to examine long term impact of BRT in a developed world context in Brisbane, Australia. Brisbane's BRT uses an open system design which contrasts with the closed system design of the successful BRT systems in South America and elsewhere, including the BRT in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia. Second, BRT in Brisbane was introduced to a network already dominated by a radial heavy rail network and this investigation recognises that the uplift from BRT introduction may therefore be different to a BRT in a single mode city. A third motivation is to consider the spatial distribution of uplift which is an essential pre-requisite to understanding the distributional impact if uplift is used to contribute to infrastructure provision. Spatial modelling is used to examine the accessibility impacts of the BRT at a global level. This is followed by Geographical Weighted Regression, used to examine the spatial distribution of accessibility using a local model. The results show that there is greater uplift in Brisbane, as compared to that identified by studies of Sydney's BRT which is likely due to the greater network coverage of BRT in Brisbane and less strong competition of rail. Land value uplift is also spatially distributed over the network giving higher uplift in some areas than others and lower values than typically found with rail based systems in developed countries. However, the degree of uplift is relatively low, with proximity to BRT stations attracting more uplift than proximity to train stations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However the specific impact of rural transport policy and provision on female entrepreneurs is less well known. Drawing upon the experiences of a group of growth-focused female entrepreneurs receiving support from a national programme, this research explores how they use transport for their business activities, transport barriers that they are subject to and ways in which these barriers are being surmounted. To this end it uses the findings from telephone surveys, supported by in-depth interviews to generate data about their business and transport behaviours. It identifies that many of the women feel that the current transport situation is having a negative impact on the success of their businesses, and has affected their ability to recruit employees, service customers and deliver goods. Whilst the women had a very poor understanding of transport policy, many of them felt that the main issue is the poor quality of the roads. In the short term initiatives to support the specific needs of women would be highly valuable in helping these entrepreneurs to successfully grow their businesses. In the long term a significant amount of investment is required to improve rural transport to meet the needs of female entrepreneurs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an arithmetic model accounting for all relevant parts of the German tax-benefit-system we explored this aspect in detail. From our calculations it became evident that the combined burden of taxes, social security contributions, and transfers was significantly affected by the distribution of earnings between spouses and that the effect differs with respect to total household income. Overall, the German tax-benefit-system favors an unequal income distribution within the household. Applying the model on empirical data taken from the most recent German Income and Expenditure Survey, we were able to quantify these effects. According to our results, total disposable income of the households analyzed would increase by about (sic)5.5 billion per year if all wage income within households would be allocated to a single-earner.","[Stoewhase, Sven] Fraunhofer FIT, St Augustin, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Institute Center Schloss Birlinghoven,"Stöwhase, S (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer FIT, St Augustin, Germany.",sven.stoewhase@fit.fraunhofer.de,"Stoewhase, Sven D/C-4803-2008",,,,,,29,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

This paper examines how mobility trends are differentiated by gender and birth cohort. Over the last decade, young adult women in Britain have come to have greater weekly mobility than their male counterparts. Until recently, women have consistently had lower mobility than men - suggesting that this finding could be a significant break with the past. This gender turnaround is driven mainly by young men travelling substantially less today than previous generations of young men. We find that younger cohorts of women travel are travelling further as they age, whilst younger cohorts of men are no longer becoming more mobile as they approach early midlife, traditionally a life course peak in travel mobility. Possible reasons for the greater mobility of young women than young men are discussed and areas for future research identified. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We find that the realities of Chinese migrants in this sector matches neither popular media stereotypes of empire building and land grabbing, nor Chinese government narratives of South South cooperation, technology transfer, and agricultural development. Far from being a silent army promoting larger Chinese state objectives, they operate independently and serve no agenda other than their own. Many migrants have little if any contact with the Chinese Embassy or other official Chinese presence in Africa. While none of our informants have received support from the Chinese government, they are nonetheless affected by government regulatory frameworks in African countries and their activities are shaped accordingly. The regulatory policy environment is very different in the two countries, and this has implications for the livelihood strategies of Chinese migrants. While the impacts of their presence on local development are modest overall, these impacts do appear to be positive in the sense that they are creating economic opportunities, both for themselves and for local people.

Cross-country evidence,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Banking system transparency; Disclosure; Regulation; Competition; Market power; Concentration,MARKET DISCIPLINE; FIRMS; RISK,"There seems to be a consensus among regulators and scholars that in order to improve the functioning of a banking system it is necessary to raise the level of bank information disclosure. However, its influence on bank competition - which is an important factor affecting the efficiency and stability of the banking system - is left out of consideration. To test whether greater bank information disclosure is associated with both lower market power and lower concentration in the banking markets, we use country-level data covering the years 1998, 2001, 2005 and 2010. Our findings show that countries with higher levels of bank transparency have lower levels of bank concentration, while the link between transparency and market power is less pronounced. We also show that the reduction of competition due to stricter disclosure requirements depends on bank credit risks and the relationship is U-shaped. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses a country's choice of inflation targeting by examining its driving forces with the dataset of 82 countries. The empirical result shows that countries' decision of adoption of inflation targeting depends highly on their development stage. For high-income or developed countries, the significant motive of monetary authority to choose inflation targeting is the desire to keep or enhance anti-inflation credibility, and inflation targeting could be a natural option under more floats with the absence of nominal exchange rate anchor. On the other hand, low-income or developing countries with the large size of public debts are not likely to choose inflation targeting, so that fiscal fragility would discourage monetary authority to adopt restrictive monetary policy under inflation targeting.

In particular, this study examines whether capitalization of finance leases has significant effects on firm behavior regarding the choice of accounting treatment and the arrangement of leases. Our findings are twofold. First, firms with debt contracting incentives are more likely to choose the exceptional treatment, which recognizes only finance leases contracted after the adoption of Statement No. 13, Accounting Standard for Lease Transactions. Second, firms choosing the exceptional treatment are more likely to transfer leases from finance leases to operating leases in response to the adoption of Statement No. 13. This study contributes to the literature on recognition versus disclosure as well as to discussions on the global convergence of accounting standards. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studies a random matching search model with human capital losses during unemployment. Wage dispersion increases, as workers accept lower wages to avoid long unemployment spells. The model explains between a third and half of the observed residual wage dispersion. When adding on-the-job search, the model accounts for all of the residual wage dispersion and generates substantial dispersion even for high values of non-market time. The paper thus addresses the trade-off between explaining frictional wage dispersion and the cyclical behavior of unemployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To complement existing work on the effects of major life events on mobility practices, we introduce the novel concept of 'mobility milestones', that is, mobility-related events across the life course that show a very high dependence on (infra)structural factors. Overall, the paper explicitly recognises the centrality of interactions between structural factors and human agency, thereby moving beyond a sole focus on individual travel behaviour. Initially, this paper reviews social and interdisciplinary research on mobility biographies, especially studies that use retrospective survey methodologies. Building on this review, we present an innovative online survey tool that has been deployed on the island of Ireland (n = 324) to record changes in individuals' mobility biographies and their connections with both life events and mobility milestones. This is followed by a discussion of key findings regarding the impact of starting college, residential relocation and changing employment, as well as buying a car or bicycle or getting a driving licence on individuals' modal choice.

We propose that the combination of (1) high internal social proximity between co-inventors within a city and (2) local cliques of inventors in which interaction is dense allows a city to achieve greater inventive creativity. Internal social proximity allows knowledge to circulate quickly across a larger pool of sources; dense cliques promote trust, cooperation, and a more effective use of the acquired knowledge. Moreover, social proximity between a city's inventors and inventors outside the city contributes to enriching and renewing a city's knowledge base by facilitating faster access to fresh external knowledge.

Making investment decisions thus requires assumptions about time and risk preferences. Such assumptions are frequently contested, particularly in the public sector, and there is no immediate prospect of universal agreement. Motivated by these observations, we develop a theory and method of finding spaces for agreement. These are combinations of classes of discount and utility function, for which one investment dominates another (or almost does so), so that all those whose preferences can be represented by such combinations would agree on the option to choose. The theory combines the insights of stochastic dominance and time dominance and offers a nonparametric approach to intertemporal, risky choice. We then apply the theory to climate change and show using a popular simulation model that even tough carbon emissions targets would be chosen by almost everyone, barring those with arguably extreme preferences.","[Dietz, Simon] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Dietz, Simon] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Matei, Nicoleta Anca] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, IPTS, Seville, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Dietz, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Dietz, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.dietz@lse.ac.uk,,,European Union [266992]; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,European Union(European Union (EU)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Simon Dietz (corresponding author) is at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, and Department of Geography and Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science (s.dietz@lse.ac.uk).

The results show that a high level of interregional inequality increases the number of domestic terror events in the sample countries. This finding is robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables that may affect both interregional inequality and domestic terrorism. Furthermore, the observed link between interregional inequality and terrorist activity does not depend on the choice of the specific measure used to quantify the degree of dispersion in the regional distribution of GDP per capita within the sample countries.

Here, we focus on the first such historically important structural transformation in which some parts of Europe escaped from the Malthusian trap centuries earlier than the Industrial Revolution, while others stagnated. There is as yet no consensus as to the causes of this First Great Divergence. The paper advances the thesis that what lies at the root of different paths is the type of property rights inherited. As populations everywhere in Europe recovered from the catastrophes of the late medieval period, what mattered for the direction taken was the size of the landlord class and their landholdings. In Western Europe where peasant proprietors tilled small plots, increases in population levels led to lower real wages. Given the low incomes of landlords and peasants, demand for manufactured goods remained low. At the other extreme, in eastern Europe, second serfdom kept wages low, and rents high. Yet given the small size of the landowning class, these rents could not generate enough demand for high-end manufacturing processes either. Northwestern Europe, being in the middle in terms both of the size of the landholding classes and their properties, prospered as wages failed to decline even when population levels rapidly rose. Combined demand from landlords and workers kindled an expansion of the manufacturing sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Liquidity improves after the commencement of public dissemination of OTC derivatives trades.

Existence of informal activities is critical in generating positive employment effects of liberal trade policies. Following a tariff cut informal wage increases and rate of unemployment goes down under reasonable conditions. Next we generalize the benchmark model to capture the phenomenon of sequential migration: from agriculture to urban informal sector, and then to urban formal sector. Positive employment effect of reformatory trade policy partly owes to the fact that the presence of informal sector directly reduces the cost of migration and, hence, further induces the process of outmigration from agricultural sector.

With a vast majority of adult Ugandans having no access to formal financial services, mobile money is expected to bridge this gap especially in rural areas. This financial product allows users to make financial transactions using their mobile phones. Within five years of its inception in Uganda since 2009, the mobile money service has been used by over 35% of the adult population and the rate of penetration is rapidly increasing. We investigate its impact on household welfare using panel data covering 846 rural households. Using a combination of household fixed effects, instrumental variable and propensity score matching methods, we find a positive and significant effect of mobile money access on household welfare, measured by real per capita consumption. The mechanism of this impact is the facilitation of remittances; user households are more likely to receive remittances, receive remittances more frequently, and the total value received is significantly higher than that of non-user households. We attribute this impact on the reduction in transaction, transport, and time costs associated with mobile phone-based financial transactions. Our results are robust to changes in model specifications and alternative explanations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We also find that there is no significant positive association between bank size and whether an SME changes its lending bank or the number of its financing sources, regardless of whether there is currently a financial crisis. The results indicate that small banks fail to maintain a strong relationship with SMEs, possibly because of the hold-up problem resulting from relationship lending. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We find that channeling agricultural assistance through CBOs makes these organizations more inclusive in the sense that several tradition-bound assortative matching patterns are broken: homophily in ethnicity and wealth are reduced. Traditionally marginalized groups such as men of nomadic background, women with small landholdings and little education and those residing in female-headed households become CBO members whereas the position of previous CBO leaders is not reinforced. Similarly, those households that received services from a CBO before the PSAOP was in place are less likely to stay. This leads to more heterogeneous CBOs and is in line with the terms and conditions of the program. On the other hand, the likelihood of CBO membership is reduced in project villages, with significant differences between men and women. Women disproportionately drop out of CBOs which receive PSAOP benefits. We conclude that for grassroots-level development projects to be successful, contextual factors need to be integrated into program design and implementation, since they shape local participation. Understanding local power relations and the potential for changing preferences due to external support are key to inclusive participation and development at the local. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on this measure, the systemic risk of European banks reached its height in late 2011 around (sic)500 billion. We find that this was largely due to sovereign default risk.

Further, the combined price effects on exports and imports imply an increase in the real value of the RMB will reduce China's trade balance. The use of alternative exchange rate measures and data on different trade classifications yields additional insights. Firms more subject to market forces exhibit greater price sensitivity. The price elasticity is larger for ordinary exports than for processing exports. Finally, accounting for endogeneity and measurement error matters. Hence, purging the real exchange rate of the portion responding to policy, or using the deviation of the real exchange rate from the equilibrium level yields a stronger measured effect than when using the unadjusted bilateral exchange rate.","[Cheung, Yin-Wong] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Int Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chinn, Menzie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Robert M La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chinn, Menzie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Qian, Xingwang] SUNY Buffalo State, Econ & Finance Dept, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA",City University of Hong Kong; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Buffalo State College,"Cheung, YW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Int Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Chinn, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Robert M La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Chinn, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",yicheung@cityu.edu.hk; mchinn@lafollette.wisc.edu; qianx@buffalostate.edu,,"CHEUNG, Yin-Wong/0000-0002-7564-7402",,,,,32,11,12,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The inflation-RPV linkage is stronger when inflation is moderately high, but tends to fade out and might eventually disappear when inflation is steadily low. The policy implication of this result is that inflation targets should be set within a range in which the inflation-RPV link is the weakest (i.e. low-inflation regime) to minimize undesirable price dispersion induced by inflation.","[Gu, Biao] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianfeng; Wang, Yi David] Univ Int Business & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Finance, Sch Banking & Finance, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; University of International Business & Economics,"Wang, YD (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Finance, Sch Banking & Finance, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",billgu@shu.edu.cn,,,"Foundation of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [12YJC790042]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [CXTD4-04]","Foundation of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE","This material is based upon the work financially supported by the Foundation of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, under Grant No. 12YJC790042, and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE (CXTD4-04).",,14,2,2,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It covers studies published in scientific journals during 1994-2014 that examine the impact on growth of inequality in income, land, and human capital distribution. We find traces of publication bias in this literature, as authors and journals are more willing to report and publish statistically significant findings, and the results tend to follow a predictable time pattern over time according to which negative and positive effects are cyclically reported. After correcting for these two forms of publication bias, we conclude that the high degree of heterogeneity of the reported effect sizes is explained by study conditions, namely the structure of the data, the type of countries included in the sample, the inclusion of regional dummies, the concept of inequality and the definition of income. In particular, our meta-regression analysis suggests that: cross-section studies systematically report a stronger negative impact than panel data studies; the effect of inequality on growth is negative and more pronounced in less developed countries than in rich countries; the inclusion of regional dummies in the growth regression of the primary studies considerably weakens such effect; expenditure and gross income inequality tend to lead to different estimates of the effect size; land and human inequality are more pernicious to subsequent growth than income inequality is. We also find that the estimation technique, the quality of data on income distribution, and the specification of the growth regression do not significantly influence the estimation of the effect sizes. These results provide new insights into the nature of the inequality-growth relationship and offer important guidelines for policy makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is concerning for Indonesia, given the the increased attention worldwide on the services sector as a likely source of growth, the contribution of the services sector to the competitiveness of other sectors, and the opportunities available for capturing the gains from innovation and change in services. There is scope, we argue, to increase the number of formal jobs in the sector and to dispel its reputation as the employer of last resort. We find that a restrictive policy regime contributes to the sector's poor performance, leading to an argument for reform. We discuss a potential strategy for such reform, focusing on four factors: increasing transparency and policy information; capturing the opportunities from international commitments; and exploring the potential of, one, new technology, and, two, urbanisation.","[Findlay, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Pangestu, Mari] Univ Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Adelaide; University of Indonesia,"Findlay, C (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",,,,,,,,25,2,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Following severe fiscal shocks, political institutions assume greater importance in assessing risk characteristics of state bonds. The bond market reacts most strongly to two factors: public sector union strength in a state and the proportion of Democrats in the state legislature. We suggest that the identity of political institutions becomes increasingly important, during periods of economic crises, when credit markets might expect that political systems can no longer delay stabilisations and must deliver policy.","[Hong, Sounman] Yonsei Univ, Coll Social Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Nadler, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yonsei University; Harvard University,"Hong, S (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Coll Social Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",sounman_hong@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

This paper presents a model that rationalizes some of the initial fears and offers two interpretations for why they did not come true. First, when debt exchange offers are sufficiently attractive relative to the risk faced by holdouts, full participation can be an equilibrium. Second, legal innovations such as minimum participation thresholds and defensive exit consents helped. coordinate creditors and avoid litigation. In this regard, exit consents are shown to have similar effects on creditor coordination as collective action clauses (CACs). Unlike CACs, exit consents can be exploited to force a high haircut on creditors, but the ability of creditors to coordinate to block exit consents limits overly aggressive use.","[Bi, Ran; Chamon, Marcos] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Zettelmeyer, Jeromin] German Minist Econ Affairs, Econ Policy, Berlin, Germany",International Monetary Fund,"Bi, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,"Chamon, Marcos/0000-0001-9840-7615",,,,,49,11,12,0,4,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The ontology preparation of the application and example of result solution is presented, some figures illustrate the procedure. Methodology/methods used in research are connected with innovation, its steps life cycle: suggestion of innovation, demand for solution of innovation, the final solution of innovation, and project for implementation of innovation. The next used methodology is oriented to an ontology preparation for the SW application: scheme of classes and associations between classes, table of assignment characteristics to classes, and implementation of ontology in SW ATOM. The extensive literature rewiev of the current state of the topic is added. Scientific aim is to verify at the experiment a real possibility to support independent processes outside of IS using an ontology driven application. The contribution is a fact that the result of the research work could be used for any process outside of IS. Changes in IS are very expensive, complicated and risk, but it should be by suggested solution omitted. Findings are presented in a solution for information support of the processes outside the IS via an ontology driven application. The same procedure should be used for any process outside of IS and could be omitted problematic and expensive changes in IS. Conclusions Limits of the proposed solution consist in only laboratory experimental verification. For the practical use should be necessary first prepared a prototype for the corporation IS and enterprise environment.","[Burita, Ladislav] Univ Def, Fac Mil Technol, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Burita, L (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Fac Mil Technol, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic.",ladislav.burita@unob.cz,"BURITA, Ladislav/ABC-6626-2021","BURITA, Ladislav/0000-0003-4779-631X",,,,,18,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,697,704,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200086,0

Evidence from Michigan,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Charters; Private schools; Instrumental variables,STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; FINANCE REFORM; CHILDREN; IMPACTS,"Charter schools have been one of the most important dimensions of recent school reform measures in the United States. Though there have been numerous studies on the effects of charter schools, these have mostly been confined to analyzing their effects on student achievement, student demographic composition, parental satisfaction, and the competitive effects on traditional public schools. This study departs from the existing literature by investigating the effect of charter schools on enrollment in private schools. To investigate this issue empirically, we focus on the state of Michigan where there was a significant spread of charter schools in the nineties. Using data on private school enrollment from biennial NCES private school surveys, and using a fixed effects as well as an instrumental variables strategy that exploits exogenous variation from Michigan charter law, we investigate the effect of charter school penetration on private school enrollment. We do not find any causal evidence that charter schools led to a decline in enrollment in the private schools. Further, we do not find evidence that enrollments in Catholic or other religious schools were affected differently from those in non-religious private schools. Our results are robust to a variety of sensitivity checks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the article was to systemize previous findings on children impact on parent's purchase decisions, and to determine whether applied methodology (qualitative vs quantitative and number of respondents), country's factors and time have impact on reported evidence of children influence on parents' purchase decisions. Besides we were aiming to determine how strong is the influence, has the evidence changed over the period of 30 years. Methodology/methods A systematic analysis of articles related to children influence on parents' purchase behavior available through nine major databases of social sciences was performed. Initial search allowed to select 278 articles published in a period of time 1985 - 2014. Three stages of screening a list of articles were employed to select 100 articles suitable for further analysis. Two raters evaluated an influence of children on their parents' purchase decision on selected categories using the established coding system. Finally, statistical analysis of findings was applied. Scientific aim The scientific aim was to systemize previous findings about child's influence on parents' purchase decisions and find factors related to the context and methodology of the research that have influence on the reported evidence of children impact on parents' purchase decision strength. Findings The results proved that a child has influence on his/her parents' decision to purchase products, but the influence was lower than scale's middle point. Based on analysis of 116 researches and using different statistical tests we proved that reported child's influence on his/her parents' decision to purchase products differed depending on a number of respondents, type of research (qualitative vs. quantitative) and year of research. Conclusions The analysis showed that reported child's impact on his/her parents' purchase decision depends on used methodology and on the context of the research (year). Therefore, deeper analysis of various methods and scales for measurement of the influence has to be performed.","[Dikcius, Vytautas; Pikturniene, Indre; Seimiene, Eleonora; Kavaliauske, Monika; Katkuviene, Kristina; Reardon, James] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Sauletekio Al 9 2 Bldg, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Armenakyan, Anahit] Nipissing Univ, Sch Business, Fac Appl & Profess Studies, H130,100 Coll Dr,Box 5002, North Bay, ON P1B 8L7, Canada; [Seimiene, Eleonora] Vilnius Univ, Fac Philosophy, Univ Str 9-1, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Nipissing University; Vilnius University,"Dikcius, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Sauletekio Al 9 2 Bldg, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",vytas@ekt.lt,"Pakalniskiene, Vilmante/AAO-5961-2021","Pakalniskiene, Vilmante/0000-0002-8042-2910",Lithuanian Research Council [MIP-017/2015],Lithuanian Research Council(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by the project No. MIP-017/2015 from the Lithuanian Research Council.,,20,2,2,0,7,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,182,189,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200021,0

In a view of the limited resources they often have issues not only with attracting young employees and keeping them after completion of the training and education, but also with the integration of the older employees. They must deal with the problems arising from the ageing of the workforce and age-related changes in the structure. In this context, there are important measures, as the increase in the employment rate of women and older employees. For this reason, it is needed to use all available knowledge, skills and qualifications, in order to achieve more flexible qualifications, regadless where and how they have been obtained. The aim of the paper is to describe some of the innovative training modules to keep both young people and older employees. The key results should be improved quality of work and the overall performance of the organization, change of mentality and increased confidence.

There is nothing guaranteed about success of companies from emerging markets (EMs), other than the fact that some of the firms that do survive will be among the success stories of the future. The purpose of this paper is to explore two questions: what enables companies from EMs to compete with existing firms? Is there a conceptual structure that is best for analyzing these firms and their strategies? Design/methodology/approach - This paper discusses the strengths of EM multinational enterprises (MNEs) from the perspective of Dunning's eclectic view, and gives four detailed examples of companies from this perspective. Findings - It is suggested that while the eclectic view offers excellent insight into EM MNEs, an analysis of their strategies and policy implications requires further perspective such as through the global value-added chain. Research limitations/implications - No single model will capture all of the important features of EM MNEs, but Dunning's view and the global value-added chain are good tools. Practical implications - Hopefully, both research analysts and company managers will be able to utilize the view presented here to better manage/understand EM MNEs. Originality/value - This view demonstrates a mechanism for exploring key elements of EM MNEs and by moving to the global value-added chain additional, original perspective is gained.","[Grosse, Robert] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Grosse, R (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",grosser@global.t-bird.edu,,,,,,,21,27,28,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The dual income tax system in Finland offers noticeable incentives for income-shifting between wages and dividends for business owners. The dividend tax reform of 2005 enables us to study how this particular form of tax avoidance reacts to an exogenous change in tax rates. Our results support highly active income-shifting behavior. We find that the income-shifting effect is homogeneous across different owners and firms. However, we find that the size of the tax incentive affects the size of the response, suggesting that costs related to income-shifting are important.","[Harju, Jarkko; Matikka, Tuomas] VATT Inst Econ Res, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00101, Finland",VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Harju, J (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",jarkko.harju@vatt.fi; tuomas.matikka@vatt.fi,,"Harju, Jarkko/0000-0003-2027-4343",Nordic Tax Research Council; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Alfred Kordelin Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Finnish Doctoral Programme in Economics,Nordic Tax Research Council; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Alfred Kordelin Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Finnish Doctoral Programme in Economics,"Many thanks to Richard Blundell, Essi Eerola, Ari Hyytinen, Laurence Jacquet, Seppo Kari, Olli Karkkainen, Tuomas Kosonen, Jukka Pirttila, Panu Poutvaara, Hakan Selin and Joel Slemrod for their very useful comments and discussion.

The cultural intelligence construct is defined as the ability of individuals to function effectively in culturally diverse situations. The authors build upon their earlier research on cultural intelligence in Ukraine and Moldova, and develop a comparative assessment based on the four-factor model of cultural intelligence: (a) cognitive - an individual's cultural knowledge of norms, practices, and conventions in different cultural settings (Van Dyne et al., 2008, p.16), (b) metacognitive - an individual's cultural consciousness and awareness during interactions with those from different cultural backgrounds (Van Dyne et al., 2008, p.16), (c) motivational - an individual's capability to direct attention and energy toward cultural differences (Van Dyne, et al., 2008, p.16), and (d) behavioral - an individual's capability to exhibit appropriate verbal and nonverbal actions when interacting with people from different cultural backgrounds (Van Dyne, et al., 2008, p.16). This has a crucial meaning for leadership in business in our globalizing world and economy, where there is a compelling need to operationalize and understand what type of cultural skills and abilities managers and leaders need in specific organizational and geographical contexts. The study advances the research in the cultural intelligence field by analyzing the cultural realm at the national level in two relatively recently emerged Eastern European countries. The novelty of the study consists in the national approach that it develops, as well as its Eastern European focus. The newly emerged countries in the Eastern European region are striving towards sustainability and economic growth, while at the same time facing major geopolitical and social challenges. In this context, the research of cultural intelligence opens new possibilities for the study of other processes and phenomena linked to cultural adaptation in the region.","[Johnson, Richard Boyd] Indiana Wesleyan Univ, Marion, IN 46953 USA",,"Johnson, RB (通讯作者)，Indiana Wesleyan Univ, Marion, IN 46953 USA.",boyd.johnson@indwes.edu; mirzadianna@yahoo.com; svitlana.buko@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,691,702,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300057,0

The topic examines building the capabilities, evaluating the efficiency and scaling up the performance of globally distributed software development teams in environments that demand high operational excellence and innovation performance. The University of Tampere, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences and the University of Helsinki are collaborating on a research project, DD-SCALE (2014-2016), with four industrial software companies working at the forefront of their industry. The objectives of the project are to investigate and develop measurement solutions, tools and work practices for managing and evaluating DDSD work. The project addresses the challenge of harnessing human and social capital assets for scaling high-performing teams to fit with high-performing organizations. The research questions are: 1) What are the applicable dimensions, in the context of IC, of a comprehensive and scalable measurement framework for DDSD? 2) What are the relevant indicators for measuring the performance of DDSD? 3) How can a framework, its dimensions and indicators be effectively implemented in practice? The chosen research approach is design and action research that has a qualitative emphasis. The theory perspectives of IC, performance management and distributed software development are applied. First, literature reviews were conducted. Next, data was collected from the participating companies by the means of interviews and workshops. The collected data was then analyzed by conducting a qualitative content analysis. The findings were then utilized for constructing the dimensions of the framework, identifying the measurement indicators, and designing prototypes for the implementation of the framework. Thus far, the results include: 1) the human, structural and relational capital dimensions of the measurement framework that can be combined for examining companies on individual, team and organizational levels; 2) a categorized set of candidates for indicators; and 3) an outline of the construction as well as preliminary prototypes for implementing the framework. The next steps of the research will include the advancement of the construction of the framework and prototypes. Examples of applicable deliverables derived from the construction will include a mobile barometer tool and an impact analysis solution for assessing DDSD work. The results will contribute to the management and development of work practices and help to realize the implementation of high performing software research and development (RD) operations within a dynamically and globally distributed setting.","[Kamaja, Pekka] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Ruohonen, Mikko; Ingalsuo, Timo; Loytty, Katriina] Univ Tampere, Sch Informat Sci, CIRCMI, Tampere, Finland",Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences; Tampere University,"Kamaja, P (通讯作者)，Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.kamaja@haaga-helia.fi; mikko.j.ruohonen@uta.fi; timo.ingalsuo@uta.fi; katriina.loytty@uta.fi,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,137,144,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300017,0

In addition, the impact of HSR on economic promotion in big cities is more effective than in small cities. According to actual situation and empirical analysis, this could be attributed to the siphoning influence of population and economic resources from small cities to the big cities, which is caused by unbalanced regional development and exacerbated by HSR.

The results indicate that Latin American countries' fiscal aggregates rise in response to positive shocks to commodity prices, yet there are marked differences across countries. Fiscal variables in Venezuela display the highest sensitivity to commodity price shocks, with expenditures responding significantly more than revenues. At the other end of the spectrum, in Chile expenditures respond very little to commodity price fluctuations and the dynamic responses of its fiscal indicators are very similar to those seen in high-income commodity-exporting countries. The results suggest that this heterogeneity may relate to the enactment of fiscal rules, as dynamic panel estimations show that government expenditures in countries with fiscal rules respond less to shocks to commodity prices.","[Medina, Leandro] Mozambique IMFs African Dept, Maputo, Mozambique",,"Medina, L (通讯作者)，Mozambique IMFs African Dept, Maputo, Mozambique.",,,,,,,,32,8,11,0,2,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

In recent years changes have been introduced into the design of CT programmes that go some way towards addressing this concern. This article critically engages the meaning of transformative social protection and introduces a collection of papers that examine whether and under what conditions cash transfers can be transformative'. Among the issues addressed are whether CTs can be catalysts leading to positive changes, material, subjective and relational in the lives of poor people; what are the social effects of CTs for beneficiaries, their households and communities; and can they foster horizontal relationships within communities and vertical relationship with the state through developing forms of social accountability and citizenship engagement?","[Molyneux, Maxine] UCL Inst Amer, 51 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PN, England; [Jones, With Nicola; Samuels, Fiona] ODI, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Molyneux, M (通讯作者)，UCL Inst Amer, 51 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PN, England.",m.molyneux@ucl.ac.uk,"Jones, Nicola/ADU-5656-2022","Jones, Nicola/0000-0002-9164-7947",,,,,39,74,81,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

It is often described as a sovereign debt crisis, but in fact, it is really a sequence of interactions between sovereign problems and banking problems that caused a severe economic slowdown. It also caused a fragmentation of euro-area financial markets. The genesis of the crisis focuses on the imbalances in European Monetary Union (EMU) countries balance-of-payments, where the TARGET2 payment system became crucial, reflecting stress in the funding of banking systems in crisis-hit countries. The decisions by European leaders to set up a banking union and the announcement, as well as adoption, of non-standard measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) greatly contributed to restoring confidence in the euro-area financial markets, improving market sentiment and reversing the earlier trend towards market fragmentation.

Using a pastoral based livestock system as the case study, the methodology required to develop this predictive Information System is described. Building upon real-time weather, satellite grass growth and soil information, a local setting and a bio-physical model of weather and market changes on farm level economic outcomes are utilized. The aim is to use the back-end framework described here to develop decision support tools for farmers to provide benchmark information in relation to the financial and technical attributes to a similar top, middle or bottom one-third performing farm.

Rogers. The main topic of the paper is the importance of team positions for the efficient execution of tasks, from the perspective several scientific findings. These aspects of leadership will accentuate the fundamental principles of PCA based on an empathic understanding and acceptance, i.e. without any conditions and a positive acceptance of a teaching employee by a director, respectively by top management of schools. The said PCA characteristic allows the creation of school manager team through equal representation of the various team roles. There are companies in Slovakia, which apply the Test of team roles for selecting the employees or other tools such as the Test of the professional type, which was established by Holland. These approaches will allow a professional approach to creating a work team that can effectively cooperate and participate in the fulfillment of tasks in variable levels of difficulty.

The demand for such services depends on the industry, energy, infrastructure development, investment projects in particular countries, as well as on economic policies. The paper identifies key factors that need to be taken under consideration when planning oversized cargo transportation services, i.e., specific characteristics, conditions, technology, tools, techniques, and methods, for example, a method of transportation service cost estimations. The proposed method uses fuzzy set theory. It can be implemented into the practice of transportation-freight forwarding-logistics enterprises, facilitating the modeling of uncertainties typical in such undertakings.

For the economy, it is not important if these needs are satisfied through public or private funds or if there is a system based on contributions or benefits. Our paper offers an economic view of ageing population from the perspective of the estimate of pension liabilities.The paper also shows that the influence of the choice of the system is not important in terms of the economy. Of course, it is important for each of individuals. The problem is connected with equity, solidarity and efficiency of the management of funds. Regardless of the system, liabilities to people in the retirement are equal. Although these estimates are based on various assumptions that may vary over time, the total value of pension entitlements represents key information for policy makers. Thus the estimated proportion of pension liabilities to GDP reflects the amount of output that will be needed to satisfy the needs of current and future retirees.","[Simkova, Martina; Sixta, Jaroslav; Langhamrova, Jitka] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Langhamrová, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Prague, Czech Republic.",martina.simkova@vse.cz; sixta@vse.cz; langhamj@vse.cz,"Sixta, Jaroslav/J-9828-2014; Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019",,,,,,27,9,9,2,25,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In addition to that the relevance of employee potential should also established through literature review. The overview of dynamic capabilities was also made and the relationship between dynamic capabilities and employee potential is also to be portrayed. By doing so the methods how employee potential can also develop organisational dynamic capabilities can be carried out. Methodology/methods This is aimed to be a theoretical article and in relation to that the scientific literature analysis to substantiate employee potential and dynamic capabilities were carried out. Scientific aim To further theoretically develop and demonstrate the dynamic capabilities concept by establishing its relationship with employee potential present in organisations. Findings Employee potential can be defined as the characteristics of an employee, which is valuable for the company, consequently can be given to the company by the employee and (or) utilized by the company but currently not being used by the company. In fact the company can be indirectly or accidentally using these potententials, but due to this the company cannot purposefully channel the employee potential to become a tool to achieve the competitive advantage. The constant requirement to strategically change in accordance with the environment while using the resources which in this case is the employee portrays the need for the company to constantly obtain something new from the employee. While the condition remains that for obtaining something new from the employee, the company must not be using that aspect in prior. As a result the findings are substantiated theoretically. Conclusions The clear definition of employee potential is established by portraying its relevance through literature analysis. The description of Dynamic Capabilities was presented as the ability of the firm to purposefully create, extend, or modify its resource base in congruence with the changing business environment. Finally theoretically it was discussed employee potential can develop dynamic capabilities. The next possible step for this research is to carry out the empirical study on the demonstrated contents.

There are reports available in Polish works on these issues at national level, but there is no analysis devoted to individual provinces, including the Podlaskie province. It was particularly important to recognize the issue of relations of trust and cooperation between businesses and institutions of science in the perspective opportunities for development of cluster structures. Methodology/methods The study included 381 companies. Identification of the factors influencing trust and cooperation was based on the analysis of literature and interviews with experts. Statistical calculations were made with the use of StatSoft STATISTICA. Scientific aim The aim of the analysis carried out in this text was to identify the relations between trust and cooperation of companies with science institutions as well as the areas of cooperation between business and science sectors. Findings The analysis showed that the dominant percentage of the studied companies have not previously undertaken any cooperation with the institutions of science. Little optimism can be seen in assessing the level of interest of the researched companies in cooperation with the science sector in the near future. Empirically confirmed was the positive correlation between trust and cooperative actions of the surveyed companies and institutions of science. Conclusions From the perspective of the possibility to create cluster links, as supports for innovation in north-eastern Poland, the obtained results are not optimistic. We should therefore seek to initiate cooperation between enterprises and institutions of science. On one hand, we must break the stereotype of a scientist as someone completely detached from the reality, who conducts unnecessary research and on the other hand we must strive to improve entrepreneurs' awareness of the need for learning throughout life, complement their knowledge and show them the specific benefits of lifelong learning.","[Wasiluk, Anna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Ul O St Tarasiuka 2, PL-16001 Kleosin K Bialegostoku, Poland",,"Wasiluk, A (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Ul O St Tarasiuka 2, PL-16001 Kleosin K Bialegostoku, Poland.",a.wasiluk@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,629,636,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200078,0

With growing product heterogeneity, labels can help consumers differentiate higher quality products on supermarket shelves. Currently, most labels are of a binary nature-meaning a product either has certain characteristics or not-although there is a larger product heterogeneity in the food market than just two standards. A multi-level label might be a solution to addressing this problem. The objective of this article is to investigate if influences on consumer satisfaction with ethical food labeling systems differ between a binary and a multi-level labeling system. A consumer survey was carried out in Germany (n = 1,538) comparing the two types of labels with a split-sample approach. The influence of five factors (comprehensibility, involvement, time pressure, trust and use), derived from the literature, were analyzed in a structural equation model. All these factors influence satisfaction with labeling. Furthermore, differences between the two labeling systems were detected. This article delivers important results for food producers and policy makers. The group comparison indicated that trust as a precondition is more necessary for a binary label whereas time pressure factors reduce satisfaction with multi-level labeling.","[Weinrich, Ramona] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Management Agribusiness, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Spiller, Achim] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Weinrich, R (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Management Agribusiness, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",weinrich@agr.uni-goettingen.de; a.spiller@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022; Weinrich, Ramona/AAR-5640-2021","Weinrich, Ramona/0000-0001-5199-682X",German Academic Exchange Service,German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This study was supported by the German Academic Exchange Service in the form of a short-term doctoral research scholarship.,,72,3,3,0,16,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

And the results show as follows: there are comparative disadvantages on the export trade of primary products in Taiwan, and the disadvantages are gradually deteriorating. Industrial manufactured goods generally get rid of the comparative disadvantage, but they are still at a very weak advantage on the international competition. In Taiwan the overall comparative advantage of exports is not obvious.

Tariffs on the carbon embodied in imported goods from countries without emission pricing appeal as a measure to reduce carbon leakage and protect domestic EITE industries. We show that the introduction of carbon tariffs can do more harm than good to domestic EITE industries. Two determinants drive the sign and magnitude of EITE impacts. First, the composition of embodied emissions in intermediate inputs to EITE production: if a large share of embodied carbon is imported in intermediate inputs, industries might suffer from cost increases due to carbon tariffs. Second, the share of domestic output that is supplied to the export market: while carbon tariffs level the playing field on domestic markets, they increase the cost disadvantage vis-a-vis competitors from abroad in foreign markets.","[Bohringer, Christoph; Schneider, Jan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany; [Muller, Andre] ECOPLAN, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33316 USA",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Böhringer, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.",christophboehringer@uni-oldenburg.de; mueller@ecoplan.ch; jan.schneider@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,20,19,19,8,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

A number of negative relationships between media use and wives' and husbands' marital quality emerged. Husbands' use of social networking websites, in particular, was associated with many of the marital quality variables. The effect sizes of media use were small, however. We also explored whether the relationship worked in reverse and whether media use differences between the spouses would relate to marital quality. When spouses reported different levels of using video games, they also reported lower levels of marital quality.

We firstly model long memory and regime switching via the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) and Markov Regime-Switching (MRS) models, respectively. Their finite-sample properties and the confusion are investigated via simulations. To control for the cause of this confusion, we propose the MRS-ARFIMA model. A Monte Carlo study shows that this framework can effectively distinguish between the pure ARFIMA and pure MRS processes. Furthermore, MRS-ARFIMA outperforms the ordinary ARFIMA model for data simulated from the MRS-ARFIMA process. Finally, empirical studies of hourly and five-minute Garman-Klass and realized volatility of the FTSE index is conducted to demonstrate the advantages and usefulness of the proposed MRS-ARFIMA framework compared with the ARFIMA and MRS models in practice.

We address these questions using data from ten Eurozone countries and the UK. The findings document the predictability role of liquidity proxies on economic growth, suggesting that stock market liquidity influences economic growth. The results reveal that liquidity increases substantially after a structural break realized around the Euro's introduction in Europe, and in all countries except Portugal we find that liquidity improvement coincides with higher growth.

It shows that when insurers differ in their default probabilities there can exist equilibria in which different risk types partially or completely self-sort into insurance contracts offered by different insurers. Partial separation can occur when insurer default and insurance risks are uncorrelated. Full separation is possible when they are correlated. For example, low-risk insured parties may match with higher default-risk insurers, while high-risk insured parties match with lower default-risk insurers.","[Stephens, Eric] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Thompson, James R.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Carleton University; University of Waterloo,"Stephens, E (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",eric.stephens@carleton.ca; james@uwaterloo.ca,,,SSHRC Grant [435-2013-0180],SSHRC Grant(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Eric Stephens is at Carleton University.

The foreign ownership return is of similar economic significance as traditional country and industry factors in explaining international stock returns. It is not related to omitted fundamentals or wealth effects but shifts substantially around ADR and index listings when the investor habitat changes.

Such scheme generates enforcement leverage as non-compliance triggers greater future scrutiny increasing the expected costs of non-compliance beyond the avoidance of immediate fines. In this paper, we propose an improved transition structure for the audit framework, in which targeting is based not only on firms' past compliance record but also on adoption of environmentally superior technologies. We show that this transition structure would not only foster the adoption of new technology but also increase deterrence by changing the composition of firms in the industry toward an increased fraction of cleaner firms that pollute and violate less.","[Coria, Jessica] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Zhang, Xiao-Bing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Renmin University of China,"Coria, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Jessica.Coria@economics.gu.se; xbzhmail@gmail.com,"Zhang, Xiao-Bing/IAQ-6426-2023","Zhang, Xiao-Bing/0000-0001-8155-5769; Coria, Jessica/0000-0002-6754-9511",Swedish Research Council (FORMAS); research program Instrument Design for Global Climate Mitigation (INDIGO); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),Swedish Research Council (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); research program Instrument Design for Global Climate Mitigation (INDIGO); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"Research funding from the Swedish Research Council (FORMAS), and from the research program Instrument Design for Global Climate Mitigation (INDIGO) is gratefully acknowledged.

A series of interviews with walking group leaders explored the design of organised walks, and factors affecting journeys to and from start points. The themes presented suggest an overlying group culture involving mainly circular walks, reached by car. The research indicates an underlying engrained dependency on cars to reach walks and a degree of opposition to using public transport, which generally contradicts widely-held attitudes towards protecting the environment. Future research should focus more in depth on the long-term removal of psychological barriers to using public transport for leisure, and persuasive measures aimed at groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agents have rational expectations about financial crises as rare events, the probability the central bank purchases assets, and the exit strategy. Selling off assets quickly produces a double-dip recession while slowly unwinding generates a smooth recovery. Expectations about the exit strategy influence the initial effectiveness of purchases. Increasing the probability of purchases during crises distorts the pre-crisis economy and depends upon the exit strategy.

Our corruption controls include bribing on exams, on term papers, for credit, and for university admission. We use a robust nonparametric approach in order to estimate the probability of bribing across the four different categories. This approach is shown to be robust to a variety of different types of endogeneity often encountered under commonly assumed parametric specifications. Our main findings indicate that corruption perceptions, past bribing behavior, and the perceived criminality of bribery are significant factors for all four categories of bribery. From a policy perspective, we argue that when bribe control enforcement is difficult, anti-corruption education programs targeting social perceptions of corruption could be appropriate.

We are especially interested in how the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) related performance of the corresponding countries moderates this relationship. We find only weak evidence that superior corporate social performance (CSP) results in systematically reduced credit risk. However, we do find strong support for our hypothesis that a country's ESG performance moderates the CSP-credit risk relationship. Superior CSP is regarded as risk-reducing and rewarded with better ratings and lower z-spreads only if it is recognized by the environment. In addition, we find a reduction of corporate bonds' z-spreads by approx. 9.64 basis points if the CSP of a company mirrors the ESG performance of the country it is located in. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the presence of cross-firm professional ties between directors and senior executives along the supply chain significantly reduces the probability of relationship termination around customers' industry negative shocks and during financial crises. The results are robust using professional-tie strength as an alternative measure. Exploring contingency effects, we find that, for suppliers who lack R&D, face high competition, are smaller in size, or are less important to customers in terms of sales, such professional ties are more helpful in sustaining such relationships. Furthermore, we find that professional ties also significantly reduce firm risk during periods of market turbulence. Taken together, our results suggest that professional ties along the supply chain can facilitate information flow and build mutual trust, which can lead to healthy long-term relationships and can help firms survive economic and industry downturns.

For a sample of 1397 trips, we fitted a multinomial logit regression model. According to this model, route choice is relatively little influenced by actual travel time. This corresponds with the fact that many drivers did not choose the shortest time route. Travel distance in combination with one route type velocity for all orbital routes, and one route type velocity for all center routes is the most derisive factor. The route type velocity indicates how fast and attractive routes of that type are (being perceived). The results support the hypothesis that orbital routes are more attractive as these routes avoid the busy city center. This effect is however partly offset by the fact that drivers also prefer routes in the direction of their destination. These direct routes are mainly center routes. The results show the importance of considering complete routes in relation to their location and not only as a set of links and nodes when modeling route choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Contract enforcement affects the expected repayment of private loans. Therefore, if lenders receive negative information from the sovereign default about the state's capacity to enforce contracts, they worsen the financial conditions offered to local firms, triggering a sharp reduction in credit and investment. The key contribution of this paper is to rationalize the worsened private-sector financial conditions observed after default episodes by modeling the price effect of the informational channel.

The MS-VAR model is capable of determining both the sign and direction of causality. We account for the nonlinear, long memory and seasonal features of the inflation series simultaneously by measuring inflation uncertainty as the conditional variance of inflation generated by recursive estimation of a Seasonal Fractionally Integrated Smooth Transition Autoregressive Asymmetric Power GARCH (SEA-FISTAR-APGARCH) model using monthly data for the period 1921:01 to 2012:12. The recursive, rather than full-sample, estimation allows us to obtain a time-varying measure of uncertainty and better mimics the real-time scenario faced by economic agents and/or policy makers. The inferred probabilities from the four-state MS-VAR model show evidence of a time-varying relationship. The conditional (i.e. lead-lag) and regime-prediction Granger causality provide evidence in favor of Friedman's hypothesis. This implies that past information on inflation can help improve the one-step-ahead prediction of inflation uncertainty but not vice versa. Our results have some important policy implications.

Tuck's discussion exposes the emphasis Olson places on imperceptibility'' in his analysis of free riding. Tuck makes a plausible case for thinking that Olson confuses incentives to free ride (which are a matter of the relative benefit to the individual of contributing to a public purpose compared with the cost) with negligibility of contribution. Moreover, Olson seems to confuse imperceptibility of individual contribution on aggregate output with imperceptibility of action. In lots of cases where there are norms of contributing, compliance with the norm is totally detectable even if the effects of a single individual's compliance on aggregate realization of the common purpose are not. But many forces for compliance (of which social esteem is one) rely only on the latter kind of perceptibility. I conclude with Tuck's analysis of voting-partly because the topic is of special interest to a public choice readership, and partly because turnout seems to be a notable case where there is significant contribution despite the large numbers setting-and hence a challenge to the spirit of Olson's emphasis on numbers as such.","[Brennan, Geoffrey] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Philosophy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Brennan, Geoffrey] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Brennan, Geoffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Australian National University; Duke University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Brennan, G (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Dept Philosophy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",geoffrey.brennan@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,14,3,3,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2015,164.0,3-4,,,,,235,250,,10.1007/s11127-015-0294-3,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU7NM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363727500004,0

Child care is essential to economic self-sufficiency, and it can also support child development, particularly for low-income children. However, most research has an urban focus so little is known about rural settings where formal programs are limited and of lower quality. In this paper we examine the subsidy use of rural families, the care arrangements they make, and the quality of care received. We utilized data collected between 2004 and 2007 from the Family Life Project, a representative, longitudinal study of non-metro families in low-wealth counties (n = 1,292), oversampled for low-income and African-American families. Families who used subsidies were more likely to select center-based care, typically of higher quality. Further, these families were also more likely to receive higher quality care, regardless of the type chosen, even after accounting for a host of family and community factors. Findings suggest that subsidy programs have successfully moved low-income children into higher quality care beneficial for development. These findings point to the need to maintain subsidy programs and encourage eligible families to take advantage of such resources.","[De Marco, Allison] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Frank Porter Graham Child Dev Inst, 517 S Greensboro St, Carrboro, NC 27510 USA; [Vernon-Feagans, Lynne] Univ N Carolina, Sch Educ Sci & Special Educ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"De Marco, A (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Frank Porter Graham Child Dev Inst, 517 S Greensboro St, Carrboro, NC 27510 USA.",ademarco@unc.edu; lynnevf@email.unc.edu,,,NICHD [P01-HD39667]; ACF [90YE0126]; NIDA,NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); ACF(United States Department of Health & Human Services); NIDA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)),"This research was supported by NICHD P01-HD39667 and ACF # 90YE0126, with co-funding by NIDA.",,98,10,15,2,9,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

In this paper, we develop a simple two-country incomplete-market model equipped with domestic reserve markets to structurally investigate this anecdotal evidence known as the Soros chart. In this model, we theoretically verify that a market discount factor close to one generates near random-walk behavior of an equilibrium nominal exchange rate in accordance with a permanent component of the augmented monetary base differential as an economic fundamental. Results of a Bayesian posterior simulation with post-Plaza Accord data of Japan and the United Stats plausibly support our model as a data generating process of the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate. The model identifies the two-country differential in money demand shocks as the main generator of the sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar under the Abenomics. We discuss data evidence that the identified money demand shocks are tightly correlated with longer-term interest rate differentials between the two countries.

Likewise, the scope of policy liberalization is influenced by the political power structure as manifested in institutional and political constraints on the executive (IPCE). However, social trust and IPCE are possibly intertwined in their effects on economic liberalization. This paper empirically explores the relationship between social trust, IPCE and the scope of economic deregulation as measured by the first difference in the regulation subindex of the Economic Freedom of the World index. The results provide evidence in favor of a positive association of social trust with deregulation and of a negative association between institutional or partisan veto-points and deregulation. Yet, according to our analysis IPCE are an obstacle for economic deregulation only in relatively low trusting environments and social trust unfolds a particular strength as driver of deregulation with increasing levels of IPCE.

But such measures often fail to distinguish spatial scales of agglomeration. In a previous paper, Mori and Smith (2014) proposed a pair of quantitative measures for distinguishing both the scale and degree of industrial agglomeration based on an explicit method for detecting spatial clusters. The first, designated as the global extent of industrial clusters, measures the spatial spread of these clusters in terms of the areal size of their essential containment, defined to be the (convex-solid) region containing the most significant subset of these clusters. The second, designated as the local density of industrial clusters, measures the spatial extent of individual clusters within their essential containment in terms of the areal share of that containment occupied by clusters. The present paper applies this pair of measures to manufacturing industries in Japan, and the results obtained are systematically compared to those of the most prominent scalar measures currently in use. Finally, these measures are shown to support certain predictions of new economic geography models concerning the relationship between shipment distances and spatial scales of agglomeration for individual industries.

This contrasts with cuts to other areas of education spending and across other areas of government spending more generally. This real-terms increase has been delivered by an increase in funding going to the most disadvantaged pupils via the pupil premium. (Other types of funding were frozen in cash terms per pupil.) One of the consequences of this reform is that funding is increasingly concentrated on schools catering for the highest proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is in contrast to school systems in some other countries (for example, the US), where resources tend to be more highly correlated with local property values. Looking forward, rising pupil numbers, together with reforms that will increase the cost of employing staff, will contribute to increasing school costs over the coming years, with school spending needing to increase by at least 20 per cent in cash terms just to keep funding per pupil constant in real terms after accounting for expected cost increases for schools.","UCL, Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University College London,"Sibieta, L (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England.",luke_s@ifs.org.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/H021221/1]; Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS (grant reference ES/H021221/1).

The paper shows that acquirers finance their cash bids with equity only if they lack access to competitive financing. This leads to underbidding and lower takeover premiums. Conversely, acquirers with access to competitive financing use debt and overbid. Endogenizing the payment method reveals that security (e.g., stock) bids carry lower premiums than cash bids, backed by competitive financing. These insights find empirical support and could help explain existing evidence, which contradicts prior theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, ongoing investment is needed from regulators and government to ensure that alternative routes to licensing are accessible, affordable, and sustainable.","Off Fairness Commissioner, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Augustine, J (通讯作者)，Off Fairness Commissioner, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,54,8,9,0,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Using a panel of recent US start-ups, we investigate how small bank presence affects these firms in normal times (2004-06) and in the recent financial crisis (2007-09). We find that greater small bank presence yields significantly more lending to and slightly lower failure rates of these firms during normal times. However, these benefits disappear during the financial crisis, possibly because small banks are less diversified and benefit less from government guarantees than large banks.","[Berger, Allen N.] Univ S Carolina, Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Berger, Allen N.] Univ S Carolina, European Banking Ctr, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Cerqueiro, Geraldo] Catolic Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Penas, Maria Fabiana] Tilburg Univ, European Banking Ctr, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Penas, Maria Fabiana] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law & Econ Ctr, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Berger, AN (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",,,"Cerqueiro, Geraldo/0000-0002-6709-1512",,,,,34,36,42,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In this respect we used the information published into the non-financial reports of 19 organizations that had adhered to the pilot programme of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). We selected a number of 30 environment and social indicators reflecting both positive and negative aspects, and we analysed the manner in which they are presented within the reports published by the organizations, following the activities to be taken into consideration for the development of a sustainable marketing strategy: supply - production - distribution. The results of the study emphasized the fact that, regardless of the sector where the organizations run their activity, though there is no homogenous display, they report mainly the indicators presenting positive information 53 %), whereas the indicators presenting negative information are reported only in proportion of 33%. The organizations holding information regarding suppliers' sustenability emphasize this aspect in order to create a brand value whereas the rest of the organizations state that they shall proceed to such evaluations in the future. Interpreting these results through the agency of the institutional theory leads to the conclusion that certain organizations' option to voluntarily report according to a certain referential is carried out mainly in order to obtain rightfulness. Moreover, the sustainable conduct adopted by the main market competitors generates a mimetic-type isomorphism.","[Calu, Adriana] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Negrei, Costel; Calu, Daniela Artemisa; Avram, Viorel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Calu, DA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",daniela.calu@cig.ase.ro,"Calu, Daniela Artemisa/N-5763-2017","Calu, Daniela Artemisa/0000-0002-2306-5275; Avram, Viorel/0000-0002-4144-0876",,,,,51,9,9,0,55,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,977,993,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700009,0

This means creating more products - values, for more customers, with superior productivity and proper management of the risks caused by growth itself. In this context, the expression grow or disappear is replaced by improve in order to stay competitive. The objective of this paper is to highlight the way in which the implementation of the sustainable development principles are correlated with the aspects of organic growth in tourism and the possibility of evaluating the organic growth from the perspective of sustainable development. In order to achieve the proposed objective, it was conducted a qualitative marketing research among hotel managers in Brasov County. Collected using the quota method, the sample is a non-probabilistic type, and the research was conducted based on semi-structured interview, a method chosen in accordance to the type of research. The major contributions of the research process are to highlight the relation between the sustainable development and organic growth, to propose a general configuration of the marketing strategy pillars of sustainable business in tourism and to identify some methods of evaluating the organic growth from the perspective of sustainable development.","[Epuran, Gheorghe; Dovleac, Lavinia; Ivasciuc, Ioana Simona; Tescasiu, Bianca] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Epuran, G (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",epuran.gheorghe@unitbv.ro,"Tescasiu, Bianca/K-3418-2016; Ivasciuc, Ioana Simona/H-1066-2016; Epuran, Gheorghe/N-4395-2015","Ivasciuc, Ioana Simona/0000-0003-1746-5691; Epuran, Gheorghe/0000-0002-4959-102X; DOVLEAC, LAVINIA/0000-0001-6963-9695",Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) from the European Social Fund; Romanian Government [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134378],Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) from the European Social Fund; Romanian Government(Romanian Government),"This paper is supported by the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD), financed from the European Social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134378.",,20,2,2,0,32,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,927,937,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700006,0

The existing literature suggests that a number of economic and political variables are important, but there is disagreement about their relative significance. Moreover, the fit of general participation models is not particularly good. An increasingly popular view in the recent literature is that the pattern of IMF lending is politically driven and that it reflects the interests of the Fund's leading shareholders; the US is seen as exerting a powerful influence. Using both quantitative and qualitative techniques, and based on an informal analytical framework, we examine in detail the factors that may be at work. We cover the period from 1984 to 2008. We discover considerable variation across the nature of programs (concessional and non-concessional), income levels, geographic regions, and time periods. The degree of observed variation means that it is unsafe to use one general participation model as the basis for evaluating the effects of IMF programs. It also means that the design of policy needs to reflect the nuances that the data reveal.","[Bird, Graham] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Mylonas, Jim] BCA Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rowlands, Dane] Carleton Univ, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School; Carleton University,"Bird, G (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",gbird@cmc.edu,,,,,,,42,5,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Our results, obtained by the quantile regression method for panel data models, are consistent with a relatively high level of capital mobility in the EU-24. They also indicate that the higher ratios of domestic investment to GDP (I/GDP) in the EU-24 are less restricted by domestic saving IS/GDP), while the two ratios (I/GDP and S/GDP) are more closely related in countries with low investment rates. Our main findings are also confirmed by the results of the Granger causality test, which we undertook to ascertain if domestic saving plays an active role in financing investment in the Enlarged EU.

In a panel data set of 64 countries from 1985-2009, I show a significant presence of threshold effects of financial integration on international consumption risk sharing. The results indicate the presence of two significant thresholds and three corresponding regimes. Below the lower threshold is limited but statistically significant consumption risk-sharing. Above the higher threshold is significant risk-sharing. However, intermediate to the two thresholds is a regime with excess volatility. These findings are therefore suggestive of a U-shaped relationship between financial integration and consumption risk-sharing, with a potentially destabilizing intermediate regime.

For this purpose, the study adopts a distinct methodology combining Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) and panel threshold regression analyses. The data from a large sample of countries are used and time-varying ERPT measure is obtained with an application of DCC-GARCH to each country in the sample. Then the macroeconomic determinants of ERPT are examined by making use of both cross country and time variations in a panel regression model. The time varying structure of ERPT clearly shows that the ERPT degree has been low over the last three decades and declining dramatically since mid-1990s. Further, ERPT responds positively to average inflation and inflation rate volatility while negatively to exchange rate volatility, the degree of openness and output gap. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our experimental results show that the likelihood of insurance purchase increases with ambiguous increases in the probability of loss. When insurance is unavailable, individuals invest more in precaution when the probability of loss is known than when it is ambiguous. Our results suggest that sources of ambiguity surrounding liability losses may explain the documented tendency to overinsure against liability rather than meet a standard of care through precaution. The results provide support for our theoretical predictions related to risk management decisions under alternative probabilities of loss and information conditions, and have implications for liability, environmental, and catastrophe insurance markets.","[Bajtelsmit, Vickie; Coats, Jennifer C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Thistle, Paul] Univ Nevada, Dept Finance, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Colorado State University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Coats, JC (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Vickie.bajtelsmit@colostate.edu; Jennifer.Coats@colostate.edu; Paul.thistle@unlv.edu,,,Georgia State University Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk; Colorado State University College of Business; Nevada Insurance Education Foundation,Georgia State University Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk; Colorado State University College of Business; Nevada Insurance Education Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous referee, the Editor Kip Viscusi, Glenn Harrison, James Sundali, Bill Rankin, and seminar participants at Colorado State University, Ludwig-Maximilian University, University of Munster, and at a Behavioral Insurance Workshop sponsored by the Georgia State University Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Nevertheless, it has macroeconomic implications in providing insurance against domestic output shocks in the recipient economies - a phenomenon known in literature as risk sharing (income smoothing). Using a large sample of 86 developing countries for the period 1990-2010, we establish that remittance inflows serve as an important channel through which risk sharing takes place in the developing world. The extent of income smoothing via remittances stands at around 5% on average. Subsequently, we explore the underlying factors that explain countries' ability to share risk through remittances. The diversification of migrants turns out to be the leading explanation for the extent of risk sharing via remittances: the more diverse the migration destinations of a country, the higher the amount of risk shared. In addition, the size of remittance flows appears to have a strong and statistically significant impact on enhancing risk sharing. We also find suggestive evidence that a higher proportion of remittances originating from farther countries facilitate more risk sharing compared to those originating from neighbouring or regional economies.

Moving from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile of market concentration is associated with 6.6 per cent greater antibiotic use.

The concept of institutionalization describes the extent to which politics takes place, and is believed to take place, via formal political institutions. Countries vary in their degree of institutionalization, hence, in the degree to which political actors pursue their goals via conventional politics or via alternative political technologies. This paper postulates that if politics is conducted largely outside of formal channels, the structure of the formal channels should not matter much as a determinant of policy outcomes. To address this issue this paper proposes a new index of institutionalization and with it revisits seminal work regarding the impact of constitutions on public spending. The findings show that the effect of constitutional rules on policy outcomes is conditional on the degree of institutionalization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Components related to the framework for regulation and supervision are more strongly linked to outcomes at the MFI level, including loan portfolio quality, financial self-sufficiency, average loan size, and the share of lending to women.

In this model new firms first enter markets; then grow internally, financing from retained earnings; and finally distribute their profits in the steady state. We find that under a nonlinear tax the owners prefer a smooth flow of dividends, which encourages firms to begin distributions right from the start. This early-distribution incentive (EDI) slows down investments and leads to delayed growth. Our calculations indeed confirm that a revenue-neutral switch from a linear to a progressive tax exacerbates production losses. We further demonstrate that this distortion can be reduced by carrying forward unused tax allowances with interest, as proposed e.g. by Mirrlees et al.

Two large cohorts were used to evaluate income gradients in children from 9 months to 5 years and from 6 to 14 years using dynamic specifications of random effects models. An income gradient in parental reports of poor child health was observed in two large cohorts of contemporary US children with ages ranging from infancy to early adolescence. When estimated in separate models both current and averaged income exhibited steepening gradients over the ages of both samples. When estimated jointly only current income exhibited a steepening gradient. While state dependence in health was indicated in dynamic models it did not influence the magnitude or age profile of the income effects. The findings suggested that the age profile of an income-health gradient in the health of US children may depend on whether income is measured as a long-term or short-term variable. Distinguishing these patterns is important for an understanding of how families cope with their children's health adversities.,"[Murasko, Jason] Univ Houston Clear Lake, Econ, 2700 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX 77058 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston Clear Lake,"Murasko, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Houston Clear Lake, Econ, 2700 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX 77058 USA.",muraskoj@uhcl.edu,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Among the most common in the context of transportation systems are the grid, ring, hub-and-spoke, complete, scale-free and small-world networks. This paper investigates the role of network topology, and the topology's characteristics, in a transportation system's ability to cope with disaster. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that the topological attributes of a transportation system significantly affect its resilience to disaster events. Resilience accounts for not only the innate ability of the system to absorb externally induced changes, but also cost-effective and efficient, adaptive actions that can be taken to preserve or restore performance post-event. Comprehensive and systematically designed numerical experiments were conducted on 17 network structures with some relation to transportation system layout. Resilience of these network structures in terms of throughput, connectivity or compactness was quantified. Resilience is considered with and without the benefits of preparedness and recovery actions. The impact of component-level damage on system resilience is also investigated. A comprehensive, systematic analysis of results from these experiments provides a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and conversely identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems.

In this article I review Indonesia's FDI record in a historical perspective; the current urge to control FDI inflows and the need to augment domestic savings and facilitate technology transfers are not at all new in Indonesia. I draw in particular on the discourse on FDI in this journal, the Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, giving special attention to contributions by this journal to the international literature on FDI and its impact. The article demonstrates that the relation between FDI and economic growth has been less straightforward in Indonesia than elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Although FDI has grown in a restrictive investment climate, on occasion it has failed to do so despite more liberal conditions. This may be attributed to the sustained role of natural resources in determining Indonesia's attractiveness as a host country of FDI.","Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Lindblad, JT (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,68,20,21,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

This paper presents the attitude of students from the Bucharest University of Economic Studies towards the adoption of innovative retail technologies within hypermarkets in Romania, based on a selective marketing research, conducted on a sample of 359 students from undergraduate and master cycles. The main objectives focused on identifying: the image of certain instruments belonging to the innovative commercial technologies in terms of usefulness in the process of buying; the intention to use innovative commercial technologies; the perception of the main advantages and disadvantages of using innovative commercial technologies in the buying process; the importance of commercial technologies in relation to other attributes underlying the development of a hypermarket image. Research results show a relatively low level of awareness among buyers, due to a reduced exposure to innovative commercial technologies, but a relatively high availability of acceptance in the purchasing process. Thus, there is a favourable assessment of the utility of commercial instruments in the buying process and a relatively high intention of use. The paper also highlights the influence of innovative commercial technologies on store image and loyalty of buyers.","[Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan; Vranceanu, Diana Maria; Filip, Alina; Tuclea, Claudia Elena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vrânceanu, DM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dvranceanu@yahoo.com,"Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan V/P-1592-2016; Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021; Diana, Vranceanu/E-1737-2013; Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Anghel, Laurentiu Dan V/E-6918-2013; Tuclea, Claudia/R-7491-2019","Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244; Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493; TUCLEA, Claudia-Elena/0000-0002-8104-0041",,,,,26,0,0,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,600,614,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900007,0

Land regulation consists in targeting some land units and remove the private sector from them to increase the quality of the environment. Land regulation is analyzed under two separate criteria: the information available and the delegation structure, i.e., the nature of its objectives (acreages, costs or benefits). It appears that a small number of conditions on the heterogeneity parameters are sufficient to deduct the best regulatory choices. A partial information about land heterogeneity does not always have a positive economic value. The overall efficiency associated with the use of information is in general invariant with the nature of the regulator's objectives.","INRA, UMR 1041 CESAER, F-21000 Dijon, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon,"Ay, JS (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR 1041 CESAER, 26 Blvd Docteur Petitjean, F-21000 Dijon, France.",,"Ay, Jean-sauveur jsay/F-9868-2018",,,,,,40,0,0,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

There are different business models and tools for enhancing the on-line retail industry, which causes changes in the business of the whole retail sector, as well as in the micro and macro social and economic environment. One of consequences of increasing value of the on-line retail industry is a dropping number of customers shopping for products in brick and mortar stores in high streets and city centers. Brick and mortar retailers are exploring new ways to reach these lost shoppers.

A series of risk analysis theoretical, methodological and practical studies are made, but for the tourism risk scientists-economists do not pay attention in practice. Tourism risk assessment models, analyzed in the article, showed their adaptability to tourism industry. Performed tourism economic risk assessment models showed that in the tourism risk classification it is appropriate to use a procedural approach, which is related to the tourism product identification stages. It would be logical to link the identification of risks to the tourism services in stages, as in each stage prevails certain risk groups The aim of the article - to analyze the tourism risk assessment models and on the basis of analysis to develop further tourism risk assessment model.

Nominal wage rigidity leads to a large and temporary decline in real wages. Also, labor productivity tends to decline during crisis leading to a similar decline in real wages. Finally, currency crises can reduce the bargaining power of labor resulting in lower real wages. Using a panel of 86 countries during 1970-2010, the author examines the dynamics of real wages and labor productivity following a large depreciation of the nominal exchange rate in the short, medium, and long run in order to determine the relative importance of each of these factors. The results indicate that in a sample of countries with median exchange rate depreciation of 56 % during crises, real wage per employee on average declines between 20 and 25 % just a year after a currency crisis. Ten years following a currency shock, real wages are still 10-20 % below the pre-crisis level. Labor productivity also declines. But, the decline in real wages is larger and more persistent. The long-lasting nature of the decline in real wages implies that factors beyond nominal wage rigidities are at work. The weak link between real wages and labor productivity during currency crises provides some suggestive evidence in favor of the 'bargaining power' hypothesis. The results are robust to different definitions of currency crises and estimation methods.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Teimouri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Room 403W, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",steimouri@uwlax.edu,,,,,,,37,6,6,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Regulated fares are ignored by auto-rickshaw drivers and customers. They bargain on prices among themselves. Newly announced fare hikes are effective enough to ensure the prevalence of legal uniform (non-negotiated) prices for a considerable amount of time.

We show that the characteristic liquidity premium of U.S. stocks has significantly declined over the past 4 decades. In recent years, characteristic liquidity is significantly priced only for the smallest common stocks. This decline stems from an improvement in liquidity and from a lower sensitivity of expected returns to liquidity. By contrast, systematic liquidity has not been trending down and is still significantly priced primarily among NASDAQ stocks.","[Ben-Rephael, Azi] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kadan, Ohad] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Wohl, Avi] Tel Aviv Univ, Recanati Grad Sch Business Adm, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; Washington University (WUSTL); Tel Aviv University,"Wohl, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Recanati Grad Sch Business Adm, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",abenreph@indiana.edu; kadan@wustl.edu; aviwohl@post.tau.ac.il,,,Family Research Fund for Banking and Finance; Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel,Family Research Fund for Banking and Finance; Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel,"Ben-Rephael, abenreph@indiana.edu, Indiana University, Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, IN 47405; Kadan, kadan@wustl.edu, Washington University in St. Louis, Olin Business School, St. Louis, MO 63130; and Wohl (corresponding author), aviwohl@post.tau.ac.il, Tel Aviv University, Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.

Using various spatial models, the results support the hypothesis of tax mimicking, with coefficients above 0.40. We also show the relevance of political variables such as the ideology of incumbents and political fragmentation. The fact that incumbents with weaker political support exhibit stronger mimicking behavior is interpreted as evidence in favor of yardstick competition. Finally, we find that incumbents mimic neighboring municipalities ruled by the same political party, confirming the political trends hypothesis.","[Delgado, Francisco J.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, GEN, Oviedo 33007, Spain; [Lago-Penas, Santiago] Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, GEN, Orense 32004, Spain; [Lago-Penas, Santiago] IEB, Santiago, Spain; [Mayor, Matias] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Oviedo 33007, Spain",University of Oviedo; Universidade de Vigo; University of Oviedo,"Delgado, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, GEN, Oviedo 33007, Spain.",fdelgado@uniovi.es; slagop@uvigo.es; mmayorf@uniovi.es,"Mayor, Matías/A-1216-2010; Delgado, Francisco J./B-6773-2008; Lago-Peñas, Santiago/D-2004-2013","Mayor, Matías/0000-0001-6466-8884; Delgado, Francisco J./0000-0002-5086-7011; Lago-Peñas, Santiago/0000-0003-4601-8655",,,,,54,38,40,1,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

We show that the performance of momentum strategy is determined by both time horizon and the market dominance of momentum traders. Specifically, when momentum traders are more active in the market, momentum strategies with short (long) time horizons stabilize (destabilize) the market, and meanwhile the market under-reacts (over-reacts) in short-run (long-run). This provides profit opportunity for time series momentum strategies with short horizons and reversal with long horizons. When momentum traders are less active in the market, they always lose.

It is common though not universal to identify a school of thought by the academic location of the main figures associated with the creation and propagation of a particular set of ideas. By this approach, Virginia political economy is associated with the three academic venues where James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock did most of their work. This paper takes a methodological approach to identifying Virginia political economy, which gives Virginia political economy an analytical rather than a regional identity. I do this by employing a form of rational reconstruction to articulate what I perceive to be the analytical hard core of Virginia political economy. While Buchanan and Tullock were pivotal characters in the development of Virginia political economy, that hard core is neither reducible to Buchanan and Tullock nor do they convey fully that hard core as is has arisen through scholarly interaction among many people over 50 years.","George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Wagner, RE (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",rwagner@gmu.edu,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2015,163.0,1-2,,,SI,,15,29,,10.1007/s11127-014-0193-z,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CF6WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352698400003,0
J,"White, LH",,,,"White, Lawrence H.",,,The merits and feasibility of returning to a commodity standard,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Commodity money; Gold standard; Inflation; Fiscal discipline,GOLD STANDARD,"Although few academic economists today endorse a gold standard, historical data show that actual gold standards have outperformed actual fiat standards in at least five respects. Gold standards have exhibited: (1) lower mean inflation rate, hence lower deadweight cost of economizing on money balances; (2) lower price level uncertainty, hence deeper long-term bond markets; (3) greater international trade and capital flows, due to network benefits of a common currency area; (4) lower resource costs of gold mining for monetary purposes with a lower real price of gold, due to the absence of private demand to hold gold as an inflation hedge; and (5) greater fiscal discipline. Returning to a gold standard would be immediately feasible for the US, the Eurozone, and Switzerland, where official gold stocks are large enough at the current price of gold to provide historically reasonable reserve ratios behind broader monetary aggregates. Other major nations (Japan, UK, China) would have to purchase gold. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to earlier studies on this theme, we find evidence that VCs are rewarded for observable mission-based performance measures. Specifically, our results suggest that success in widening participation for students from comprehensive schools and those from areas with low university participation exerts a positive effect on VCs' pay. Securing income flows from university funding council grants also impacts positively on their remuneration. However, even after controlling for a rich array of observable and unobservable factors, there have been sizeable increases in real pay in recent years that cannot be readily explained.","[Bachan, Ray] Univ Brighton, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England; [Reilly, Barry] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Brighton; University of Sussex,"Bachan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Brighton, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England.",R.Bachan@brighton.ac.uk; b.m.reilly@sussex.ac.uk,"Reilly, Barry/AAN-8101-2021","Reilly, Barry/0000-0003-0606-4585; Bachan, Ray/0000-0003-1699-9034",ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,61,13,14,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

These incentives lead to credit rationing and positive-profit interest rates, possibly exceeding the monopoly level. If banks share information about past debts and seniority via credit reporting systems, the incentive to overborrow is mitigated: interest and default rates decrease; credit access improves if the value of collateral is not very volatile, but worsens otherwise. Recent empirical studies report evidence consistent with these predictions.

Banking-industry risk factors directly relate to the banks' financial intermediation functions while market-wide risk factors affect all stocks. In contrast, idiosyncratic risk is driven by individual bank risk characteristics. We analyze the systematic bank risk factors in time series regressions, determine their importance with a democratic orthogonalization technique, and explore the idiosyncratic risk in a panel regression framework. Our results suggest that corporate credit risk and real estate risk are most detrimental in crisis periods, while banks' interest rate risk sensitivity has changed over the last decade. The banks' equity ratio, loan-loss provisions, fraction of real estate loans, and proportion of non-interest income relate to the differences in individual bank risk. Moreover, banks' idiosyncratic risk contains a strong state-level business cycle component. Our results are robust to alternative risk factor specifications. Overall, our study contributes to understanding the structure and time-variation of banks' systematic and idiosyncratic risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model is used to investigate the impact of uncertainty about the likelihood of governmental bailouts on leverage, interest rates, the volume of defaults and the real economy. The distinction between risk and uncertainty is implemented by applying the multiple priors framework to beliefs about the probability of bailout. Results of the analysis include: (i) An unanticipated increase in bailout uncertainty raises interest rates, the volume of defaults in both the real and financial sectors and may lead to a total drying up of credit markets. (ii) Lower exante bailout uncertainty is conducive to higher leverage, which in turn raises moral hazard and makes the economy more vulnerable to expost increases in bailout uncertainty. (iii) Bailout uncertainty affects the likelihood of bubbles, the amplitude of booms and busts as well as the banking and the credit spreads. (iv) Higher bailout uncertainty is associated with higher returns' variability in diversified portfolios and higher systemic risks, (v) Pre-crisis expansionary monetary policy reinforces those effects by inducing higher aggregate leverage levels. (vi) The larger the change in bailout uncertainty and the change in aversion to this uncertainty, the stronger the pre-crisis buildup and the deeper the ensuing crisis. A central policy implication of the analysis is that the vaguest is bailout policy prior to a crisis, the lower is the magnitude of investments destroyed or missed due to errors in evaluating bailout and other intervention policies. On the other hand, the clearer is bailout policy upon the eruption of a crisis, the smaller the contraction of credit and the destruction of investment activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Multivariate analyses revealed evidence that women caregivers experienced greater health penalties than men with care commitments. Mediation analyses further indicated that work-family conflict fully explained the caregiver strain experienced by men, while it only partially accounted for caregiver strain among women.

A 100 basis point increase in the two-year nominal yield on a Federal Open Markets Committee announcement day is associated with a 42 basis point increase in the ten-year forward real rate. This finding is at odds with standard macro-models based on sticky nominal prices, which imply that monetary policy cannot move real rates over a horizon longer than that over which all prices in the economy can readjust. Instead, the responsiveness of long-term real rates to monetary shocks appears to reflect changes in term premia. One mechanism that could generate such variation in term premia is based on demand effects due to the existence of what we call yield-oriented investors. We find some evidence supportive of this channel. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, there is a significantly positive relationship between the supply of trade credit (i.e., accounts receivable) and bank loans and a significantly negative relationship between the demand of trade credit (i.e., accounts payable) and bank loans, indicating a complementary and substitution effect between trade credit and bank loans. Second, this study shows a significant decrease of the demand/supply-side of trade credit at the peak of financial crisis, followed by a subsequent increase of this source of financing after the crisis events. Third, both large and small firms provide significantly less trade credits (accounts receivable) and receive less trade credits (accounts payable) during financial crisis. After the crisis, large firms still provide significantly less trade credit to their customers but receive more trade credits from the suppliers than smaller firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The data used are a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms drawn from the Survey of Business Strategies, for the period 1990-2011. We estimate discrete time proportional hazard models accounting for firm observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Our results are consistent with a process of learning associated with the accumulation of R&D capital and with a self-sustained effect of engagement in R&D activities. In addition, we obtain that persistence in R&D in SMEs is also related to the success-breeds-success, sunk costs and demand-pull hypotheses. Finally, our findings also uncover some interesting differences in the underlying drivers of R&D persistence of SMEs as compared to their larger counterparts.","[Manez, Juan A.; Rochina-Barrachina, Maria E.; Sanchis-Llopis, Amparo; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Manez, Juan A.; Rochina-Barrachina, Maria E.; Sanchis-Llopis, Amparo; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] ERI CES, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Sanchis-Llopis, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Ave Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",sanchisl@uv.es,"Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/ABE-8264-2021; Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./K-8923-2014; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/K-8929-2014","Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/0000-0002-0872-7859; Manez, Juan/0000-0003-1105-0815; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./0000-0001-9664-4668; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/0000-0002-9263-1023","Ministry of Science and Technology in Spain [ECO2011-30323-C03-02, ECO2011-25033]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054]; University of Valencia through the programme Micro-clusters VLC/CAMPUS",Ministry of Science and Technology in Spain(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); University of Valencia through the programme Micro-clusters VLC/CAMPUS,"Financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Spain, Projects numbers ECO2011-30323-C03-02 and ECO2011-25033, from the Generalitat Valenciana, PROMETEOII/2014/054, and from the University of Valencia through the programme Micro-clusters VLC/CAMPUS 2011-2013, is gratefully acknowledged.

The model explains the heterogeneity observed among occupational groups beyond employers and employees, and predicts differences in the sing of the association between entrepreneurs' rates and economic development depending on the entrepreneurs' type. The introduction of a minimum wage leads to involuntary solo self-employed, more skilled voluntary solo self-employed, and fewer employers.

We provide evidence, from a natural experiment in Korea, that reduced tunneling is an important channel. Korean legal reform in 1999 changed the board structure of large firms (assets > 2 trillion won) relative to smaller firms. In event studies of the reform events, we show that large firms whose controllers have incentive to tunnel earn strong positive returns, relative to mid-sized firms. In panel regressions over 1998-2004, we also show that better governance moderates the negative effect of related-party transactions on value and increases the sensitivity of firm profitability to industry profitability (consistent with less tunneling).

Using simple correlations and VAR and Dynamic Conditional Correlations, we reject the hypotheses that price stability is positively correlated with financial stability and that the correlation is stable over time.

The elasticity sharply increased, when gravity equations are estimated by ordinary least squares in log form (log-OLS), while it was broadly stable or slightly increasing, depending on the specification, based on Poisson pseudo-maximal likehood (PPML) in levels, a standard estimator. We show that such a divergence is due to the increased heterogeneity of trade flows. However, gamma pseudo-maximal likehood, which should be consistent under the assumptions that make PPML so appealing, generate estimates that are significantly different from PPML and actually closer to log-OLS.

Empirically, a positive relationship between interest rate volatility and financial instability emerges for the US, UK and Sweden since the early 1990s.

By analysing TH model (Government - University - Industry) in relation to accomplishing TIME main functions: Planning, Organizing and Control (POC), we created a general model which measures TIME effectiveness related to the key elements of the TH model. The general model - TMD-TH (Technology Management and Development - Triple Helix) represents the framework for further more specific research into the relations of the observed dimensions. From the general model, three sub-models are excluded: TMD-G (Government), TMD-U (University) and TMD-I (Industry), and each of TH dimensions is observed by a set of indicators classified from the perspective of the specific function (POC) of TIME. This provides better categorization of TIME indicators and linkage with the actors in the TH model. The applicability of the suggested general model was tested by a set of indicators at the example of Serbia, Austria and Finland and comparison of these countries was made from a perspective of innovativeness and sustainable development. Since technology, innovation and entrepreneurship are considered as the main forces leading to sustainable development at different levels of the economy and society, it is of paramount importance to develop our capacities to better monitor, analyse and develop these forces. A model is developed with a set of indicators that enables the systematic analysis in concrete situations in practice. In this paper, the model is applied at the level of the national economy, the results obtained point to the most critical activities of the actors in the TH model in accomplishing TIME. The performance model represents a base for developing policies and strategy better tuned to the urgent needs of the economy and society in developing TIME directly related to accomplishing a higher level of sustainable development.","[Jaksic, Maja Levi; Jovanovic, Milica; Petkovic, Jasna] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Jovanovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia.",milica.jovanovic@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Jovanović, Milica/AAM-6283-2020; Petković, Jasna/AAC-8660-2022; Jakšić, Maja/JHU-9704-2023","Jovanović, Milica/0000-0001-7618-6356; Petkovic, Jasna/0000-0001-5202-8679",,,,,39,9,10,1,65,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,422,440,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800027,0

Although this topic has been quite ignored until the late twentieth century, a lot of studies and consulting practice have contributed to the fact that there are now a number of theories concerning mentioned correlation. These theories aim to offer a model that would provide better utilization of the possibilities from the business environment which could be very important for the development from both macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects. An increasing number of articles on this topic says enough about its importance, and numerous researches by many reputable globally recognized institutions go in favor of this claim. There are many indicators that observe the economic situation in a country or a region from different aspects, so the analyses of these indicators make it possible to determine the specific relationships between entrepreneurial activities and the local and the global business environment. Given the complexity of these relations, the impact cannot be observed partially, without taking into consideration other important factors, but more detailed analyses, however, result in some useful conclusions, which in the proper context can have a positive impact on many economic factors. It is very important to emphasize the fact that the correlation between the business environment and entrepreneurial activities is bidirectional, since this influence is mutual, so that changes in one of these factors can and usually cause some modifications in the other. Frequent series of such iterations actually lead to changes in the business environment, while entrepreneurial activity changes its shape and affects the economy of a country or a region, which is of particular importance for its competitiveness in the era of globalization.","[Krivokapic, Jovan; Jasko, Ondrej] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Krivokapic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia.",krivokapicj@fon.bg.ac.rs,,"Jasko, Ondrej/0000-0003-4877-0592",,,,,25,1,1,0,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,291,307,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800019,0

We study the effect of loans and equity investments of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) and find that they do not have any consistent effect on firm-level performance and investment, except for a reduction in financial expenditures due to the subsidies accompanying loans. However, BNDES does not systematically lend to underperforming firms. Our results indicate that BNDES subsidizes firms that could fund their projects with other sources of capital.

This belief has important implications for the impact of widely-advocated policy measures, such as revenue sharing. This paper looks at the performance of 16 English football clubs that acquired a stock exchange listing in the mid-1990s. If the European story is true, we should have observed a shift toward profit-maximising behaviour at these clubs, under the assumption that investors were attracted to these football clubs to earn a positive return. This paper finds no evidence of any shift in the behaviour of these 16 clubs after flotation. This result is consistent with the view that football clubs in England have been much more oriented toward profit objectives than is normally assumed.","[Szymanski, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,28,61,66,3,49,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

But how do consumers evaluate sales prices? The standard approach in economics, psychology, and marketing suggests that consumers' estimates are best described by a attribute-based or piecemeal strategy that integrates information about products in a linear additive fashion. Here, we outline and test an alternative theoretical approach from the categorization literature suggesting that consumers sometimes follow an exemplar-based strategy that relies on similarity to previously encountered products. We hypothesize that people switch between these two estimation strategies depending on the context they face. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in which 64 participants repeatedly estimated the market price of different consumer products (bottles of wine). In one condition, the product prices could be well approximated with an attribute-based strategy whereas in the other condition an exemplar-based strategy worked best. Results of a subsequent testing phase indicated that participants switched between strategies depending on the structure of the presented sets. These results show that people rely on different strategies to estimate market prices, which should influence people's consumption behavior. The results suggest that theories on categorization learning can provide a deeper insight into behavior in an economic context and allow predicting consumer behavior more accurately.

However, these researches were mostly based on event studies which identified crises too late. By using banking sector asset price data, the paper finds that economies still thrive in the pre-crisis period in terms of increasing GDP growth. The slowdown of economy in terms of a fall in GDP growth is generally associated with the post-crisis period coinciding with the bubble burst process. Thus, this result supports the policy view that it is not useful to postpone macroeconomic stability to conceal banking sector weakness.","[Li, Xiaojun; Fang, Yan] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Management & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Li, XJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Management & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",xiaojunli5@live.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Six Eurocontrol Member States applying different cost calculation methods were selected and compared in terms of national costs, chargeable costs to users, number of service units and unit rates in 2011 and 2013. For airlines, low unit rates are factors which can be reflected to ticket prices.

It also analyses the relative opportunities as well as the costs of contract and estate farming.

A study is carried out of the features of the spatial distribution of the rates of mortality from esophageal cancer. It allows us to determine more and less epidemiologically affected regions and to carry out more detailed studies on the link between the mortality rates from esophageal cancer and various factors, such as the environmental situation, socio-demographic characteristics of the population, culture and nature of nutrition, the general health status of the population, the availability of resources and the level of healthcare in the region.

A little research work has addressed quality of schedules though a good project schedule can be considered as of the key factors of project success. The development of a reliable and easy to perform construction schedule quality assessment procedure seems to be a challenging task. Since Schedule Health Assessment of a construction project has to be strictly related to process requirements, it is used the 3 S rule as a starting point and framework for obtaining improved understanding of quality of construction schedules. The 3 S are Safety, Space and Structure, meaning that the planned process should provide a safe working environment to construction workers, sufficient space to perform construction activities and the required sequence of construction operations and project phases. The aim of the study is to implement a schedule quality assessment method that takes into account the 3S rule of construction process. The 3S requirements can be successfully integrated in a Schedule Health Assessment method, but to facilitate their implementation and control a flow-line chart is needed, thus the schedule tool becomes a new requirement for construction schedule quality control.

Crisis communication as part of crisis management or organizational ie. part of marketing communication, aims to protect the image of the company and other organizations or reputation of an individual who is in a crisis situation. Internet as a modern medium of communication with the clear trend of increasing use in business, determined by two-way communication in real time, highlights the crisis for companies, creating new challenges in the field of crisis communication. Compression of time and space in the communication, and the decentralization of market and communicationpower, increases the possibility of a crisis situation for the company, but also multiplies their effects. Therefore, many companies face daily threats of communication on the Internet, regardless of whether they actively participated in the same. Accordingly, this paper presents crisis communications with a focus on Internet communication, and researches the possibility of using the potential of the Internet by businesses, with the mission of overcoming the crisis situations.

This inevitably leads to broader social consequences that could jeopardize long-term economic prospects of a country. The lack of economic growth in a given period, in particular in undeveloped and developing countries, can undermine social values and stability of social institutions. The social consequences of the economic crisis are usually related to unemployment, poverty, inequality, political crisis, changing of cultural patterns, conflicts, wars and the rise of extremist movements.

The Central Bank of Romania regulates the preparation of individual financial statements under IFRS as of 1 January 2012 as per the agreement concluded in 2009 with the IMF-EU-IFI. this paper studies the impact of transition from RAS (Romanian Accounting Standards) to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) on the financial position and performance of credit institutions. In order to identify the differences we analyzed the financial statements as per 2011 financial year for 5 Romanian banks considering their size in terms of assets. The research involved a comparative analysis and presentation of the major components of banking assets and liabilities emphasizing key findings. One of the major aspects identified relates to determining provisions under the IFRS model. Compliance with the NBR requirements was checked and prudential aspects were outlined.

Crisis affecting our country and all other countries in the world also influences not only vacated people but also other individuals who concerns about losing their jobs. This economic uncertainty seemingly interests corporations. However environment is also one of the factors that affects crisis. If crisis isn't brought under control or managed properly, it will come about and create chain crisis. Because of the increasing chaos, change from authoritarian leadership through teamwork and participative management mentality has been observed. Commerce has been getting more and more complicated and complex. These changes have transformed traditional crisis leaders to a leader model that makes scenario analysis and work done co-ordinately with a team by gathering lots of different point of view to create optimum solution. Leadership and crisis concepts are discussed together in order that implementation of leadership in crisis can be understood. Crisis leadership is also regarded as optimally and timely assessment process of adverse condition's effects whatever its reason is.

However, once using panel data analysis as well as modeling spatial and temporal effects explicitly, the sports-sentiment effect disappeared. The same conclusions could be made by replacing win (loss) dummies with unexpected win (loss) variables, removing Monday matches, dropping sports-related firms, and sorting portfolio returns by market capitalization and past returns. Hence, there is very limited micro-evidence to support the 'overreaction' hypothesis of individual investors using Borsa Istanbul data.

The reason is a constant effort of political representation to set new rules for the exercise of competence and financial and cost management within SOU. The result of these, often unprofessional, interventions is a fundamental over-regulation of the whole segment of SOU cost management. One of the possible ways is to introduce modern management methods based on the causation of activities and costs in SOU, notably including the ABC/ABM methodology. A specific cost domain represents overhead expenditure on IT. With this respect there stands a general assumption that IT leads to boosted efficiency of activities, which fact may also mean a displacement of labour force. The performed regression analysis revealed that IT overheads are not dependent upon the number of workers. These overheads are subject primarily to technical and technological development. As a result, neither number of workers nor any indicators derived from it, such as full time equivalent, can be used for the construction of cost drivers for causal cost allocation methodology according to the ABC/ABM methodology.

Permanent glaciers could be considered a new element and they cannot be considered land, air nor water, but they can be used e. g. for building research stations. The law of the sea is particularly important among the numerous legal systems that could be in interaction with the ATS. Despite the application of provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, the freedoms of the sea are not affected, but the territorial force of the Antarctic Treaty is limited. The relation between the Antarctic Treaty and Law of the Sea is expressed in article VI of the Antarctic Treaty.

The effects of using the English language as the medium of communicating their business operations instead of other languages will also be an interesting factor to consider. As such, a selected number of SME operators (N=21) were requested to participate in a survey and interview. The results of the study indicated that there is indeed a diversity of factors that contribute to business naming and they are mostly skewed towards influence from family and background of the business owners. The mismatch of linguistic accuracy is partly due to cultural aspects and therefore it is recommended that a set of guidelines in business naming is prepared so that language distortion is not promoted and image of linguistic competency is not tarnished.

The instrumental, attitudinal and affective experience of the journey through the interchange is assessed from the user perspective. Surveys are used from three HSR stations: Beijing South, Chengdu East and Suzhou North (N = 150), representing three types of HSR stations, i.e. national capital, regional capital and sub-regional city. 'Expected' and 'realised' facilities are compared - with the difference representing the 'disgruntlement' factor (after Stradling et al., 2007). The unprecedented urbanisation process currently being witnessed in the PRC, together with the rapid development of the HSR network and associated multimodal interchanges, offers much opportunity to develop a leading-edge public transport system and urban development predicated on the use of public transport. Although the importance of intermodal interchange hubs is being increasingly recognised, the journey experience through the interchange often remains poor, with problems including Wi-Fi availability, waiting and seating, the availability of door-to-door ticketing, crowdedness, access to the hub, time of travel through and waiting in the hub. MANOVA analysis and factorial (three way) MANOVA analysis are used to explore the differences between intermodal hubs, with many instrumental and particularly attitudinal and affective factors being significantly influenced by location.

Building on the institutional theory, we examined its regulative, normative, cognitive and conducive dimensions. To obtain the contextual picture, we compared Slovakia with group of innovation-driven economies that serve as a relevant and desirable benchmark for our country. Our findings suggest that Slovakia lacks especially in conducive dimension (particularly important for innovative entrepreneurship) as well as in several regulatory aspects, while we exhibit comparatively favorable levels of certain cognitive and normative attributes (such as self-confidence, network or uncertainty avoidance).

This paper, based on the analysis of CLHLS data from Beijing University and other data sources, mainly investigated the relationship between the social insurance and the health level of the senior population through a multiple linear regression model from a Grossman health function. The preliminary conclusions can be drawn from the study as follows. Through the comparison of the regression coefficients, it is clear that the three kinds of basic medical care have different effects on the health level of senior population. The interpretation function of medical insurance on senior health level is lower than those of other social decisions and social support factors, while the influence of pension insurance is minor. Furthermore, the paper studied the coupling mechanism among pension, medical and nursing insurances, and put forward the suggestions of merging pension, medical and nursing insurances to one single plan to improve the efficiency performance of the current social security service system.","[Huang Tian; Weng Xiaodan] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Huang, T (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",huangtiankitty@126.com; wengxd2006@163.com,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,7,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,2,13,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500001,0

We argue that existence of households which have to pay an inadequately high rent makes the possibility for poverty identification, especially if we compare the actual housing costs with the costs implicit. In the results section we present information on these households and discuss whether we identified the right group. Besides the data analysis we show that the interplay of individual parts of the housing policy led to a situation when some households pay an inadequately high rent which the state considerably contributes to. Although the problem concerns about 1% of Czech households, consequences of a failure to solve the situation can be critical for both the citizens themselves and the public sector.

LIBOR, EURIBOR, JIBAR, etc., that were once deemed to be default-free, or at least close proxies thereof, are now deemed to be credit risky. In response to this, global financial markets have adopted a credit and liquidity homogenous multi-curve interest rate framework. The risk-neutral valuation of financial instruments has also been fundamentally altered, following the acceptance of a new proxy for a default-free discounting curve - this being the Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) curve. Major financial markets, like the U.S. and the Euro zone, have swiftly developed liquid OIS markets, and have therefore adopted OIS discounting. The lack of consensus on, and the inaccessibility of, a tradable overnight rate in South Africa has hindered the development of an OIS market. Nonetheless, there is still a need for a South African default-free discounting curve, as the prevalent South African defined inter-bank JIBAR rates also carry an element of credit risk. In this paper we provide a potential solution, using cointegration to estimate an OIS curve for the South African market from a JIBAR-linked swap curve. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We test for market efficiency using a battery of variance ratio tests with superior size and power properties. We find that the Ugandan foreign exchange market is characterised by pricing inefficiency, except for a few brief episodes of efficiency. We also find that the Buy signals outperform the Sell signals in correctly predicting exchange rate movements, and yield higher returns. Investors can earn excess returns over a buy-and-hold strategy using trading rules but these returns diminish substantially after accounting for transaction costs. We conclude that the Ugandan foreign exchange market is generally characterised by weak-form inefficiency. However, market participants are unable to consistently exploit pricing inefficiencies due to transaction costs and time variation in the inefficiencies under changing market conditions. Our finding of time variation in market efficiency is consistent with the adaptive market hypothesis of Lo (2004). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These payments depend, among others, on whether farmers fulfill their obligations in managing their production in a sustainable manner, protecting the environment, ensuring public health, plant health, animal health and welfare. Thus, farmers have to accept this role; to protect the environment in order to acquire subsidies. Even more, European Unions' surveys reveal that Europeans generally believe that it is a main responsibility of farmers to protect the environment. On the other hand there is a decline in farmers, forcing European Union to establish different policy measures and motives for new entrants in agriculture. Such measures support new farmers' initial establishment and the structural adjustment of their holding afterwards. This paper attempts to identify Greek new (young) farmers' perceptions about their role as environmental protectors. For this reason a questionnaire was developed and distributed among young farmers participating in the measure 112 'Setting up of young farmers' (Common Agricultural Policy, Pillar II). The survey took place in Central Macedonia in Greece during an educational course series designed for new farmers.

We find that credit spreads of China's corporate bonds mainly reflect the corporate-level default factors; once those factors are controlled for, systematic factors have very limited explanatory power. As for the effect of the firm-level factors on yield spreads, bond ratings, coupon rates, debt-to-asset ratios and bond ages are relatively important, while durations and bond sizes play a much less important role.","[Li Jie; Cai Jingwen] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,0,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-146-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,368,373,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364787100060,0

Thus, this study seeks to develop a framework for defining and clarifying various aspects of social capital and examines the effects of social capital on members' participation in collective activities and on the economic performance of farmer cooperatives. Social capital is indicated in terms of three dimensions, i.e., the external, relational, and cognitive dimensions. A statistical model is applied to a database consisting of 147 farmer cooperatives in China's Zhejiang province. The results demonstrate a positive relationship between certain dimensions of social capital and members' participation in training and general meetings. In addition, each dimension of social capital has a significant and positive impact on the economic performance of cooperatives.","[Liang, Qiao] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Haiyang] S China Univ Technol, Inst Publ Policy, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinxin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; South China University of Technology; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Liang, Q (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Sch Management, Yuhangtang Rd 866,Qizhen Bldg 1207, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",liangqiao2323@126.com; zhhuang@zju.edu.cn; charlie_lu@zju.edu.cn; xxwang1985@gmail.com,"Lu, Haiyang/AAB-1478-2019","Lu, Haiyang/0000-0001-5789-2319; Liang, Qiao/0000-0001-7473-7863","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ14G030041]; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science project [13JDQY01YB]; National Natural Science Foundation of China project [71373063, 71333011]",Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science project; National Natural Science Foundation of China project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China project (Grant No. LQ14G030041), Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science project (Grant No. 13JDQY01YB), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China project (Grant No. 71373063, Grant No. 71333011).",,87,65,69,6,67,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The excise tax influences beer consumption in every state variously, so it makes sense to keep tax policy in this area on the national level in frame of EU.","[Maier, Tomas] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Maier, T (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",maiert@pef.czu.cz,"Maier, Tomas/H-7627-2018","Maier, Tomas/0000-0003-2386-6977",,,,,12,1,1,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,264,272,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600029,0

The study includes three groups of characteristics: 1) general characteristics (gender, age, educational background, experience and tradition), 2) the motivation for setting up a business, and 3) perception of work and the problems entrepreneurs are faced with. The research has shown that the typical entrepreneur is a micro entrepreneur with secondary school qualifications and aged 41-50, suggesting that middle-aged persons with great experience in business and life, and many business contacts and acquaintances, are usually the ones to engage in entrepreneurial ventures. A small number of respondents are continuing the entrepreneurial tradition of their parents. The greatest interest of entrepreneurs is in further education concerning how to use new forms of marketing (social networks, e-marketing), draw from European and national funds, reach out to new markets, and create networks with other entrepreneurs and design joint offerings. Research conducted indicates the need to provide further education through workshops for micro and small entrepreneurs to ensure and encourage cooperation for the development of entrepreneurship, competitive ability, knowledge transfer and the sustainable development of rural areas.","[Milohnic, Ines] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Dept Management, Primorska 42,POB 97, Opatija, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Milohnic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Dept Management, Primorska 42,POB 97, Opatija, Croatia.",ines.milohnic@fthm.hr,"MILOHNIĆ, INES/T-4982-2019","MILOHNIĆ, INES/0000-0001-7487-4286",,,,,12,0,0,2,8,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,569,578,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000063,0

With recent rapid growth of IFIs, there is still inconclusive stance regarding the need for specificity accounting standards for IFIs such as the ones issued by Accounting and Auditing for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), prompting this paper to examine this issue in more detail. Drawing upon seven in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with IFIs' leading officers who are highly involved in preparing financial statements in Malaysia, the paper offers evidence on the influence of AAOIFI accounting standards in reporting IFIs. Whilst interviewees admit the feasibility of IFRSs in reporting IFIs, many interviewees placed greater emphasis on the spirit of Islam based on Islamic contract. In that case, the findings show that in order to convince the public that they offer Shariah compliance products approved by Shariah Advisory Council, there is a need for specificity guidelines or standards for IFIs within the IFRS framework. The main concern raised in the paper is that separate Islamic accounting standard is not needed, instead the option need to be within the IFRS framework with the collaboration work of Accounting and Auditing for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). Without such collaboration, the intended specific guidelines for IFIs will be unlikely to be accepted globally.

We can observe that only small group of students voted for participatory budget of Wroclaw. Main reason of non-voting was a lack of information about participatory budget and possibility of voting. Some of respondents were also misinformed about possibility of voting. It seems also that that main reason of non-voting is really lack of interest. In introducing participatory budget one of main players is local community. Applicants, non-governmental organizations, district councils, schools or other institutions are able to motivate citizens for voting. In our survey we discovered that these actors didn't play a single minute. Surveyed voting-students had heard about participatory budget from friends, family members, or they had found information from social media, town internet page and posters. The main factors influencing the choice of the projects by surveyed students were in general: descriptions of tasks in the electronic voting system, tasks descriptions available on the town website, information spread by the applicants (online, by leaflets, posters, banners and other ones) and opinions of family members.

Financial statement fraud can surface in many different forms such as overstating assets, sales and profit, understating liabilities and expenses. Although once deceptive accounting practices are initiated, various systems of manipulation will be utilized to maintain the appearance of sustainability. Financial statements are used by shareholders to measure the performance of the firm versus expectations. However, it is sometimes manipulated to meet own greed. Lots of studies have been done in detecting and predicting the occurrence of financial statement fraud. This study explores the significant impact of corporate culture in the occurrence of financial statement fraud. Culture has been widely accepted as a pattern of behavior which influences the character of society. In studying the occurrence of financial statement fraud, an element of corporate culture needs to be considered together with other factors. This paper provides a holistic view of the concept of culture and its effect on organization and behavior. The second purpose is to discuss the effect of the corporate culture within the perspective of financial statement fraud. The findings of the study provide the suggestion for improvement in corporate culture. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This research proposes a state-space market model with conditional heteroscedastic errors, thus addressing the leptokurtosis of the unconditional distribution of the disturbances and reducing the influence of outliers in the estimation process. This approach outperforms the conventional models, providing better levels of in-sample goodness of fit and more accurate point- and interval-dynamic assets returns forecasts. The proposed model provides better levels of empirical, conditional, and unconditional coverage and independence of its interval returns forecasts and reaches lower loss-function scores. Therefore, our model allows improving financial strategies, such as stock pricing, determining the companies' cost-of-equity, evaluating the performance of managed-investment and pension funds, making portfolio-rebalancing processes and computing the value at risk (VAR) of investment portfolios.

Gilpin's theory about how states use their economic diplomacy in order to provide their national security. According to Gilpin, Realists are right when they consider security as a main objective in order to achieve others, but state, in order to achieve prosperity, is willing to sacrifice financial resources. The main argument here is that states in conflict, invest in their armed forces but, although, they use their financial resources through economic diplomacy, in order to raise their security levels, they remain insecure. To examine that, we focus on case-study between states in conflict, at this paper, U.K. and Spain, by using determinants, such as trade, relative gains and alliance. The conclusion is that although economic diplomacy enhance the state's influence, cannot deter a conflict or war. (C) 2015 The Authors.

These models described the transactional price behavior in terms of market quality and market regulation. It is important that the academic community and practitioners disposes a good set of instruments that measures trading cost and noise because they reveal the market efficiency and the degree of competition. Since the models commonly used are time series models, our model is a computationally intensive measure for trading costs and trading noise including clustering noise and non-clustering noise, but is a reasonable instrument. We propose a movement model of intraday prices from Bucharest Stock Exchange based on Thomson Reuters Quotes and Volumes and apply it to analyze trade-by-trade stock price data. To model asset prices movements on a micro scale (high frequency trading) a stochastic counting process will be used. In order to use this model, we impose a difference between the price and intrinsic value of the asset. To find the value of the parameters we apply Bayesian estimation via filtering, which has the advantage that can incorporate all complete information about prices and trading time. Our study comprises stocks from Bucharest Stock Exchange over the last two years (2012-2013), and our question that we want to give an answer is if the trading costs are much bigger for equities that are less liquid comparing with the liquid one.

The types of shifts may present variety such as part time and full time shifts. The breaks also show variety like lunch breaks, short rests, and compulsory reasons based on the occupational health and safety or necessities for maintenance.

We suppose that the cost function is quadratic and the demand is a convex and log-linear function. The game is modeled with a system of two difference equations. Existence and stability of equilibria of this system are studied. We show that the model gives more complex chaotic and unpredictable trajectories as a consequence of change in the speed of adjustment of the players. If this parameter is varied, the stability of Nash equilibrium is lost through period doubling bifurcations. The chaotic features are justified numerically via computing Lyapunov numbers and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The fundamental European vision of stability, growth, prosperity and economic convergence seems to be at stake, mainly, by the citizens of the countries that suffer from the consequences of lengthy austerity measures and economic recession. The European Union itself changed since 2009. As the Franco-German axis is crumbling, Germany even reluctantly for some analysts became the essential leading force in the EU and hard fiscal policies dazzled bright characteristics of the EU. Intergovernmental controversies are coming at the front of the stage once again. We argue that is time for the European Union to seek for another approach of itself, an approach beyond the narrow intergovernmental processes, beyond even the spill-over effect model that guided the monetary unification. The aim of this paper is to draw the cloud Europe approach, show its characteristics and attributes. The cloud Europe scheme, based upon the cloud Computing characteristics from the field of ICTs, can stimulate again the European vision, and revitalize the European cooperation in terms of positive and reliable aspects and not just in terms of heavy fiscal discipline. We use a theoretical adaptation from the ICTs area to the political field of the European organization and successful cases of best practices such as the progress of Estonia towards the digital economy and the growth of digital infrastructures. The leading role of Germany in an approach like that can turn the country into a European stabilizer. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The firm takes into account only the expected behavior on the demand side (consumers), because there are no competitive firms in the industry. An impossibility of access to a particular market is associated with the so-called barriers of entry into the industry. The barriers then become a source of monopoly power. The fact that a monopoly firm has a certain monopoly power allows it to use a pricing strategy called price discrimination. The essence of price discrimination is to gain consumer surplus and convert it into additional profit for the company without having to take the costs into consideration. Second-degree price discrimination consists of setting different prices for different cumulative quantities of a commodity. By this discrimination a monopoly may obtain a part of the consumer surplus (but not all of it). The aim of this paper is to express a rate of exploitation of consumer surpluses in the second degree price discrimination in relation to selected food products of monopolistic character. This concerns the gain of consumers' buying individual food products compared with buying large (cumulative) packages of the product. The result of the paper will answer a research question: how is second degree price discrimination done in practice? The methodology of scientific research will be based on monitoring the prices of selected food products in retail chains and a comparative analysis of collected data. The survey shows that, thanks to second-degree price discrimination seller receives consumer surplus amounting to 37.41% for the sale of individual piece of the product.","[Sredl, Karel; Svoboda, Roman] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ Theories, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Srédl, K (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ Theories, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",sredl@pef.czu.cz; svobodar@pef.czu.cz,"Svoboda, Roman/G-3320-2017; Šrédl, Karel/J-2521-2017",,,,,,10,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,463,470,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600053,0

Over time, several precedents have been recorded, of which we mention the following: the financial crises prior to the collapse of the foreign currencies from the Eastern Asia from 1997; the financial crisis from Russia from 1998, when the huge competition deficit had a significant effect on the global economic market. The year 2009 made the banking system confront with a higher vulnerability, given the increase of the credit risk, and the Romanian business environment was negatively affected by: the contraction of the external retail market; difficulties in the external financing; the worsening of the risk perception, including by association with the regional evolutions; doubling the liquidity risk with the solvency risk at a micro-economic level. The year 2011 brings several changes in the economic and financial situation as follows: the balance of the non-governmental loan granted by the credit institutions increased in July 2011 with 1.1% in comparison with June 2011, up to the level of 216,010 7 million RON; the credit in RON increased with 1% while the credit in foreign currency increased with 1.1% (expressed in EUR, the credit in foreign currency increased with 1%); on 31 July 2011, the non-governmental credit recorded an increase of 4.5% compared to 31 July 2010, based on the increase with 1.8% of the RON component and with 6.2% of the foreign currency component expressed in RON (expressed in EUR, the credit in foreign currency increased with 6.3%);the governmental credit decreased in July 2011 with 4.6% up to 64,164 6 million RON. On 31 July 2011, it recorded an increase of 16.7% compared to 31 July 2010; the residents' deposits, non-governmental clients increased in July 2011 with 1.7% in comparison with June 2011, up to the level of 177,219 0 million RON. One of the main negative consequences of the financial crisis affected the cost and the external financial liquidity. Thus, the risk premiums for the CEE countries increased significantly, while the banks counted on the external resources. The financial crisis is causing suffering and shivers across the globe, forcing Governments to nationalize key parts of the banking sector, and the central banks to inject immense quantities of liquidity in the financial markets [\, not Marx, Keynes is back ', European Voice, 21 oct 2008].

This paper develops a Bayesian Markov framework for short-term prediction of farm numbers that allows combining two asynchronous data sources in a single estimation. Specifically, the approach allows combining aggregated Farm Structure Survey (FSS) macro data, available every two to three years, with individual farm level Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) micro data, available on a yearly basis. A Bayesian predictive distribution is derived from which point predictions such as mean and other moments are obtained. The proposed approach is evaluated in an out-of-sample prediction exercise of farm numbers in German regions and compared to linear and geometric prediction as well as a no-change prediction of farm numbers. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms the geometric prediction but does not significantly improve upon the linear prediction and a prediction of no change in this context.","[Storm, Hugo; Heckelei, Thomas] Univ Bonn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Espinosa, Maria; Gomez y Paloma, Sergio] European Commiss, Agr & Life Sci Econ, Seville, Spain",University of Bonn,"Storm, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",hugo.storm@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"ESPINOSA, MARIA/Z-3794-2019; Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011; Storm, Hugo/GVU-3032-2022; Storm, Hugo/AAT-9629-2021","ESPINOSA, MARIA/0000-0002-0766-2539; Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480; Storm, Hugo/0000-0003-3791-3615; Storm, Hugo/0000-0003-3791-3615",German Research Foundation (DFG) [HE 2854/4-1]; European Commission Joint Research Centre - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) [151949-2010-A08-DE],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Commission Joint Research Centre - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"The work conducted in this paper is in parts funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), grant No. HE 2854/4-1 as well as the research project Modelling the effects of the CAP on farm structural change (Contract 151949-2010-A08-DE) from the European Commission Joint Research Centre - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS).

Based on the experience of the countries which had already joined Euro zone, we identified that, beyond the standard fluctuation band of +/- 15% officially required by ERMII, there is a strong preference for maintaining the exchange rate within a narrow band, with an upper margin of maximum +10 percent over the central rate. On this background, a hypothetical participation of Romanian leu in ERM-II over two-year period is assessed using the framework developed by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Simulations performed on daily data series for the last 24 months indicate that the nominal exchange rate of RON was relatively stable within the standard fluctuation hand.

Five years ago, the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic concluded that the (social) pension insurance should basically be a Bismarckian scheme and cancelled the bend points. The government of that time did not agree, however, instead of a radical reform (for which there was not enough time) it (re)introduced a simplified version of bend points, decreasing the index of pension progressivity only by less than 10 percentage points, and parametrized the basic amount of the pensions to 9% of the average national wage. Czech state pensions are financed from taxes, including the premiums for pension insurance. State pensions are thus a public expenditure program and our analysis indicates that basic and percentage amounts of the pension should firmly merge after the calculation of a new pension. An alternative is a systemic reform dividing the state pensions into two pillars: a Beveridgean flat-rate pillar and a Bismarckian earnings-related pillar. We explain that the indexation of pensions in payment shall follow the logic of the pension scheme(s). If a part (basic amount) of the pension is independently defined by law, it is to be indexed separately, not jointly with the other part of the pension.","[Vostatek, Jaroslav] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Vostatek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.vostatek@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

In recent years, its regulated price of electricity has deviated substantially from marginal cost. This has led to economic inefficiency, causing significant welfare costs, higher electricity consumption, and excess reliance on thermal generation. In the next few years, substantial but costly hydroelectric capacity will be constructed, largely displacing reliance on thermal generation. In tandem with that new generation, subsea transmission facilities ending Newfoundland's isolation from the North American grid will be put in place. However, without a change in the governing legislation and the regulatory framework, economic efficiency will remain unattainable. Policy reforms that support efficient pricing and adapt the regulatory regime to the new circumstances are called for.","[Feehan, James P.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, St John, NF, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Feehan, JP (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Econ, St John, NF, Canada.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,4,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

It is shown that the pricing kernel function required for socially valuing marginal units of exhaustible resource, hereafter called the Exhaustion-Stochastic Discount Factor, combines a factor that discounts for risk and another factor that discounts for resource exhaustion over time. The social rate of return on the marginal unit of resource stock adds to the risk-premium an exhaustion premium that accounts for the resource depletion over time. In this setting, the principle of no-arbitrage holds by extending asset-class dimensions to include not only a risk dimension but also an exhaustibility dimension.","[Kakeu, Johnson] Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, 830 Westview Dr SW, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA",Morehouse College,"Kakeu, J (通讯作者)，Morehouse Coll, Dept Econ, 830 Westview Dr SW, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA.",kakeu_johnson@yahoo.fr,,"KAKEU KENGNE, JUSTIN JOHNSON/0000-0003-3354-1762",Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1043330] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),,,47,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Previous studies using data from European countries have presented a number of common findings, including that banks with a high proportion of relationship lending tend to set lower pass through. In this respect, we have obtained similar results using a dataset for Japan going back to the early 2000s. We further examine the influence of borrowing firms' balance sheet characteristics on loan interest rate pass-through, and find that these additional factors are also important determinants for pass through dispersion. However, after the recent global financial. crisis, even banks with a high proportion of relationship lending have largely lowered loan interest rates by raising pass-through, and pass-through has not necessarily been determined in accordance with borrowing firms' balance sheet characteristics. These results differ from those of recent studies on European countries. Possible background factors explaining this change are that (i) pressure to lower loan interest rates has risen due to extensive monetary easing and greater lending competition among banks, while Japan's banking system as a whole has maintained its resilience in the post-crisis period; (ii) demand for bank loans has increased substantially due to disruptions in the market for alternative funding sources, such as commercial paper and corporate bonds; and (iii) public measures to increase bank loans have been broadly introduced in Japan.

Using unique hand-collected data for 378 large global banks, we find that CEO power has a significant positive relation to bank profitability and asset quality, but also to insolvency risk, during the sovereign debt crisis.

To avoid potential model error, this approach represents the operations of these assets as portfolios of traded financial instruments on energy commodities. Optimization of the portfolio composition subject to the asset operational constraints yields a market-value, an operating policy, and a financial hedge for the asset.

We hypothesize that investment banking networks allow lead IPO underwriters to induce institutions to pay attention to the firms they take public and to perform two information-related roles during the IPO process: an information dissemination role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to disseminate noisy information about various aspects of the IPO firm to institutional investors; and an information extraction role, in which the lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to extract information useful in pricing the IPO firm equity from institutional investors. Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take public. We find that more central lead IPO underwriters are associated with larger absolute values of offer price revisions, greater IPO and after-market valuations, larger IPO initial returns, greater institutional investor equity holdings and analyst coverage immediately post-IPO, greater stock liquidity post-IPO, and better long-run stock returns. Using a hand-collected data set of pre-IPO media coverage as a proxy for investor attention, we show that an important channel through which more central lead IPO underwriters achieve favorable IPO characteristics is by attracting greater investor attention to the IPOs underwritten by them.

There is also evidence for anticipation effects a few years before placement of a turbine. The effect is larger for taller turbines and in urban areas.

We use a dynamic optimization model to determine the likelihood of an orchard farmer in northern California converting to forest under 90 plausible future scenarios. We find reforestation to be a highly unlikely outcome, occurring only 4.0% of the time under current economic, biophysical, and policy conditions, and only 18.5% of the time under a set of assumptions that make carbon offset production more economically viable. Conversion to carbon farming was more sensitive to changes in orchard production costs and yields than to carbon offset policy changes. In the absence of other changes, the price of a carbon offset would have to increase nearly a hundredfold to make reforestation compete economically with orchard agriculture. Our results partly explain low participation in the reforestation sector of US carbon markets. We conclude that farmers will not be interested in forest conversion unless their land has limited agricultural potential or they are motivated by social, rather than economic, rewards.","[Nelson, Erik] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Nelson, Erik] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Matzek, Virginia] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Bowdoin College; Lund University; Santa Clara University,"Nelson, E (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.;Nelson, E (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",enelson2@bowdoin.edu,"Nelson, Erik/J-4192-2019","Nelson, Erik/0000-0002-7291-5192",,,,,46,6,7,2,18,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Relative to this known aspect of the Rueff's contribution, this paper shows that the author considered also a temporary unemployment due to an insufficient level of the economic activity, and a minimum frictional unemployment prevailing in the normal functioning of any economy. Using empirical data in England during the 1920's, Rueff suggested that the permanent component was the main explanation of the unemployment (this is the so-called law of Rueff). We conduct simple econometric tests using Rueff's data that confirm this conclusion, and we show that releasing the assumption of a constant labor productivity (that was supposed by Rueff) improves the accuracy of the law of Rueff. In line with these results, we show that the theoretical approach proposed by Allais [19431 joins the three types of unemployment pointed out by Rueff, renamed as chronic, conjonctural and technological, respectively. Much later, Allais [1980] proposed an unrecognized straightforward econometrical equation comprising these three types of unemployment to represent the french unemployment over the period 1952-78. We confirm that this equation describes a large part of the evolution of unemployment in England during the 1920's and in France during the period 1970-2008, but the properties of residuals show that this equation is mis-specified. Finally, we suggest that, under some restrictive conditions, the three types of unemployment distinguished by Rueff and Allais can be seen through the equilibrium unemployment defined by the imperfect competition WS -PS model (Layard-Nickel-Jackman [1991]), hence allowing to indicate why the Allais' equation is misspecified, thus highlighting the important scientific advances that have been made since.The permanent unemployment concept of Rueff [1925, 1931] represents a. form of equilibrium unemployment dye to a downward wage rigidity leading to a persistent excess of real wage compared to its value corresponding to a competitive equilibrium.

Because religious Jews refrain from driving during the Sabbath, traffic on Israeli roads decreases sharply when the Sabbath begins each Friday, at a precisely defined time before sundown, and increases after the Sabbath ends on Saturday evening, at a precisely defined time after sunset. Using plausibly exogenous variation in traffic volume associated with the Sabbath, we estimate the effect of traffic volume on the risk of fatal or injurious accident. We find that a positive accident externality emerges only at the Sabbath exit, when traffic volumes are greater. Remarkably similar results arise when the analysis is confined to non-Jewish drivers, whose travel choices are not bound by the precise timing of the Sabbath, supporting the interpretation that our findings reflect an externality. Finally, the effect emerges mainly on a class of road sections that is considered highly perilous, suggesting that the interaction of traffic volume and road perilousness is important for understanding this issue and shaping implicated policy.

To assess the scenarios of natural gas development up to 2050, we employ a global energy-economic model - the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. The results show that a cap-and-trade policy will enable China to achieve its climate mitigation goals, but will also reduce natural gas consumption. An integrated policy that uses a part of the carbon revenue obtained from the cap-and-trade system to subsidize natural gas use promotes natural gas consumption, resulting in a further reduction in coal use relative to the cap-and-trade policy case. The integrated policy has a very moderate welfare cost; however, it reduces air pollution and allows China to achieve both the climate objective and the natural gas promotion objective.","[Zhang, Danwei; Paltsev, Sergey] MIT, MIT Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Paltsev, S (通讯作者)，MIT, MIT Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",paltsev@mit.edu,,"Paltsev, Sergey/0000-0003-3287-0732",,,,,69,2,3,3,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Social protection programs have now burgeoned in several countries as a strategy to enable the poor to overcome risks, vulnerabilities and poverty. These social protection programs have inclusion and exclusion errors, which current theorization attributes mainly to political clientalism, social vulnerability, elite capture, targeting inefficiency, leakages and corruption, lack of information transparency and improper designing of social protection programs. This paper argues that the errors are due to a more fundamental assumption made in application of social contract and entitlement based approach to social protection programing. It identifies an uncritical application of Sen's entitlement thesis to social protection programs, as leading to inclusion and exclusion errors. The main problematic, the paper shows is that the social contract-led entitlement thesis works within the domain of formal rights situated within the state-citizen relations, and as such, misses out on the non-formal entitlements and non-state influences that impact materialization of social protection programs in practice. Evidences from flood prone Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, India indicate that non-state rules linked with clientele and patronage relations, moral and local political economies trump over formal rights to mediate social protection entitlement outcomes. Rather than abstract state-citizen social contract, it is the moral contracts of reciprocal exchanges with influential patrons embedded in the moral economy of the villages that ultimately ground the social protection entitlement claims of poor villagers. Conceptualizing this process of access as cultures of entitlement, the paper builds a framework for reinterpretation of entitlements and their outcomes, suggesting a recalibration of application of Sen's entitlement thesis to social protection programs. In conclusion it argues that Sen's entitlement thesis which is pitched at transfer of economic resources through social protection from the state to the poor is inadequate. Learning from social movements currently leading the transparency and accountability struggles in India, it calls for an instituting and recognition of accountability as new cultural resource and entitlement. In conclusion it argues that information, and accountability as new cultural entitlements, when mobilized through collective agency of the poor can potentially challenge the current cultures of entitlements evidenced in this paper that presently underlie social protection outcomes.

In order to do that, we use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a housing market, banks, borrowers, and savers. Results show that monetary policy needs to be more aggressive when the capital requirement ratio (CRR) increases because it is less effective in this case. However, this policy combination brings a more stable economic and financial system. We also analyze the optimal way to implement the countercyclical capital buffer stated by Basel III. We propose that the CRR follows a rule that responds to deviations of credit from its steady state.

Using the case of Laguna Lake, the paper probes how aquaculture production and corresponding agrarian transformations are inextricably tied to dynamics in capture fisheries in multiple ways. It emphasizes the fundamentally ecological nature of the relations between aquaculture and capture fisheries through a discussion of three interrelated features of agrarian change: commodity widening through the production of a commodity frontier, aquaculture producer strategies of working with materiality of biophysical nature, and the attendant consequences of these processes for agrarian configurations. By examining the appropriation of nature in commodity frontiers and situating relations between aquaculture and capture fisheries as historical-geographical moments in commodity widening and deepening, the paper highlights the centrality of nature in agrarian change.","[Saguin, Kristian] Univ Philippines, Dept Geog, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Saguin, K (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Dept Geog, Quezon City 1101, Philippines.",kcsaguin@up.edu.ph,,,Texas AM University,Texas AM University,"I would like to thank Christian Brannstrom, Jake Soriano, Fiona Wilmot and the anonymous reviewers for providing insightful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

One interpretation of this finding is that women who perceive a high risk of their husbands' or grown-up sons' deaths are likely to want to have more children to ensure future support.","[Lindskog, Annika] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lindskog, Annika] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Ctr Globalizat & Dev, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Lindskog, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.;Lindskog, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Ctr Globalizat & Dev, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",annika.lindskog@economics.gu.se,,"Lindskog, Annika/0000-0003-1932-8674; Durevall, Dick/0000-0002-7363-3197",,,,,60,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

The pre-experimental planning phase includes a clear identification of the problem statement, selection of control factors and their respective levels and ranges. To improve production quality based on the DoE a new approach for the pre-experimental planning phase, called Non-Conformity Matrix (NCM), is presented. This article also addresses the key steps of the pre-experimental runs considering a consumer goods manufacturing process. Results of the application for an industrial case show that this methodology can support a clear definition of the problem and also a correct identification of the factor ranges in particular situations. The proposed new approach allows modeling the entire manufacturing system holistically and correctly defining the factor ranges and respective levels for a more effective application of DoE. This new approach can be a useful resource for both research and industrial practitioners who are dedicated to large DoE projects with unknown factor interactions, when the operational levels and ranges are not completely defined.

This paper investigates the significance of the mix of monetary and fiscal policies for financial stability through counterfactual simulations of three key historical episodes, using the Bank's main policy model, ToTEM (Terms-of-Trade Economic Model). The paper finds that there is an intimate relationship between the monetary/fiscal policy mix-and the dynamics of both private sector and public sector debt accumulation. No attempt is made to develop criteria for policy mix optimization, since it is clear from the model simulations that the appropriate policy mix is highly state dependent. This finding points to the need for a coherent framework for weighing the relative financial and macroeconomic consequences of accumulating public sector versus private sector debt. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to ex ante monetary/fiscal policy coordination, and that Canada's policy framework where the monetary and fiscal authorities jointly agree on an inflation target while enshrining central bank operational independence represents an elegant coordinating mechanism.","[Poloz, Stephen S.] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Poloz, SS (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,11,5,5,3,11,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

As such, a large price and/or volatility shift experienced in one sector is now more likely to spill-over into the other. In trying to capture the interrelations present in the two markets, we take seriously the importance of properly modeling smooth structural shifts. We incorporate trigonometric functions into a multivariate GARCH model of crude and corn futures prices in order to obtain the empirical volatility response functions and the time-varying correlation coefficient. Although both short-term and long-term futures exhibit shifts in the mean and volatility, volatility shifts do not manifest themselves in the same manner for different maturities. This indicates that the term structure of futures volatility changes over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, considering that voting behavior has been empirically linked to reputational harms, these findings can be considered as a useful insight about the keys that should be taken into account in order to achieve an effective reputational risk management strategy.

Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs such as fertilizer and modern seeds has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers' adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Brown, CA; Pena, JL",,,,"Brown, Colin Andrew; Pena, Joao Luiz",,,Water Meters and Monthly Bills Meet Rural Brazilian Communities: Sociological Perspectives on Technical Objects for Water Management,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,sociotechnical innovation; water management; environmental sociology; Actor-Network Theory; Latin America; Brazil,,"Lasting solutions for communities in need of improved water and sanitation services notably rural ones depend on a balanced consideration of what some have called natural, technical, and social factors. Worldwide deficits in access to appropriate water services in rural areas highlight the need to develop sustainable management models, which are increasingly being proposed with an emphasis on local user participation. The current research analyzes a case study of two rural communities in Northeast Brazil who recently began receiving water supply services through the SISAR, a state-affiliated organization underpinned by shared management with local actors. Using sociological frameworks based conceptually in Actor-Network Theory, the study's main objectives aimed to characterize what changes if any the application of the SISAR's model would produce upon local dynamics, be them wide-scale or intra-household. Field research was carried out over three months in 2014, in which the researcher interviewed a handful of professionals and several dozens of local residents during an extended in situ research phase. Our study finds that two technical factors (the water meter and monthly bill) were at the heart of key tensions and uncertainty for users in the new water management model. Lacking appropriate guidance, users acquainted themselves with these technical objects with what personal resources, interests, and intuitions they possessed. Users were without instruction on how the meter worked, how to understand the bill, and did not know that a price table even existed. Consequently, users revealed unknown qualities of these objects that countered the service provider's intentions to rationalize water use, and adopted attitudes and behaviors marked by subjective impressions of precaution and frugality. The findings show that technical objects have no self-evident qualities to users and, thus, users must learn or be taught how to interact with them in such a way as to produce desired outcomes. Rushed attempts at establishing low-cost, so-called participative models may indeed have heavy consequences. The most significant of which is an unfavorable climate for the formation of societies where informed individuals collectively possess the tools required to grasp the situations they live within and manage sustainable water supply systems. Awareness of one's environmental impact is predicated on knowledge of one's consumption. Thus, this research contributes to development-related discussions by demonstrating that producing particular user attitudes and behaviors on a mass scale vis-a-vis resource consumption requires regular efforts to understand and mediate the encounter between users and non-human actants.

Using different measures to capture this phenomenon, the present study examines its impact on banking crisis for a dataset of 138 nations spanning the period 1998-2013, while controlling for other banking-industry specific, macroeconomic and external factors. Employing different econometric models and several robustness checks, I find greater banking sector globalization to reduce the occurrence of banking crisis. Moreover, greater bank asset concentration, diversification, credit flows, real interest rates, inflation rates, M2-to-foreign exchange reserves and nominal exchange rate depreciations significantly increase the likelihood of banking crisis, while higher bank profits, real GDP growth, economic development and economic freedom lower such chances. The results are further examined for nations across different levels of economic development and with different degrees of foreign bank penetration.

Next, using country-level data from 108 countries between 1971 and 2011, we provide empirical evidence for a nonconstant elasticity of substitution between capital and energy.

To do so, we use data from a survey carried out in 2010 for the specific purpose of analysing the environmental performance of 50 dairy farms in the Spanish region of Asturias. The survey contains information on nutrients balances and greenhouse gas emissions which is used to calculate environmental pressure indicators. Eco-efficiency is measured using data envelopment analysis. We analyse the influence of farmers' socio-economic characteristics and attitudes in explaining these eco-efficiency scores using truncated regression and bootstrapping procedures. On average, the dairy farms are found to be highly eco-inefficient. Among our results, farmers that are younger, that plan to continue in operation in the foreseeable future and that participate more in training schemes are found to be more eco-efficient. Self-reported positive environmental habits are also reflected in actual eco-efficient performance. We quantify these potential gains in eco-efficiency through a simulation analysis based on the estimated model's coefficients.","[Perez Urdiales, Maria; Wall, Alan] Univ Oviedo, Sch Business & Econ, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Ave Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Oviedo; Wageningen University & Research,"Urdiales, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Sch Business & Econ, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Ave Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",perezumaria@uniovi.es,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Wall, Alan/L-1921-2017; Perez-Urdiales, Maria/X-4696-2018","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Perez-Urdiales, Maria/0000-0002-9227-8020",Cajastur (Cajastur Mobility Grant); Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Competitivness [ECO2010-17240],Cajastur (Cajastur Mobility Grant); Spanish Ministry of Innovation and Competitivness,"The authors thank Samuele Centorrino, Luis Orea, Jose Antonio Perez, David Roibas and session attendees at the XIII European Workshop on Efficiency and Productivity Analysis held in Helsinki in 2013 for valuable comments.

One hundred and twenty women relocated to a resettlement site chosen by a nongovernmental organization (NGO) are the primary data source. The concept of sensemaking/sensegiving provides a framework for analyzing how these particular women reconstructed their livelihoods in new surroundings independent of directives from NGOs, government agencies, or private developers. The article identifies four strategies that the women utilized to make sense of changes in their livelihood positive reappraisal, radical change, incremental steps, and restraint depending on their age, marital status, length of time widowed, family-size, past employment experience, education, ethnicity, and/or religion. Once women had individually and retrospectively made sense of their new environment and circumstances, they attempted to influence others present to consider an alternate vision for livelihood generation. This article captures the micro-level dynamics operating in these early moments of livelihood envisioning, dynamics that might otherwise escape the attention of government, business, and civil society actors with a stake in the project's future. Such early-stage envisioning by residents could serve as a valuable guide for all concerned stakeholders and must be factored in to strengthen national and international policy for urban resettlement and rehabilitation.

In this paper, the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, gross domestic product (GDP), energy use and urban population is investigated in the Transition Economies (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). Environmental Kuznets Curve is tested by panel smooth transition regression for these economies for 1993 - 2010 periods. As a result of study, the null hypothesis of linearity was rejected and no-remaining nonlinearity test showed that there is a smooth transition exists between two regimes (below $5176 GDP per capita is first one and above $5176 GDP per capita is second one) in the related period for these economies.","[Zortuk, Mahmut; Ceken, Sinan] Dumlupinar Univ, Kutahya, Turkey",Dumlupinar University,"Zortuk, M (通讯作者)，Dumlupinar Univ, Kutahya, Turkey.",mahmut.zortuk@dpu.edu.tr,,,,,,,43,12,12,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2016,18.0,43,,,,,537,547,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU5MP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382256100004,0

Together, all existing explanations account for 29-54% of the puzzle in individual stocks and 78-84% of the puzzle in idiosyncratic volatility-sorted portfolios.

Using a principal component analysis (PCA), we compare reported results in US and European markets with our findings here for Australian markets. In this way, we seek to establish the degree to which prior findings have universality as opposed to being strictly the outcome of a particular market at a particular time. In a broad sense, we are able to reproduce prior findings. But there are differences. Prior studies find that prevailing shocks impact primarily uniformly across options independently of moneyness (a parallel shift) with a second effect (a Z-shaped twist) that impacts differentially in relation to the option's degree of moneyness. We find that the parallel shift can be interpreted as applying primarily to in-the-money (ITM) options and the Z-shaped twist to out-of-the-money (OTM) options. As a result, the overall effects are interpreted in relation to a volatility smile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We also analyze how the yields of French, Italian, German and Spanish government long-term bonds were affected by CRA announcements. Our results reveal that CRA downgrades, watchlist and outlook announcements had no impact on the value of the Euro currency but increased exchange rate volatility. At the same time, downgrades as well as negative outlook announcements increased the yields of French, Italian, and Spanish bonds and even affected the German bond's yields. This shows that the monetary union has led to a breakdown of the consequences of the rating shocks between currency value and sovereign bond yields. The reason is that part of the rating shock is absorbed by an internal repricing of sovereign bonds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, the question of how social identity affects negative reciprocity in identity-homogeneous and-heterogeneous groups has only received little attention. Consequently, we seek to fill this gap by examining whether social identity affects individuals' willingness to sanction deviating group members in a public good context. Moreover, we devote particular attention to the role of anger-like emotions in negative reciprocity. To test our hypotheses, we employ one-shot public good games in a strategy method with punishment opportunity and induced social identity. Our results indicate that members of identity-homogeneous groups are prone to reveal less negative reciprocity than identity-heterogeneous groups when they face contributions smaller than their own. We also find that anger-like emotions much more strongly influence punishment behavior when individuals are matched with members of different identities than in identity homogenous groups. These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the nature of social identity and its impact on reciprocity, improving economists' ability to predict behavior while taking emotions into consideration.

Multiple regression models are developed to analyze these relationships at individual level. First K-means cluster analysis is conducted to create seven neighborhood types based on five built environment variables. These new neighborhood types are used as discrete explanatory variables to explain average activity spaces, while controlling for travel time, individual and household features, access to transit facilities and the job-population balance. The modeling results indicate that residential location characteristics have significant influences on activity spaces. People living in places away from suburban and rural areas and with a high mix of population and employment tend to have smaller activity spaces. Moreover, this study finds out that while the effects of some explanatory variables (such as age and gender) vary for all activities and non-work activities, socially disadvantaged people (such as the elderly and low income households) generally experience smaller activity spaces.

As a basis for this, we clustered the EU population into eight mobility styles based on Eurobarometer data. The mobility styles - including, for example, green cyclists and convenience drivers - differed not only in their travel-related variables but also in their socio-economic background, IT affinity, and life satisfaction, with green cyclist showing the highest life satisfaction and two car-oriented styles having the highest socio-economic resources. In a second step, the 28 EU member countries were clustered into six country clusters based on their representation of mobility styles. The country clusters indicate the existence of considerably different mobility cultures across the EU. Sub-regions can be identified that have highly different positions on the path towards sustainable mobility and therefore different requirements towards European platforms and support measures, e.g. for 'Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans'. The country clusters can provide a starting point for future communication and targeting of European efforts in sustainable mobility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Faced with a sudden stop of international market funding, the Irish government had recourse to an EU-IMF financial support programme at the end of 2010. Reviewing the broad parameters of the programme this paper argues that, while a sharp fiscal adjustment was necessary, adverse distributional consequences were partly mitigated by government. But the programme should have embodied better international risk-sharing through financial engineering. Ireland's experience in financial crisis management and crisis resolution points to the importance of building and maintaining trust. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We utilize a panel of 227 manufacturing industries between 1960 and 1969. We find that on the one hand, the removal of de facto import quotas had significantly negative effects on real output, real output per establishment, and employment. On the other hand, for those industries where import quotas were removed, tariff protection was effective in maintaining real output and employment. However, this does not necessarily mean the success of industrial policy change because neither tariff protection nor the removal of quotas contributed to productivity growth. In that sense, the industrial policy change had limited effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

By explicitly accounting for the structural break during the early 90s at the time the UK exited the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, we document a number of interesting findings. Specifically, there is evidence of a great moderation in the volatility of the term structure post-1992. At the same time, there is a significant reduction of the loading parameter in the DNS model, which suggests a greater influence of monetary policy and economic activity on the UK bond market. We find that the level and slope yield curve factors are related to inflation expectations and monetary policy, respectively, as has been found in related literature. Interestingly, the curvature factor which has been elusive in its relationship to macroeconomic fundamentals is found to be more strongly related to economic activity post-1992.

Non-African-owned banks are found to exploit non-traditional banking and earn higher non-interest income. In contrast, African banks in other African countries focus more on traditional financial intermediation. Our findings are important to other emerging, markets because their banks are traditionally focused on financial intermediation and regulations and supervision in relation to non-traditional activities are relatively less developed.

Cities are increasingly concerned with managing traffic congestion and reducing pollution and most of the focus of this research has been on cars, public transport, walking and cycling. In contrast, the role of powered two wheelers (PTWs), including motorcycles and scooters, in commuting has received little attention, particularly in the context of cities in the developed world. This paper provides new insight into commuting by PTW by drawing on census journey to work data from Australia's three largest cities (Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane) combined with an intercept survey of PTW commuters in Melbourne. It explores the extent of, and changes in, PTW commuting as well as the demographics of PTW commuters. While PTWs account for only a small percentage of urban commuting in Australian cities, their use is growing rapidly and there is a concentration of commuting by PTW into city centres. PTW commuters tend to be high-incomemales in skilled professional and technical professions. The implication of these findings for transport policy are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The key idea is that when there is a strong home bias in the asset portfolio of domestic bondholders, these investors turn out to have no access to any assets that hedge fiscal risk. This explains why domestic investors do not request a risk premium on government bonds. In this environment, the interest rate and the default probability are low, and the government can sustain its large debt even under adverse fiscal conditions. As the interest rate does not rise fully to reflect the risk premium, the low interest rate is not always a signal of sound fiscal conditions. The welfare implications of financial market reform are mixed. This reform can improve welfare so long as the government can sustain the debt, but at the same time, it makes it difficult to sustain the debt because the interest rate rises. Quantitative easing is effective in lowering the risk premium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies offer cross-country evidence on how IPRs affect yield growth by incentivising private sector investment in cultivar improvement. We address this knowledge gap by testing technology diffusion patterns for six major crops using a unique dataset for the period 1961-2010 and an Arellano-Bond linear dynamic panel-data estimation approach. Findings indicate that biological and legal forms of IPRs promote yield gap convergence between developed and developing countries, although effects vary by crop.","[Spielman, David J.; Ma, Xingliang] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Spielman, DJ (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",d.spielman@cgiar.org,,"Spielman, David/0000-0002-6889-7358","Department of Economics, American University, Washington, DC; CGIAR Research Program on Markets, Institutions, and Polices to Strengthen Food Security and Incomes for the Rural Poor","Department of Economics, American University, Washington, DC; CGIAR Research Program on Markets, Institutions, and Polices to Strengthen Food Security and Incomes for the Rural Poor(CGIAR)","This study was undertaken with support from the Department of Economics, American University, Washington, DC, and the CGIAR Research Program on Markets, Institutions, and Polices to Strengthen Food Security and Incomes for the Rural Poor.

Time to -build captures the delay in transforming new investments into productive capital, and time-to-produce captures the delay in transforming productive capital into output. Both delays increase risks in that time-to-build generates procyclical payouts, whereas the time to -produce amplifies this procyclicality. Inventory smooths consumption and helps capture interest rate volatility even when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is small. The model is consistent with a high equity premium, a high stock return volatility, and lead-lag relations between asset prices and macroeconomic quantities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, this is the case in the service sector. We divide the service sector into a tradable and a non-tradable part using an approach to identify tradable industries utilizing a measure of regional concentration of production. We examine whether the probability of displacement is higher and income losses after displacement greater for workers in tradable services and manufacturing (tradable) than in non-tradable services. We also analyze whether the probability of re-employment is higher for workers displaced from tradable services and manufacturing than from non-tradable services. We find that in the 2000s the probability of displacement is relatively high in tradable services in comparison to non-tradable services and manufacturing. On the other hand, the probability of re-employment is higher for those displaced from tradable services. The largest income losses are found for those who had been displaced from manufacturing. Interestingly, the income losses of those displaced from manufacturing seems mainly to be due to longer spells of non-employment, whereas for those displaced in tradable services lower wages in their new jobs compared to their pre-displacement jobs appears to play a larger role.","[Eliasson, Kent] Growth Anal, Studentplan 3, S-83140 Ostersund, Sweden; [Eliasson, Kent] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hansson, Par] Growth Anal, Box 574, S-10131 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hansson, Par] Univ Orebro, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Umea University; Orebro University,"Hansson, P (通讯作者)，Growth Anal, Box 574, S-10131 Stockholm, Sweden.;Hansson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Orebro, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",kent.eliasson@tillvaxtanalys.se; par.hansson@oru.se,,,"Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte))","Financial support from Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare is gratefully acknowledged.",,35,2,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Moreover, capturing the interplay between structure and agency that unfolds within these mobility biographies can shed light on both opportunities and drawbacks for sustainability transitions in the transport sector. Mobility biographies research has thus gained considerable momentum internationally. To date, much of this work has deployed quantitative approaches to record and analyse broader life-course related trends. Moreover, there has been a strong focus on the impact of specific life events such as childbirth or residential relocation on mobility practices of individuals and households. Examples of qualitative investigations of individuals' mobility biographies have frequently deployed cross-case comparisons that rest upon linear and realist conceptualisations of the life course. In contrast, narrative-interpretative inquiries into the meaning and complexity of mobility biographies remain scarce. This paper examines key conceptual and methodological aspects of a qualitative inquiry into voluntary carlessness across the life course. This is supplemented with an analysis of biographical interviews from the Vienna region in Austria that shows how individuals attach meaning to their deliberate departure from the dominant car culture. Building on these research experiences, the paper argues for a novel reconstructive approach to qualitative mobility biographies research that allows a deeper understanding of the biographical embeddedness of mobility practices.

Specifically, those assets which remain hidden in the accounting statement due to the difficulties in identification and measuring (ie what is called intellectual capital).

In this sense, annual reports are the primary tool of information disclosure that companies have for provide voluntary information. In recent years, sustainability reports have become in the main means of communication as a way to legitimize the actions of companies to their stakeholders. Thus, our aim is to explore and analyze the means of communication used by companies to provide voluntary information about their hidden intangible assets. Results obtained indicate that there has been a change in corporate information policy and sustainability reports have become the mainstay to provide information voluntarily to stakeholders as well as being a good way to provide information of intangible resources.

This paper examines how these dynamics result in a misalignment of the US monetary policy with the business cycles of the GCC economies. The study shows how the staggering amount of remittances outflow of the GCC economies plays a stabilizing role as a tacit monetary policy tool. Incorporating remittances in the money-demand equationresults in a more robust model than otherwise. We further find that the effect of the Federal Funds rate on money demand in these countries diminishes in significance during the period of oil boom between 2002 and 2009. However, the transmission effect of the recession periods in the USA into the demand for money in the GCC countries is not statistically significant.","[Termos, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Olayan Sch Business Finance & Managerial Econ, POB 11 0236 Riad El Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Genc, Ismail] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business & Management, Dept Econ, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Naufal, George] Texas A&M Univ, Publ Policy Res Inst, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Naufal, George] IZA, Prague, Czech Republic",American University of Beirut; American University of Sharjah; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Termos, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Beirut, Olayan Sch Business Finance & Managerial Econ, POB 11 0236 Riad El Solh, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",at36@aub.edu.lb,,"Genc, Ismail/0000-0001-5059-5821",,,,,35,2,2,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We find that dividend relative to capital gains tax penalty is cointegrated with corporate payouts (dividends and share repurchases) i.e. corporate payout taxation may be a long run phenomenon. Further, the cointegrating vector estimates are largely consistent with the traditional view of dividend taxation whereby the tax penalty discourages dividends, while the estimates give limited support to the premise that firms substitute dividends for share repurchases in response to an increase in dividend tax penalty. Long run causality also operates between the tax penalty and payouts in the error correction models. Additionally, dividend tax appears to be more influential than capital gains tax on dividend payout decisions. Lastly, taxation affects dividends more significantly in countries with high investor protection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Sample estimates indicate that reservation wages are modestly higher for women than for men, and that residents have higher reservation wages for jobs requiring more exertion or involving more danger.","[Larson, Douglas M.; Jarvis, Lovell S.] Univ Calif Davis, Fdn Agr Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ & Giannini, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Larson, DM; Jarvis, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Fdn Agr Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ & Giannini, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Pienaar, EF (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL USA.",dmlarson@ucdavis.edu; efpienaar@ufl.edu; lsjarvis@ucdavis.edu,,"Pienaar, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0343-080X",,,,,32,2,2,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

In this study, we use a recently developed generalized metafrontier Malmquist productivity index (gMMPI) to provide insights on productivity growth. We extend the gMMPI to broaden the index's capacity by decomposing various sources of productivity change in the metafrontier context. The sample contains commercial banks from 12 Western European countries prior to the recent financial crisis. A key advantage of our extension is that it introduces the role of scale effects. The empirical results show that an average bank's productivity growth arises mainly from technical changes and scale effects. Moreover, smaller and larger banks grow faster than medium ones. In addition, conservative banks tend to grow faster. These findings suggest that a more competitive and integrated financial market induced by financial deregulation is indeed able to improve banks' productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Sample period spans from 2003: 1Q to 2013: 4Q. Sample objects are 58 semiconductor companies listed on Taiwan Security Exchange Corporation. The empirical results report that stock returns display a nonlinear path, and the three risk premiums are time-varying, depending on different proxies of investor sentiment in different regimes. Market premiums fall as investors in stock markets show extreme optimism or extreme pessimism. Except in rare situations, the size premium is significant and decreases with the increase in the VIX. Returns in holding growth stocks dominate holding value stocks when the investors show extreme pessimism or optimism. However, in normal sentiment of investment, value stocks earn more returns than growth stocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The two accessibilities are combined to form a regional air transportation accessibility profile, which can be used as a criterion to evaluate airport locations at a macro-planning level.

We find that in the US assets on average decline gradually with age, while in England older households actually accumulate wealth. These differences appear to be driven largely, though not entirely, by housing wealth: over the period we consider, house price growth drove increases in housing wealth in England that more than offset the slow drawdown of non-housing wealth. This suggests the illiquid nature of housing is likely to be an important factor in explaining wealth drawdown at older ages. We also consider the potential importance of bequest motives and savings to insure against the risk of medical and long-term care expenses.","[Blundell, Richard; French, Eric; Tetlow, Gemma] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Blundell, Richard; Crawford, Rowena; French, Eric; Tetlow, Gemma] Inst Fiscal Studies, Paris, France",University of London; University College London,"Blundell, R; French, E; Tetlow, G (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.;Blundell, R; Crawford, R; French, E; Tetlow, G (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, Paris, France.",r.blundell@ucl.ac.uk; rowena_c@ifs.org.uk; eric.french.econ@gmail.com; g.tetlow@ifs.org.uk,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299; French, Eric/0000-0002-1029-3738",Social Security Administration through the Michigan Retirement Research Center (MRRC); Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [RES-544-28-5001]; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Social Security Administration through the Michigan Retirement Research Center (MRRC); Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank Thomas Crossley, Mariacristina De Nardi, John Jones and an anonymous referee for comments.

These normalizations are often treated as equivalent, but they are subtly different both in population, and in finite samples. Standard asymptotic inference relies on rank conditions that differ across the two normalizations, and which can fail to differing degrees. I first establish that failure of the rank conditions is a genuine concern for many well-known SDF models in the literature. I also describe how failure of the rank conditions can affect inference, both in population and in finite samples. I propose using tests of the rank conditions not only as a diagnostic device, but also for model reduction. I show that this model reduction procedure has desirable properties in a Monte-Carlo experiment with a calibrated model.","[Burnside, Craig] Univ Glasgow, Duke Univ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Burnside, Craig] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Glasgow; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Burnside, C (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",craig.burnside@duke.edu,,"Burnside, Craig/0000-0001-9843-6053",,,,,34,31,32,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The resulting model is then used out-of-sample to examine the failure of 191 banks during 2010-11, with predictive accuracy in the 90-95% range. Our results demonstrate that our model can also easily be applied to a large number of firms (even those that don't fail) and does an excellent job of distinguishing healthy from distressed banks.

This provides a unique opportunity to study the nature and source of information embedded in each metric. Our empirical findings are consistent with short sellers being heterogeneous with respect to their information. Short flow is strongly related to recent returns and buy-order imbalance, and both anticipates and reacts to price relevant announcements. In contrast, short interest is related to the mispricing of firm fundamentals. The distinct differences in the nature of information embedded in the two metrics provide an economic rationale for both the unique ability of each metric to predict returns and the future horizons over which the information is relevant.

The main contribution of our method comes from accounting for the effect of information provided during a survey on the mean and the variance of individual-specific scale parameters. In this way we incorporate both scale heterogeneity as well as observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity to investigate differences across and within information treatments. Our approach will also be useful to researchers who want to combine stated preference data sets while controlling for scale differences.

By contrast, legal damages under the environmental liability system prescribed by the European Commission Directive 2004/35/CE are computed on the basis of the cost of restoring the environment. When full restoration is not economically reasonable, damages include an imputation for the value of the residual environmental loss which is not paid as financial compensation to the populations directly harmed but should be allocated to environmental measures of a general nature. I argue that the environmental liability system is on the whole consistent with the prescriptions of a standard law and economics analysis, except for the conservationist stance in the allocation of the imputation for the residual environmental harm which may be interpreted as a policy, of earmarked taxes.","[Fluet, Claude] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Fluet, Claude] CRED, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Fluet, C (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.;Fluet, C (通讯作者)，CRED, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",Claude.Fluet@fsa.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,17,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The (geometric) average decrease in shelter entries was about 5% when census tracts are weighted equally, and 11% when community districts (which are much larger) are weighted equally. This study also examines the effect of foreclosures. Foreclosures are associated with more shelter entries in neighborhoods that usually do not send large numbers of families to the shelter system.

The analysis accounts for whether firms need loans or have sufficient capital, and studies the use of bank loans (quantity of finance) and availability of overdraft facilities (flexibility of finance). We develop a two-stage estimation procedure that uses an equation of bank financing in the first stage and an export equation in the second. We find that export participation (extensive margin) and the share of exports in total sales (intensive margin) increase with the availability of overdraft facilities, particularly so for SMEs with loan needs. The percentage of foreign ownership, ISO certification, and operation in manufacturing sector are also significant and positively associated with a firm's export participation and firm's share of exports in total sales. The main results are robust to a battery of econometric specifications and statistical tests applied on the firm-level data from our sample countries. The finding of a large economic significance of the overdraft facility variable is consistent with a growing concern from SMEs that the regulatory response to the Global Financial Crisis has forced banks to tighten risk management, thereby raising the rejection rates of overdraft and loan applications from SMEs. For SMEs in developing countries and emerging markets, the improvement of alternative financing forms and supportive government interventions has become ever more challenging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a novel methodology to assess how compliant networks are to being perfect core-periphery structures. The approach is flexible; allowing for the identification of multiple cores in networks. We verify that the interbank network presents a high disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting preferential attachment of highly connected financial institutions to others with few connections. We use the clustering coefficient-to assess the substitutability of financial institutions. We find that large banking institutions are counterparties that are easily substitutable in normal times. We uncover that the rich-club effect is strongly present in the community comprising the large banking institutions, as they normally form near-clique structures. Since they play the role of liquidity providers in the interbank market, this interconnectedness effectively endows the network With robuStness, as participants that are with liquidity issues can easily substitute counterparties that are liquidity suppliers.

The results suggest that there is a statistically significant substitution effect between domestic and foreign sales. Furthermore, this relationship appears to be asymmetric, as the link is much stronger when domestic demand falls than when it increases. Weakness in the domestic market translates into increased efforts to serve markets abroad, but, conversely, during times of boom, exports are not negatively affected by increasing domestic sales. This reorientation towards foreign markets was particularly important during the crisis period, and thus could represent a new adjustment channel to strong negative domestic shocks. The results have important policy implications, as this substitution effect between domestic and external markets might allow the euro area countries under stress to improve their trade outcomes with a relatively small downward pressure on domestic prices.","[Bobeica, Elena] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Esteves, Paulo Soares] Banco Portugal, Off Governor, R Comercio 148, P-1100150 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rua, Antonio] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Ave Almirante Reis 71, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rua, Antonio] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Staehr, Karsten] Tallinn Univ Technol, Eesti Pank, Estonia Pst 13, EE-15095 Tallinn, Estonia",European Central Bank; Banco de Portugal; Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Tallinn University of Technology; Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Rua, A (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Ave Almirante Reis 71, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal.;Rua, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.",elena.bobeica@ecb.int; pmesteves@bportugal.pt; antonio.rua@bportugal.pt; karsten.staehr@eestipank.ee,"Staehr, Karsten/G-4707-2016","Staehr, Karsten/0000-0002-2128-6672; Rua, Antonio/0000-0003-2494-9758",,,,,32,15,16,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Our analysis shows that the inclusion of FDI does significantly affect firms' employment elasticity when facing wage, capital and output shocks. These effects vary dramatically across industries with different factor intensities and export status. Specifically, we find that non-exporters with FDI tend to increase employment elasticity more than exporters when wage, capital input or output changes. However, FDI firms that are engaging in labor-intensive production tend to have larger output and capital input elasticity of employment while smaller wage elasticity of employment. Our findings help to explain the contradicting results in existing literature and provide important references for China's policy makers to design proper industry policies towards FDI.","[Li, Yao; Yin, Yuming] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Rd, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bo] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Rd, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.",liyao@uestc.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [71103116]; China National Social Sciences Foundation [10XJL0019]; Youth Fund of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of Chinese Ministry of Education [11YJC790248],"Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China National Social Sciences Foundation; Youth Fund of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China)",Chen is grateful for financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (71103116).

This paper examines the role of domestic holidays in satisfying demand in relation to international holidays, in the context of providing a better understanding of the environmental impacts of tourism. This is achieved through analysis of a household survey and a series of interviews with family groups of holiday-makers. The data was collected in the East Midlands region of the United Kingdom. Most respondents prefer domestic holidays in attractive coastal and rural destinations; they often take place in the summer and for shorter periods than overseas trips. Yet once at the destination there is commonality between tourism practices in domestic and international destinations. Socio-cultural aspects, life stage and financial considerations prove much more influential than environmental concerns in influencing choice. In response, the main policy recommendation would be to raise the relative cost of travelling abroad. The primary research recommendation would be to deepen the understanding of how substitution between destinations can occur. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The models are calibrated using O-D matrices constructed from the three most recent Lyon household travel surveys (1985,1995 and 2006) and generalised travel time data from coded transport networks for the three dates. Calibration has been conducted for three different zoning levels which have been chosen in line with common practice. The parameters obtained from model calibration are then applied to estimate O-D matrices at a later date and the results are compared using indicators that have been established for the zoning level applied in calibration, but also using indicators that have been aggregated in two different ways: aggregation to create larger zones or distance segments. Our findings confirm our initial intuition: the choice of zoning is fundamentally important. Moreover, in the best case, the parameters of the model change, but not sufficiently for the goodness-of-fit of the predicted model to be very different from that of the matrix obtained during calibration. It is possible to use the gravity model for forecasting purposes, but on condition that the goals of the study are compatible with the level of error in the reproduction of the observed matrices. If the zoning is either too coarse or too fine grained, forecasting performance is compromised. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesize that a more concentrated customer base increases a supplier's risk, which results in a higher cost of equity. Our results show a positive association between customer concentration and a supplier's cost of equity, and this relation is more pronounced for suppliers that are more likely to lose major customers or that are more prone to larger losses if they lose such customers. Further, results from a propensity score matched sample analysis and instrumental variables regressions imply that our findings are robust to accounting for endogeneity. We also provide evidence that a supplier with a concentrated base of safer government customers has a lower cost of equity. Finally, we document a positive relation between corporate customer concentration and a supplier's cost of debt.

Indeed, with respect to public goods provision the focus of this article the conventional wisdom holds that a negative relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and public goods provision is so well-established empirically that future research should abandon examination of whether such a relationship exists and focus instead on why it exists, that is, on the mechanisms underlying a negative relationship. This article challenges the conventional wisdom on empirical grounds. It demonstrates at the sub-national level strong evidence for a diversity dividend - that is, a positive relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and some measures of public goods provision, in particular welfare outcomes related to publicly provided goods and services. Building on the literature, the article draws on new analysis at district level for Zambia, using a new dataset compiled by the authors from administrative, budget, and survey data, which cover a broader range of public goods outcomes than previous work, including information on both budgetary and welfare outcomes. The article explores why relationships may differ for sub-national budgetary and welfare outcomes, considering separate models for each. Analysis shows results to be robust across a variety of alternative specifications and models. Given the more nuanced relationship between ethnic diversity and public goods provision documented, the article argues that the key task for future work is not to address why the relationship is negative, but to study under what conditions such direction holds true, and the mechanisms that underlie a diversity dividend. It concludes by considering key explanatory hypotheses against the Zambian data to identify promising areas for such theory development. More broadly, while the diversity debit hypothesis highlights the costs of diversity and could be interpreted as providing support for polices that minimize it, the findings in this article are consistent with a view that diversity can be good for communities, not only for normative reasons, but also because, under some conditions, it can support concrete welfare gains.

Empirical Evidence from Nepal,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,gender; land ownership; empowerment; household decision making; Nepal; South Asia,RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; PROPERTY OWNERSHIP; CHILD HEALTH; EDUCATION; MARRIAGE; AUTONOMY; RIGHTS; IMPACT,"Land rights equity is seen as an important tool for increasing empowerment and economic welfare for women in developing countries. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to empirically examine the role of women's land ownership, either alone or jointly, as a means of improving their intra-household bargaining power in the areas of own healthcare, major household purchases, and visiting family or relatives. Using the 2001 and 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys and relevant econometric techniques, we find that land ownership has a positive and significant impact on women's empowerment. In particular, we find two important patterns of results. First, accounting for the endogeneity of land ownership with inverse probability weighting, coarsened exact matching and instrumental variable methods makes its impact on empowerment higher. Previous research in this area had largely ignored the potential endogeneity of land ownership. Second, the impact is generally stronger in 2011 than in 2001. As evidenced in a number of empirical studies, the increase in women's bargaining power can in turn translate into a redirection of resources toward women's preferences, including higher investment in human capital of the household such as education, health, and nutrition. Therefore, our study indicates that in places where agriculture is the main source of economy for women, policies enhancing land rights equity have the potential to increase women's empowerment and associated beneficial welfare effects.

In order to design policies that aim to change commuting practices it is, however, necessary to have acquired a good understanding of the trips in question and their determinants. However, these trips have been subjected to very little study in the cities of developing countries. This paper is concerned with the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area (RJMA), and sets out to test the influence of classical socioeconomic and spatial variables on the distance and duration of the commuting trips of the region's inhabitants, especially those with the lowest incomes. The main original feature of this research is that it includes jobs in the informal sector. The results show that, all other things being equal, commuting distances and times are shorter for the informal sector, and people walk more from their homes to their place of work because jobs in the informal sector are more dispersed than jobs in the formal sectors. The notable exception is personal and household services for which employees (who are mainly women) live a long way from the city center where wealthy families (and their jobs) are concentrated.

This paper develops a theory and empirical identification strategy for studying sales tax competition with multiple federations, as exemplified by multiple counties each containing several cities. In addition to strategic interactions with nearby cities and a city's own county, city tax rates are influenced by the tax rates of neighboring counties. Cities react heterogeneously to own-county sales tax rates depending on distance to the county border. Using data on the driving time to county borders and a comprehensive cross-section of local sales tax rates, I exploit variation in proximity to county borders to identify vertical fiscal competition. Cities located near county borders react more intensely to their county's tax rate in comparison to towns at the interior. An increase in the neighboring county tax rate raises city tax rates in nearby counties. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Long-run economic growth depends almost exclusively on increased productivity and competitiveness where human capital plays its primary role as a factor of production. Increasing volume of goods and services require sufficient and effective exploitation of human capital and other factors as well. Due to economic, technological and environmental changes, demand for skilled human resources varies in quantity over time as some industries rise and other ones fall. Accordingly, human capital is needed to migrate from one sector to another which warrants the requirements for diversified competences. Learning outcomes of different educational programs should adapt these job market needs. This can be enhanced by a system that is capable of predicating these needs continually and discovering their similarities and discrepancies with learning outcomes of relevant programs. The paper presents how Input-Output Model can estimate expected labor force with different skills by processing open data.","[Ahmed, Fizar] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Informat Syst, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Ahmed, F (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Informat Syst, Budapest, Hungary.",fizarbd@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,349,357,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300042,0

The key contribution of this paper is to evaluate the adjustment process using the New Multi Country Model (NMCM) at the country and sectoral levels. The model suggests that a recovery in wage competitiveness reduces external deficits but has only mildly expansionary effects at the cost of higher net borrowing by households. It also suggests that the impact of an aggregate demand shock in Germany is not enough to lead to a rebound in economic activity and address external imbalances in the rest of the euro area. Finally, the presence of supportive external conditions, while facilitating the implementation of vital reforms, would not necessarily unravel intra-euro-area imbalances.","[Angelini, Elena] ECB, DG Res, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ca'Zorzi, Michele] ECB, DG Int & European Relat, Frankfurt, Germany; [van Aerssen, Katrin Forster] ECB, DG Econ, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; European Central Bank; European Central Bank,"Angelini, E (通讯作者)，ECB, DG Res, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",elena.angelini@ecb.int,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Although globalization has trended positively for most of our sample, the global financial crisis and its aftermath have provided new headwinds.

The extension is proposed to overcome the commonly criticized aspect of panel regressions, the inability to obtain homogeneity in panels. The study utilizes a panel data set that consists of 46 countries covering the 1980-2009 period and models are evaluated in terms of their ability to model the interrelations between the variables analysed. According to the empirical results, the proposed Panel Neural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron and Panel Support Vector Machine models provide success with this purpose.

In effect, minimum wage was periodically modified between 2002 and 2014 to be among the highest in the Latin American region while the mentioned income transfer programme - called the Universal Child Allowance - has benefited some 40 per cent of children residing in the country since its implementation. The obtained evidence suggests that modifications to minimum wage did not produce adverse effects on employment or have a substantial impact on the probabilities of entering the informal sector. Regarding the income transfers, it was possible to confirm that it did not encourage adults in beneficiary households to become economically inactive.","[Groisman, Fernando] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Groisman, Fernando] Natl Council Sci & Tech Res, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires,"Groisman, F (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Groisman, F (通讯作者)，Natl Council Sci & Tech Res, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,,Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP); Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC),Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP); Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC),"This research work was carried out with financial and scientific support from the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP) (www.pep-net.org) with funding from the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid), and the Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC).",,50,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,155,180,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024007,0.0,,,26,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400006,0

Conclusions Increasing labour costs, tougher competition and unstable political situation are a cause for concern to family businesses when they conduct investment activities. They expect changes such as lower tax rate, simplified tax system and lower non-wage labour costs. These firms believe that due to this kind of changes they could further develop their activity.","[Kogut, Justyna; Brozek, Katarzyna] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Kogut, J (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",justynakogut5@wp.pl,"Kruk, Justyna/G-1806-2015",,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,24,31,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200002,0

Over the years, many socio-political changes have taken place leading to new structures, relations and means of communication. Even if we do not directly realize it, public entities are heavily relying upon intangible assets, and intellectual capital is gradually being revealed as a crucial element for fostering sustainability and, genuinely, for improving operations and services. Now, more than ever, explanatory mechanisms need to be developed for assessing the intellectual capital role in the Administrative Reform processes. At the same time, public entities through Good Governance principles become intellectual capital creators either within the wider public management environment or within the society and the economy as a whole. The aim of the paper is to provide an intellectual capital management perspective for Good Governance in the public sector that is undergoing an intense modernization and restructuring process. Nowadays, although intellectual capital resources are involved to a great extent in the management of public entities, they are treated as the Cinderella of resources. Usually, such resources are not properly identified and managed, as public management does not completely recognize their significance. Yet intellectual capital may enhance the overall performance, innovativeness, and the total assets held by any public organization. This work is grounded on a selected literature review in such a way that the public sector's reform process is being placed under the lens of intellectual capital. Good Governance characteristics - mostly non-tangible in nature - are presented, treated and explored as value parameters of the administrative reconstruction process. In fact, we focus on the Good Governance axiomatic criteria, and we discuss their relevance to intellectual capital management by briefly presenting some indicative cases of Greek public sector services which are based on administrative reform policy planning. The analysis suggests an Intellectual Capital metrics Balanced Scorecard as a good governance policy tool and highlights the need for further research.","[Laskari, Tatiana] Ionian Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Informat, Corfu, Greece; [Laskari, Tatiana] Greek Minist Interior & Adm Reconstruct, Unit Legislat Initiat, Athens, Greece; [Kostagiolas, Petros] Ionian Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Informat, Dept Arch Lib Sci & Museum Studies, Corfu, Greece; [Kefis, Vasileios] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Publ Adm, Athens, Greece",Ionian University; Ionian University; Panteion University,"Laskari, T (通讯作者)，Ionian Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Informat, Corfu, Greece.;Laskari, T (通讯作者)，Greek Minist Interior & Adm Reconstruct, Unit Legislat Initiat, Athens, Greece.",lasktat@yahoo.gr; pkostagiolas@ionio.gr; bkefis@panteion.gr,"Kostagiolas, Petros/U-1556-2018","Kostagiolas, Petros/0000-0001-8974-1128",,,,,55,2,2,1,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,152,158,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300019,0

The results revealed only marginal relations between tested independent variables and household income, with land ownership leading the way as the strongest predictor. The main reason behind variable disconnect lies within surveyed households under or over reporting their incomes, expenditures and savings.

Our research shows that the reforms cemented the second-class status of pobladores, as their access to land, natural resources such as firewood and governmental subsidies is now even more contested. Ejidal residents have responded to these tensions by invoking various conceptions of citizenship to press for different forms of justice. Ejidatarios seek to enforce their legal prerogatives by advocating a tiered citizenship, inflected with aspects of market citizenship', in which pobladores have less access to resources and voice.

Methodology/methods The paper considers various studies, reports, data and articles published regarding the above-described issues. When working on the paper, both, deduction and induction methods were used. The study used the methods of statistical observation, grouping and analysis. Scientific aim The scientific aim of the paper is to identify the level of awareness of the Georgian society and sometimes, improving it in connection to the questions of the organizational culture in terms of the labor diversity. Also, to study the influence of the organizational culture on individuals, teams and gross productivity of the organizations. Findings It was found that it is impossible to arrive at the desirable employee's behavior under the stressful working environment. When an employee is in a stressful environment, his/her health deteriorates, his/her emotional balance reduces and he/she experiences a chronic stress and inability what leads to the diminished labor productivity in the final run. Such losses cost a company a lot. Therefore, it is better to timely respond to the problems leading to the undesirable situations, solve the questions and manage the conflicts in order to avoid extra costs and nuisances. Conclusions To sum up, attention must be paid to the establishment of a strong organizational culture and common values to bring them down to all employees.

As it solves waste management problems and simultaneously produces biogas and digestate as a by-product. Although household biogas programs have experienced rapid development and achieved remarkable benefits, the current widespread reduction in the use of digesters may hinder further progress. Hence, it is important to comprehend the economic aspect of the technology from the view of its financing as the main beneficiaries are rather poor farmers. The survey was conducted in the province of Thua Thien Hue in central Vietnam from July to September 2012, furthermore followed by field visits in June and July 2016. The target group covered randomly selected owners of small-scale biogas plants (n=141). The collected data were categorized, coded and analyzed using MS Excel. The results revealed that only 6 % of households fully financed the construction of biogas technology with their own savings. This emphasizes the need of various methods of co-financing (mainly subsidies or loans). The subsidy from the National Biogas Program was used by 88 % of the households. Only one third of farmers would consider building biogas plant without subsidy which shows high importance of involvement of other actors. Our findings divulged a high degree of participation of family members in decision on investment in a biogas technology; however, the role of a male household head was dominant in the final decision. Vietnamese domestic biogas sector plays a vital role in farming systems and adds value to agricultural waste. It offers advantages in regard to energy, environmental and economic development. However, in terms of financing of this technology our study reveals that it is not adequately available to the poorer and poorest farmers. Further policy implications should be executed.","[Roubik, Hynek; Mazancova, Jana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Dept Sustainable Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Roubík, H (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Dept Sustainable Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",roubik@ftz.czu.cz; mazan@ftz.czu.cz,"Roubík, Hynek/N-9732-2019; Mazancová, Jana/AAK-2685-2020",,,,,,14,4,5,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,312,318,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000040,0

At the first time in the history there are four generations working together in the organizations and soon representative of new generation Z will join the labor market too. Each generation brings different values, opinions, expectations, views and behaviors to the organizations. A number of researchers investigate and distinguish features of each generation. As a consequence, combined evaluation of generational differences and similarities in the context of human resource management is needed. Without this knowledge it will be impossible for any practical solutions. The focus of the paper is to review of other authors approaches to generational diversity management. Methodology/methods In the paper was used analysis, synthesis, abstraction, induction, deduction, classification and systematization of other authors studies and researches to reveal methods of generational diversity management. It is conceptual paper. Scientific aim is how to manage diversity of the different generations' employees at the context of human resource management? Findings The results of the paper demonstrate that it is vital for organizations to actively take account to generational diversity in order to achieve competitive advantage, improve effectiveness. The findings demonstrate that workforce is changing and organizations have to adapt generational differences in their human resource strategies. Conclusions Employers have to develop effective communication tools to minimize conflict, to create progressive human resource strategies to attract and retain talents and to shape management practices to enhance productivity. Lack of attention to generational diversity can cause conflicts, reduce productivity, impair communication and teamwork. The sooner employers realize importance of generational diversity management, develop and implement efficient human resource strategies at workplaces, the easier it would be to welcome new employees of generation Z in the labor market. The paper does not empirically verify the suggested model of generational diversity management, but shortly represent methodology of future research.","[Savaneviciene, Asta; Jakimuk, Julija] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Savaneviciene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.savaneviciene@ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X",,,,,46,0,0,3,30,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,120,127,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200014,0

Traditional indicators such as Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for teachers and Grade Point Average (GPA) for students are not sufficient to create a holistic system for measuring the efficiency of the HEI. To overcome this drawback, the performance of teachers and students should be measured using new indicators such as Intellectual Capital Indicator (ICI) and Employability Readiness Indicator (ERI). This is an exploratory study aimed at developing a conceptual framework for measuring the efficiency of HEIs in knowledge transfer with the help of both traditional and new introduced indicators. While ERI measures competencies enabling future graduates to successfully compete in the labour market, ICI measures qualifications of academic staff involved in the development of these competencies. The minimum efficiency can be reached if KPI approximates ICI and both increase as well as GPA approximates ERI and both increase. The correlation between KPI and GPA has to be checked by similar relations between ICI and ERI. The more positive correlation between ICI and ERI, the more efficient is the HEI in knowledge transfer. Finding a degree of the correlation, one can judge whether an input in the form of teachers' intellectual capital brings an adequate outcome in the form of graduates' employability. It helps identify shortages in the design of the educational program and in the organisation of the education process which should be regarded as resources for the enhancement of the education quality and the HEI's efficiency in developing graduates' competencies.","[Sultanova, Gulbakhyt; Auken, Vilmur] Narxoz Univ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Narxoz University,"Sultanova, G (通讯作者)，Narxoz Univ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan.",gulbakhyt.sultanova@narxoz.kz; vilmur.auken@narxoz.kz,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,271,279,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300033,0

We attempt to clarify how CoCos impact on investment timing, capital structure and inefficiencies arising from debt overhang and asset substitution. We show that there is a conversion ratio (the fraction of equity allocated to CoCo holders upon conversion) to eliminate the inefficiencies. Our conclusions predict that debt leverage decreases with investment option payoff factor and the average appreciation rate of the cash flow. In contrast to traditional corporate finance theory saying that a firm's value decreases globally with business risk, our model indicates that it might first decrease and then increase with asset volatility.

Design/methodology/approach - The strategy tripod that results from combining the industry-, resource- and institution-based views, each of which proposes specific drivers of strategic success, was used as the framework for investigating, in a longitudinal perspective, the drivers of the strategy of a trading company and its success in emerging economies. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, document analysis and non-participant observation and analyzed using content analysis techniques. Findings - Rather than a single driver, the authors found that strategic choices were driven at times by the demands of industrial competitiveness, at times by firm resources and capabilities, and at times by institutional conditions. There was evidence neither of a linear chronological order for these drivers, nor of driver obsolescence. On the contrary, findings suggest that drivers are cumulative and interactive. Changes in organizational resources and capabilities or in competitive or institutional environments can force review and re-thinking of strategic objectives. Research limitations/implications - Generalization is affected by the fact that the study focusses on the experience of one individual trading company. Practical implications - From a pragmatic, managerially oriented perspective, the findings show the importance to be alert to all the tripod legs over time, and not belittle the institutional context. This fact is noted by the data, which not realize a timeline or order between the drivers and the strategies adopted by the firm. Originality/value - The paper is of value in showing the drivers of trading company strategy and the determinants of trading company success in emerging economies using a longitudinal perspective rather than the more usual sectional perspective. In addition, the study is original in simultaneously investigating all three legs of the strategy tripod and providing empirical evidence about how the respective drivers interact over time.","[Thome, Karim Marini; Medeiros, Janann Joslin] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Thomé, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",thome@unb.br,"Thomé, Karim Marini/AAK-6709-2021; Medeiros, Janann J/E-5105-2013","Thomé, Karim Marini/0000-0003-2701-5643;",,,,,59,11,16,2,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

EVIDENCE FROM US ELECTRIC UTILITIES,CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Using a panel dataset of U.S. electric utilities, we investigate the effect of a Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) on the rates of electric utilities affected by the mandate. Our findings are twofold. First, we find that, on average, electric utilities affected by an RPS mandate charged a higher electricity rate. This would suggest that an RPS mandate is a costly constraint on the utilities that have to comply with the requirement. The second finding of our analysis is that marginal increases in a utility's RPS requirement do not necessarily translate into higher electricity rates. This would imply that the costs imposed on utilities affected by the RPS mandate tend to be fixed costs rather than variable costs. We also find that controlling for time-varying unobserved factors at the state level is key to identifying the RPS effect on electricity retail rates.","[Tra, Constant I.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Tra, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",constant.tra@unlv.edu,,,,,,,10,13,18,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

A pre-selection model, can include different stages, such as the following: an online questionnaire concerning professional qualification (for example, we can't recruit any person on an engineering job; he/she must have a certain level of engineering education); an online test which can confirm the knowledge level of the candidate; and one or more surveys on candidate personality. After each online test/questionnaire, we have to do some evaluations. The next step is to take into consideration only the candidates, which satisfy job requirements. Valuable online questionnaires containing significant questions must be implemented using specialists (in human resource, business, psychology, etc.). Only using adequate questions can we obtain good selection results. Using the online environment and some filters, we can know the candidate's profile very well before the first interview, training, year of working, etc., where, in general, many employers come across various surprises.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the innovations in ambient advertising including flash mob dancing, use of structures, posters, props, bus tickets, supermarket floors, shopping carts, bank receipts, animals, and other strange and unusual venues in developed economies (e.g. the USA) vs emerging economies (e.g. India). Design/methodology/approach - The research proposes relationship strength (R)-inherent drama (I)-prodigious execution (P) or R-I-P conceptual framework to measure ambient advertising and delves into the R-I-P constructs of ambient advertising. Findings - The results of Study 1 demonstrate that consumers' global consumption orientation positively influences their attitudes toward ambient advertising. Results from Studies 2 and 3 exhibit interesting comparisons of innovations in ambient advertising between the USA and India; which improves understanding of globalization of ambient advertising in both developed and emerging economies. Relationship strength (R) between the product and the customer strengthens ad believability in both developed and emerging economies; while inherent dramatic surprise (I) displays contrasting results for developed and emerging economies. Prodigious execution (P) results in ad irritation for developed economies while it has no impact for emerging economies. Research limitations/implications - Overall R-I-P constructs of ambient advertising strengthen brand and ad attitudes and purchase intentions. The research has strong implications for advertising innovations in the USA vis-a-vis India, and demonstrates stronger implications of advertising internationalization across developed and emerging economies. Originality/value - The research is valuable in the context of emerging and developed economies of the world with respect to ambient advertising. The research explores the trends in ambient advertising and develops measures for testing perceptions of consumers in various world markets toward ambient advertising. The world economies exhibit varying levels of acceptance and appreciation to the global emerging advertising trends, and this presents a huge challenge to the companies worldwide.","[Wu, Jun; Arora, Anshu Saxena; Arora, Amit] Savannah State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Savannah, GA 31404 USA",University System of Georgia; Savannah State University,"Arora, AS (通讯作者)，Savannah State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Savannah, GA 31404 USA.",Aroraa@savannahstate.edu,,,,,,,90,6,6,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

A set of extended qualitative research interviews with professionals and students with experience living in both Europe and China are presented. Themes from these discussions, which highlight the features of the sharing economy in both China and Europe, are explored. The Chinese sharing economy is in general found to be more service-based and fast moving than its European equivalent, which functions in a different framework based on concepts of community and sustainability. The importance of trust and understanding of the Chinese political system in this kind of business is highlighted. Strategies for carrying out business in the Chinese sharing economy are discussed.

With the development of the economy, SMEs are facing both opportunities and fierce competition. Compared with the mature companies, SMEs have their own features, such as the weakness of the ability of resisting risk, the lacking of capital, deficiency in the ability to raise funds and etc. Therefore, in the complex environment, a more suitable financial risk early warning system is needed. In this paper, such a financial crisis early warning model of SMEs was established, focusing on the characteristics of the SMEs, selecting the data from the SMEs listed in the stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2011 to 2015 as samples, choosing 13 financial index input values, finally using the neural network tool in Matlab 2012b.

Four different characteristics are used to measure the government size. Total public expenditures, total tax revenues, final government consumption and share of compensation of public workers to overall spending. There are also added control variables and time dummy variable to prevent biased results. The analysis was performed on data from 30 OECD countries from years 1995-2014. Fixed-effects panel regression was used to determine relationship between these individual indicators of government size and the economic growth. Main findings of this paper are that change in all indicators is negatively correlated with the growth.

These measures are weakly related to one another and only half of them identify banks with the highest loan price as also being the least competitive. This is the opposite of what is expected.

However, there is no evidence on whether specific supervisory arrangements were more successful than others during the crisis. Empirical evidence on the topic is in general scarce and there are reasonable theoretical arguments for and against alternative approaches. Similarly, while the effect of central bank independence on price stability has attracted a lot of attention, our knowledge with regards to its effect on bank soundness remains limited. Using a large sample of commercial banks operating in various countries over the period 2000-2011, this paper investigates whether and how bank soundness is influenced by central bank independence, central bank involvement in prudential regulation, and supervisory unification. We find that central bank independence exercises a positive impact on bank soundness, which in the case of smaller banks is enhanced during the crisis. Supervisory unification and the central bank involvement appear to mitigate the adverse effects of the crisis. The power of the supervisory authorities and bank size also appear to be conditional factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One popular explanation for this puzzle is that incumbents deliver non-ideological benefits to the district through pork-barrel politics, i.e., the distribution of federal spending. We put this explanation to the test by measuring the causal link between senior representation and pork. In short, we find no such link (sausage or otherwise). Employing both differences-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs, we find that a senior member of Congress, on average, brings no more pork to her district than the counterfactual freshman representing the same district at the same time. As a result, voters have no pork-based incentive to reelect their experienced incumbents, and pork-barrel politics cannot explain the incumbency advantage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate whether and when the turning point in China's CO2 emissions would occur. A simple yet powerful neoclassical Green Solow model (GSM) is utilized herein as the main forecasting tool. To verify the capability of this framework to address China's economy, a key prediction of the GSM - the convergence in per capita CO2 emissions across Chinese provinces - is empirically verified. By assigning reasonable values to the GSM's key parameters, the trajectories of total CO2 emissions are projected for the three regions of China and the whole country. The forecast results show that, under the benchmark scenario, China's total CO2 emissions would peak around the year 2047. According to the sensitivity analysis, carbon efficiency is the most important determining factor for whether a turning point in total CO2 emissions may occur.","[Hao, Yu; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",haoyuking@bit.edu.cn; wei@bit.edu.cn,"Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71020107026, 71403015]; CAS Strategic Priority Research Program [XDA05150600]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Strategic Priority Research Program,"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 71020107026 and 71403015, and the CAS Strategic Priority Research Program, Grant No. XDA05150600.",,58,43,44,1,87,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Moreover, extant research suggests that high levels of stimulation induced by radical innovations even enhance negative effects of passive innovation resistance. However, empirical evidence for these propositions is still rare. Consequently, this study strives to enhance the current understanding (1) by investigating the inhibitory role of passive innovation resistance for different kinds of innovative consumer behaviors and (2) by examining the moderating role of perceived stimulation for effects of passive innovation resistance. Based on a large-scale empirical study (n = 681), we provide first empirical evidence that passive innovation resistance inhibits both consumers' tendencies to engage in innovative behavior and actual new product adoption. Furthermore, the results confirm that perceived stimulation increases the negative effects of passive innovation resistance. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on a possible pro-change bias in adoption literature and to the current understanding on how to develop and market innovations to reach market success.

We describe how transport studies and political geography offer two related, but poorly connected, theoretical approaches purporting to explain the relationship between transport and the economy. Yet in what ways does it matter that two different world views exist? We test these questions through an empirical case study of how city and regional officials use transport in attempting to realise economic objectives. Echoing theoretical approaches based in political geography, we find officials' own reasoning places emphasis on supply side improvements, especially connectivity within regions and on a high quality urban environment hoped to attract high GVA jobs. The decision-support tools are not well aligned to this reasoning, focussing on time savings and the justification of the value for money of proposed schemes relative to other investments in the region and nationally. In contrast to much theoretical work on competitiveness, employment growth is treated as exogenous with less emphasis given to which areas win and lose in the region. It is competition between weaker regional towns and cities that is prominent in officials' discourse. Such a gap between the thinking by officials, and the types of available transport investment decision-support tools, is of international significance. Given the centrality of the economy to where and what we invest in, the paper suggests a need for better knowledge about the efficacy of urban realm and other supply side improvements on job creation and on the influence of local autonomy in decision-making on investment selection and outcomes.

We analyze the in-sample and out-of-sample portfolio effects resulting from adding commodities to a stock-bond portfolio for commonly implemented asset allocation strategies such as equally- and strategically-weighted portfolios, risk-parity, minimum-variance as well as reward-to-risk timing, mean-variance and Black-Litterman. We analyze different commodity groups such as agricultural and livestock commodities that currently are critically discussed. The out-of-sample portfolio analysis indicates that the attainable benefits of commodities are much smaller than suggested by previous in-sample studies. Hence, in-sample analyses, such as spanning tests, might exaggerate the advantages of commodities. Moreover, the portfolio gains greatly vary between different types of commodities and sub-periods. While aggregate commodity indices, industrial and precious metals as well as energy improve the performance of a stock-bond portfolio for most asset allocation strategies, we hardly find positive portfolio effects for agriculture and livestock. Consequently, investments in food commodities are not essential for efficient asset allocation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, panel data is used to estimate a dynamic labor demand and a dynamic wage equation to measure direct and indirect effects of the Chinese competition over these two variables. A negative direct impact was found, due to the Chinese imports into Mexico, affecting employment, and on a smaller scale affecting wages. Evidence was not found recording an indirect impact (via the US market) neither on employment nor on wages.

In the case of El Paso, Texas, those variables would include wholesale gasoline prices, local economic conditions, weather, and, more uniquely, cross-border economic variables associated with Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, in Mexico. To analyze the contributions of these variables to monthly price movements for gasoline in El Paso, a theoretical model is specified. From the latter construct, a reduced-form equation is extracted. That specification is then expressed within an error correction framework to allow accounting for both long-run and short-run behaviors in this metropolitan economy. Results indicate that the border poses a fairly substantial barrier to normal trade and purchasing patterns for this product within this specific region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It argues that a diversification of political conditionality beyond aid is now taking place. Political conditionality reaches across different external policy fields and includes cooperative and punitive measures. It has also moved from political rights toward social and environmental rights. To capture this diversification conceptually, the article presents an ideal typical typology that is then refined based on the example of the European Union (EU).

However, energy policy typically relies on the evolution of average costs, neglecting the covariances in the costs of the different energy technologies in the mix. The Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory is implemented to evaluate jointly the average costs and the associated volatility of alternative energy combinations. In addition systematic and non-systematic risks associated to the energy technologies are computed based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model and considering time varying betas.

Social epigenetic research can be an insightful additional source of evidence in pursuing this endeavour. Social epigenetics is the study of the molecular mechanisms by which early-life experiences influence gene expression and have persistent effects on human physiology and health. Findings so far suggest that epigenetic mechanisms might be an important biological component linking various early-life experiences to later outcomes. Although there are numerous challenges in translating epigenetic knowledge to the public sphere, applying social epigenetic research to practice and policy could have important and pragmatic uses in clinical practice and in influencing public opinion toward healthy starts.","[Park, Mina] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Mol Med & Therapeut, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Child & Family Res Inst, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Park, Mina; Kobor, Michael S.] Univ British Columbia, Human Early Learning Partnership, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Kobor, Michael S.] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Mol Med & Therapeut, Dept Med Genet, Child & Family Res Inst, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Child & Family Research Institute; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; Child & Family Research Institute; University of British Columbia,"Park, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Ctr Mol Med & Therapeut, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, Child & Family Res Inst, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"The authors dedicate this article to the memory of the late Dr. Clyde Hertzman, a tireless champion for children.

In recognition of the importance of these social influences on population health and inequalities, the World Health Organization adopted, in 2012, resolution WHA62.14 endorsing the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health. With this resolution, member states recognize the existence of social determinants of health (SDH) and pledge to implement actions outlined in the Rio declaration, including to monitor progress and increase accountability to inform policies on SDH. From 7 to 9 May 2014, the Quebec Inter-University Centre for Social Statistics held an international conference in Montreal. Social Policy and Health Inequalities: An International Perspective had as its primary objective showcasing leading-edge international research on the impact of social policies and programs on health inequalities in high-income countries.

Some theories suggest that democratic regimes, owing to their greater political transparency and larger number of veto players, should have a lower risk of currency crisis than dictatorships. Alternative arguments emphasize the advantages of political insulation and rulers with long time horizons, and imply that crises should be most likely in democracies and least common in monarchic dictatorships. We evaluate these competing arguments across four types of political regimes using a time-series cross-sectional dataset that covers 178 countries between 1973 and 2009. Our findings suggest that the risk of currency crisis is substantially lower in monarchies than in democracies and other types of dictatorship. Further analyses indicate that the adoption of prudent financial policies largely account for this robust negative association between monarchies and the probability of currency crises. This suggests that political regimes strongly influence financial stability, and perverse political incentives help explain why currency crises are so common.","[Steinberg, David A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Koesel, Karrie J.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Thompson, Nicolas W.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University of Notre Dame; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Steinberg, DA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, 1740 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",dsteinberg@jhu.edu,,,,,,,95,18,21,1,40,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

An extensive empirical search suggests that the GATT/WTO accession duration is likely to be shorter for an applicant whose political regime is more democratic. Meanwhile, countries that initiated applications before 1995 took longer to accede to GATT than those that initiated applications after 1995 to accede to the WTO. The GATT/WTO accession is shortened if the applicant country's economy is large.

Using stop level service supply, demand, and performance data from the Los Angeles Metro bus system. I investigate whether reliability of a directional line serving a stop influences the number of passengers boarding the line at that stop, controlling for various other established factors affecting demand. This cross-sectional analysis of the variation in line boardings across about 1300 sample schedule time point bus stops served by about 300 directional bus lines over a six-month period uses a historical archive of real-time geo-referenced vehicle location data, and focuses on five different time periods, peaks and off-peaks, of a typical weekday. By evaluating two measures that capture different dimensions of bus service reliability, and by estimating a series of regression models, I find systematic evidence that higher average service punctuality (or schedule adherence) and lower variation in schedule deviation over time are associated with greater ridership, all else equal, particularly during the peak periods. This study also provides first empirical evidence that the effect of reliability on peak-period ridership is moderated by headway. The demand for reliability seems to be higher for lines with relatively longer headways. The findings indicate that service reliability influences transit mode choice and/or line/route selection, and suggest that system-wide ridership gains can be expected from reliability improvements. From an urban planning perspective, this study provides more evidence that good service quality can effectively compliment transformations in the urban fabric brought about by coordinated land use transit plans to promote transit use.

Such benefit can offset the negative price trend of a declining market and compound the positive price trend of a growing market, suggesting an asymmetric effect of the price and time-on-the-market (TOM) relation. In other words, search mitigates the downside risk and magnifies the upside potential for the seller, which is an important advantage for real estate investors. In this study, we uncover the asymmetric price-TOM relation, and demonstrate the value of search using empirical data from the residential real estate market. Based on a large sample of home sales in the Virginia Beach-Norfolk, Virginia metropolitan area during an extended period of time, our findings clearly reveal an asymmetric search effect on price: longer TOM is strongly correlated with higher selling prices, but more interestingly, even in a declining market, the effect of the search (or the impact of TOM) on price is still positive, albeit smaller, suggesting the benefit of search is more than enough to potentially offset a negative market impact.","[Cheng, Ping] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Lin, Zhenguo] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Liu, Yingchun] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; William & Mary,"Cheng, P (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",pcheng@fau.edu; zlin@fiu.edu; yingchun.liu@unt.edu; Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,28,21,22,1,11,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Nominating committee independence is important even when firms had an independent board, and the effect is stronger when the CEO is on the committee.

Our analysis of a panel of Romanian firms reveals two main findings: only medium-sized foreign firms generate spillovers, and domestic firms' size is of limited importance to identify which firms absorb spillovers. To explain these findings, we show that large foreign firms are less embedded in the domestic economy because they are more likely to bring their own suppliers, import intermediate inputs and export their output. Smaller foreign firms lack the scale to transmit spillovers to domestic firms. Whereas foreign firms' size adequately proxies for these spillover mechanisms, domestic firms' size has an unclear relationship with the different mechanisms.","[Lenaerts, Karolien] Univ Ghent, Fund Sci Res FWO Vlaanderen, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lenaerts, Karolien; Merlevede, Bruno] Univ Ghent, Dept Gen Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Merlevede, Bruno] IWH Halle, Halle, Germany; [Merlevede, Bruno] HUBrussel, Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Lenaerts, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fund Sci Res FWO Vlaanderen, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",karolien.lenaerts@ugent.be; bruno.merlevede@ugent.be,,"Merlevede, Bruno/0000-0002-5707-1155; Lenaerts, Karolien/0000-0002-3299-4690",,,,,36,14,19,4,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We study such choices for gains and losses, and for different gain probabilities. For 50-50 lotteries over gains we find that being responsible for somebody else's payoffs increases risk aversion. In the loss domain, on the other hand, we find significantly different behavior relative to gains, with slightly more risk seeking under responsibility. In a second experiment, we replicate the finding of increased risk aversion for large probabilities of a gain, while for small probability gains we find increased risk seeking under conditions of responsibility relative to large probabilities. This discredits hypotheses of a 'cautious shift' under responsibility, and may indicate an accentuation of the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes usually found for individual choices.","[Vieider, Ferdinand M.] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England; [Vieider, Ferdinand M.] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Risk & Dev Grp, Berlin, Germany",University of Reading,"Vieider, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",f.vieider@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,67,73,3,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

However, the removal of an incentive leads to a significant decrease in performance. Although there is behavioral evidence that incentives have an effect on performance, the neural underpinnings of the underlying cognitive processes are not certain. We hypothesize that performance is affected by monetary incentives, and that these changes are reflected by the dopaminergic reward system. In this study, we use the direct measure of performance and measure the underlying cognitive processes by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MI) simultaneously. We find that incentives induce changes in reward-related brain regions, but not in task-related neural representations. Interestingly, when monetary incentives are introduced, blood oxygenation level dependent activity increases in the ventral striatum, being sensitive to reward, and decreases in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, representing the subjective value. We suggest that pay-for-performance does not directly affect performance by modulating neural activity in task-relevant regions, but affects the reward representation during task completion. Therefore, we conclude that performance-contingent incentives need to be applied carefully. This finding is of special interest for employee compensation in unstable economic environments, as companies in unstable environments might not permanently ensure pay-for-performance.

If this high-value sector is to remain competitive and continue to grow, rural traders must be able to efficiently allocate scarce labour and factor inputs to trade shrimp. This study tests for factors leading to allocative inefficiency in the shrimp trade, by estimating a stochastic cost frontier on the basis of data from a survey of 200 shrimp traders in Central Java and South Sulawesi. Our results show that larger firms have a distinct cost advantage in trade and, owing in part to greater access to factor markets, are more efficient in allocating factors. Small firms can improve their allocative efficiency and become more competitive by specialising in trading one shrimp variety and by using output contracts to mitigate risk in the output market.","[Yi, Dale; Reardon, Thomas] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Adelaide; Michigan State University,"Yi, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",,,"Yi, Dale/0000-0002-8286-451X",,,,,40,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Under alternative specifications and robustness tests, the results suggest that signed dynamic PIN is related to returns, as a proxy for information asymmetry rather than just liquidity effects.

To answer this question, we assess how well Japanese youth have coped with the labor market's long-term structural changes, induced primarily by deepening interdependence with emerging economies and rapid technological progress over the last three decades. We examine the role of educational upgrading on the labor-market outcomes of youth between the ages of 25 and 29, using six waves of micro data from the Employment Status Survey spanning from 1982 to 2007. The analysis demonstrates that the demand growth for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor has been met by the educational upgrading of youth through the expansion of tertiary education, including education in vocational schools. Youth left behind the trend of educational upgrading, however, have suffered significantly from decreasing employment opportunities and deteriorated working conditions.

The stability of the Euro is proxied by decomposing Dollar-Euro exchange rate options into the moments of the risk-neutral distribution. Our stability measure can nicely separate periods of Dollar instability (the subprime crisis period) and Euro instability (the sovereign debt crisis period). In particular, we document that only during the sovereign debt crisis, changes in the creditworthiness of member countries with vulnerable fiscal positions have a significant impact on the stability of the common currency.

This paper is the first to use high-frequency good-level data to provide evidence that the answer is yes, at least for an important subset of consumption goods. It considers the case of Latvia, which recently dropped its pegged exchange rate and joined the euro zone. The paper analyzes the prices of thousands of differentiated goods sold by Zara, the world's largest clothing retailer. Price dispersion between Latvia and euro zone countries collapsed swiftly following entry to the euro. The percentage of goods with nearly identical prices in Latvia and Germany increased from 6 to 89 percent. The median size of price differentials declined from 7 percent to zero.

A lack of information about these programs has been suggested as a cause of low participation rates among certain groups, but it is often difficult to distinguish between the role of information sharing and other features of a neighborhood, such as factors that are common to people of the same ethnicities or socioeconomic opportunities, or uniquely local methods of program implementation. We seek to gain new insight into the potential role of information flows by investigating what happens when information is disrupted. We exploit rich microdata from Florida vital records and program participation files to explore declines in Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participation during pregnancy among foreign-born Hispanics in the information shock period surrounding welfare reform. We identify how the size of these reductions is affected by having a high density of neighbors from the same place of origin. Specifically, we compare changes in WIC participation among Hispanic immigrants living in neighborhoods with a larger concentration of own-origin immigrants to those with a smaller concentration of own-origin immigrants, holding constant the size of the immigrant population and the share of immigrants in the neighborhood who are Hispanic.

This paper criticises the determination of the amount to procure, and argues that the amount set for the first auction was excessive, particularly (but not exclusively) in ignoring the contribution from interconnectors. Too little attention was given to either the political economy or the option value aspects. Procuring too little raises fears of 'the lights going out but over-procurement increases consumer costs; undermines renewables by transferring capped finance to fossil generators; and impedes the Single Market including by weakening the business case for interconnectors. Making more use of the demand-side and potentially available 'latent' capacity lowers risk and increases options allowing more capacity procurement to be deferred. Capacity markets are intended to address problems of 'missing money' in terms of energy-only market incentives to invest; but over-procurement risks exacerbating the underlying problem, whereas addressing market failures and missing markets, and properly accounting for interconnectors, reduces the underlying problem.","[Newbery, David] Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Newbery, David] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Grubb, Michael] UCL, Int Energy & Climate Policy, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Grubb, Michael] Ofgem, Sustainable Energy Policy, London, England",University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; University of London; University College London,"Newbery, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",dmgn@cam.ac.uk; m.grubb@ucl.ac.uk,"Grubb, Michael/ITU-1302-2023","Grubb, Michael/0000-0003-2393-3041",,,,,44,18,18,2,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Mechanization-service provisions can be constrained by economies of scale, seasonality, limited mobility, or heterogeneous inputs quality. However, information has been scarce regarding how the private sector has overcome these constraints especially in countries like Nigeria that are at low agricultural development stages. We present the results of a small survey of tractor owner-operators conducted in Nigeria. We find that existing private-sector tractor-hiring services in Nigeria are indeed constrained. However, we also find heterogeneity among these owner-operators. In particular, those who buy tractors from private markets or from private individuals are more efficient than those who receive tractors through government programs, providing services to a greater area at lower costs, including during off-peak seasons, sometimes selecting machinery types according to soil types.

This paper examines the role of targeted development policy action in inducing economic growth and also in reducing regional income inequality during the last two decades (since the beginning of the 1990s)a period marked by increasing trade openness. In our disaggregated analysis of the states, we find that while the government capital expenditure policy has had significant positive impact on output growth of the poorer states, it failed to break the trend of escalating regional inequality. The policy has been significantly more effective in enhancing manufacturing sector output in the poorer states compared with the richer states. On the trade front, while the poorer states gained somewhat in income growth from greater openness, the gains were not large enough to offset the increasing regional disparity.","[Barua, Alokesh; Sawhney, Aparna] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Sawhney, A (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India.",abarua@mail.jnu.ac.in,"Sawhney, Aparna/AAW-4137-2020","Sawhney, Aparna/0000-0003-4878-7773",,,,,31,7,7,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We focus on the question whether productivity changes have a long-run impact on real effective exchange rates for a large number of European economies. Focusing on a sample period running from 1995 until 2013, we adopt a cointegrated vector autoregressive approach and distinguish between long-run equilibrium, short-run dynamics and long-run impact of shocks. Our findings show that for several industrialized economies, real effective exchange rates and labor productivity are not related over the long-run. A possible explanation for this result is that wage developments do not reflect increases in labor productivity to a large degree, which prevents a transmission to the real effective exchange rate through the price channel. The results for Central and Eastern European Countries are more encouraging since a positive impact of labor productivity on real effective exchange rate is frequently observed.","[Beckmann, Joscha; Belke, Ansgar; Czudaj, Robert] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] CEPS, Brussels, Belgium; [Belke, Ansgar] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Czudaj, Robert] Univ Appl Sci, FOM Hsch Oekonomie & Management, Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",joscha.beckmann@uni-due.de,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019; Czudaj, Robert L./I-2286-2019","Czudaj, Robert L./0000-0002-3313-8204",,,,,20,4,5,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Building on prior CV configuration research, we develop a theoretically grounded typology consisting of eight CV logics. Our typology holistically integrates aspects of institutional duality and competing logics with the influence of mutual resource dependencies and power imbalances arising from the three-way interplay between the parent company, the CV program, and the external environment. In particular, our typology captures the effects of the relative resource munificence of the external environment on the bilateral dependence between the parent company and the CV program, and on the emergence of either existing distinct venturing logics or unique hybrid logics. These eight venturing logics provide guidance with respect to the optimal configurations of CV programs, both in times of economic crisis and in times of economic plenty.

In contrast, Durtschi and Easton (2005, 2009, hereafter DE) assert that discontinuities are instead explained by some combination of prior researchers' choice(s) of scaling and sample selection as well as a scaling-related effect due to a systematic relation between the sign of earnings and market prices. Resolution of the conflicting interpretations of discontinuities is important because (1) it affects how investors, regulators, and scholars view earnings management and (2) it demonstrates the importance of a close linkage between theory and research design choices. We point out that DE provide no evidence that scaling or selection create discontinuities, but only evidence showing that changes in scaling or selection eliminate discontinuities. We demonstrate why the research designs used by DE eliminate discontinuities and why alternative designs using the same data yield statistically significant discontinuities that cannot be attributed to either scaling or selection.

This increase represents an intention to save that would almost completely offset the government debt in specific states of the world (i.e., if the insured dies). Because this state of the world is rare, the immediate increase in actual savings is only about $0.03, the cost of the additional insurance. We find, in addition, that this response occurs mainly on the intensive margin, meaning that the size of the average life insurance policy increases when government debt increases. Along the extensive margin, we find the number of policies in force falls slightly with federal debt, and rises slightly with state debt increases.

We analyzed the methods used by 95 organizations, experienced in sustainability reporting. We used both quantitative and qualitative data extracted from the integrated reports published in 2014. The theoretical framework of the research relies on the stakeholder theory. The perspective used in the analysis of the results was derived from the classic and modern theories in marketing, which include the use of annual reports as marketing communication tools. The main results show that the provisions of the International Integrated Reporting Framework were only partially observed by the organizations included in the sample. The analyzed reporting practices show evidence of the existence of correlations between the size of integrated reports and the disclosure of the value added distribution for the traditional stakeholders. The disclosure of information regarding the customers, environment and the society is correlated with the presentation of the value added statement.","[Dumitru, Madalina; Guse, Raluca Gina; Feleaga, Liliana; Mangiuc, Dragos Marian; Feldioreanu, Alexandra Ionelia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",Madalina.Dumitru@cig.ase.ro,"Mangiuc, Dragos/IXX-0619-2023; Dumitru, Madalina/C-3885-2011; Guse, Raluca Gina/GVT-2621-2022; Ionescu-Feleaga, Liliana/AAT-1346-2021","Mangiuc, Dragos/0000-0003-1215-6902; Dumitru, Madalina/0000-0001-9159-6302; Guse, Raluca Gina/0000-0001-5424-3364; Ionescu-Feleaga, Liliana/0000-0002-2087-2186",,,,,51,19,24,0,39,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,955,976,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700008,0

Analyses of multi-source and multi-level data, collected from 72 top managers (TMs) and 397 middle managers (MMs) operating in 34 units of a multi-national organization, indicate that TMs' boundary-spanning is positively related to units' exploratory innovation, but also has a cascading effect on MMs by increasing their perceived role conflict. MMs' role conflict is negatively related to units' exploratory innovation and thus offsets some of the benefits gained through TMs' boundary-spanning activities. Taking a configurational perspective on social exchanges at multiple levels, we show that role conflict is reduced by overlapping boundary-spanning ties among TMs and MMs. Surprisingly, MMs' boundary-spanning does not relate to exploratory innovation. Our study shows that with regard to boundary-spanning, a top-down approach to CE as strategic renewal may be most effective because TMs play a key role in driving exploratory innovation. However, TMs need to be aware of the cascading social liabilities of their boundary-spanning behavior and ensure MMs develop similar networks. We advance ongoing debates in studies about CE and social networks by providing empirically validated insights into who drives strategic renewal and by uncovering the benefits and costs of social exchanges for strategic renewal. Furthermore, we uncover potential causes of mixed findings in network theory research and highlight a remedy to social liabilities.","[Glaser, Lotte] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Fourne, Sebastian P.

This effect is sizable and delivers a net-of-risk performance of 3.8% per year. Funds with a lower FSB follow more idiosyncratic strategies, suggesting that FSB is a deliberate, active choice of the fund manager.

The first analysis investigates the adjustments to the size and composition of portfolios to achieve the target risk-weighted asset (RWA). The second analysis investigates how quickly banks adjust the numerator and denominator of their capital ratio. We find evidence that banks adjusted the composition of their assets faster than their asset size to achieve the RWA targets under the macroeconomic and institutional conditions in Japan. In addition, we find that banks adjusted their level of regulatory capital faster than their RWAs to achieve the capital ratio targets. Furthermore, we find that banks that had less capital surplus shifted their portfolio composition toward lower-risk assets without reducing the total assets.

Contrary to what the existing literature suggests, results show that there is no definite relation between lobbying status and the direction of trade policy of an industry. Trade protection of an industry depends on how its consumption (horizontal) and production (vertical) linkages with other industries reinforce or cancel out its lobbying efforts. To cite a few results, (i) an organized industry may face trade tax, whereas an unorganized one may obtain protection; (ii) an organized downstream industry may not be able to impose trade tax to an unorganized upstream industry, (iii) an organized upstream industry may not hurt unorganized downstream industry, (iv) lobby for non-traded industry alone can influence trade policies, and (v) lobby for traded industry affects the size of the non-traded sector in the economy.","Dept Ind, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada",,"Acharya, RC (通讯作者)，Dept Ind, 10 East 235 Queen St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada.",ram.acharya@ic.gc.ca,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,9,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The model outperforms affine specifications with the same number of state variables, suggesting that there are important nonlinearities in credit spreads that are captured by our model.

In this article, we provide a model of, and different perspectives on, such sabotage activities and review the economics literature analyzing the act of sabotage in contests. We discuss the theories and evidence emphasizing the means of sabotage, why sabotage occurs, and the effects of sabotage on individual contestants and on overall welfare, with possible means of reducing sabotage. We note that most sabotage activities are aimed at the ablest contestant, the possibility of sabotage reduces productive effort exerted by the contestants, and sabotage may lessen the effectiveness of public policies, such as affirmative action, or information revelation in contests. We discuss the different policies a designer might use to counteract sabotage.

We exploit an exogenous shock to the asset opaqueness and perception of risks of Brazilian banks caused by the global financial turmoil of 2008. Our empirical identification takes advantage of the cross-sectional heterogeneity of types of depositors in Brazilian banks and the existence of several owner-managed banks (for which shareholder-targeted signaling is implausible) to identify that information-sensitive depositors (institutional investors) are targets of dividend signaling by banks. These costly signaling efforts are particularly strong during financial crises when asset opaqueness, informational asymmetry and depositors' concerns regarding bank liquidity are exacerbated. From a policy perspective, our results favor the imposition of limits on bank dividends during financial crises, because the banks' need to signal their financial health through dividends during crises intensifies the pro-cyclical effects of bank capital on lending.

Drawing on empirical results obtained in experimental economics and psychology, we first discuss the impact of moral emotions on the emergence of other-regarding behaviors such as cooperation, altruism, trust and reciprocity. We especially highlight how the affective sanction associated with negative moral emotions (guilt, shame, righteous anger...) participates in the regulation of opportunistic behaviors, whereas the affective reward derived from positive moral emotions (pride, gratitude...) promotes socially or morally valued behaviors. Second, we focus on how economists have responded to the challenge of integrating a role for moral emotions into economic theory. We particularly point out that, in a minimalist conception, emotions can be formalized as exogenous preferences activated because of the behavioral constraints embodied in pre-existing implicit social or moral norms. Nevertheless, a broader and (we argue) more realistic conception of emotions would allow their influence to depend on agents' intentions, expectations, and personalities as well as on the specific context of a decision, implying that moral emotions may be better understood as a form of endogenous preferences.","[Jourdheuil, Romain; Petit, Emmanuel] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Jourdheuil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",romain.jourdheuil@u-bordeaux.fr; emmanuel.petit@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,95,7,7,4,129,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This resulted in active formal credit and land markets, either of which potentially affects consumption levels and volatility. This article evaluates the program impact with respect to consumption outcomes. In particular, it identifies the channel of impact through which improved property rights affect consumption volatility. We find that land certification increases consumption levels for rural households, but also consumption volatility for a subgroup of households identified by an instrument. We show that the certification program affects consumption outcomes of this subgroup through, presumably more risky, credit-based agricultural investment at the intensive margin.

The empirical work for these projects was conducted using confidential versions of the Canadian Census and the Labour Force Surveys on-site at Statistics Canada. I found that while increases in the generosity of parental leave benefits substantially increased the birth rate and induced increases in labor supply among women of childbearing age, cash-transfer fertility incentives only slightly increased birth rates and decreased female labor supply. The net government cost of each additional birth due to an increase in the generosity of parental leave programs was $15,828 in 2008 Canadian dollars, whereas the net government cost of an additional birth due to cash-transfer fertility incentives was $223,625 in 2008 Canadian dollars. Therefore, paid parental leave is a low-cost way to increase fertility whereas the price per additional birth due to cash-transfer fertility incentives is quite high.","[Ang, Xiaoling] Off Res, Consumer Financial Protect Bur, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA",,"Ang, XL (通讯作者)，Off Res, Consumer Financial Protect Bur, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",xiaoling.ang@cfpb.gov,,,Statistics Canada Tom Symons Research Fellowship; teh National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship,Statistics Canada Tom Symons Research Fellowship; teh National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship,"This research was supported by the Statistics Canada Tom Symons Research Fellowship and teh National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

At the same time, total aid has no effect on overall quality of governance, while US aid appears to have a negative impact on some dimensions of governance. Aid's differential impact on democracy and governance is consistent with uneven development of institutions and the democracy consolidation hypothesis.

This allows us to study many new issues, including entry, efficiency, and dynamics. In the benchmark model, equilibrium exists uniquely and involves production and intermediation for some parameters but not others. Sometimes intermediation is essential: the market operates if and only if middlemen are active. If bargaining powers are set correctly equilibrium is efficient; if not there can be too much or too little economic activity. This is novel, compared to the original Rubinstein-Wolinsky model, where equilibrium is always efficient.","[Nosal, Ed; Wright, Randall] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Wong, Yuet-Yee] Binghamton Univ, Binghamton, NY USA; [Wright, Randall] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Wright, Randall] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Wright, Randall] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Federal Reserve System - USA; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Nosal, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",ed.nosal@chi.frb.org; yywong01@gmail.com; rwright@bus.wisc.edu,,,,,,,30,10,11,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In particular, countries with much corruption are shown to encourage emigration and discourage immigration because they provide worse and unpredictable economic conditions, more insecurity, and a lower quality of life. This hypothesis is confirmed empirically with a cross-sectional dataset with bilateral migration data covering 230 countries. Well-known implications of the gravity model are confirmed here: larger populations, a common language and a common border increase migration, while distance between two countries decreases migration. Furthermore, education, GDP per capita, inflation in the destination country, as well as corruption and education in the origin country can robustly explain migration. Corruption thus appears to be a push factor of migration.","ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Poprawe, M (通讯作者)，ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",marie.poprawe@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,58,65,3,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2015,163.0,3-4,,,,,337,354,,10.1007/s11127-015-0255-x,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CI0DY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354407500008,0

While changes to government structures are often suggested as a solution to the coordination and servicing dilemmas inherent within metropolitan areas, more recent research has demonstrated that decentralized, voluntary means of interlocal cooperation show promise in providing for service and policy continuity within these regions. Very little research has been conducted on the state of voluntary cooperation in Canadian metropolitan areas. This article seeks to correct this by studying interlocal agreements within six Canadian metropolitan areas, while introducing new measures for examining the intensity of these relationships. Overall, this article finds that municipalities within these areas are using interlocal agreements sparingly, and those with arrangements are mostly signing low-value, low-risk agreements that do not integrate governance mechanisms or service responsibility.","Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Laurier Inst Study Publ Opin & Policy, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Spicer, Z (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Laurier Inst Study Publ Opin & Policy, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",,,,,,,,56,9,10,0,35,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We employ average daily temperatures to derive GDDs using three approaches: (1) An econometric approach with a sine function; (2) Monte Carlo simulation with a sine function and three methods to estimate the mean-reversion parameter; and (3) a historic approach (burn analysis) based on a 10-year moving average of GDDs. Results indicate that the historical average method provides the best fit, followed by the stochastic process with a high mean reversion speed, and, finally, the approach using the econometrically estimated sine function.

Our findings for the Taiwan market differ from previous studies on the U.S. market. Specifically, we find no support for the notion of out of sight, out of mind. For Taiwan mutual funds, net flows and inflows are negatively related to operating expenses but not front-end loads. The discrepancy between our results and those reported for the U.S. market may be attributed to the fee structure in Taiwan, where operating expenses are much higher than front-end loads and seem to have a bigger impact on fund performance. The negative relation between net flows (inflows) and operating expenses is more pronounced for funds with high institutional investor participation and funds charging high operating expenses. However, investor types show no significant impact on the relations between front-end loads and various measures of fund flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This empirical predictive relation is negative, which is consistent with the usual prediction of the dividend pricing model. In contrast, over the new REIT era, 1993-2011, there is a positive predictive relation from dividend yields to aggregate REIT returns.

We address this contradiction using data moments of consumption and asset returns to fit a canonical international consumption risk sharing framework. Introducing persistent consumption risk, we find that its correlation across countries is more important for risk sharing than that of transitory risk. To identify these risk components, we jointly exploit the comovement of equity returns and consumption. This identification implies high correlations in persistent consumption risk, suggesting a strong degree of existing risk sharing despite low consumption correlations in the data.

Although the explanation of this divergence has been attributed to the social and environmental context, together with the prevailing market incentives, that characterized the different rural societies of this period, there has been no clear assessment of the role played by each of these factors. Through a comparative study of the historical data at the provincial level, this paper analyses the relative contribution of these elements to that divergence. The results diminish the significance of market signals and show how the social and environmental conditions interacted to limit, or promote, the dismantling of the common lands. Apart from the greater need to resort to the commons when it was necessary to increase agricultural production in dry regions, this paper highlights the role of unequal levels of access to land in promoting enclosure. The Spanish case illustrates the limitations of the theories that predict the inevitable drift towards individual property rights.","Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford,"Tapia, FJB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",francisco.beltran@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Beltran Tapia, Francisco/H-4337-2015","Beltran Tapia, Francisco/0000-0002-7354-5699","ESRC; Nuffield College; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [HAR2012-30732, ECO2012-33286]",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Nuffield College; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"An earlier version of this paper was presented in Zaragoza and Oxford.

This paper contributes to closing a gap in the literature on entrepreneurship and development by developing a model of costly firm creation with skill differences between young and adult entrepreneurs. The model shows that for young entrepreneurs facing high costs of search for business opportunities, support for training is more effective in stimulating productive start-ups than subsidies. The case for interventions targeted at youth rises in societies with high costs of youth unemployment.

We find that house prices in emerging economies grow faster, are more volatile, less persistent, and less synchronized across countries than in advanced economies (AEs). We also find that they correlate with capital flows more closely than in AEs. We then condition the analysis on an exogenous change to a particular component of capital flows: global liquidity, broadly understood as a proxy for the international supply of credit. We identify this shock by aggregating bank-to-bank cross-border credit and by using the external instrumental variable approach introduced by Stock and Watson (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013). We find that in emerging markets (EMs) a global liquidity shock has a much stronger impact on house prices and consumption than in AEs. We finally show that holding house prices constant in response to this shock tends to dampen its effects on consumption in both AEs and EMs, but possibly through different channels: in AEs by boosting the value of housing collateral and hence supporting domestic borrowing; in EMs, by appreciating the exchange rate and hence supporting the international borrowing capacity of the economy.","[Cesa-Bianchi, Ambrogio] Bank England, London, England; [Felipe Cespedes, Luis] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Rebucci, Alessandro] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Bank of England; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Johns Hopkins University,"Cesa-Bianchi, A (通讯作者)，Bank England, London, England.",ambrogio.cesa-bianchi@bankofengland.co.uk; lfcespedes@uai.cl; arebucci@jhu.edu,"Rebucci, Alessandro/AFQ-9033-2022","Rebucci, Alessandro/0000-0002-6824-8227",,,,,0,82,88,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Substituting carbon taxes for other sources of revenue or using the proceeds to reduce deficits or finance expenditures are the keys to integration of carbon taxes with fiscal reform. Recycling carbon tax revenues through reductions of capital income tax rates provides the largest margin of economic benefits over the costs of emissions control. Reducing capital tax rates lowers the cost of capital services and increases the rate of capital formation.

When a bank experiences a negative shock to its equity, a natural way to return to target leverage is to sell assets. If potential buyers are limited, then asset sales depress prices, in which case one bank's sales impact other banks with common exposures. We show how this contagion effect adds up across the banking sector, and how it can be estimated empirically using balance sheet data. We compute bank exposures to system-wide deleveraging, as well as the spillovers induced by individual banks. Applying the model to European banks, we evaluate a variety of interventions to reduce their vulnerability to fire sales during the sovereign debt crisis.

The geographically differentiated nature of real estate market fluctuations implies that these policies need to be granular across regions and countries. Before the financial crisis that started in 2007 property markets were overvalued in a range of European countries, but much like in other constituencies active policies addressing this were an exception. An increasing number of studies suggest that borrower-based regulatory policies, such as reductions in loan-to-value or debt-to-income limits, can be effective in leaning against real estate booms. But many of the new macroprudential policy authorities in Europe do not have clear powers to determine them. Moreover, the cross-border spillovers they may give rise to suggest the establishment of a well-defined macroprudential coordination mechanism for the single European market.","[Hartmann, Philipp] European Cent Bank, Gen Res, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hartmann, Philipp] Erasmus Univ, Macrofinancial Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Hartmann, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Gen Res, Frankfurt, Germany.",philipp.hartmann@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,21,34,37,2,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We replicate successfully the main results of Ram (2009), who rejects the role of country size as an omitted variable. However, several extensions advise against a hasty conclusion: The results differ substantially depending on the data source used, the timeframe considered, the countries selected, and the way variables are measured. Specifically, we employ newer versions of the Penn World Table (PWT 7.1 and 8.0), allowing us to both extend the number of observations and the timeframe. We find evidence for the claim that smaller countries do indeed have bigger governments, especially when using the PWT 8.0 data, and Ram (2009) findings might be driven by the specific dataset used (PWT 6.1) and the countries included in that sample.

In this paper, we explore the different electoral incentives faced by first term mayors who are eligible for reelection and second term mayors who are legally banned to stand for another term in office. Our results point to significant fiscal differences between both types of mayors in Brazil. During elections, first term mayors decrease revenues from own local taxation and change their budget composition by moving from current expenditures towards capital related ones, while budget balances and total expenditures remain unchanged. These findings are consistent with recently developed signalling models of PBC and with the conditional political budget cycles literature, where incumbents aiming at maximizing their reelection chances subject to institutional restrictions on fiscal deficits change the composition of the budget in electoral years by providing more visible and targeted expenditures.

This paper investigates asymmetric pattern in volatility clustering by employing a univariate copula approach of Chen and Fan (2006). Using daily realized kernel volatilities constructed from high frequency data from stock and foreign exchange markets, we find evidence that volatility clustering is highly nonlinear and strongly asymmetric in that clusters of high volatility occur more often than clusters of low volatility. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to address and uncover this phenomenon. In particular, the asymmetry in volatility clustering is found to be more pronounced in the stock markets than in the foreign exchange markets. Further, the volatility clusters are shown to remain persistent for over a month and asymmetric across different time periods. Our findings have important implications for risk management. A simulation study indicates that models which accommodate asymmetric volatility clustering can significantly improve the out-of-sample forecasts of Value-at-Risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This effect is more pronounced among financially constrained firms and for firms that are likely to benefit more from diffused technology, e.g., those that have newer patents, are more profitable, and face better growth opportunities. The spillover impact remains strong when product market competition and own-firm innovations are accounted for.

In particular, we study the impact of the program on food security, savings, and health outcomes. We have a panel data of 1,064 households from 198 villages of Andhra Pradesh, over two years. In the early stage of the program, several households that applied for work were denied employment due to shortage of work. We exploit this exogenous variation to calculate triple-difference estimates of the impact of the program. Our results indicate that the NREGS significantly increased the monthly per capita expenditure on food and non-food consumables. The program also improved food security by a significant reduction in the number of meals foregone by households per week. The program raised the probability of holding savings and reduced the incidence of depression among rural households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the nature of the relationship between formal and informal institutions, we analyze bilateral trade patterns in a sample of 16 European countries between 1996-2009. Our results show that trust and rule of law are substitutes, as the positive effect of trust on trade is conditional on the quality of the rule of law. When the rule of law of the importing country increases relative to that of the exporter, the effect of trust on trade decreases. The decline in the effect of trust on trade is less for importers than for exporters, a result that can be attributed to the risk of non-payment that exporters run. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considers the way that the HSR network has grown and how this growth could have affected air transport dynamically. The findings show that a dynamic vision of this substitution rate should be adopted, as opposed to assuming that the rate is constant, as has been the case in previous references. Although the rate varies significantly over the study period, only 13.9% of HSR passenger demand was found to have come from air travel during the 1999-2012 period, meaning that HSR and airlines would seem to offer more independent services than at first it might appear. This confirms the hypothesis as to the HSR's great ability to generate its own demand. The substitution rate between the two transport modes seems to be closely linked to the way that any new stations are incorporated into the HSR network. Convergence between the seasonality of HSR and air transport has also been examined. The results show that it is difficult to talk of a real HSR transport network in Spain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking to capture the costs that firms face when operating in a country. Several interesting results emerge. Firstly, the Doing Business rank is highly significant when included in a standard empirical foreign direct investment (FDI) model estimated on data averaged over the period 2004-2009. Secondly, the significance of the overall Doing Business is driven by the Ease of Trading Across Borders component. Thirdly, the relationship is significant for middle income countries, but not for the World's poorest region, Sub-Saharan Africa, or for the OECD. Finally, we find no evidence that the ease of doing business of nearby countries has an effect on the FDI that a country gets in general.","[Corcoran, Adrian] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Gillanders, Robert] Aalto Univ, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland",University College Dublin; Aalto University,"Corcoran, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland.",adriancorc@gmail.com; rgillanders@gmail.com,"Gillanders, Robert/I-5105-2019","Gillanders, Robert/0000-0001-9462-0005",,,,,24,85,95,10,124,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This is important consideration as risk concentrations and propagation embedded in risk transfers pose as a significant challenge for financial regulations and risk management. Using an a priori and an a posteriori analysis, we investigate the impact of the network structure on optimal hedge decisions and hedge efficacy. The a priori analysis shows that network features play an important role in determining corporate hedging decisions through their impact on hedge costs. In the a posteriori analysis for counterparty risk, benefit of modification from the a priori optimal hedge decision is realized when variance of firm value matters, but not when tail risk measures are utilized. Financial network assessment indicates that an a priori analysis is insufficient for robust hedging decisions, and choice of risk measures behind risk management objectives dictates the extent of impact of network characteristics.

The motivation for this paper is the growing PRC merger and acquisition activity in Europe and the USA. The fact that the PRC, despite its many successful internal reforms, cannot induce innovation activity designed to alter its external sector from one that is based on cheap labor to one that is based on innovation-rich products, has forced it to use its extensive reserve holdings to acquire the necessary R&D via merger and acquisition.

Random-effects estimates differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those of fixed effects in our study, serving as a cautionary note for evaluations where time-invariant unobservables are important.","[Wendland, Kelly J.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Baumann, Matthias] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Lewis, David J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Sieber, Anika] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Radeloff, Volker C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA",Colorado State University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Oregon State University; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Wendland, KJ (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Radeloff, Volker C/B-6124-2016; Lewis, David/AFQ-9010-2022; Lewis, David/AAH-4137-2022; Baumann, Matthias/K-4757-2014","Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Baumann, Matthias/0000-0003-2375-3622",,,,,58,32,40,0,48,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 728 State Street, Suite 443, MADISON, WI, UNITED STATES",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,FEB,2015,91.0,1,,,,,149,168,,10.3368/le.91.1.149,0.0,,,20,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CA1TB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348693200009,0

This article examines the processes through which Indonesia has promoted palm-oil consumption and some of the consequences of that promotion. Partial equilibrium modelling shows that Indonesia's remarkable increase in palm-oil consumption since 1985 is not largely attributable to population and income growth. Instead, much of this consumption growth has resulted from substitution away from coconut oil, facilitated by government policies on technology, pricing, distribution, and trade. The switch from coconut oil to palm oil in Indonesia was associated with increased land conversions to agriculture and diminished smallholder competitiveness. Despite lower rates of cooking-oil substitution in the future, simulations suggest that Indonesia's total palm-oil consumption in 2035 will be at least double that of 2010.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Gaskell, JC (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,Center for International Forestry Research; Stanford University,Center for International Forestry Research; Stanford University(Stanford University),"The author gratefully acknowledges Walter P.

In particular, the empirical strategy studies the relationship between risky asset shares and linear and nonlinear business cycles. The empirical part employs data from household surveys in the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand for the period of 1998-2012. The analysis provides evidence that while a linear framework does not provide a statistically significant association between business cycles and decisions in risky investments, a nonlinear business cycles context leads investors to decrease their risky investments stronger during recessions than they increase them during booms, lending support to the hypothesis of interaction between financial risks and other determinants. The results are expected to signal interesting flashing points not only to market participants and portfolio managers, but mainly to policy makers and the way their economic policy decisions affect the working of financial markets.

Due to the lack of transparency in debt statistics (government arrears, guarantees, etc.), undeveloped bond market (smallest countries rely on short to medium term credit borrowing) and the lack of public debt management strategy (Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), countries mostly rely on external borrowing with constantly increasing borrowing costs (yields on government bonds and interest payments).

At the same time, the global food system is now responsible for up to one-third of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions (Gilbert, 2012). This means that, given the present conditions in terms of climate, demography and technology, the world society should be capable of progressing, not regressing, toward a sustainable rural economy before 2050, relying on a per capita availability of arable land, not matching the current world population distribution, which is around 0.20 hectares at present. On this premise, the present article claims that peasant agriculture oriented to family livelihood will be a key sector in the next wave of economic development. Therefore, in order to support this statement, the Albanian agriculture case study will be considered. This is because the case of Albania is a distinctive case in Europe of peasant agriculture, it being structurally oriented to family autoconsumption and local food markets. Referring to a rural economy based on peasant agriculture as a modern one seems to be a paradox. Nevertheless, climate change is pushing the ontological shift towards an agro-ecological paradigm in which an ecologically driven conception of value addressing societal reproduction rather than capital accumulation is emerging (McMichael, 2012). Thus, the present article aims to describe the role of peasant agriculture in economic development under the constraint of climate change, applying this topic to the empirical case of Albania.

In this scenario, between cities in the same region there would have emerged a collaborative relationship aiming to further develop the region and to compete with other regions. In the current situation, without regionalization, urban agglomerations are facing a direct competition with even cities that should be colleagues within the administrative regions. Some public managers understand that in order to have an effective management system it is mandatory to adopt a competitive behavior, guided by the rules of competitive intelligence.

In economics experience can improve productivity. The concept of the experience curve as a form of organizational learning was developed during the second half of the 20th century. It was especially promoted by the Boston Consulting Group and found its way into most textbooks on management and strategic planning; empirical data have been published for a number of industries. In the construction industry, however, very few data are available to support the concept. The largest obstacle for all researchers is to obtain the cost information as these are typically not shared by companies. Consequentially we have gathered cost data from four very large expressway bridges to study experience effects in construction projects. These were built in Bangkok, Thailand, by the same joint venture for the same owner during the period from 1990 to 2000 using segmental bridge construction technology. The square meters of bridge deck serve as basic units and the four projects comprise some three million of these, so that impacts of increasing experience could be observed. The data for all four projects have been evaluated and adjusted for inflation. They support the idea that a cost reduction of 20% can be achieved. The cost reductions must be actively pursued, there exists no automatic process. (C) 2015 The Authors.

According to the results of the model is the work-centered preference associated with 52% increase in likelihood that a woman will spend most of the energy in employment. The impact of higher education has been shown to be positive and significant - higher education increases the likelihood that a woman will spend most of the energy is employment by more than 14%.

Secondly, the exchange rate acts as a shock absorber for domestic productivity and foreign demand shock. Thirdly, in case of incomplete passthrough the central bank of Mongolia is required to adjust the nominal interest rate more under the productivity shock.

This paper made a research on the defense mechanism against cascading collapse effect in communication networks and proposed a defense model based on emergency flow-limiting mechanism. And by using three sample networks in simulation experiments, the plan has been proved working well in controlling and defensing cascading collapse phenomenon appearing in communication networks. At the same time, we conducted some simulating researches and analyses on defense plan of deleting the modules with lower centralization degree. By comparison, we find defense model with emergency flow-limiting mechanism has a wider application scope and higher efficiency, while costing less, providing prominent theoretical support to prevention and control of network cascading failures.","[Chen, Xi; Li, Qi] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",572214342@qq.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,929,934,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700181,0

Our approach relies on a structural definition of liquidity frictions arising from the theoretical framework of Grossman and Miller (1988), which explains how liquidity shocks affect the way in which information is incorporated into daily trading characteristics. In addition, we propose an econometric setup exploiting the volatility-volume relationship to filter the liquidity portion of volume and infer the presence of liquidity frictions using daily data. Finally, based on FTSE 100 stocks, we show that the extended MDH model proposed here outperforms that of Andersen (1996) and that the liquidity frictions are priced in the cross-section of stock returns.

Discovering the inner disparities can be incorporated into the development strategies. The LAGs with prevailing either economic or environmental qualities should develop their weaker features. The study compares all communities inside the LAG Vyhlidky in Central Bohemia and divides them into three groups. The contribution proposes evaluation of the quality of life and comparison between regional subjects based on direct processing of official statistical data. The disparities were qualified using two aggregated indexes: economic activity index and environmental quality index. The mutual evaluation of chosen communities is quite complicated due to a high number of independent territorial units. Specialized maps were created for visualization to improve the transparency of the results. The result of the study is a methodological proposal of finding inner disparities in micro regions.

One of the main question remains as how close is the position of Romanian urban areas to the category of knowledge city. Given the characteristics of Romanian cities on culture, science, technology and innovation, and policies in urban, economic and social development, I conclude that Romania must adopt firstly a unified and coherent long term development strategy for a healthy economy. The paper will try to emphasize the position possibility of Romanian cities in the category of knowledge city based on the concept of knowledge city, the principles, characteristics and processes of a knowledge city, taking into account the theoretical approach and empirical evidences. In this regard, I will use the background offered by literature and the official statiscal data for analysis to identify the key success factors of few Romanian urban areas which explain the posible 'candidature' to the quality of knowledge city. I estimate the analysis to confirm the hypothesis that there are good aspects, but also deficiencies that require major solutions and policy options for designing Romanian cities as emerging knowledge cities.

The results indicate that US investors tend to herd during days when important macro data are released, and that there have been herding spill-over effects from the US to the UK during earlier financial crises. Further results reveal more differences in herding behavior between the two markets: in the US we find that investors herd due to both fundamentals and non-fundamentals during different crises, when in the UK there is herding only due to fundamentals and only during the Dotcom bubble burst.

The portions they received will enable them to fulfill their basic needs and conduct economic activities. One of the distribution instruments of zakat institutions is in form of loan-free capital assistance. The objective of capital assistance programs is to increase the income of the recipients through entrepreneurships. Zakat institutions have also initiated various programs such as offering training as well as giving business and marketing guidance, so that the recipients would become self-reliant and own a formal business. Based on content analysis on secondary data as well as primary data, the discussion of this paper is divided into three sections. First, this paper identifies the capital assistance program which is the most effective in increasing the income of the recipients. Second, this paper investigates the factors that contribute to the success of the program and third, it investigates the challenges encountered by zakat institution in capital assistance program. The study was done with the cooperation from Selangor Zakat Board, one of the main zakat institutions in Malaysia. The findings of the research revealed that the mobile business program is the most effective program in transforming the recipients into entrepreneurs where the success of the business can be seen in as early as 3 months. The fmdings of this research also revealed that instead of requesting the recipients to repay the capital aid, forced savings method has been imposed which became one of the factors that contribute to the success of the program.

Even though the Beyond Budgeting system offers advantages to those organizations competing in the sector of knowledge industry, there are only few organizations practicing this approach today. This paper tries to give an answer to the question why Beyond Budgeting did not spread in the knowledge based modern industries and what might be impact factors regarding a successful approach. First this paper gives an overview of the development and the literature regarding beyond budgeting. After that the advantages of Beyond Budgeting are pointed out, especially in terms of organizational justice. We then show that the ability of managers and employees to participate in decision making and to accept a coaching management style might be a key factor for a successful approach. Moreover, this requirement might hinder organizations to start a Beyond Budgeting project as it would mean a change in mindset which is difficult to achieve. We suggest that Beyond Budgeting offers great benefits and advantages especially in terms of perceived organizational justice. But only those organizations which managers and employees are able to change and leave their comfort and turn into stretch zones, can harvest those advantages the Beyond Budgeting approach offers.

Lessons from Japan's Postcrisis Experience,IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CREDIT,"This paper reexamines Japanese policy choices during its banking crisis in the 1990s and draws some lessons relevant for the United States and Europe in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The paper focuses on two aspects of postcrisis economic policy of Japan: the delay in bank recapitalization and the lack of structural reforms. These two policy shortcomings retarded Japan's recovery from the crisis and were responsible for its stagnant postcrisis growth. The paper also suggests some political economy factors that contributed to the Japanese policies. In France, Italy, and Spain bank recapitalization has been delayed and the structural reforms have been slow. Without drastic changes, they are likely to follow Japan's path to long economic stagnation. The situation in Germany looks somewhat better mainly because the structural reform was undertaken before the crisis. Although the recovery has been slow in the United States as well, the problems are at least different from those faced by Japan then and many European countries now.","[Hoshi, Takeo] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies FSI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Finance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Hoshi, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies FSI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"Bank of England; National Science Foundation; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1128322] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Bank of England; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Takeo Hoshi is Henri and Tomoye Takahashi Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI) and Professor of Finance (by courtesy) at the Graduate School of Business, both at Stanford University.

This paper aims to analyse the dependence between slope of the yield curve and an economic activity of selected countries between the years 2000 and 2013. The slope of the yield curve can be measured as the yield spread between sovereign 10-year and 3-month bonds. The natural and probably the most popular measure of economic growth is by GDP growth, taken quarterly. The results showed that the best predictive lags are lag of four and five quarters. The results presented also confirm that 10-year and 3-month yield spread has significant predictive power to real GDP growth after financial crisis. These findings can be beneficial for investors and provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of the yield curve spreads as indicators of the future economic activity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The beams are modeled by the Euler-Bernoulli theories when they are bending during the piezomagnetic/piezoelectric structures in shear motion. The explicit formulations of SH-SAWs dispersion relations in such layered structure with consideration of magnetoelectrically open and shorted cases are derived. The effects of the microbeam array on the phase velocity are analyzed. The numerical results are presented and discussed. From the results, we can find that the effects of microbeams on the properties of the SH-SAWs are remarkable. The phase velocity decrease with the non-dimensional wave number and increase with the number of microbeams and the thickness of piezomagnetic layer. The analytical method and the results in the paper could be useful to the design of the chemical sensors of magnetoelectric materials.","[Jin, Ruixin; Yuan, Lili] Ningbo Univ, Sch Architectural Civil Engn & Environm, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ding, Benjie; Fu, Xian; Yuan, Lili] Ningbo Univ, Sch Mech Engn & Mech, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; Ningbo University,"Jin, RX (通讯作者)，Ningbo Univ, Sch Architectural Civil Engn & Environm, 818 Fenghua Rd, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yuanlili@nbu.edu.cn,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,363,367,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700071,0

The article focuses on potential benefits and risks of extending legal regulation of the geographical indication protection for non-agricultural products. After experiencing the results of legal protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs, it is clear that strengthening legal protection of these designations brings benefits to producers, because their products have greater distinctiveness and the guarantee of quality and origin can boost sales. The same values are beneficial for consumers, which can make informed and safe decision about purchase of goods, based on reliable information. Eventually, the selected region can benefit from the GI too, because the introduction of the protection of geographical indications can have a multiplying effect in terms of promotion of the region, encouraging tourism and subsequent creation of new job opportunities.","[Kelblova, Hana; Mikusova, Jana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Law & Social Sci, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kelblová, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Law & Social Sci, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",kelblova@mendelu.cz; mikusova@mendelu.cz,"mikusova, Jana/JNS-5205-2023","Kelblova, Hana/0000-0001-5862-6688",,,,,9,0,0,0,8,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,396,403,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000044,0

This paper provides a literature review of earnings management based on five theories that explain the use of earnings management: the signal theory, the agency theory, the positive accounting theory, the threshold theory and the entrenchment theory.","[Mahjoub, Imen] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, Poitiers, France; [Miloudi, Anthony] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, EA 22493, Grp Sup Co la Rochelle, Poitiers, France",Universite de Poitiers; Universite de Poitiers,"Mahjoub, I (通讯作者)，Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, Poitiers, France.",imen.mahjoub@univ-poitiers.fr; miloudia@esc-larochelle.fr,,,,,,,44,1,1,2,25,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,691,703,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600069,0

A feedback effect arises from the insider's trading on fundamental information (the expected growth rate of dividends) and nonfundamental information (insider's inventory or noise supply). We find that the stock price is not fully revealing; a faster mean-reverting noise supply leads to a more volatile price; the price impact can increase with insider's risk-aversion; and a risk-averse insider can trade more aggressively on fundamental information than a risk-neutral one does.

In the context of the built environment, the emphasis is on increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, whereas other building life cycle phases are generally considered less important. However, in recent research it has been suggested that more attention should be given to construction phases, including emissions embodied in materials. They occur in early life cycle stages whereas a large share of use-phase related emissions occur outside the existing climate change mitigation target years, and, due to development in energy sector, might significantly deviate from what is projected today. In this study, by using the life cycle assessment (LCA), we assess the greenhouse gas emissions related to the materials and construction of a low-energy multi-storey residential building in Finland. We depict how the emissions are allocated to the different building systems and look for opportunities to reduce the emissions from this perspective. The novelty of the study arises from two factors: (1) we utilize the wide assessment scope that enables depicting the importance of the boundary decision and (2) not many construction-phase LCA studies of modern low-energy residential buildings exist.

It concerns mainly statistical testing in order to prove dependency between the current place of purchase of honey and the size of municipality, to prove dependency between the size of municipality and the conditions under which the consumer was willing to purchase honey via the Internet, and to prove dependency between the way honey is used and its purchasing on expert recommendation. Strong statistical dependence between the place of purchase and municipality size has been confirmed. Therefore direct sale seems to be the best, e.g at home of beekeepers or their business establishment, at farmer's markets, fairs and so on, mainly in larger towns, because in larger towns these events are more frequented and more popular. These events are also a suitable means of acquiring a stable clientele who would buy honey online. From practice is known, that a cooperation with experts offers a great potential (for example, with general practitioners, beauticians and so on), and this in regard to the recommendation for using honey and the following sale.

We model the pass-through equation in an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) format and the model is estimated using pooled mean group method. Our results reveal that oil price change has its direct effect on domestic inflation in low oil dependency group but its impact is indirect on affecting the domestic inflation in the high oil dependency group through changes on the exporter's production cost. The main determinants of domestic inflation are real exchange rate and exporter's production cost (high oil dependency group) and domestic output and exporter's production cost (low oil dependency group).

The current structure of the population and of the workers in agriculture, fishery and forestry is surveyed by Czech Statistical Office (CZSO) in periodic Census. While, the future population development is a subject of many studies, the research on males and females agricultural gender inequalities still missing. It is due to the obstacles in methodology of projection of particular population group.

The user interface in current editors can appear to a user as unintuitive or having illogical structure of steps to accomplish an advanced task. Usability testing is required in all editor development stages to improve the user experience and usability of the next generation of editors. Expert evaluation and user experience methods were used to choose the optimal methods for testing of the next generation editor used in agricultural online magazines and agricultural web portals.

The purpose of this paper is to identify evaluation aspects for assessing the potential of new uses for cultural heritage places and test the proposed aspects in a case study. The proposed framework serves as a tool for understanding the value of spaces for historic buildings. The paper provides a short introduction to the different aspects typically included in the different types of evaluation. We pursue a broad approach to attain a holistic perspective on evaluating cultural heritage places, including evaluation approaches from facilities and project management as well as architectural and cultural heritage management. Based on the review, we propose a framework that consists of key evaluation aspects. We distinguish among nine primary aspects to assess cultural heritage places: history, architecture, structure, environment, legislation, plans, time, users and economy. The proposed set of aspects is applied to evaluate a pilot case and its potential for new use. Two types of results are presented: the proposed aspects for evaluation of a site and reflections based on their application. The case is Vaernes Hovedgard, a 19th-century manor house located on an air base. The case study illustrates a situation in which a cultural heritage site loses its original function because of a combination of an unfortunate location and physical characteristics. The historic aspect is clearly relevant to this type of site. The building is sound and healthy, and it receives continuous maintenance. This building has direct funding for maintenance but it generates no income and is rarely in use. We discuss different approaches for alternative use, based on the proposed evaluation aspects. These aspects could be applied to evaluating other cultural heritage sites with special focus on the potential for use. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

Analysis shows that the success of the two companies' merger depends upon the establishment of an efficient transnational pork supply chain.

As of interest to resolve this controversy, a research framework is developed in which general competencies act as the mediator between career success and employee performance in accounting offices. The empirical findings from a survey of 84 employees in accounting offices in Central Greece confirmed that general competencies exert a mediating effect on the relationship between career success satisfaction and job performance. The main implication of the findings for accounting managers is that employees in a career advancement environment are more likely to achieve higher job performance and subsequently effectiveness, as a result of strengthened general competencies. Thus, specific directions for managerial action have been derived. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We measure default risk according to Ohlson's (1980) O-score and Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi's (2008) failure probability and further implement Duffle, Saita, and Wang's (2007) doubly-stochastic intensity model to estimate default probabilities that incorporate the dynamics of the changes in covariates. We then employ Campbell and Vuolteenaho's (2004) two-beta model to estimate firms' cash-flow and discount-rate betas according to the default risk The default risk anomaly persists when using Duffle el al.'s (2007) method. We show that cash-flow and discount-rate betas, respectively, earn a high and low premium and find that high-default firms tend to have relatively high discount-rate and low cash-flow betas. Hence, high-default firms deliver low expected returns. Importantly, 25.5% of the default risk anomaly can be explained by the two-beta model and that, on average, also accounts for 49.2% of the cross-sectional variation across the portfolios formed on default risk. This result implies that investors believe that high-default firms are unlikely to generate significantly extra cash flows when market-wide profitable opportunities improve. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To address endogeneity concerns, we perform a difference-in-differences analysis using a setting which causes exogenous decreases in analyst coverage. Our tests identify a negative causal effect of analyst coverage on tax aggressiveness, suggesting that higher analyst coverage constrains corporate tax aggressiveness. Further cross-sectional variation tests find that this constraining effect on tax aggressiveness is more pronounced in firms with lower investor recognition and firms with more opaque information environments. Our results are consistent with the notion that higher analyst coverage increases the visibility of aggressive tax planning behavior as well as heightens analysts' demand for more transparent information, which in turn reduces tax aggressiveness.

The model is solved numerically and calibrated to the US economy. In contrast to previous studies that have analyzed severance payments in the absence of persistent earning losses, we find that the welfare gains from the insurance against job displacement afforded by severance pay are sizable.

Electoral competitiveness, by virtue of threatening the ability of incumbents to maintain informal corruption agreements with criminal networks, is argued to increase crime because of violent competition among criminal groups over future influence. We link elections to maritime piracy, a form of criminal behavior that has increased substantially since the end of the Cold War and for which cross-national, temporally and spatially disaggregated data are available. We argue that electoral competition reinforces piracy because political changes threaten to disrupt collusive agreements between pirates and government authorities. Anticipating a disruption of criminal activity, pirates elevate their attack rates before political changes undermine these agreements. This disruption effect suggests that jurisdictions holding competitive electoral contests should experience more maritime piracy. We test our hypothesis on electoral competitiveness and piracy with subnational data for the 1999 and 2004 elections in Indonesia. Our results show that piracy escalates in proximity to highly competitive electoral districts.","[Daxecker, Ursula E.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Daxecker, Ursula E.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Prins, Brandon C.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Polit Sci, 1001 McClung Tower,1115 Volunteer Blvd, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Prins, Brandon C.] Univ Tennessee, Howard Baker Ctr Publ Policy, 1001 McClung Tower,1115 Volunteer Blvd, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Daxecker, UE (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Daxecker, UE (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Prins, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Polit Sci, 1001 McClung Tower,1115 Volunteer Blvd, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Prins, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Howard Baker Ctr Publ Policy, 1001 McClung Tower,1115 Volunteer Blvd, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",u.daxecker@uva.nl; bprins@utk.edu,,"Daxecker, Ursula/0000-0003-2372-7192",Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-14-1-0050],Office of Naval Research (ONR)(Office of Naval Research),The authors acknowledge funding from Office of Naval Research (ONR Grant No. N00014-14-1-0050).,,52,11,12,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2016,169.0,3-4,,,,,375,393,,10.1007/s11127-016-0374-z,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EA3ML,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386506800012,0

Despite their popularity, a key downside of multiple price lists has not been widely recognized - namely that the approach is unlikely to generate sufficient information to accurately identify different dimensions of risk preferences. The most popular theories of decision making under risk posit that preferences for risk are driven by a combination of two factors: the curvature of the utility function and the extent to which probabilities are weighted non-linearly. In this paper, we show that the widely used multiple price list introduced by Holt and Laury (The American Economic Review 92(5) 1644-1655 2002) is likely more accurate at eliciting the shape of the probability weighting function, and we construct a different multiple price list that is likely more accurate at eliciting the shape of the utility function.

We use this intuition to identify informed demand and document that it exhibits highly significant predictive power over returns (approximately 10% per year).

Hedged by credit derivatives, creditors have stronger bargaining power in the case of debt renegotiation, which ex-ante demotivates the firm to default strategically. In this paper, I aim to investigate theoretically and empirically whether credit derivatives could help reduce the cost of debt contracting stemming from the possibility of strategic default. I find that firms with a priori high strategic default incentives experience a relatively large reduction in their corporate bond spreads after the introduction of credit default swaps (CDS) written on their debt. This result is robust to controlling for the endogeneity of CDS introduction, My finding is consistent with the presence of CDS reducing the strategic default-related cost of corporate debt, suggesting the beneficial role of credit derivatives as a commitment device for the borrower to repay the lender.

For traditional life insurance products, surrender behavior is typically explained by the interest rate and the emergency fund hypotheses. For variable annuities, the interest rate hypothesis is not directly applicable. For these products, we expect the value of the financial options and guarantees provided to the policyholder to drive surrender behavior. We define this expectation as the moneyness hypothesis. The statistical analysis confirms our moneyness hypothesis: the value of the embedded financial options and guarantees has the largest explanatory power for the surrender rate. The extent to which this finding holds depends on the single premium paid, which we consider a proxy for the policyholder's financial literacy. Moreover, our data set weakly supports the emergency fund hypothesis for the case of variable annuities.","[Knoller, Christian; Kraut, Gunther; Schoenmaekers, Pascal] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Risk & Insurance Ctr, Schackstr 4-3, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Knoller, Christian] Allianz SE, Munich, Germany; [Kraut, Gunther; Schoenmaekers, Pascal] Munich Re, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Allianz SE; Munich RE Group,"Knoller, C (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Risk & Insurance Ctr, Schackstr 4-3, D-80539 Munich, Germany.;Knoller, C (通讯作者)，Allianz SE, Munich, Germany.",knoller@bwl.lmu.de; kraut@bwl.lmu.de; pschoenmaekers@munichre.com,,"Kraut, Gunther/0000-0002-5927-9988",Versicherungsforen Leipzig,Versicherungsforen Leipzig,"The authors are members of the Munich Risk and Insurance Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munich, Schackstrasse 4/III, 80539 Munich, Germany.

This paper extends the theoretical debate and methodology on decoupling in transport to cover environmental (e.g. carbon) and social (e.g. fatalities) issues as well as the economic dimensions (e.g. income growth and transport activities). The typology developed here details the concepts of absolute and relative decoupling in a strong and weak version. This typology is then applied to explore the potential and the reality of transport decoupling in 15 major countries over the period since 1990, when concerns over the global environment and social issues have become a central part of the sustainable development agenda, through the measurement of changes in all three of the elements of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social). Two key transport externalities, carbon dioxide emissions and traffic fatalities, are studied, as these represent examples of environmental and social costs associated with increased levels of mobility. These 15 key countries included both developed and developing countries, and they together account for the majority of the global economy, carbon emissions and a substantial proportion of transport fatalities. The results show that decarbonisation of the transport sector has proved more difficult to achieve in the 15 countries over the 22 years than the reduction in the levels of transport-related fatalities. Nevertheless, there is progress beiug made. Decoupling has taken place in both developed and developing countries, though the experiences vary in terms of timing (earlier vs more recent), consistency (stable vs variable), form (absolute vs relative) and magnitude (strong vs weak). Recoupling effects are limited. Transport has proved to be the most difficult sector to make more sustainable, as it is growing so fast and as it is necessary to support economies and lifestyles. Yet through combining measures of economic (e.g. income), environmental (e.g. carbon) and social (e.g. fatalities) wellbeing, it has been possible to identify positive trends in decoupling transport at the national level, as measured through relative decoupling. The much harder objective of an absolute decoupling is only just beginning to take place, but this must be seen as the primary objective in moving towards sustainability in the transport sector.

Explaining the Variation in Demand for Property Titles across Cities in Mexico,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,property rights; housing deed; housing demand; hedonic model; Mexico,LAND; MARKETS; GENDER,"This paper examines the variation in the value of property rights to housing in Mexico, focusing specifically on differences between urban housing markets. Roughly 30% of owner-occupied houses in Mexico do not have a proper deed. Houses with no deed are estimated to be five percent less valuable than otherwise similar houses with a full deed, yet this premium varies widely across cities. I match data from the 2012 and 2014 National Survey of Household Incomes and Expenditures to different sources of city-level data in order to examine hypotheses explaining this variation in a multilevel regression framework. I find that deeds are valued more in cities with more highly educated residents, more political competition, and more voting. Measures of local economic activity, degree of informality, and the regulatory bureaucracy are not associated with higher value to full property rights. Additionally, I find that more educated households value deeds more, and having a deed is more valuable for larger houses in neighborhoods with less vacancy and higher infrastructure quality. Based on these results, I suggest funds to subsidize titling should be redirected to places where titles are worth more. More broadly, I suggest policymakers reconsider framing property-titling programs as poverty alleviation. Low-income households would benefit more from subsidies for improvements to housing and residential infrastructure. At the same time, the federal government should further push to reduce the costs of transferring property. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Three features make this new approach attractive to practitioners. First, the iHMM is capable of capturing the complex nonlinear dynamics of bubble behaviors because it allows for an infinite number of regimes. Second, implementing this procedure is straightforward because bubbles are detected, dated, and estimated simultaneously in a coherent Bayesian framework. Third, because the iHMM assumes hierarchical structures, it is parsimonious and superior in out-of-sample forecasts. This model and extensions of this model are applied to the NASDAQ stock market. The in-sample posterior analysis and out-of-sample predictions find evidence of explosive dynamics during the dot-com bubble period. A model comparison shows that the iHMM is strongly supported by the data compared with finite hidden Markov models.","[Shi, Shuping] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Song, Yong] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Song, Yong] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",Macquarie University; University of Melbourne,"Shi, SP (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;Shi, SP (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",shuping.shi@mq.edu.au,,"Shi, Shuping/0000-0001-8571-3066",,,,,45,17,18,2,89,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

In times with falling housing prices, the mobility of home owning workers may be hampered by a lock-in effect of low or even negative housing equity. This paper explores the effect of housing equity on both the residential mobility and the commuting pattern of homeowners. We merge administrative registers for the Danish population and properties and get highly reliable micro data for our analysis. We find that low and negative housing equity substantially reduces residential mobility among homeowners. The negative effect of locked-in low equity families on labor market mobility may be mitigated by commuting. However, our results show that family heads in low or negative equity homes are not found to commute more than households with higher housing equity, but also that a considerable fraction of home owning family heads commute. The analysis of the joint decision of homeowners to commute or move shows that the option of moving, as an alternative to not moving and not commuting, is chosen by five to six percent of homeowners with low housing equity, while the option of not moving but commuting is chosen by 60%.

Our evidence confirms that only a minority of researchers are aware of the existence of a TTO at their university. TTO awareness is greater among researchers who possess experience as entrepreneurs, closed many research and consulting contracts with industry partners, conduct research in medicine, engineering or life sciences, or occupy postdoctoral positions.

There are different tools for managing this risk, including water market mechanisms and insurance. Given the choice, farmers will opt for the tool that offers the greatest positive change in expected utility. This paper presents a theoretical assessment of farmers' expected utility for two different water option contracts and a drought insurance policy. We analyze the conditions that determine farmers' preferences for these instruments and perform a numerical application to a water-stressed Spanish region. Results show that farmers' willingness to pay for the considered risk management tools are greater than the preliminary estimates of these instruments costs. This suggests that option contracts and insurance may help farmers manage water supply availability risks.","[Rey, Dolores; Garrido, Alberto] Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, 13 ETSI Agronomos,Campos Pract, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Rey, Dolores] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Calatrava, Javier] Univ Politecn Cartagena, ETSIA, Paseo de Alfonso 13 48, Murcia 30203, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Estudios e Investigacion para la Gestion de Riesgos Agrarios Medioambientales CEIGRAM; Cranfield University; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Rey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, 13 ETSI Agronomos,Campos Pract, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.;Rey, D (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",d.reyvicario@cranfield.ac.uk; alberto.garrido@upm.es; j.calatrava@upct.es,"Calatrava, Javier/JXY-9270-2024; Calatrava, Javier/G-3880-2011","Calatrava, Javier/0000-0003-1165-7908; Rey Vicario, Dolores/0000-0002-9024-576X",European project 'Water Markets Scenarios for Southern Europe: new solutions for coping with water scarcity and drought risk?'

Stocks of banks that had previously disclosed a more extensive use of financial derivatives and loan securitization were more likely to experience extreme losses. Our findings are consistent with investors viewing banks that used derivatives for non-hedging purposes as highly vulnerable to the crisis. Moreover, banks which had significant securitization activities and were thus potentially exposed to under-capitalized risks from conduits possess a higher vulnerability of their equity to market downturns.

To explore how rational insurance companies respond to this bias, this paper analyzes a contract design problem in a monopolistic insurance market with ex ante moral hazard. Weconsider two types of consumers with this bias: the naifs, who do not foresee the present bias and make decisions in a myopic way, and the sophisticates, who foresee the bias and incorporate it in the decision process. Relative to the benchmark case where consumers are time-consistent, we show that (i) present bias reduces the monopoly profit, regardless of the consumer type; (ii) present bias can either reduce or increase the coverage of the profit-maximizing insurance contract depending on the extent of the bias; and (iii) when present bias is severe, the insurance company can profitably exploit naifs but not sophisticates. These results still hold when consumers are heterogeneous and their types are unknown to the insurance company.","[Ai, Jing] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, 2404 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Zhao, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Wei] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Insurance & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; University of International Business & Economics","Ai, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, 2404 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jing.ai@hawaii.edu; zhaolin@iss.ac.cn; zhuwei@uibe.edu.cn,"zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023",,"National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301161, 71532013, 71201029, 71373044]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [CXTD5-04]",National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE,Lin Zhao acknowledges financial support from the research Grant of National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Nos. 71301161 and 71532013).

Total NHS expenditure, which has risen in real terms by an average of 3.7 per cent per annum since the inception of the NHS in 1948, constituted 7.9 per cent of GDP in 2012. This paper presents a summary of the trends in medical expenditure in England together with, using detailed administrative data, an analysis of the growth over 15 years of expenditure and activity in hospital inpatient health care, which represents around 20-25 per cent of all NHS expenditure. We document the coincidence of observed trends in expenditure with reported activity, morbidity and the proximity of individuals to death. We find that: (i) expenditure for both elective and emergency inpatient care broadly follows activity, so that expenditure is mostly driven by activity rather than unit costs; (ii) expenditure is concentrated in individuals with multiple diseases, so that the prevalence and identification of complex medical conditions are important drivers of expenditure; and (iii) health care activity rises substantially for individuals in the period before death, so that expenditure is driven substantially by mortality in the population. Taken together, these findings indicate that this element of health care expenditure in England has been substantially driven by the underlying morbidity and age of the population in conjunction with improving health care technology.","[Aragon, Maria Jose; Chalkley, Martin] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Rice, Nigel] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Aragón, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England.",mariajose.aragonaragon@york.ac.uk; martin.chalkley@york.ac.uk; nigel.rice@york.ac.uk,,,Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health from the Economics of Social and Health Care Research Unit (ESHCRU),Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health from the Economics of Social and Health Care Research Unit (ESHCRU),"This paper is an independent report commissioned and funded by the Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health from the Economics of Social and Health Care Research Unit (ESHCRU).

This paper follows international standards in documenting recent trends in Taiwan's medical spending by category, relying on official statistics, Surveys of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) data and administrative reimbursement panel data from the NHI Universal Database (NHIUD). Two findings are noteworthy. First, we find a rapidly widening gap since 1996 between rich and poor in terms of out-of-pocket payments and those by private health insurance; meanwhile, the gap between them in terms of NHI expenditure has remained roughly constant. This trend can be attributed mainly to a positive income gradient in personal health care expenditure among elderly individuals (aged 65 or older). Second, end-of-life hospital spending is large in both magnitude and proportion. Average end-of-life hospital spending is more than 30 times average hospital spending by the total population, and it accounts for 15.9 per cent of total hospital care expenditure (or 5.0 per cent of overall medical spending), even though the population near death accounts for only 0.51 per cent of the overall population. Two-thirds of end-of-life hospital spending is on the elderly, who also constitute two-thirds of the population near death. For both the elderly and working-age adults, the share of end-of-life hospital spending strikingly aligns with the share of deaths.","[Chen, Stacey H.] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Chen, Stacey H.] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Stacey H.] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Chuang, Hongwei] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Hitotsubashi University; Tohoku University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan.;Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.;Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",chens@nber.org; hongwei@econ.tohoku.ac.jp,"CHEN, Stacey/KCL-7182-2024","Chen, Stacey/0000-0001-8534-7166","Academia Sinica [103-H02]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [104-2410-H-001-010-MY2, 105-0210-01-13-03]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The authors thank Eric French, two anonymous referees, Yoko Ibuka, and especially Lifei Huang (Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics), Yih-Shin Hwang (Ministry of Health & Welfare), staff members (Survey Research Data Archive, Academia Sinica) and seminar participants (at the Institute for Fiscal Studies) for their contributions to this manuscript.

We investigate the contribution of air pollution to the procyclicality of deaths by combining county-level data on overall, cause-specific, and age-specific mortality rates with county-level measures of ambient concentrations of three types of pollutants and the unemployment rate. After controlling for demographic variables and state-by-year fixed effects, we find a significant positive correlation between pollution concentrations and mortality rates. Controlling for carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and ozone attenuates the relationship between overall mortality and the unemployment rate by 17%. The findings are robust to the use of state-rather than county-level data and to a variety of alternative specifications, although the attenuation of the unemployment-mortality relationship after controlling for pollution is insubstantial when including county-specific linear trends.","[Heutel, Garth] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Heutel, Garth; Ruhm, Christopher J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ruhm, Christopher J.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Virginia,"Heutel, G (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Heutel, G (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gheutel@gsu.edu; ruhm@virginia.edu,,,University of Virginia Bankard Fund,University of Virginia Bankard Fund,"We thank Andrew Friedson, Matthew Neidell, Nicholas Sanders, and seminar and conference participants at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Appalachian State University, NBER, the 2012 AERE Summer Conference, and the 2013 and 2016 Allied Social Sciences Association meetings for helpful comments, and Kalee Burns, Will Mautz, Stephanie Norris, and James Small for excellent research assistance.

Our model compares the payoffs from uninformed decision-making, solo decision-making, joint voting decision-making, and coordinated decision-making when information about a project's expected return and risk is dispersed in the organization.

This reform eliminated the prefecture city government as the intermediate layer between the province and the county, and was intended largely to improve administrative efficiency and to lessen the fiscal stress of county governments. We apply a difference-in-difference method using a panel data set of 263 cities nationwide over the period of 1999-2011 to examine how the introduction of the PMC fiscal reform affects the economic growth of the cities. Our results show that on average implementing the PMC fiscal reform moderately increases city GDP growth by around 1 percentage point. We argue that this unexpected positive growth effect of the reform is induced by the expansion of land supply of the reformed cities, which in the post-reform period have faced the need to look for revenues outside the budget system, mainly extra-budgetary funds in the form of leasing land. Our analysis provides evidence on this argument, and reveals that the reformed cities tend to expand land leasing at a rate that is 14% higher than the non-reformed cities. Furthermore, we show that the impacts of the reform tend to be strengthened over time following the introduction of the reform. Our results are quite robust to alternative estimation methods.

Specifically, it had imperfect knowledge about the structure of the economy and was subject to data misperceptions.

However, compared to nonfamily firm restatements, restatements announced by family-controlled firms trigger significantly more negative market reactions. We attribute the more negative market reactions to the greater loss in reputation and higher investor scepticism of the credibility of corporate insiders for family firms than for nonfamily firms following restatements.

We show that the grand coalition between the three countries can be stabilised when the most efficient country compensates the other countries. This solution is not feasible when using a single-species model for the cod population; thus, taking into account the multispecies nature of the Baltic Sea fisheries, the scope of cooperation increases compared with a single-species simulation.

Since the predatory relationship between the state and its subjects depends on the power of the state to grab or to appropriate coercively and the subject's ability to escape or hide, the boundaries of the state are decided by the nature of the assets that can be taken more or less easily. Accordingly, I will introduce a new distinction between captive and fugitive assets that positively captures the frontiers of a state space. The US railroading in the nineteenth century provides an illustration regarding the explanatory power of an asset-appropriating perspective of the state compared to a public goods approach.","[Vahabi, Mehrdad] Univ Paris 08, Dept Econ, 69 Rue Haxo,Escalier 10, F-75020 Paris, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Vahabi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, Dept Econ, 69 Rue Haxo,Escalier 10, F-75020 Paris, France.",mehrdad.vahabi@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,92,52,54,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2016,168.0,3-4,,,,,153,175,,10.1007/s11127-016-0354-3,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DZ9BP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386168500001,0

The early-retirement (ER) of nearly 90 GW of capacity and massive new coal power installation in this period significantly altered the pattern of the coal power generation assets. In this paper, it will be shown that the existing structure of coal power installations was built and based on stock, stock efficiency and assumptions on the yearly distribution of early retirement units. With regard to this structure, we measure the effects of large-scale closure on the aggregated age of power generating plants, efficiency and cumulative CO2 emission. It shows that 0.1 billion tons of CO2 reductions can be obtained as a result of this policy for the period 2006-2050, compared to the counter-factual case, i.e. with no ER during 2006-2013. Instead, 1.2 billion more emissions are to occur if coal power additions are completely banned from 2020 as a stringent coal controlpolicy. The substantial difference is fundamentally induced by the slow turnover nature of long-lived power assets and the younger coal plants in the ER case, which would run for a longer time and result in more emissions. It is necessary to take account of how to avoid the new lock-in effects of ER action intended to unlock existing infrastructures in the context of required climate change mitigation. The early phase-out of inefficient equipment is not necessarily a green investment.","[Zhang, Shuwei] Draworld Environm Res Ctr, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuwei] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Energy Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qin, Xuying] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Nucl & New Energy Technol INET, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University,"Qin, XY (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Nucl & New Energy Technol INET, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qinxuying@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Shuwei/0000-0001-5372-6700",,,,,33,5,5,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Financial-economics literature shows that the short-term forward rate is a crucial factor considered by investors in the expectation of central bank returns. Yet, it is unclear if the forward rate, a rather abstract measure, is a sufficient predictor-whether a more concrete variable, such as investors' crisis cycle perceptions, significantly adds explanatory power to the central bank rate expectations. We examine Israeli capital market forecasting of the short-term Central Bank of Israel interest rate, i.e., a 1-to-3-month horizon, during the period 1993-2008. Beyond extracting the forward rate, we create a proxy for crisis business cycle, using local and international capital market performance. This financial setting allows us to examine the Construal Level Theory, where the abstract variable is the forward rate, the concrete variable is the economic crisis, and the construal level is the horizon length. The findings strongly support Construal Level Theory. We show that the expected central bank rate's reliance on the abstract forward rate becomes more aggressive for longer periods. In addition, the significant positive impact of the economy's crisis cycle on the short-horizon expected federal fund diminishes in longer horizons. Hence, there is a forecasting substitution effect between the concrete economy crisis and the abstract forward rate in the psychological distance represented by the investment horizon.","[Akron, Sagi] Univ Haifa, Dept Business Adm, Fac Management, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Akron, S (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Business Adm, Fac Management, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",sagiakron@univ.haifa.ac.il,"Akron, Sagi/P-9341-2019","Akron, Sagi/0000-0002-9887-1634",,,,,16,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

We explicitly take an options market perspective and focus on market participants' changes in beliefs and expectations. During the ban, short positions in banned stocks decreased, whereas they increased for non-banned stocks. Our results indicate that the ban increased implied jump risk levels, thereby negatively impacting the banned financial stocks. However, we also observe that after the announcement of the ban, financial contagion risk actually dropped for banned stocks. Instead of a substitution effect between regular short selling and synthetic shorting through single stock puts, we observe a migration out of single stock puts into the EuroStoxx 50 index options market. We conclude that this type of migration diversified selling pressure initially concentrated in financial stocks across a larger share of the stock market, thereby reducing systemic risks and enhancing overall financial stability.

Our estimate of the mean elasticity of substitution across imports at product level is slightly below four. Counterfactual simulations suggest that RTAs have increased partners' bilateral agricultural and food exports by 30-40 % on average, with marked heterogeneity across agreements. Also, RTAs are found to increase the probability of exporting a given product to a partner country although this impact is small.

Our previous work has shown that decentralization decreases aid effectiveness, i.e., the impact of aid on economic growth is negative in decentralized countries. However, our previous work has not taken different types of aid and different types of decentralization into account, which is at the heart of our current analysis. We consider different measures of decentralization, in particular measures of fiscal decentralization derived from government finance statistics and measures of political decentralization that are constructed based on countries' constitutional rules. In addition, we take different types of aid into account: grants, loans, technical assistance, total net ODA; and we distinguish between multi-lateral and bi-lateral aid in order to consider differences in the donor structure. Our empirical analysis is based on panel data of up to 53 developing countries. In our growth regressions, we combine all types of decentralization with the different types of aid. We find important differences between different types of decentralization: (i) fiscal decentralization negatively affects aid effectiveness (in line with our previous work), (ii) employment decentralization may increase aid effectiveness, and (iii) political decentralization does not hamper aid effectiveness or may even have positive effects.

We implement the most extensive survey of irrigation management ever conducted in Pakistan to examine variation in farmer participation in managing local irrigation systems under the new governance regime. Building on and adding to previous work in Pakistan and elsewhere, we examine the effects of privately accessed groundwater, groundwater quality, surface water, and other factors along 5 different community management responsibilities, including roles that existed prior to decentralization (maintenance of the watercourse and dispute resolution) and new roles that were created after (voting to elect representative at the higher level, collection of water charges, and holding internal meetings). Each responsibility represents a collection action problem for the community. We find that while group leader education is important in successful execution of the roles, voting has in general been taken up enthusiastically while water charge collection remains, not surprisingly, low. We find a previously unreported inverse-U shaped relationship between groundwater availability and farmer participation, and that availability of high groundwater quality (less-saline) groundwater significantly reduces participation, as does high variation in canal water supply within a growing season. We also find, contrary to expectation, that communities in the tail reaches of the system, known to receive worse canal water service, more actively participate in managing their local irrigation systems.

In this study, we investigate whether consumers had better product nutrition knowledge, assigned more importance to healthiness when choosing meals, and chose healthier meals in the stores of a quick-casual restaurant chain that displayed nutrition information on their menus, relative to a control group of stores of the same chain that did not display nutrition information. We find robust evidence for the learning effect: consumers estimated the energy content of meals more accurately in restaurants which displayed nutrition information on menus. However, contrary to prior research findings in the context of fast-food restaurants, we find that consumers overestimated the energy content of meals, and chose healthier meals in quick casual restaurants which did not display nutrition information on menus. Our findings shed a new light on the previous findings by showing that the effect of menu labeling on the healthiness of meals chosen by consumers depends on their prior nutrition beliefs.

For more than two decades, the 1.13 million people it displaced have been rebuilding their livelihoods. To assist, the Chinese government used policy and incentives to stimulate the local economy. Whether the resettlers benefited from such initiatives is not yet understood. This paper offers the first longitudinal analysis of the resettlers' livelihoods. The study follows up with 521 households that participated in a survey in 2003. The initial survey, conducted within five years of their displacement, found that despite improvements to infrastructure and housing, incomes generally declined, livelihoods were dismantled, and permanent employment was replaced by more temporary employment. Resettlers were struggling to meet even their basic needs. However, eight years on from the original survey, this study finds the gains to be substantial. Within the sample groups, income inequality has declined, food is more secure and wellbeing is improved on 2003 levels. What is more, incomes have generally grown and are positively correlated to employment in an enterprise. It appears that the Chinese government's resolve to stimulate the regional economy and to turn the crank on enterprise investment has paid off in this region of the Three Gorges Dam.

The higher voter turnout resulted in higher municipal taxes and greater per capita local public spending.

We construct one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk forecasts by taking into account the different dynamics of the overnight and daytime return processes and their covariance. The covariance is motivated by market microstructure effects such as price staleness and news spillover. Among the competitors we include a simpler bivariate model where the overnight return is redefined by moving the open price further into the trading day, and a univariate model based on the close-to-close return and an overnight-adjusted realized volatility. We illustrate the different approaches using data on the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indices. The evidence in favor of modeling the covariance is more convincing for the latter index because of the lower trading volumes and, relatedly, the less efficient price discovery at market open for small-cap stocks.","[Ahoniemi, Katja] Imperial Coll Business Sch, London, England; [Fuertes, Ana-Maria] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",Imperial College London; City University London; University of Southampton,"Fuertes, AM (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",a.fuertes@city.ac.uk,"Olmo, Jose/Y-7042-2019",,OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Spanish Government [MICINN ECO2011-22650],OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"The first and third authors acknowledge the OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation and the Spanish Government through project MICINN ECO2011-22650, respectively, for financial support.

Unfortunately, the insights gained in these studies are limited because they (i) present conflicting evidence on the time-varying nature of the estimated Hurst coefficients and (ii) incorrectly equate random walk behaviour with market efficiency. In this note, we revisit the issue of time-varying predictability for a rich sample of 21 emerging markets in the 27-year period from 1988 to 2015. Extending the two aforementioned studies by various alternative fractal estimators of the Hurst coefficient, trend regressions and several robustness checks, our analysis reveals significant downward trends in the local Hurst coefficients of almost all markets. Specifically, we document vanishing predictability over time, which indicates that profitable emerging market investment strategies based on past returns may not continue their good performance in the future. Furthermore, we explicitly point out why a random walk is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for rationally determined security prices, and thus signs of predictability (randomness) should not be interpreted as evidence for market inefficiency (efficiency).

By committing to offering price discounts conditional on the purchase of a specific brand of other differentiated good, the homogeneous good suppliers can separate consumers into distinct groups. Such brand-specific discounts help the firms relax competition and attain a collusive outcome. Consumers become worse off due to higher effective prices. Our result shows that in oligopolies it is feasible to leverage other's market power without excluding rivals.","[Hahn, Jong-Hee] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Sang-Hyun] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Kim, Sang-Hyun] Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Yonsei University; University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of East Anglia,"Hahn, JH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",hahnjh@gmail.com; sang-hyun.kim@uea.ac.uk,,"Kim, Sang-Hyun/0000-0001-6171-5382",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5A2A01015901]; Yonsei University Future-Leading Research Initiative [2014-22-0158],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Yonsei University Future-Leading Research Initiative,"We gratefully acknowledge insightful comments and suggestions of an anonymous referee.

We examine depth by studying whether a bank's preference for domestic, as opposed to external, lending (funding) changes when it is subjected to a large public intervention, such as bank nationalization. Our results suggest that, following nationalization, non-British banks allocate their lending away from the UK and increase their external funding. Second, we find that nationalized banks from the same country tend to have portfolios of foreign assets that are spread across countries in a way that is far more similar than those of either private bank from the same country or nationalized banks from different countries, consistent with an impact on the breadth of globalization. Third, we study the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to examine the persistence of the effect of large government interventions. We find weak evidence that upon entry into the TARP, foreign lending declines but domestic does not. This effect is observable at the aggregate level, and seems to disappear upon TARP exit. Collectively, this evidence suggests that large government interventions affect the depth and breadth of banking globalization, but may not persist after public interventions are unwound.

The optimal policy is illustrated in a simple New Keynesian model, where analytical solutions can be derived as well.

This study utilized an economic game (Dictator Game) to test whether androstadienone (AND), an odorous compound derived from testosterone, impacts on altruistic behavior. We predicted that the female participants would act more generously in the AND condition, exhibiting a significant interaction effect between gender and AND on Dictator Game contributions. We also expected that the presence of AND should increase the positive mood of the female participants, compared with a control odor condition and also compared with the mood of the male participants. The results confirm our hypotheses: For women, the subliminal perception of AND led to larger monetary donations, compared with a control odor, and also increased positive mood. These effects were absent or significantly weaker in men. Our findings highlight the capacity of human putative chemosignals to influence emotions and higher cognitive processes-in particular, the processes used in the context of economic decisions-in a gender-specific way.","[Perrotta, Valentina] Autonomous Prov Trento, Dept Knowledge, Trento, Italy; [Graffeo, Michele; Bonini, Nicolao] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Gottfried, Jay A.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Trento; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Graffeo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",michele.graffeo@gmail.com,,"Bonini, Nicolao/0000-0001-8871-0936","Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy; European Union; Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (7th Framework Program People); NIH; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC010014]; Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (Marie Curie Action - COFUND); Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (project PEOCC)","Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy(Autonomous Province of Trento); European Union(European Union (EU)); Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (7th Framework Program People); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (Marie Curie Action - COFUND)(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)); Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (project PEOCC)","Valentina Perrotta gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy.

The performance of the simple rule is excellent and yields only negligible welfare losses compared with the true welfare optimum under a wide range of perturbations including some extreme runs designed to severely road test the rule.

Initially, the empirical analysis, based on the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a large nationally representative panel survey, aims to ascertain the impact of the household's monetary financial position on overall life satisfaction and financial well-being, with the latter being measured by financial satisfaction and subjective prosperity. The empirical analysis confirms that the household's level of net wealth, assets and debt are important determinants of overall life satisfaction and financial well-being. The paper goes on to explore whether the financial situation of households in a comparison group influences an individual's overall life satisfaction and financial well-being. The results suggest that the financial position of households in the comparison group is an important determinant of an individual's level of overall life satisfaction and financial well-being, with information effects generally dominating comparison effects. In addition, the effects of the comparison group are asymmetric depending on whether a household's financial position is above or below the average of the reference group. (c) 2016 The Authors.

We use a multi-period overlapping generation model with a pay-as-you-go pension pillar, a funded pension pillar and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public debt and variations in the indexation of pension entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The best-performing pension arrangement is a hybrid funded scheme in which both contributions and entitlement indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation instruments. We find that contribution and indexation adjustment policies are substitutes and the same is the case for contribution and tax adjustment policies. By contrast, indexation and tax adjustment policies are complements. We compare different taxation regimes and conclude that a regime in which pension benefits are taxed, while contributions are paid before taxes, is preferred to a regime in which contributions are paid after taxes, but benefits are untaxed.","[Chen, Damiaan H.

Additionally, reputational consequences depend significantly on the nature of the allegation and lawsuit merit.

We find a robust negative relation between governance institutions and external indebtedness in East & Horn of Africa, Central Africa and Southern Africa; and unclear relationships in North and West Africa regions. Importantly, these baseline results are robust to the consideration of debt write-offs, natural resource rents, and endogeneity. Further, we find that geographic, economic and cultural factors of proximity, intra-regional activity, shared official language, legal origin and dominant religion, largely explain the commonality of Africa's regional blocs of countries. These and other results of the study can support potential external debt management strategy that leverages effective governance institutions and enhanced regional economic integration.

Using segment-level capital allocation in multisegment firms (conglomerates) as a laboratory, we show that capital expenditure is increasing in the expected skewness of segment returns. Conglomerates invest more in high-skewness segments than matched stand-alone firms, and trade at a discount, which indicates overinvestment that is detrimental to shareholder wealth. Using geographical variation in gambling norms, we find that the skewness-investment relation is particularly pronounced when CEOs are likely to find long shots attractive.

Then participants have to report their satisfaction level after being informed of their own endowment and of their opponent's endowment. Finally participants can choose, or not, to reduce their opponent's endowment incurring a personal cost. We observe: (1) most people report to experience negative interdependent preferences by learning others' higher endowments; (2) although destructive decisions are predominantly undertaken by participants expressing negative interdependent preferences, such preferences fail at predicting decisions to reduce income; (3) absolute difference between participants' endowments affects individuals' satisfaction whereas relative difference modulates participants' decisions to reduce others' income.","[Celse, Jeremy] Grp ESC Dijon Bourgogne, 29 Rue Sambin, F-21000 Dijon, France",,"Celse, J (通讯作者)，Grp ESC Dijon Bourgogne, 29 Rue Sambin, F-21000 Dijon, France.",jeremy.celse@escdijon.eu,,"CELSE, Jeremy/0000-0002-0266-5140",regional council of the Reunion's island; program CONFLICT [ANR-08-JCJC-0105-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0105] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),regional council of the Reunion's island; program CONFLICT; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The author thanks Dimitri Dubois for programming the software and for his numerous advices.

The results of our analysis suggest that, relative to published statistics on pre-tax net worth, the distribution of after-tax wealth is slightly less concentrated in the early years of our sample period, but the effectiveness of the income tax system in reducing wealth inequality has decreased during the last decade. We find the reduction in the long-term capital gains rate is the primary reason for the muted effectiveness of the current income tax system in reducing wealth inequality.","[Looney, Adam] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Moore, Kevin B.] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Brookings Institution; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Moore, KB (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",kevin.b.moore@frb.gov,,"Looney, Adam/0000-0002-9628-5789",,,,,32,5,6,3,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We show that including taxes into the valuation closes this gap between theory and practice. In particular, we develop a subjective risk-neutral valuation methodology that takes into consideration differences in the tax structure between investment opportunities. We demonstrate that accounting for tax advantages significantly affects the value of the guarantees and produces results that are in line with empirical patterns.","[Moenig, Thorsten] Univ St Thomas, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Bauer, Daniel] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University of St Thomas Minnesota; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Moenig, T (通讯作者)，Univ St Thomas, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",,"Moenig, Thorsten/R-9821-2019","Bauer, Daniel/0000-0001-6425-3769",Society of Actuaries under a CAE research grant,Society of Actuaries under a CAE research grant,"We are thankful for helpful comments from participants at the 2012 ARIA Annual Meeting; the 47th Actuarial Research Conference; the 12th Symposium on Finance, Banking, and Insurance; the 2013 ASSA Meetings; the 2013 PARTY; the 2014 International Congress of Actuaries; the 2014 SIAM FM Conference; as well as from seminar participants at Georgia State University, Ulm University, the University of Manitoba, Manhattan College, the University of St. Thomas, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Minnesota.

Nor is it correct to say that Japan intends to expand renewable energy to such an extent that it becomes Japan's primary energy source. Japan has been facing two problems. The first is the destabilization of the energy market caused by the Fukushima nuclear power crisis and electricity market reform. The other is the destabilization of energy policy caused by the discrepancy between people's perception of electricity market reform in Japan and the structure of Japan's energy sector. The discrepancy means that the Japanese government has had an overly optimistic view on the crisis, believing that the rise in energy prices and energy market reform or supply shock were not serious problems for people's lives, and that the public could handle these problems. In addition, this discrepancy arose as a consequence of Japan's incomplete energy market liberalization which began in the 1980s, and also due to political factors under the administration of the Democratic Party of Japan. Currently, Japan's energy policy is discussed more logically and calmly because this discrepancy has been progressively eliminated. In fact, the Sendai nuclear power plant-owned by Kyushu Electric Power Co. restarted operation on August 11th 2015.","[Nishimura, Kiyoshi] Kansai Elect Power Co Inc, Mkt, Tokyo, Japan","Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc","Nishimura, K (通讯作者)，Kansai Elect Power Co Inc, Mkt, Tokyo, Japan.",nishimura.kiyoshi@e2.kepco.co.jp,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,25,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

This is the market impact discount in value yielded by the immediate sale of the portfolio relative to its in-hand market value calculated from prevailing market prices. For any portfolio, the day-to-day liquidation discount at risk (i.e., the liquidation discount that would be suffered if liquidation were undertaken) is variable. This liquidation discount risk is additional to price risk and will be of concern to portfolio managers that may, at short notice, wish to convert substantial stockholdings to cash. We obtain daily time series of instantaneous log liquidation discount for variously sized portfolios of Australian stocks and determine that these time series are best modeled with an Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARFIMA-GARCH) process. We then formulate a liquidation discount-at-risk measure with which portfolio managers can budget for the future cost of portfolio liquidity for a chosen liquidation horizon and confidence level.

Zones established later tend only to have effects where counties already had an export-advantageous position.

However conditions have changed since the well-documented successes of the 1960s and 1970s benefitted smallholders in southern Asia and beyond. We argue that under contemporary constraints the mechanisms for achieving improvements in the lives of smallholder farmers through such policies are unclear and that both policy rationale and means of governing agricultural innovation are crucial for pro-poor impacts. To critically analyze Rwanda's Green Revolution policies and impacts from a local perspective, a mixed methods, multidimensional wellbeing approach is applied in rural areas in mountainous western Rwanda. Here Malthusian policy framing has been used to justify imposed rather than induced innovation. The policies involve a substantial transformation for rural farmers from a traditional polyculture system supporting subsistence and local trade to the adoption of modern seed varieties, inputs, and credit in order to specialize in marketable crops and achieve increased production and income. Although policies have been deemed successful in raising yields and conventionally measured poverty rates have fallen over the same period, such trends were found to be quite incongruous with local experiences. Disaggregated results reveal that only a relatively wealthy minority were able to adhere to the enforced modernization and policies appear to be exacerbating landlessness and inequality for poorer rural inhabitants. Negative impacts were evident for the majority of households as subsistence practices were disrupted, poverty exacerbated, local systems of knowledge, trade, and labor were impaired, and land tenure security and autonomy were curtailed. In order to mitigate the effects we recommend that inventive pro-poor forms of tenure and cooperation (none of which preclude improvements to input availability, market linkages, and infrastructure) may provide positive outcomes for rural people, and importantly in Rwanda, for those who have become landless in recent years. We conclude that policies promoting a Green Revolution in Sub-Saharan Africa should not all be considered to be pro-poor or even to be of a similar type, but rather should be the subject of rigorous impact assessment. Such assessment should be based not only on consistent, objective indicators but pay attention to localized impacts on land tenure, agricultural practices, and the wellbeing of socially differentiated people.

We find evidence that foreign acquisitions change the Chinese target firms' probability of exporting to a third market. Technology transfer is not observed.

Child miners - or half shovels as they are locally known - are both directly and indirectly involved in small-scale gold extraction in Kono District, Sierra Leone's main diamond-producing area. But the implications of their involvement are often far more nuanced and complex than international children's rights advocates understand them to be. Drawing upon recent fieldwork carried out in and around the Kono mining village of Bandafayie, the article argues that children's participation in the rural economy not only generates much-needed household income, but in many cases is the only way in which they can earn the monies needed to attend school. A blind and uncritical acceptance of international codes and agreements on child labor could have an adverse impact on children and, by extension, poor communities in rural Sierra Leone. Western notions of progress and development, as encapsulated in the post-conflict reconstruction programing of international NGOs and donor organizations, often do not match up with the complex realities or competing visions of local people.

However, our knowledge of subjective well-being among the self-employed, the differences between various groups of self-employed and the potential influence of contextual factors is somewhat limited. The purpose of the present paper is to address this gap by taking macroeconomic conditions, gender and immigrant status into consideration. The results show that self-employment is positively related to subjective well-being, but there are also differences between groups of the self-employed; self-employed with employees report a higher level of life satisfaction than the self-employed without employees. Economic growth is more important for the level of life satisfaction among the self-employed than among employees. The analyses also point to different patterns for female and male self-employed without employees: only women experience a higher level of life satisfaction compared to employees. The results also show that the relationship is stronger among immigrants than natives.

There is a rich, though not very mature, body of literature on this topic which is largely application-driven. The focus in the literature is generally on methods and concept and/or on applications. Applications generally focus on ex ante or ex post evaluations of the implications for accessibility of (candidate) policy plans. An important question is which are the main challenges in the area of accessibility research? This paper aims to examine this question and provide a research agenda for the coming one or two decades or so. The focus is on putting relatively new topics on the agenda, rather than making suggestions for improvements of given accessibility indicators. The paper does not aim to provide a complete list, but rather proposes avenues for future research focusing on (1) indicators to express accessibility, and (2) evaluation. In the area of indicators the challenges include the impact of ICT on accessibility; the inclusion of the robustness of the transport system in indicators; comparing perceptions of accessibility and traditional accessibility indicators; the option value; and the indicators of accessibility for goods transport, air transport, and slow modes. In the area of evaluation the paper discusses the pros and cons of the logsum as an accessibility measure, ethical aspects, comparisons of accessibility indicators to evaluate a specific case, and the needs of the clients of accessibility research.

The paper addresses this question both theoretically and empirically. In the theoretical model, growth results from innovations that allow local sectors to catch up with frontier technology. In poor countries, catching up requires the cooperation of a foreign investor who is familiar with the frontier technology and a domestic entrepreneur who is familiar with local conditions. In such a country, domestic savings matters for innovation, and therefore growth, because it enables the local entrepreneur to put equity into this cooperative venture, which mitigates an agency problem that would otherwise deter the foreign investor from participating. In rich countries, domestic entrepreneurs are already familiar with frontier technology and therefore do not need to attract foreign investment to innovate, so domestic savings does not matter for growth. A cross-country regression shows that lagged savings is positively associated with productivity growth in poor countries but not in rich countries.","[Aghion, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Aghion, Philippe] Econometr Soc, Chicago, IL USA; [Aghion, Philippe] Amer Acad Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA USA; [Howitt, Peter] Brown Univ, Social Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Tecu, Isabel] Charles River Associates Inc, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Brown University; Charles River Associates,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,26,38,44,6,19,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The expected result of smart development is the increase of living standards and quality of life. Each country's sustainable development is determined by public, businesses and public institutions. The paper introduces the analysis which aims to estimate the changes in economic transformation and inequality changes in Bulgaria, Lithuania and the European Union Member States (EU-28) in the year 2005-2015. The country's economic development and poverty reduction is closely related to education, including higher education. The EU-28 is involved into the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), including Lithuania and Bulgaria. Therefore the main aim of the paper is to make a comparative analysis of Bulgaria's and Lithuania's economic development situation in the context of these changes. Higher education, as the most important socioeconomic variable, diminishes economic inequality, increases incomes and reduces economic inequality. If the education level was lower, the economic situation in the country would be worse; the inequity would be more significant. Education determines the individual position of each person in the labour market, his income level, quality of life and its values. The analysis showed that higher education can make a significant influence both to Lithuanian and Bulgarian smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth and to human capital development. Methodology/methods The methods of research: analysis of scientific literature, statistical classification and comparison, logical comparative analysis and synthesis. For the analysis, data from Bulgarian and Lithuanian Departments of Statistics, World Bank Data, and EUROSTAT databases for the year 2005-2015 are used. Both absolute and relative amounts are compared. The method of base indicators comparison is applied, whereas the first year (e.g., year 2005) of the analyzed period is chosen as base year. The intenseness causes and the changes of the economic inequality level in countries are evaluated. Scientific aim The aim of the study: to analyze the inequality, its reasons and relation with higher education in Bulgaria and Lithuania. Therefore the objectives of the paper are: to make the analysis of the changes of main macroeconomic indicators, the changes of economic inequality (income inequality, labour market inequality, Gini coefficient, risk-of-poverty rate or social exclusion) and the role of higher education in the country's economy. Findings The analysis showed that higher education can make a significant influence both to Lithuanian and Bulgarian smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth and to human capital development. Conclusions Research shows different effects and the changes of economic indicators in Bulgaria and Lithuania, but in each country the global crisis reduced aggregate demand and demand for labour force, due to this the unemployment level has increased. The growth of unemployment causes the growth of discomfort index and increase of Gini index, which shows unequal distribution of income.","[Ciburiene, Jadvyga] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino Str 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania; D Tsenov Acad Econ, 2Em Chakarov Str, Svishtov 5250, Bulgaria",Kaunas University of Technology; Tsenov Academy of Economics,"Ciburiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino Str 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jadvyga.ciburiene@ktu.lt,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405",,,,,9,0,0,0,8,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,267,272,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200032,0

Focussing on one form of institutional changes, namely pro-market reforms, the paper analyzes how firms may boost the potential benefits from such changes through international strategies that increase their access to knowledge spillovers and absorptive capacity. These strategies include international product diversification, enhancing innovation capabilities, informal institutional exposure, accumulated internationalization knowledge, and overall experiential knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested using generalized least squares models with AR(1) panel-specific autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity correction. Based on the preliminary analyses performed in these studies, the author also executes a Hausman test, Bartlett's test, and James/Alexander's test. The results of these analyses indicate that the use of random effects is appropriate; that moderating effects are present; and that multivariate analyses using these moderators are suitable, respectively. Findings - The results indicate that pro-market reforms have a positive and significant effect on the profitability of firms from developing countries. Furthermore, they provide support for the positive moderating effects of international product diversification, innovation capabilities, informal institutional exposure, accumulated internationalization knowledge, and overall experiential knowledge. Together, these findings suggest that through their international strategic decisions, MNEs can enhance their access to knowledge and become more responsive to institutional changes in their home market. Research limitations/implications - This paper contributes to the economic geography literature by linking the POST Model with the classification of types of knowledge from Learning Theory. The paper analyzes how characteristics of place, organization, space, and time play a different role for each of the three basic types of knowledge that is relevant for international firms: institutional, business, and internationalization. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the literature on reforms and firm profitability by delving deeper into the moderating effect of strategic decisions on the relationship between reforms and firm performance. This allows us to have a deeper comprehension of how various sources of international learning may enhance the responsiveness of firms to institutional changes. Originality/value - The paper provides several important contributions to the international strategy literature. First, it contributes to Learning Theory by combining it with the POST Model of Economic Geography to study how each of the three sources of knowledge (and their subcomponents) can be further broken down into factors of place, organization, space, and time. Second, it contributes to the literature of institutional change by studying how knowledge acquired through vastly different means can provide firms with sources of competitive advantage over other local competitors when responding to institutional changes in their home market. Third, it contributes to the literature on reforms and profitability by studying five novel moderators of this relationship.","[Dau, Luis Alfonso] Northeastern Univ, Int Business & Strategy Grp, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Dau, LA (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Int Business & Strategy Grp, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",l.dau@neu.edu,"Dau, Luis/GNP-7889-2022; Dau, Luis/K-9746-2013","Newburry, William/0000-0002-6916-6952; Dau, Luis/0000-0001-7369-2544",,,,,105,19,19,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The Currency Composition of International Reserves in the Long Run,IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DOLLAR; EURO,"The paper analyzes how the role of different national currencies as international reserves was affected by the shift from fixed to flexible exchange rates. It extends data on the currency composition of foreign reserves backward and forward to investigate whether there was a shift in the determinants of the currency composition of international reserves around the breakdown of Bretton Woods. It finds that inertia and policy-credibility effects in international reserve currency choice have become stronger post-Bretton Woods, while network effects appear to have weakened. The paper shows that negative policy interventions designed to discourage international use of a currency have been more effective than positive interventions to encourage its use. These findings speak to the prospects of currencies like the euro and the renminbi seeking to acquire international reserve status and others like the U.S. dollar seeking to preserve it.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] Amer Acad Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA USA; [Chitu, Livia; Mehl, Arnaud] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); European Central Bank,"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Eichengreen, Barry/0000-0002-1683-4486",,,,,70,18,18,1,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

By employing data for 1992-2014, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between growth and productivity and how it interacts with ownership. Design/methodology/approach - The longitudinal nature of the data suggests that the appropriate technique for the analysis is panel data econometrics. Accordingly, consistent with prior research, the author employs a fixed effects model. Besides accounting for firm-level observables, the author controls the economic environment and bank ownership by employing real GDP growth and ownership dummies. Findings - The evidence appears to suggest that growth improves through both active and passive learning, the magnitude of the former far outweighing that of the latter. These results are remarkably robust: both baseline regressions and sensitivity tests point to similar conclusions. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, the paper makes two original contributions. First and more broadly, it tests the relationship between growth and productivity for banks in a leading emerging economy. Second, it distinguishes between two kinds of learning - active and passive - and explores which of them are more relevant for growth.","[Ghosh, Saibal] Reserve Bank India, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Reserve Bank of India,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank India, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",saibalghosh@rbi.org.in,"Ghosh, Saibal/M-2476-2019","Ghosh, Saibal/0000-0002-8741-6951",,,,,90,12,13,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

For stocks in the short legs, future returns are systematically related to the information signal contained in preceding insider trading activity, indicating underreaction. For insider trading information, we consider the possibility of net buying, net selling, and no trading (or silence). The underreaction effect is economically significant, with the most negative signal accounting for an average of 71% of short-leg returns.

This paper identifies three structural shocks that impact on the oil market and analyzes their effect on exchange rates in 43 advanced and emerging countries. It finds that oil-exporting countries tend to experience appreciation pressures after oil shocks, especially oil demand shocks, which are largely offset by foreign exchange reserves accumulation. A main theoretical prediction of most general equilibrium models, namely that shocks leading to increases in oil prices are associated with a real appreciation of oil exporters, is not supported by the paper's results, as oil producers either peg their exchange rate or accumulate foreign exchange reserves in the wake of these shocks, even when they have floating currencies.","[Habib, Maurizio Michael] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Buetzer, Sascha] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Stracca, Livio] European Cent Bank, Int Policy Anal Div, Directorate Gen Int & European Relat, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Deutsche Bank; European Central Bank,"Habib, MM (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,"Buetzer, Sascha/0000-0002-9255-6385",,,,,44,60,64,1,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This article utilised data from a survey of 223 small farming households in the Eastern Cape province, one of the poorest agrarian provinces in South Africa, to explore the exposure of smallholder farmers to climate change, their adaptive capacity and their vulnerability to climate shock across major agro-ecological zones. Data on the production of main staple foods, household assets and access to institutional facilities were analysed by means of principal component analysis. General circulation model scenarios were used with a crop model (EPIC) to explore the impact of future plausible climate patterns on farmers' income. Farmers in the Karoo zone are currently the most vulnerable to climate variability. A scenario analysis also showed that maize production in the Eastern Cape will be positively affected by climate change under both low-input and irrigated management systems, whereas potato yield will decrease. It is projected that smallholder farmers who significantly rely on maize can expect an increase of up to 45 per cent revenue by 2050 under the UKMO-HADGEM1 climate scenario if the average estimated future yields materialise. Both institutional and infrastructural support in the form of access to credit and irrigation facilities are recommended for adequate adaptation to future climate change impact, in particular climate volatility, which was not taken into account in our yield projections.","[Hosu, Sunday Y.; Luswazi, P.

This paper investigates whether the Dutch pension adequacy is still high when we take into account the resources that people really accumulate, using a large administrative data set. A comprehensive approach is followed: not only public and private pension rights, but also private savings and housing wealth are taken into account. Summed over all age- and socioeconomic groups we find a median gross replacement rate of 83% and a net replacement rate of 101%. At retirement age, 31% of all households face a gross replacement rate that is lower than 70% of current income. Public and occupational pensions each account for more than 35% of total pension annuities. Private non-housing assets account for 14% and imputed rental income from net housing wealth accounts for about 10%. Some vulnerable groups, such as the self-employed, have below average replacement rates. Results are fairly similar to results found in the UK, indicating that we should be careful in evaluating the adequacy of pensions systems on the basis of fictitious replacement rates.","[Knoef, Marike; Been, Jim; Caminada, Koen; Goudswaard, Kees] Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands; [Knoef, Marike; Been, Jim; Caminada, Koen; Goudswaard, Kees] Netspar, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands; [Alessie, Rob] Univ Groningen, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Alessie, Rob] Netspar, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Netspar, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; University of Groningen; Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Knoef, M (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands.",m.g.knoef@law.leidenuniv.nl,,"Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753; Knoef, Marike/0000-0003-4134-4961",Netspar; Instituut Gak,Netspar; Instituut Gak,"This project is a part of an international comparative study regarding Retirement Savings Adequacy organized by the OECD.

We measure VRP by distinguishing the investment horizon from the variance swap's maturity. We extract VRP from actual S&P 500 variance swap quotes and we test four classes of predictive models. We find that the best performing model is the one that conditions on trading activity. This relation is also economically significant.

Moreover, in the China the development speed of large-scale public buildings is very fast, the annual increase is more than 50 million square meters, so the energy consumption of large public buildings will become a major growth point in the future energy consumption in many city.

Ways in which these companies operate in the market will affect their performance. One of the most important stages of this process is the distribution channel and distributors, find it necessary to evaluate their performance. The paper starts with the importance of distribution channels. Decisions about the structure of the distribution channel are important in at least two dimensions. First, the decision has a direct effect on pricing policy, advertising, packaging, etc. Second, decisions regarding distribution channels require a long-term commitment. It takes several years to be deploying a desired distribution system and can't be changed easily. Distribution means delivering the product to the consumer at the right time and place. Thus, a company must decide the number of distributors needed on each channel while using different distribution strategies. Distribution channels always include the manufacturer and the final consumer, the main duty of distribution system that places goods to a potential customer is to be at the right time and place. Thus, an evaluation of the performance of distributors is done considering both the manufactures performance and consumers benefits. In this study, two kinds of distributors are considered, exclusive distributor, ED and nonexclusive distributors, NED. The focus of the paper is an Elevator Installation & Service Industry in Albania while looking at three significant elements of the distributors: rationalization, communication, and perceived performance. The paper was qualitative and empirical data were collected through questionnaire and in-depth interview. SPSS was used in analyzing the data gathered from the sample (13 respondents from 22). The study revealed that even though ED agreements are characterized by an asymmetric power structure, data shows that producers and ED tend to have with each other a more stable and closer relationship compared to NED. In addition, the positive result of evaluation performance and commitment of ED is higher than NED. Their commitment is seen in the form of investments in the exclusive distribution channel. This commitment motivates producers to consider ED.","[Manxhari, Mimoza] Univ Tirana, 183 Sq Mother Teresa, Tirana, Albania; [Hasanaj, Rezarta] Univ Vlora Ismail Qemali, L Pavaresia 9400, Vlore, Albania",University of Tirana (UT),"Manxhari, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tirana, 183 Sq Mother Teresa, Tirana, Albania.",mmanxhari@yahoo.com; rezarta.hasanaj@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,778,787,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300064,0

Even though notable progress has been achieved towards more market-oriented aviation policies, at the pan-African level some markets are still restrictive and inconsistent with the YD, particularly with respect to the granting of 5th freedom rights. This paper aims to examine recent developments in the aviation sector in Africa, with a focus on the implementation of the YD. The obstacles to liberalisation are discussed and several measures for facilitating Africa's move towards multilateral open skies are investigated. These include, among others, a greater collaboration and co-operation among African airlines, as well as between African airlines and foreign ones; redefinition of the role and responsibilities of different institutions which are instrumental in implementing the YD and some further issues such as ownership guidelines.

In particular, it asks how a fiscal equalization scheme affects the tax cooperation condition. It shows that when the scale of fiscal equalization scheme increases, capital exporter is more (and capital importer is less) cooperative in implementing tax coordination. The paper also demonstrates that the best cooperative tax rate-the one that provides the strongest potential for voluntary cooperation-takes a positive value and increases with the scale of fiscal equalization.

We present a calibrated OLG model which quantifies how much of these four trends can be explained with a fifth-the widespread fall in the relative price of investment goods. Relative to other explanations for low real interest rates, this trend is important because it can also account for the fall in nominal investment rates. The model can reproduce a small but economically significant part of the observed fall in interest rates and rises in house prices and household debt, and a larger part of the fall in the investment rate.","[Sajedi, Rana; Thwaites, Gregory] Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England",Bank of England,"Thwaites, G (通讯作者)，Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",rana.sajedi@bankofengland.co.uk; gregory.thwaites@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,24,9,10,0,5,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

The formalisation of property rights in Tanzania is being undertaken by a multiplicity of actors at great expense to donors, individuals and the government. While there have been a variety of different justifications for allocating Certificates of Customary Rights of Occupancy (CCROs) to farmers in Tanzania, perhaps the most prominent argument is that it will enable farmers to finally overcome the divide between informal' customary rights and the formal banking sector. CCROs would provide the collateral that would induce banks to lend money to small-scale farmers.

Banks examines several criteria while giving the credit. The problems which are met to pay the credits lead to the banks to face with the serious risks. So, the banks implement the risk management effectively. Credit risk is most elementarily identified as the potential that a bank debtor will fail to meet its indispensability in compliance with agreed conditions. The banks which implement the risk management effectively evaluate their risks down to the last detail. The banks need to use the foreign funds efficiency, since banking activities are determined in accordance with foreign funds. The banks give credits to their customers in order to obtain the funds. The banks also undertake the risk while giving the credit. Credit risk is nearly related to the potential return of an investment. The conducted studies revealed that the most important risk for the banks is credit risk. Many techniques are used in the measurement of credit risk. Thus, the banks statistically tend to measure the credit outcomes. In this study, the factors which affecting credit risk in banking are evaluated. Analytical Hierarchy Proses which is one of multiple criteria decision making techniques were applied while assessing these criteria. Accordingly factors were compared by paired comparison. The weight of each criteria were determined as a result of comparisons. The consistency ratio was calculated whether comparisons were consistent or not. At the end of the study, the weight of the factors affecting the credit risk was found. Thus, the factors which must be focussed on clearly demonstrated while managing most significant risk of banking. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Scientific aim is to disclose the evolution of the design concept and to reveal how the understanding has changed in the course of time. Study based on the opinion of researchers and practitioners worldwide who have recognized the importance of structured, scientifically-based, and industrially-tested theories and methods for product (and process) design and development. Design and innovation can mean the processes which are followed to produce some output. Common features of innovation and design are: generation of new knowledge, and selection/use of existing knowledge. Research in engineering design concerns the interplay between the design process and the design object. Technology like a catch-ball is used to describe objects and the networks, systems and infrastructures in which they are embedded. An invention will become part of current technology; invariably a further engineering, effort is required to bring a concept to usable reality as case study after case study reveals. Findings relates to an understanding of the design concept which is different in several countries. The understanding of the design concept in Latvia focuses on various elements like art, fashion, apartment furnishings. Conclusions are based on the results of the research which may lead to further investigation of design concept understanding in different countries.

One of the advantages of applying ICT in e-recruitment is broadening the scope of information used to improve the organization's image. Activities from the scope of Corporate Social Responsibilities are usually recommended as a tool for improving employer brands, as it is commonly accepted that young professionals are responsive to the organization's involvement in these fields. Although discussions about if and why companies should be active in CSR are still inconclusive in the sciences, management scientists clearly state that CSR improves an organization's employer brand and informing about CSR is beneficial for its recruitment process. Although informing about company CSR activities is in vogue in the Polish media and popular branch reports, some research suggests that entrepreneurial involvement in CSR in Poland is superficial and much lower than popular opinion holds. The article proves that e-recruitment tools, and CSR information, in particular, are less widely used by big organizations than the public believes, and that information concerning CSR activities improves organizational employer brand. Two types of data are used for this: the results of an e-survey concerning the perception of company attractiveness as an employer based on its CSR activities (a sample of 1054 young Polish professionals and students), and direct observation of 300 websites of the biggest Polish enterprises. Less than 30% of the biggest companies publish information about their CSR activities on their websites, while for about 2/3 of potential candidates, such information would attract them to submit their application to this potential employer (ceteris paribus). The importance and implication of CSR involvement for general theory and for understanding the scope in which CSR and ICT and HRM tools are used in Poland are discussed.","[Wozniak, Jacek; Wolodzko, Kinga] Univ Finance & Management, 55 Pawia St, Warsaw, Poland",University of Finance & Management Warsaw,"Wozniak, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Management, 55 Pawia St, Warsaw, Poland.",jkwozniak@tlen.pl; kinga-wolodzko@wp.pl,"Woźniak, Jacek/M-7001-2018","Woźniak, Jacek/0000-0003-4610-2822",,,,,23,1,1,1,16,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,873,883,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300072,0

First, the author took into consideration the theories which are connected with surveyed matters, following by the characteristic and causes of state receivables development for the period of 1991 to 2014.

This capital reallocation allowed chaebol firms with greater investment opportunities to invest more than control firms after the crisis. These firms also showed higher profitability and lower declines in valuation than control firms following the crisis.

We investigate whether there is an optimal business model along three business dimensions assets, funding and income and which business model is optimal for foreign banks in a financial center. We apply recently developed non-parametric methods with bootstrap to estimate group efficiency, to test for differences across groups and finally to analyze the link between bank efficiency and diversification measures. Using Luxembourg bank data that include the financial crisis, we find that there is no unique business model. The most efficient business model appears to be a focused asset, funding and income strategy. Banks' organizational forms play a role; branches may be preferable to subsidiaries prior to the financial crisis, whereas bank subsidiaries perform better than branches during the financial crisis. However, branches diversified in assets, funding and income exploit efficiency advantages during the financial crisis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Being one of the most significant outlays in a household balance, housing costs may indeed cause households to reduce non-housing expenditure such as health care, education, food, and clothing, thus creating serious household economic hardship. Using microdata from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions dataset (EU-SILC) regarding five European countries (Italy, Germany, UK, Spain, and France) we have examined the predictive power of housing costs in explaining family economic hardship. Furthermore, we have jointly estimated the effect of the housing cost burden upon economic hardship for renters versus homeowners paying mortgages. Results showed that housing costs represent a non negligible burden in all the five European countries. Moreover, home ownership was found to significantly reduce household hardship status.","[Deidda, Manuela] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Viale S Ignazio Laconi 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Deidda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Viale S Ignazio Laconi 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",manuela.deidda@unica.it,,"Deidda, Manuela/0000-0002-0921-6970",,,,,63,29,31,1,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Specifically, we used data over two decades from the Basic Surveys on Wage Structure to apply pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effect estimation to three indexes on gender equality and another three indexes of internal labor markets. We found that establishments with ILMs have significantly high gender inequality in their workplaces. That is, establishments with the lifetime employment system, the seniority wage systems, or the internal promotion system are likely to have large gender wage gaps, employ less female full-time workers, and have less female managers. However, these negative associations become much smaller or even disappear when we apply a fixed effect model using quasi-panel data. The erosion of ILMs may not be an important driving force of gender equalization, and establishments that have improved gender equality may not necessarily have moved away from ILMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the five years that followed a cease fire agreement in 2006 nearly all the displaced persons returned home. The difference in the growth of consumption between returnee households and a comparison group of non-displaced households is estimated using propensity score matching. After an initial shock to consumption and assets upon return, returnee households experience a period of catch-up growth. These results contribute to understanding the dynamics of recovery from displacement and have implications for the policy response during recovery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The disposition effect describes the phenomenon that investors are reluctant to realize losses, whereas winners are sold too early. Our experiments compare the investments of two-person teams to a setting, where investors trade alone. We find that subjects investing jointly exhibit more pronounced disposition effects than individuals. A closer look reveals that investor teams hardly realize losses and predominately sell winners. The data suggest that decision-dependent emotions may explain the differences. That is, teams reporting high levels of regret exhibit significantly higher disposition effects than individuals.

By means of a theoretical model, we derive cases of market imperfection in a two-sided market setup and survey the literature. We show that there is often no clear free-market bias in (for example) advertising levels, program quality, or channel diversity with respect to a socially optimal equilibrium. The economic literature paints a diverse picture of public provision of broadcasting. While public service broadcasting can indeed remedy some market failures, it may also exacerbate others. Thus, there is no simple rationale for public intervention in broadcasting markets based on the traditional theory of market failure.","[Sieg, Gernot; Stuehmeier, Torben] Univ Munster, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Sieg, G (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",gernot.sieg@uni-muenster.de; torben.stuehmeier@uni-muenster.de,"Sieg, Gernot/HMD-6495-2023","Sieg, Gernot/0000-0001-7528-2872",,,,,43,1,1,1,17,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2015,71.0,4,,,,,440,459,,10.1628/001522115X14425626525083,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DC0ZQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368947000002,0

It proposes a framework for calculating exact' price indices, based on the Exact Affine Stone Index' (EASI) demand system, and shows its usefulness by calculating spatial prices and regionally varying temporal prices that allow for both differences in preferences between states and over time. The study finds that the nature of inflation has been regressive during (1999/2000-2004/2005) and progressive during (2004/2005-2009/2010) and that the effects of temporal price inflation and spatial prices on inequality are qualitatively different.","[Chakrabarty, Manisha] Indian Inst Management Calcutta, Econ Grp, Kolkata, India; [Majumder, Amita] Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, Kolkata, India; [Ray, Ranjan] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; Monash University,"Majumder, A (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, Kolkata, India.",amita@isical.ac.in,,"Ray, Ranjan/0000-0002-0411-6268",,,,,31,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Using a novel measure to proxy uncertainty about expected changes in aggregate volatility, i.e. monthly range of the VIX index (RVIX), we find that portfolio betas change significantly when uncertainty about aggregate volatility expectations is beyond a certain threshold level. Due to changes in their market betas, small and value stocks are perceived as riskier than their big and growth counterparts in bad times, when uncertainty about aggregate volatility expectations is high. The proposed model yields a positive and significant market risk premium during periods when investors do not expect significant uncertainty in near-term aggregate volatility. Our findings support a volatility-based time-varying risk explanation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
