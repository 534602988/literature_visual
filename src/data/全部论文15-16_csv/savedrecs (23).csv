The limitedness of access to resources in economy world reveals importance of economic literacy, involving financial literacy. Economic literacy is the ability to identify economic problems, alternatives, costs, and benefits; analyze the incentives at work in economic situations; examine the consequences of changes in economic conditions and public policies; collect and organize economic evidence; and weigh costs against benefits. Forest products industry has an important place in national economy. This industry section presents wide range of outputs such as timber, package, plywood, particle board, fiberboard, paper, parquet, joinery and furniture. With a share percent 1,6% in manufacturing industry, it is ranked 16th among subsectors and approximately employs 300 thousand personnel. Moreover its production value is about 4,3 billion dollars. Considering above statements, in this study economic literacy level of forest products industry managers was investigated. The sample of this research consists of 30 managers in Kahramanmaras forest products industry. Face to face survey was used as method. Findings were shown as frequency tables. It was found that 92% of managers consider their income when making installment. Conversely, 20% of these managers can't make comments about currency changes on import and export.","[Sahin, Yunus; Durgun, Muhammet; Serin, Hasan] Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam Univ, Fac Forestry, Kahramanmaras, Turkey",Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University,"Sahin, Y (通讯作者)，Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam Univ, Fac Forestry, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",ysahin@ksu.edu.tr; muhammetdurgun@ksu.edu.tr; hasanserin@ksu.edu.tr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,181,186,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700021,0

However, R&D-intensive industries in Japan have recently experienced a decline in performance. This study estimates the rate of return on R&D capital and physical capital as well as total factor productivity (TFP) to solve this puzzle. The rate of return is properly estimated applying the methods, which deal with simultaneity bias issues. After Japan entered the lost decade, the rate of return on R&D capital dropped significantly, while the rate on physical capital did not. This trend cannot be found by the methods without considering the issues, typically used in previous studies. The slowdown of TFP growth occurs coincidentally with a declining rate of return on R&D capital, which suggests the importance of innovations that enable effective use of R&D capital. Considering the trends, the declining rate of return on R&D capital along with the slowdown of TFP growth are the main causes of the low performance of recent R&D-intensive industries. The results of this paper also offer suggestions on economic policies and growth strategies.","[Sakai, Hirotsugu] Mitsubishi Res Inst Inc, Chiyoda Ku, 10-3 Nagatacho 2 Chome, Tokyo 1008141, Japan; [Sakai, Hirotsugu] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyamacho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Mitsubishi Research Institute; Osaka University,"Sakai, H (通讯作者)，Mitsubishi Res Inst Inc, Chiyoda Ku, 10-3 Nagatacho 2 Chome, Tokyo 1008141, Japan.;Sakai, H (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyamacho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",sakai@mri.co.jp,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,18,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

However, these decisions are still not well known and empirical evidence about firms in financial distress is controversial. Previous studies do not find support for either the trade-off theory or the pecking order theory, which explain the financial decisions of healthy firms. Distressed firms frequently have to use all of their available financial resources to cover their financing deficit. This could give rise to a concave quadratic relationship between financing deficit and net debt issued, which might well explain the ambivalent results about the financial decisions of these firms. To analyze this quadratic relationship, which has not been studied previously, we perform an empirical analysis on a sample of 3,337 listed firms from Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Our results show that the pecking order theory does not appear to have a higher explanatory power in healthy firms. Moreover, the hierarchy suggested by the pecking order theory is not totally applicable in firms in financial distress. Our results show that as financing deficit grows, these firms use debt decreasingly, which gives rise to a concave quadratic relationship between financing deficit and net debt issued. This suggests that firms in financial distress have difficulty issuing new debt. Our results also show that firms in financial distress have a greater probability of issuing equity. Therefore, these firms can use equity financing as an alternative to debt issuance.","[Sanfilippo-Azofra, Sergio; Lopez-Gutierrez, Carlos; Torre-Olmo, Begona] Univ Cantabria, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Sanfilippo-Azofra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Santander, Spain.",sanfilis@unican.es; carlos.lopez@unican.es; torreb@unican.es,"Torre, Begoña/JJD-5456-2023; Lopez-Gutierrez, Carlos/E-6023-2017","Lopez-Gutierrez, Carlos/0000-0003-1703-6440; Sanfilippo Azofra, Sergio/0000-0001-8941-2033",,,,,40,2,2,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The main drivers for the growth in using multi-channel structures and the business arguments for adding new distribution channels are issues of significant interest in this research. The aim of this study is to make a review of the contemporary drivers of multi-channel distribution and identify the main companies' arguments for adding new marketing channels. The research is based on an online survey among companies registered in Bulgaria. The survey places emphasis on the companies' distribution decisions and argumentation for adding new channels in the last three years. The paper presents four major drivers for multichannel distribution growth: technological development, legal regulation, logistics industry progress and increasing number of customers using multiple channels to buy products. The paper views the technological developments driving forward the use of various types of channels (conventional, e-channels, vending channels, catalog channels, call channels, direct personal sales and so on). In the last decade the increasing legal regulation of distribution from a distance is also an indisputable factor for the growth in applying multi-channel distribution. A significant driver for the growth in using multi-channel distribution is the development of the logistics industry. The growing number of companies and the enhanced wide range of services they offer support channels from a distance to serve their consumers effectively. The growing number of individuals defined as cross channel shoppers who demonstrate active consumer behavior in purchasing by using many channels also stimulates companies to invest in adding new channels for ensuring the balance under the circumstances of supplying and demanding the specific products and services and providing effective Place to Space channel management. The results of the research show that adding new distribution channels to the already functioning ones is mainly aimed at attracting new customers, covering new markets/market segments, increasing market share and revenues. The decisions to add new channels are taken primarily under the influence of owners of companies and the example of the best multi-channel practices in the industry. In conclusion, the technological development will stimulate changes in the quantitative and qualitative parameters of channels, hence their functions and capacity. Applying new technologies in a distribution and logistics will remain an important prerequisite for integrating separate channels in a uniform system which provides effective distribution through balancing the relations benefits/costs/risks for companies and consumers.","[Tonkova, Evgeniya] Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Tonkova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria.",evge@mbox.digsys.bg,"Tonkova, Evgeniya/AAN-6109-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,1,21,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,870,881,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200074,0

Regarding sequential investments as conditional events subsequent to a successful initial investment, a game-theoretic outward FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) model is constructed. It demonstrates that the adverse selection problem that originates from information asymmetry between the parent company and its subsidiary is embedded in outward FDIs. A conditional information update on the types of sequential investment through ceaseless monitoring efforts is required to make outward FDIs fruitful. Pooling LSDV (least squares dummy variable) regression supports the prediction of the developed model; Korean parent companies begin to pursue more sequential investments in China as their monitoring capabilities are enhanced. From the perspective of the intervals between an initial investment and sequential investments, those sequential investments occurring within four years ex post initial investments enlarge assets of parent companies, but those occurring later help to expand parent companies sales. Functionally, the sequential investments pursued by either green field investments or joint ventures contribute more to the size expansion of Korean parent companies compared to those pursued by mergers and acquisitions.","[Yim, Hyung Rok] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Jung, Wonjin] Dankook Univ, Sch Business Adm, Young In 448701, South Korea",Hanyang University; Dankook University,"Yim, HR (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea.",hryim@hanyang.ac.kr; jungw@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,11,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Although rater bias weakens the agent's incentives to exert effort in late periods, at the same time it strengthens implicit incentives in early periods. Under the optimal contract, as long as rater bias is not overly strong, its adverse effect on late-period incentives is fully offset by exploitation of stronger early-period incentives and thereby leaves the principal's profits unchanged.","[Mueller, Daniel] Univ Bonn, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Weinschenk, Philipp] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Weinschenk, Philipp] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Kaiserslautern; Max Planck Society,"Müller, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Adenauerallee 24, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",daniel.mueller@uni-bonn.de; weinschenk@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,40,7,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We discuss a possible pitfall regarding this procedure. We argue that a positive and significant event variable coefficient is not a sufficient condition for concluding that there have been anticompetitive price effects. We use simulations to demonstrate that even in cases where the alleged anticompetitive activity had no anticompetitive effect, the D-in-D procedure can still produce positive and significant event variables. This article does not take issue with D-in-D in principle but rather as it is often practiced. Our results imply that while D-in-D is an important tool, the researcher must conduct additional analyses to put the D-in-D result into context before concluding a significant event variable is indicative of anticompetitive effects. We suggest a specific approach.

An ordinal regression and decision tree analysis have been used to identify a portfolio of e-business ICT applications. We have also proposed three hypotheses to test whether the perceived impact of ICT is influenced by the number of implemented e-business ICT applications, or by the number of procurement-orientated e- business ICT applications, or even by the number of sales-orientated ones.

In almost every type of case, each colleague's vote increases the likelihood that a judge will vote in the same direction by roughly 40 percentage points. This result is consistent with a strong norm of consensus and can account for nearly all of the perceived impact of colleagues' party, gender, and race. This finding raises questions about strategic and deliberative models of panel voting and helps clarify measurement issues regarding the relationship between judicial characteristics and voting behavior (JEL C31, K40).","[Fischman, Joshua B.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Northwestern University,"Fischman, JB (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",joshua.fisch-man@law.northwestern.edu,,"Fischman, Joshua/0000-0001-8912-7662",,,,,78,33,35,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

J,"Arblaster, M; Hooper, P",,,,"Arblaster, Margaret; Hooper, Paul",,,Light handed regulation-Can it play a role in the developing world?,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Developing countries; Airport; Pricing; Light-handed regulation; Case study,,"The private sector has become essential for the development of airport infrastructure worldwide, but ICAO maintains that all governments ultimately are responsible for protecting users from the abuse of market power and therefore they need to establish appropriate regulatory arrangements. Nevertheless, economic regulation is difficult, it involves risk of failure, it can be costly, and careful analysis might well suggest that presumptions of significant market power are not supported by the facts. Developing countries, in particular, face challenges in providing necessary financial and (qualified) human resources for their regulatory authorities, but such regulation also has to function in a sub-optimal framework. We review less 'intrusive', less 'prescriptive', and potentially less costly models of regulation that have been applied in some developed countries. Such light-handed regulation does not involve direct exante determination of airport prices or other terms and conditions by an external regulator. In particular we consider Australian and New Zealand experiences with light-handed approaches to regulating airports including price and quality of service monitoring, information disclosure, and negotiate-arbitrate-regulation. The various forms of light-handed regulation are examined in terms of their need for regulatory intervention and the extent to which they offer the prospect of a reduced need to maintain regulatory infrastructure. The paper concludes that negotiate-arbitrate regulation, or a variant of it, offers the potential of a light-handed form of economic regulation which could be applied to airports in developing countries taking account of the institutional setting in which such regulation has to function.

In the antitrust literature and practices, RPM solving the free-rider problem is perceived mostly as pro-competitive, while multiple manufacturers' RPM is perceived as anti-competitive based on their collusive incentives. In our circumstances, distributors' services may differentiate manufacturers' brands ex post, as is desired by manufacturers. Thus, despite solving the free-rider problem, multiple manufacturers' RPM may harm consumers by softening inter-brand price competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

If repeated interaction or exogenous enforcement is unavailable, societies often solve this problem via institutions that rely on group, rather than individual, reputation. Groups can employ two mechanisms to uphold reputation that are unavailable to individuals: information sharing and in-group punishment. We design a laboratory experiment to distinguish the roles of these mechanisms when individual reputations are unobservable. Subjects are split into groups and play a trust game with random re-matching, where only the group identity of one's partner is known. Treatments differ by whether information about group members' transactions is shared and whether in-group punishment is possible. We find that information sharing encourages path dependence via group reputation: good (bad) behavior results in greater (fewer) gains from exchange in the future. However, the mere threat of in-group punishment is enough to discourage bad behavior.","[Kimbrough, Erik O.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Rubin, Jared] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA",Simon Fraser University; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Kimbrough, EO (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",ekimbrough@gmail.com; jrubin@chapman.edu,,"Rubin, Jared/0000-0002-3133-7947",John Templeton Foundation,John Templeton Foundation,"Chapman University.

This paper discusses the use of social media, and Twitter in particular, for forecasting elections in the United States, Germany, and other democracies. All known forecasting methods based on social media have failed when subjected to the demands of true forward-looking electoral forecasting. These failures appear to be due to fundamental properties of social media, rather than to methodological or algorithmic difficulties. In short, social media do not, and probably never will, offer a stable, unbiased, representative picture of the electorate; and convenience samples of social media lack sufficient data to fix these problems post hoc. Hence, while these services may, as others in this volume discuss, offer new ways of reaching prospective voters, the data that they generate will not replace polling as a means of assessing the sentiment or intentions of the electorate.

A methodological framework for developing such strategies is presented in the paper. The framework is illustrated through two examples: the management of rural roads in Thailand where the vast road network is being threatened by increasing floods and rising sea levels and the improvement of pavement design strategies for expressways along the coast of Hong Kong.

This article makes a contribution as it constructively critiques the Revenue Required methodology used by Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) for the 2014/15 tariff application. It challenges the underlying assumptions of the Revenue Required methodology as it is applied to the South African ports system and recalculates the tariff adjustment. There is a concern that the Required Revenue model may incentivise port prices at levels that are not in the best interests of the country. The findings show that TNPA's application of the model contained rounding-off errors and the model is based on disputed assumptions. Specifically, TNPA does not include a debt beta, they use a Market Risk Premium (MRP) of 7.1% and use an asset beta of 0.5. This article recommends that the Ports Regulator of South Africa should: Include the calculation of a debt beta; allow an MRP of 6.3% or less; and use an asset beta of less than 0 5 Through scenario analyses the article demonstrates the pricing consequences of accepting these recommendations.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Natal, RN, Brazil",,"Chasomeris, MG (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Natal, RN, Brazil.",chasomerism1@ukzn.ac.za,"Chasomeris, Mihalis Georgiou/V-4271-2019","Chasomeris, Mihalis Georgiou/0000-0003-0920-7537",,,,,32,8,8,0,6,IST EDITORIALI POLGRAFICI INT,PISA,"CASELLA POSTALE N 1, SUCCURSALE N 8, 56123 PISA, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

It adopts the concept of sectoral innovation system as its framework. Through in-depth interviews with representatives from firms and other actors in the system, as well as a technology foresight workshop, the study reveals that there were several product innovations, namely, branded ready-to-eat, ready-to-cook, and frozen products based on Thai, Oriental, Western, and fusion recipes. These innovations were the results of changing demand conditions as well as an integration of knowledge and expertise from science, social science, art, and the services industry. These innovations were achieved through R&D departments having personnel from various disciplines, in addition to interaction between R&D and other departments within firms. In several cases, firms leveraged external knowledge through collaboration with local universities and public research institutes. The study finds that in order for convergence innovation to occur, firms must be proactive in their approach to acquiring and creating new knowledge in their industry. Convergence innovation also requires a strong, coherent sectoral innovation system to be in place.","[Intarakumnerd, Patarapong] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Chairatana, Pun-arj] Natl Innovat Agcy, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kamondetdacha, Rungroge] Natl Sci Technol & Innovat Policy Off STI, Bangkok, Thailand",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Intarakumnerd, P (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan.",patarapong@grips.ac.jp,,"Intarakumnerd, Patarapong/0000-0001-6190-1388",JSPS KAKENHI [25101006]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101006] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 25101006].,,11,8,8,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Using propensity score matching, the authors provide evidence for a sample selection bias that leads to an overestimation of the 3D effect if not accounted for. Matching results show that 3D movies are, on average, not economically advantageous when compared with 2D twins. However, subsequent weighted least squares regression analyses find that the impact of 3D on movie success varies in a non-linear, inverted U-shaped way with a trend variable that measures the point in time of a movie release and with a number of movie genres. A post-hoc analysis shows that a consumer's decision to attend a 3D screening of a 3D movie (instead of a 2D screening) is influenced by several factors, including whether the film is originally shot in 3D or the 3D element is added during postproduction.","[Knapp, Ann-Kristin; Hennig-Thurau, Thorsten] Univ Munster, Mkt Ctr Muenster, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Knapp, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Mkt Ctr Muenster, Stadtgraben 13-15, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",ann-kristin.knapp@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,47,4,6,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The Italian market is the first and most extensive case in Europe where two railway companies compete for HSR services on open access basis. In this paper we empirically explore the competitive effects of the newcomer's entry in the passenger market tackling two issues. First, we study price and capacity effects of the stemming intro-modal competition. Second, we measure the impact of inter-modal competition by HSR on airline pricing behaviour. The results show that the two railway companies engage in strategic pricing, although to a different degree on different routes and that capacity and frequency are strategic variables. We also find that airlines significantly reduce fares when flights are in direct competition with HSR services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For the 1981:Q3 to 2013:Q2 sample, the ECM improves upon the competing models, with the largest improvements on the univariate models coming from the current quarter forecasts and those on the multivariate models coming from the multi-step forecasts. Further, the ECM makes modest improvements to the SPF, and performs comparably to the Greenbook from 1981:Q3 to 2007:Q4.

One explanation is that sellers can undergo changes in production costs which generate a value of waiting. Using the real-option approach, we examine the effects of the lack of incentives for on-time delivery on competitive bids for a fixed-price procurement contract. Next, we analyze the effects of liquidated damages aimed at protecting the buyer for the expected losses due to project delays. We show that when the expectation damage measure fails to discourage time overruns, a liquidated damages stipulation does not lead to a Pareto superior outcome. Although liquidated damages tend to make the seller better off, the buyer's expected payoff is lower than when the contract does not provide for any damages for breach.","[Dosi, Cesare] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy; [Moretto, Michele] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Ctr Studi Levi Cases, Padua, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Dosi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy.",cesare.dosi@unipd.it; michele.moretto@unipd.it,,"MORETTO, MICHELE/0000-0002-5892-8165",University of Padova under the project Governance Complexity and Financial Determinants of Public-Private Partnerships [CPDA121089/12],University of Padova under the project Governance Complexity and Financial Determinants of Public-Private Partnerships,The University of Padova under the project Governance Complexity and Financial Determinants of Public-Private Partnerships (CPDA121089/12).,,42,8,9,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

This article provides a review of fare schemes for several public transport modes operating under both high-and low levels of regulation in Norway. A general model for the passenger transport market is presented and the derived relationships between fare and trip distance under different company goals and forms of competition are discussed in relation to the empirical evidence. The empirical evidence confirms a close relationship between fare and distance and largely supports the conclusions of the theoretical model with respect to how firm goals and quality influence fares. Perhaps surprisingly, transport firms able to set fares freely demonstrate more or less the same close relationship between fares and travel distance as companies with regulated fare schemes.

However, due to the broad range of actors interacting in supply chains and the diverse interests, it becomes very challenging to achieve positive uptake from all these stakeholders. The objective of this paper is to capture the attitude of and impacts on different stakeholders towards the introduction of ICT into a supply chain for enhanced monitoring and information provision. This is achieved through a set of surveys addressing all possible impacted parties: shippers, receivers and society. The survey relies on 'stated and revealed preferences' method and input is analysed through a simple, descriptive method. The outcome of this survey is a clear depiction of the approach that each stakeholder group follows in order to assess the impacts of ICT usage according to the needs of each group. Also, insight is provided regarding the citizens behaviour as consumers who face delays. The outcomes showed that the ICT adoption in supply chains is considered as beneficial by all stakeholder groups and will assist in the mitigation of delays in the logistics environment.

Despite robust evidence illustrating the key role of parents in this process, parental involvement in financial education programs is not well-developed. Hence, this study advocates a revaluation of their role in such programs and shows how this fits in with the development of youth financial literacy programs that are more proactive and aimed at raising adaptable financial consumers. Guidelines are provided for the design of such proactive financial literacy programs, which take into account the role of parents in the financial socialization process. In addition, consequences for the role of teachers are discussed. In conclusion, a number of suggestions for future research are formulated that are necessary in order to develop more effective delivery methods and to increase the effectiveness of financial education programs.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Finance, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Van Campenhout, G (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Finance, Louvain, Belgium.",geert.vancampenhout@kuleuven.be,,"Van Campenhout, Geert/0000-0001-5821-6750",,,,,129,69,96,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Since that time, a soccer match of the Spanish First Division-considered a public benefit activity-can be viewed on a weekly basis for free throughout the regular season. The aim of this article is to determine whether a general interest for these free-to-air broadcastings exists. To perform the empirical analysis, a demand equation for a TV audience is estimated using a unique panel data set on a regional level, in which the dependent variable is the number of viewers of free-to-air matches in each Spanish region during the period 2008-2012. The model specifications consider whether a particular region has a team competing in the First Division and other socioeconomical and sporting variables. The results conclude that a nationwide general interest in free-to-air broadcasting of soccer matches, which would support Spanish law, does not exist, with the exception of matches played by Real Madrid Club de Futbol, Futbol Club Barcelona, and local teams.","[Perez, Levi; Puente, Victor] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Gijon 33203, Asturias, Spain; [Perez, Levi; Puente, Victor; Rodriguez, Placido] Fdn Observ Econ Deporte, Gijon, Spain; [Rodriguez, Placido] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Univ Sch, Gijon 33203, Asturias, Spain; [Rodriguez, Placido] Int Assoc Sports Economists, Limoges, France",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Pérez, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Jovellanos Fac Commerce Tourism & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Luis Moya Blanco 261, Gijon 33203, Asturias, Spain.",lperez@uniovi.es,"Pérez, Levi/L-6919-2015","Pérez, Levi/0000-0001-6632-6626",,,,,14,11,12,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

According to the resource-based view heterogeneous resource profiles that enable firms to achieve competitive advantage in international markets may be also such differentiating factors. On the other hand, as a result of the process of globalization and the increasing number of born global firms, firm age at entry into foreign markets is becoming negatively related to internationalization. Our findings just partly confirm the trends above. Using a regression model on the selected sample of 247 Slovenian small and medium enterprises, we have confirmed the hypotheses that internationalized companies are significantly larger (in terms of sales) and have more specialized resources (human, organizational, and financial resources) than non-internationalized companies. Organizational and human resources and the number of employees were positively and significantly related, while the age of companies at the start of their international activities was negatively related, to the extent of companies' internationalization.

Sustainability is a multidimensional concept based on a balance of environmental, social and economic pillars. It is difficult to evaluate it because it is expressed by many variables which most of them are non-financial ones. Data envelopment analysis is based on assessing the quantity of consumed inputs by the produced outputs and estimation of production possibility frontier; it computes a scalar measure of efficiency and determines potential improvements of inputs and outputs without requiring explicit specification of functional relations between inputs and outputs and setting weights of variables. Based on the computation of the CCR super efficiency DEA model the companies are divided into four groups: sustainable, pro-social, pro-environmental and unsustainable companies. The model outputs allow users to identify the position of a particular company and to reveal weaknesses in the effectiveness of a company, thus the model can serve its users as a basis for decision-making and performance management.

To address this issue, we have designed two variants of the capacitated network flow problem based on an integer programming (IP) approach with two sets of inter-dependent decisions. One set of decisions involves finding a feasible k-tree path network through segment linkages (routing flow) at a minimum variable cost, while another attends to the schedule of an even wood flow to the landing location(s) (transporting flow), within the scope of operational planning horizon. The mathematical models are then linked to a heuristic algorithm to identify the landing locations at the parcel level. The models were applied to a 680 ha area in the highlands of the Hyrcanian forests, in the north of Iran. The new formulation solved the problems using binary decision variables to represent transport of saw-logs from timber entry nodes to destination(s) by use of a ground-based machine skidder system. Then, the model uses continuous decision variables to represent transport of wood fuel to the same destination(s) by use of an animal skidding system. The results showed that the skidding costs and the length of the designed skid-trails were different based on the skidding systems and the types of products desired. Even though the models could generate an optimal solution, both of them could not address the real isolated timber node problem, where there is no accessible pathway for a skidding operation. As a promising point, the second model (splittable, animal systems) could partially solve the temporarily isolated timber nodes problem, where the timber nodes were not accessible by ground-based machine skidder systems.

They enrich the structure of the intellectual capital for strategic management of high-technology enterprises The authors have designated the class of such intangible assets as unidentifiable intangible assets. The paper analyzes peculiarities of forming and implementing innovative managerial techniques at the high-technology enterprise, as well as problems of inexpedient use of resources during implementation of such techniques. The authors have formalized the definition and demonstrated the significance of unidentifiable intangible assets in forming the increment to the value of the business. A mechanism of forming and enhancing use efficiency of such asset class is presented. Expediency of attributing investments, related to creation of unidentifiable intangible assets, to capital expenditures is substantiated and demonstrated.

It is therefore essential for cell phone network providers to offer effective service recovery when they attempt to restore customer satisfaction following service failure. As it has been argued that relationships between customers and service providers should be considered a key determinant of the service recovery required to restore post-recovery attitudes and behavioural intentions, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between South African cell phone customers' relationship intentions, their perceptions of service recovery and their satisfaction following service recovery. Personal in-home interviews were conducted to collect data from 605 cell phone customers residing in the Johannesburg metropolitan area. In addition to the significant positive relationships found between cell phone users' relationship intentions, perceived service recovery and satisfaction after service recovery, this study found that perceived service recovery played a mediating role in the relationship between relationship intention and satisfaction following service recovery. The study concludes that, although a direct relationship exists between relationship intention and satisfaction following service recovery, perceived service recovery plays an additional indirect complementary role in this relationship. It is recommended that, in addition to focusing their relationship efforts on customers with relationship intentions, cell phone network providers also offer positively perceived service recovery to these customers, as this would lead to greater satisfaction following service recovery.","[Kruger, Liezl-Marie; Mostert, Pierre; de Beer, Leon Tielman] North West Univ, WorkWell Res Unit Econ & Management Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Kruger, LM (通讯作者)，North West Univ, WorkWell Res Unit Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom Campus, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"De Beer, Leon T./AAH-8146-2021; van der Westhuizen, Liezl-Marié/AGR-6836-2022; van der Westhuizen, Liezl-Marié/AAA-1515-2020","De Beer, Leon T./0000-0001-6900-2192; van der Westhuizen, Liezl-Marié/0000-0003-1972-8408; Mostert, Pierre/0000-0002-4046-3312",,,,,110,5,5,3,28,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In a one-factor between-subject online experimental survey the presence and different choice options of the charitable donation issued with the product purchase were manipulated in a product advertisement. Through planned contrasts and regression analysis it is shown that a Cause-Related Marketing campaign can be able to positively influence consumer purchase intentions - under the condition of no choice.

On the basis of a sample of 82 companies on the JSE, hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the contribution of levels of corporate social responsibility disclosures to company share prices, over and above the contribution of the size of a firm's equity and net income. In contrast with other findings which predict a positive relationship between company share price and levels of corporate social responsibility disclosures, the latter are found to have no significant association with company share price over and above the associations of the size of a firm's equity and net income. Bivariate associations, however, indicate a significant association between share price and levels of corporate social responsibility disclosures.

Equilibrium will be achieved when there is an interaction between demand and supply; and at certain price. Nonetheless, the equilibrium in housing market is difficult to attain since the demand and supply on housing market always changing due to several macro and micro factors (Bourne 1978; Tan, 1995; and Ismail, 1998). Changes between supply and demand quantities in housing create problems and one of them is oversupply. The oversupply on housing is a situation where supply in housing exceeds the local market demand (Bourne, 1981). This leads to several negative implication to the national housing market that create situations where many houses remain unsold, higher vacant rate, abandoned completed house and etc. Economic factor is being mentioned to be the main contributing factor to the oversupply situation (Mcnulty, 1995; Boortz, 1994; and Grenadier, 1992). Thus, the primary purpose of this paper is to focus on the discussion on the influence of economic factors towards housing oversupply. The main arising issue is whether or not economic factor has a significant relationship towards housing oversupply as argued by previous researchers (i.e. Mcnulty, 1995; Boortz, 1994; and Grenadier, 1992)?. In light of this, an empirical study was conducted within the Johor Bahru area, which was selected as a case study area. Prior to that, this paper briefly discusses housing oversupply issue and major findings from literature study. Finally, some of the result from preliminary data analysis will be discussed.","[Mohd, Thuraiya] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Architecture Planning & Surveying, Dept Real Estate Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Alias, Buang] Univ Technol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Real Estate Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Mohd, T (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Architecture Planning & Surveying, Dept Real Estate Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",thuraiya.mohd@yahoo.com,"Mohd, Thuraiya/ABA-3386-2021",,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3762,3772,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700389,0

Despite of the European Union efforts to reduce disparities continuously between regions, there are still significant differences between them. This paper is devoted to the issue of above mentioned regional disparities in the social sphere. The social sphere was chosen because it is often neglected area. Most of the researches are devoted to the economic sphere (used descriptors as GDP, foreign direct investment, unemployment rate etc.) For the measuring there will be used four integrated indicators living standards, health condition, social facilities and social pathology. Subsequent evaluation of integrated indicators will be performed by using point method. The measuring will be done in four regions in the Czech Republic - the Hradec Kralove Region, the Plzen Region, the Usti Region and the Moravian-Silesian Region. These regions have been chosen because Hradec Kralove Regon and Plzen Region are known as the regions good for life and the Moravian-Silesian Region and Usti Region are contrast to them. The Moravian-Silesian Region and Usti Region belong to the worst regions in the Czech Republic There is high unemployment rate, damaged environment, high migration, high criminality etc. The measuring of the disparities was done in 2011 because more recent data was not available for the all descriptors.","[Palova, Zuzana] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ & Publ Adm, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Palová, Z (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ & Publ Adm, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",zuzana.palova@centrum.cz,,,,,,,10,6,6,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,424,430,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000043,0

This paper, first of all, paints a picture of the approach to plagiarism adopted by students during their tertiary education and strives to capture the shift in the perception of plagiarism that has occurred in the last few years. The aim is not to capture global trends, but to monitor and quantify the situation based on data collected from three different surveys conducted among university students. For comparison, we used a survey conducted in 2005 at the University of Virginia, USA, adopted in 2010 by the Faculty of Management, University of Economics in Prague, Czech Republic, and then repeated in an expanded version in 2015. As the results show, plagiarism as the source of documents is a serious problem, which is subsequently carried over to the working life and entrepreneurship. Combating plagiarism is difficult and the solutions proposed can only defeat a narrowly defined form of plagiarism. As in many other areas of human life, it is therefore appropriate to introduce preventive elements into the tertiary education system (especially information on how to address the issue of plagiarism) before introducing repressive measures.","[Pribil, Jiri; Vilemova, Eva] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pribil, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",jiri.pribil@vse.cz; xvile01@vse.cz,"Pribil, Jiri/C-2326-2019","Pribil, Jiri/0000-0003-3874-0816",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1000,1011,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700097,0

We develop a method called dynamic latent class model averaging, which combines a state-space model for the parameters of each of the candidate models of the system with a Markov chain model for the best model. We propose a polychotomous regression model for the transition weights to assume that the probability of a change in time depends on the past through the values of the most recent time periods and spatial correlation among the regions. The evolution of the parameters in each submodel is defined by exponential forgetting. This structure allows the correct' model to vary over both time and regions. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed model naturally incorporates clustering and prediction analysis in a single unified framework. We develop an efficient Gibbs algorithm for computation, and we demonstrate the value of our framework on simulated experiments and on a real-world problem: forecasting IBM's corporate revenue.

Using confidential data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997 Cohort), we document that young adults tend to drink up to 2.1 days more once they are granted legal access to alcohol at age 21. Although the discrete jump in alcohol consumption at the MLDA is associated with an increase in the probability of having sex by up to 7.8 percentage points, it does not have a significant impact on the probability of engaging in risky sexual behaviors among young adults. We also document that the effect of the MLDA on the probability of using several different birth control methods is not significant for those who had sex in the past 4 weeks. These results are robust under alternative specifications and imply that although the MLDA law is quite effective in reducing alcohol consumption among young adults, spillover effects of this law on risky sexual behaviors are relatively limited.","[Yoruk, Ceren Ertan] Sage Coll, Sch Management, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Yoruk, Baris K.] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",Russell Sage College; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Yörük, CE (通讯作者)，Sage Coll, Sch Management, 140 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208 USA.",yorukc@sage.edu; byoruk@albany.edu,,,,,,,32,11,13,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

As the buyer, the policyholder purchase insurance to limit the unpredictable future loss within a tolerable range. As the seller, the insurance company charges premium and makes profits, by providing policies for policyholders. The object of the transaction is a special commodity the policy, and the price of the policy is determined according to the cost of the policy. The cost of the policy is the insurance companies' expected future payouts to policyholders, which is determined by the policyholders' risk (risk type). Therefore, to determine the type of applicant's risk is premise work of determining premiums for insurance company. Information asymmetry is a typical characteristic of the insurance market. Policyholders know their risks, while insurance companies lack of relevant information, which causes difficulty in determining the price of policy according to the policyholders' risk for insurance companies. Before the deal, by virtue of private information of their own, policyholders can make favorable decisions, leading to the distortions of market allocating resource, resulting in insufficient demand and supply in the insurance market, which is called adverse selection. After the deal, under the condition that insurance companies' supervision is difficult, policyholders enjoy gains of their actions, but will pass on the cost to the insurance company, causing a loss of insurance company and the dilemma of insurance company's operation and management, which is called moral hazard. Adverse selection and moral hazard violate the original intention of insurance mechanism, which is harmful to the sound development of the insurance market. Adverse selection and moral hazard are derived from information asymmetry. Adverse selection is result from ex ante asymmetric information, while moral hazard is derived from ex post information asymmetry. According to their characteristics, this paper established a complete and perfect information dynamic game of moral hazard and a complete but imperfect information dynamic game of adverse selection with the situation that supervision is difficult. Analysis showed that adverse selection is a market partial failure mixed strategy perfect Bayesian equilibrium of imperfect information dynamic game; and moral hazard is a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of perfect information dynamic game when incentive compatibility constraints is insufficient. Based on the analysis, we modify the game model, looking for conditions to improve the equilibrium outcome, managing to overcome the adverse effects of asymmetric information on the insurance market.","[Zhou Yuemei; Li Zhi; Song Yongning] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Zhou, YM (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",ymzhou@foxmail.com; consul_tant@163.com; songning1992@126.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,5,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,173,181,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700012,0

Actavis decision, which directed attention to the magnitude of and possible explanations for a payment from the patent-holder to the generic as part of settlement including an agreed-upon entry date. A reverse payment exceeding the patent-holder's avoided litigation costs (with no other reasonable explanation) is regarded as buying a delay, logic that has come to be labeled as the Actavis Inference. This paper presents and explains a complementary form of evidence, an event study assessing how the Nexium settlement announcement affected the stock price values of AstraZeneca, the patent holder, and Ranbaxy, a generic manufacturer. On the single day on which the Nexium settlement was announced, the stock market capitalization of AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy went up (after statistical adjustments) by $2.8 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, indicating that the agreement created substantial anticompetitive gains through delayed generic entry. Although the jury decided against the plaintiffs on a causation question framed by the court rather than on economic grounds, the lessons for assessing evidence of anticompetitive effect in Nexium are relevant to the many ongoing reverse-payment antitrust cases in the drug industry.","[Drake, Keith M.; McGuire, Thomas G.] Greylock McKinnon Associates, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Drake, Keith M.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dartmouth Inst Hlth Policy & Clin Practice, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [McGuire, Thomas G.] Harvard Med Sch, Hlth Econ, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA USA; [McGuire, Thomas G.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Drake, KM (通讯作者)，Greylock McKinnon Associates, Boston, MA 02116 USA.;Drake, KM (通讯作者)，Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dartmouth Inst Hlth Policy & Clin Practice, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",kdrake@gma-us.com; mcguire@hcp.med.harvard.edu,,,,,,,28,4,5,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Through the prism of context rooted in history, legal framework, post-socialist transformation, reorientation to export, European integration and other factors, it delivers a justification for the current state of the industry and firm strategies. The analysis encompasses main macroeconomic indicators of the industry and the sector, changes in the structure of production, external relations (primarily export) and basic data on employment. Conclusions from the analysis of data are backed by information acquired from in depth interviews conducted in 2013 and 2014 in two traditional footwear industry regions. This sector of industry was characterized by dynamic growth of production in the post war socialist period, decline following 1989, small scale inflow of foreign investment and reorientation of external relations.","[Kocaj, Arkadiusz] Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Gronostajowa St 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Kocaj, A (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Gronostajowa St 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",arkadiusz.kocaj@uj.edu.pl,,"Kocaj, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-9330-9378",,,,,76,1,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

These procedures allow to test the existence of long run relationship between the variables and to decide whether the model is linear or not. The empirical results show the existence of a cointegration relationship between air transport and economic growth, and that this relationship is linear.

Using the OD survey data, it is possible to determine passenger loads and transfer flows for each line of the network, as the route of the surveyed trips, including transfer stations, is identified. Moreover, OD matrices can be estimated using smartcard data in Santiago's integrated transit system. The latter is done establishing the time and geographical position of every boarding transaction in the system using the GPS equipment inside buses or validation devices in subway stations. Using also an alighting stop estimation model, it is possible to determine the OD matrix. The estimated matrix is assigned in a transit equilibrium model, where passenger load levels are a result of this process. Both sets of demand levels show a strong correlation between them, which in the future would allow the use of smartcard data as the main source of information for the construction of OD matrices, avoiding the need to perform the complete OD survey. Anyhow, a smaller specific survey to address socioeconomic and accessibility data would be needed as a complement, saving considerable resources. This proposed methodology becomes crucial considering the important expansion that the Metro network will face by 2020; this is 37 km for two new lines and 6 km for two line extensions. These expansion projects will include 32 new stations, nine of them with transfer possibilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It elaborated a wide range of benefits from public transport services, to both users and non-users. In regard to non-users, there was a particular focus on the role of public transport in promoting positive external benefits, such as agglomeration economies, and reducing the negative external costs of car use. A number of ways in which the service funding requirement might be reduced by improved system management were considered, such as better fare evasion practices and more effective public private partnerships. A range of funding opportunities was then reviewed, from which two preferred bundles were developed. Value capture was seen as a vital funding opportunity, both for supporting operating funding and capital funding requirements. Funding circumstances that were seen as more properly a governmental responsibility were identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, the Theta method's performance in the M3-Competition caught researchers' attention. The Theta method, as implemented in the monthly subset of the M3-Competition, decomposes the seasonally adjusted data into two theta lines. The first theta line removes the curvature of the data in order to estimate the long-term trend component. The second theta line doubles the local curvatures of the series so as to approximate the shortterm behaviour. We provide generalisations of the Theta method. The proposed Dynamic Optimised Theta Model is a state space model that selects the best short-term theta line optimally and revises the long-term theta line dynamically. The superior performance of this model is demonstrated through an empirical application. We relate special cases of this model to state space models for simple exponential smoothing with a drift.

Nature-facing elements, including resource scarcity and environmental regulation, have seldom featured in GPN analysis. So, too, GPN analysis emphasizes spatial relations between network actors over temporal change. We extend GPN theorization through a temporal analysis of industrial change, connecting manufacturing to upstream resource materialities and shifting regulation, and to downstream consumers increasingly concerned with provenance and material stewardship. To illustrate, we document a resource-sensitive GPNacoustic guitar manufacturingwhere scarcity of select raw materials (tonewoods) with material qualities of resonance, strength, and beauty, as well as tighter regulation, has spawned shifting economic geographies of new actors who influence the whole GPN. Such actors include specialist extraction firms, salvagers, traders, verification consultants, and customs agents who innovate in procurement and raw material supply risk management. Traditional large guitar manufacturing firms have struggled with regulation and securing consistent resource supply, although smaller lead manufacturing firms have creatively responded via novel procurement methods and marketing, developing closely bound, iterative relationships with specialist timber harvesters, traders, and with emotionally attached consumers. A cohort of tonewood supply firms and guitar manufacturersespecially in Australia, the Pacific Northwest and Canada, key locations of both resource and design expertisehave together altered material stewardship practices and commodity production. Niche strategies derive exchange value from rarity and resource innovation, embracing raw material variability, inconsistent supply, and the need for alternatives. How firms adapt to resource supply security risks, we argue, is an imperative question for GPN analysis.","[Gibson, Chris; Warren, Andrew] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Gibson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cgibson@uow.edu.au; awarren@uow.edu.au,"Gibson, Chris/A-7733-2011","Gibson, Chris/0000-0002-7242-8255; Warren, Andrew/0000-0003-1022-7578",University of Wollongong Faculty of Social Sciences grant scheme [04/2015],University of Wollongong Faculty of Social Sciences grant scheme,This research received funding support from the University of Wollongong Faculty of Social Sciences grant scheme [grant number 04/2015].,,63,7,11,5,48,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

In this article, we examine MacAvoy's prescient critiques of the failure of antitrust and regulation to produce competitive markets for telecommunications services. We explain how the real competition has come from new products and innovation. Market power in the short run is the incentive that drives investment in research and development, and, in telecommunications, it is a small price to pay for innovative new services. Unfortunately, the experience in telecommunications has been one of regulatory delay of implementing new services and technology to level some hypothetical playing field rather than rewarding innovation with a temporary market advantage. We suggest that technical change enhanced by benign regulatory neglect is the answer to MacAvoy's question. It is the escape from counterproductive regulation to control market power in telecommunications.","[Hausman, Jerry A.] MIT, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Taylor, William E.] Natl Econ Res Associates Inc, White Plains, NY USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Hausman, JA (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jahausman@gmail.com; wtaylor276@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,2,2,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The findings of this literature survey identify new aspects of consumerism in digital markets that have the potential to enhance consumer well-being. The literature survey also revealed that consumer vulnerabilities have grown in complexity faster than regulative efforts.

The vast majority of that projected increasean estimated 97 percentwill occur in the developing world. Demography is not destiny, but population growth in the developing world is a challenge-multiplier. In recent decades, notable gains have been made in reducing the incidence of hunger and poverty in the world, but progress has been slow in countries with high fertility rates. The nations with the fastest growing populations tend to rank high on global indices of hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, and fragility; and many of these countries face enormous obstacles to economic development in the form of climate change, regional or ethnic conflict, or water scarcity. Most of these countries also have large numbers of unemployed young people between the ages of 15-24, a demographic factor that can contribute to, or exacerbate, political instability and conflict. Unless fertility rates in these countries fall faster than currently anticipated by demographers, many of these countries face an uncertain future. Lack of progress in improving living conditions in these countries could lead to greater political instability and conflict and increase the growing number of refugees and internally displaced persons in the world.","[Walker, Robert J.] Populat Inst, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Walker, Robert J.] Populat Resource Ctr, Austin, TX USA; [Walker, Robert J.] Common Cause Educ Fund, Washington, DC USA; [Walker, Robert J.] Handgun Control Inc, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Walker, Robert J.] Ctr Prevent Handgun Violence, San Francisco, CA USA; [Walker, Robert J.] Amer Assoc Retired Persons, Washington, DC USA; [Walker, Robert J.] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",American Association of Retired Persons (AARP); University of Sydney,"Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Populat Inst, Washington, DC 20002 USA.;Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Populat Resource Ctr, Austin, TX USA.;Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Common Cause Educ Fund, Washington, DC USA.;Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Handgun Control Inc, Washington, DC 20005 USA.;Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Ctr Prevent Handgun Violence, San Francisco, CA USA.;Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Amer Assoc Retired Persons, Washington, DC USA.;Walker, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rwalker@populationinstitute.org,,,,,,,48,14,20,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the current discussion on regulatory failures in CRAs' activities by testing the existence of a bias in CRAs' assessment due to conflict of interest. More specifically, we examine whether the solicitation of a rating by a sovereign affects the grade provided by rating agencies. Our empirical results, which are based on a two-step ordered probit for a large set of emerging and industrialized countries, address the issue of self-selection bias for ratings attributed by Standard & Poor's in 2013 and suggest that unsolicited ratings are higher than solicited ones, which goes against the traditional argument of conflict of interest, namely the blackmail hypothesis, and supports the idea that CRAs attach an important weight to their reputation in attributing sovereign ratings.

Nontrivial productivity gains due to increases in load factor and stage length explain the findings for FSCs. Unexplained technical change accounts for the cost increases for LCCs, while productivity gains due to increases in load factor and stage length and unexplained technical change contribute to cost declines for 'other' carriers.

The properties of a population tax and a tax on self-reported bag are analyzed and we begin by con sidering a baseline situation with full certainty and no use of self-reporting for population size estimation. Here individual hunters self-report a bag on zero and a population tax alone can secure an optimum. Next we show that when facing uncertain population size, a risk-averse hunter will self-report part of the bag to reduce the uncertain population tax payment, making both tax instruments necessary for reaching an optimum. Finally, when self-reported bag is used to estimate population size, we also show that it is optimal for hunters to report a part of the bag and both instruments are again necessary for reaching an optimum.

Using fixed-effect panel data models with a representative sample of firms for the period from 1997 to 2013, we observe that the investors' rights and their legal protection as well as the rule of law are associated with a premium in the firm market value. Contrary to what was expected, in immature financial markets, as found in Latin America, firms take advantage of both the asymmetries of information and the multiple market frictions to be overvalued. So, as the financial system develops, firm value drops. At the firm-level, results confirm the hypothesis of the expropriation of minority shareholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Instead of imposing a threshold value on the dynamics of the latent volatility process of the SV model, we assume that the innovation of the mean equation follows a threshold distribution in which the mean innovation switches between two regimes. In our model, the threshold is treated as an unknown parameter. We show that the proposed threshold SV model can not only capture the time-varying volatility of returns, but can also accommodate the asymmetric shape of conditional distribution of the returns. Parameter estimation is carried out by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. For model selection and volatility forecast, an auxiliary particle filter technique is employed to approximate the filter and prediction distributions of the returns. Several experiments are conducted to assess the robustness of the proposed model and estimation methods. In the empirical study, we apply our threshold SV model to three return time series. The empirical analysis results show that the threshold parameter has a non-zero value and the mean innovations belong to two separately distinct regimes. We also find that the model with an unknown threshold parameter value consistently outperforms the model with a known threshold parameter value.

The literature shows that the importance of quality attributes has until now been estimated indirectly, as they are derived from the Customer Satisfaction Index using various different and complex techniques. Little work has been dedicated to its direct estimation (stated importance) by designing ad-hoc surveys, an approach that represents a considerable reduction in the length of the questionnaire. This paper contributes to the limited existing literature by developing a survey technique based on hierarchy processes to estimate the stated importance of quality attributes, and compares the results with the derived importance obtained using conventional surveys with the same sample. The added value of this research is that it provides the first comparison between two quality survey methods using the same real case study in Madrid (Spain). The results achieved using this pioneer survey method (293 valid questionnaires) were validated using conventional face-to-face surveys (520 valid questionnaires). Factorial analysis, multiple regression analysis and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models were applied to the conventional survey sample to analyse and derive the importance of the attributes. The results clearly show that, after a few teething troubles, the stated importance of quality attributes can be estimated directly, thus providing transport management companies with a simple and useful tool to implement in their Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS), and narrowing the gap between practitioners' needs and scientific research.

If fire-sale liquidation imposes negative externalities on their peers, then firms can be collectively better off if they are all forced into a no-opt-out choice (a mandatory menu). This is the case even though they would individually want to commit themselves to liquidation, and it is collectively better for them than voluntary contract choice or mandatory liquidation. Our article's innovation is thus to show not when a later choice should be prohibited, but when a later choice should be mandatory.

These results are based on a stratified random sample of 241 investor-owned, 96 cooperative, and 94 municipal utilities in the United States between 1999 and 2012.

The Center began with roots in the anti-poverty movement in the 1970s. In subsequent years, the Center served as an activist research center that was devoted to serving the interests of the public and small farmers. For example, a Center study showed that center-pivot irrigation was an initial step toward heavy capitalization of agriculture, a process that increased the debt of farmers and eventually drove many of them into bankruptcy. In other studies, the Center examined specific policies that were indirectly depopulating rural areas by turning farming into an industry. Joining with other groups, the Center fought to keep Nebraska as free as possible from corporate farming. In contrast to organizations that are located in urban areas and analyze rural problems from a distance, the Center is located in a small town in Nebraska, so the staff are personally aware of rural conditions. In addition to describing the research and activism of the Center, this account also provides information about the early obstacles an advocacy group must overcome in terms of funding, building a strong board, and other factors.",,,,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The study is based on primary data collected through questionnaire survey from four case study communities in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, each of whom experience reduced access to public transport. Results show that out of home activity uptake is gender segregated. Men were more likely to travel for almost all activities. They were also more likely to either walk or use public transport for daily activity participation. On the other hand, women participated less frequently in the out of home activities. They were more likely to use personal automobile as well. Quantitative analyses highlight that transport related issues such as the financial costs of travel, availability and quality of public transport played a major role in shaping individual's activity participation. People often cut down their activities that required the use of motorized, particularly public transport. Women appeared to be additionally disadvantaged due to limited access to economic resources and increased reliance on personal means of transportation in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on data from 88 new product development (NPD) projects in Korea, this study found that there were six different types of champion role structures: two solo champion structures, three dual champion structures, and one triple champion structure. This study examined the characteristics of key people who played three different champion roles in terms of education level, functional area, and hierarchical position in the organisation. It also revealed that organisational complexity led to specialisation of the champion role structure. Role specialisation in championing activities in general and the existence of an executive champion in particular had a significant impact on uncertainty reduction in terms of technology, market, resource acquisition, and organisation support, which in turn led to higher performances in the innovation project.","[Kim, Youngbae] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, 85 Hoegi Ro, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Shim, Duksup] Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, 77 Yongbong Ro, Kwangju 500757, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Chonnam National University,"Shim, D (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, 77 Yongbong Ro, Kwangju 500757, South Korea.",dsshim71@chonnam.ac.kr,"Kim, Youngbae/C-1985-2011",,Korea Research Foundation - Korean Government (MOEHRD) [KRF-2007-327-B00220],"Korea Research Foundation - Korean Government (MOEHRD)(Ministry of Education & Human Resources Development (MOEHRD), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government)","This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD, Basic Research Promotion Fund) [KRF-2007-327-B00220].",,89,5,6,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

For investment goods, like health clubs, I find that the equilibrium sign-up (lump-sum) fees decrease when competition intensifies, similarly to prices in standard oligopoly models. However, the equilibrium attendance (per-unit) price increases due to firms' deteriorated ability to take advantage of consumers' self-control problems. Moreover, firms earn less profit due to consumers' self-control problems-the firms have a unilateral incentive to charge per-unit fees lower than the marginal cost; however, they cannot make up the lost margins by increasing the lump-sum fee, due to competition. I also show that for plausible parameter regions the market adjusts to consumers' self-control problem in such a way that firms play the standard equilibrium strategies that they would have engaged in with fully rational consumers, with identical market outcomes. Most of the results are qualitatively the same for leisure goods (for example, credit cards); however, some results are reversed: the per-unit fees are higher than marginal cost and decrease as competition intensifies.","[Alexandrov, Alexei] US Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, Washington, DC USA",,"Alexandrov, A (通讯作者)，US Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, Washington, DC USA.",Alexei.Alexandrov@cfpb.gov,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Overall, conditional on being reviewed, the probability that a case is reversed by a high court judicial panel is less than one half. To understand these findings, I develop a simple framework that connects reversals and panel size with the extent to which judicial decision-making is congruent with the law. Assuming the high court rules correctly more often than not, my empirical results suggest that increasing judicial panel size erodes the quality of decision-making in high courts.

The hub airport is congestible and it levies a per-flight charge on its carriers and discriminatory per-passenger charges on the local and connecting passengers. Our main results are: (i) the socially optimal per-passenger charges should take the higher congestion contribution by connecting passengers into account, leading to a higher charge on a connecting passenger than on a local passenger; (ii) generally, the social optimum cannot be achieved when the hub only levies a per-flight charge on carriers; (iii) the optimal per-connecting passenger charge should be lower (higher, respectively) than the per local passenger charge when the per-flight charge is large (small, respectively); and (iv) a profit maximizing hub can impose lower per-connecting passenger charges as compared to per-local passenger charges, owing to its market power, and this possibility is further strengthened by economies of traffic density.

Consumer attitude towards GMO depends on a number of factors including the information obtained from a variety of information sources (scientific papers, TV, radio, relatives, friends etc.) and trust in regulatory actors involved in decision making process and stakeholders. Many consumers report that they receive information about genetically modified (GM) products from the media, Internet and other news sources. These sources may be less reliable than scientific experts whom consumers trust more to present the facts. Trust in regulatory actors and stakeholders involved in handling of GMO is important as they are primary source of information about new technologies. In all walks of life, individuals often look to others to help them make decisions, in particularly, when they admit a personal lack of knowledge in that area. However, if these actors are not trusted, their claims are likely to fall on deaf ears, or be consciously rejected. A lack of trust in public officials in this regard is likely to further erode public support for use of GMO. The survey method was chosen as a tool to collect data and elicit Latvian consumers' attitude towards use of GMO in different industries. The survey was composed of 18 questions; seven of them have been structured on one to ten-point scale. The survey data of Latvia's inhabitants (N = 1184) were collected by the telemarketing company from September 2014 until June 2015. To select the units to be included in the sample systematic sampling was applied - every twentieth inhabitant was approached by phone call and invited to answer on survey questions. In the frame of this research the part of the results obtained were discussed regarding the media's role in shaping public opinion, and how trust in regulatory actors and stakeholder impacts consumers' attitude towards GMO in Latvia. The results of Latvian consumers' survey showed Latvians' attitude towards GMO were sceptical; less positive towards GM animals compared to GM plants. It was also indicated that scientific publications were the most trustful information source on GMO but friends and relatives - the lowest evaluated information source. Public trust in regulatory actors and stakeholders involved in handling of GMO played an important role on consumers' attitude shaping regarding GMO.","[Aleksejeva, Inese] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Aleksejeva, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",aleksejeva.inese@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,11,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,19,32,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200002,0

The presented research aims at proving validation values of described models in predicting possible bankruptcy signals and evaluating the financial condition of the TSL sector (transport, spedition, logistics) entities from Poland and Slovakia. In order to predict the risk of company bankruptcy from the logistics sector, the following statistical models of bankruptcy classification were used: classic linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression. What is more, the predictions based on the so-called classification trees and the method of nearest neighbours was applied. The empirical verification of correct classification by given groups of methods of statistical bankruptcy analysis from the perspective of their efficiency showed that these methods could be characterized with a high quality of bankruptcy prediction. The presented concepts allow evaluating quite easily the threat of bankruptcy for a given group of entities. One vital advantage of the presented results is the fact of dividing research sample into the so-called learning group, for which parameters of the analysed models were estimated, and the test sample researching effectiveness of proper classifications, for which all the predictions were set for a period of both one and two years before the bankruptcy.","[Brozyna, Jacek; Mentel, Grzegorz; Pisula, Tomasz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Quantitat Methods, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Brozyna, J; Mentel, G; Pisula, T (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Quantitat Methods, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland.",jacek.brozyna@prz.edu.pl; gmentel@prz.edu.pl; tpisula@prz.edu.pl,"Mentel, Grzegorz/T-1850-2018; Brożyna, Jacek/P-3090-2014; Pisula, Tomasz/J-9399-2019","Mentel, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6371-1219; Brożyna, Jacek/0000-0001-5632-7262; Pisula, Tomasz/0000-0001-7111-9955",,,,,19,14,14,0,24,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We use a two-step procedure where the common factors extracted from the firm-level data are subsequently used as predictors in nowcasting regressions. The results show that large firm-level datasets are useful for predicting aggregate economic activity in a timely fashion. The proposed factor-based nowcasting model leads to a superior out-of-sample nowcasting performance relative to the benchmark autoregressive model, even for early nowcasts. Moreover, we find that the quarterly GDP flash estimates that we construct provide a useful real-time alternative to the current official estimates, without any substantial loss of nowcasting accuracy.

It deepened the inefficiency use of healthcare resources. In the foreground of urgent problems is the unresolved issue of ensuring health policy objectives, the availability and quality of health care and the financial sustainability of the system. The indebtedness of Slovak hospitals disproportionately increases and in international comparison of results of healthcare is Slovakia gradually moving away from developed countries. One form of increasing the efficiency of the health system is to support the development of day surgery, which in Slovakia in during its 15 years of existence stagnating and reached only a level of 7%. The aim of the study is to analyze the level of implementation of pediatric day surgery in Slovakia, with special focus on possible regional discrepancies, based on the data available from the National Health Information Centre. This topic was chosen due to specificity of pediatric population compared to the adult one. Analysis revealed uneven trends in the number of completed pediatric day surgery procedures and specified regional disparities. Extreme fluctuations in the proportions of day surgery and traditional in-hospital surgical care suggest deliberate misuse of reporting methodology by some healthcare providers (reporting day surgery procedures as in-hospital care) in various regions during the analyzed period. This observation may be caused by the instability of reimbursement system. With respect to the financial issues, the importance of health insurance companies is obvious, as they have the right to set their own payment strategies and are responsible for the contractual relations with the health care providers. To achieve positive progress in the pediatric day surgery in Slovakia, it is necessary to adjust the active health policy in the country in a way that the balance among the quality of health care, costs, efficiency and equality is achieved.","[Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia; [Soltes, Marek] Safarik Univ, Dept Surg 1, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.;Soltes, M (通讯作者)，Safarik Univ, Dept Surg 1, Kosice, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; marek.soltes@upjs.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Soltes, Marek/AAL-3483-2020","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Soltes, Marek/0000-0002-5990-5547",VEGA Project Multidimensional economic and financial evaluation of the implementation process and the use of one day health care and quantification of the financial impact on the health care system in the Slovak Republic [1/0929/14],VEGA Project Multidimensional economic and financial evaluation of the implementation process and the use of one day health care and quantification of the financial impact on the health care system in the Slovak Republic,This work was supported by the VEGA Project No. 1/0929/14 Multidimensional economic and financial evaluation of the implementation process and the use of one day health care and quantification of the financial impact on the health care system in the Slovak Republic.,,54,19,19,0,8,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The effect of household income on commuting distance may be positive, because of an increased demand for housing as house prices are lower further from workplace locations, or negative, because of an increase in the value of travel time. In addition, the sign of this effect may depend on the location of residential amenities relative to workplaces. Empirical tests of this effect are not standard, due to reverse causation and lack of good control variables. To address reverse causation, this effect is derived using changes in household income and distance through residential moves keeping workplace location constant. Our results contradict previous results in the literature. We show that for Denmark, conditional on the workplace location, the income elasticity of distance is negative and in the order of -0.18. This elasticity is larger for single-earner than for dual-earner households. Conditional on that the household moves residence between municipalities, the elasticity is suggested to be around -0.60.","[Gutierrez-i-Puigarnau, Eva; van Ommeren, Jos N.] CPB Bur Econ Policy Anal Climate & Reg Econ, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Mulalic, Ismir; van Ommeren, Jos N.] Tech Univ Denmark, Bygningstorvet Bldg 116 Vest, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tinbergen Inst Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Technical University of Denmark; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Puigarnau, EGI (通讯作者)，CPB, Sect 5,Postbus 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",E.Gutierrez.Puigarnau@cpb.nl,,"Mulalic, Ismir/0000-0002-5525-6391; Van Ommeren, Jos/0000-0003-4838-478X",DBR,DBR,This research has been supported financially by DBR.,,42,22,22,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Results of the study indicate that ISO 9001 certified companies were having significantly greater benefits and financial performance compared to non-certified companies. However, no significant direct relationship between ISO 9001 certification and company's financial performance was found. A further investigation revealed that financial performance is actually directly related to quality and local and international business performance, which are significantly influenced by ISO 9001 certification. Therefore quality and business performances are involved in the mediational process between the financial performance of companies and ISO 9001 certification. The novelty of this research lies in the establishment of, for the first time, high level statistical relationship between ISO 9001 certification, its mediating factors and financial performance of companies.","[Islam, Mohammad Mazharul] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, POB 344, Rabigh 21911, Saudi Arabia; [Habes, Essam] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, POB 80201, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Karim, Azharul] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Engn Syst, Dept Mech Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [bin Syed Agil, Syed Omar] Inst Profess Maitulmal, Lot 1363 Jalan Perkasa, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Islam, MM (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, POB 344, Rabigh 21911, Saudi Arabia.",malislam@kau.edu.sa; ehabes@gmail.com; azharul.karim@qut.edu.au; syedomar@ipb.edu.my,"Islam, Mohammad Mazharul/A-8481-2013","Karim, Azharul/0000-0001-9074-0384",,,,,28,13,14,1,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The independent variable was internal marketing factor represented by several dimensions namely, development, vision, internal communications, rewards and empowerment adopted from the models of Foreman and Money (1995). The dependent variable was job satisfaction factor, represented by several dimensions namely; pay, promotions, supervision, work and co-workers, adopted from Stanton (2002). The study made use of a survey questionnaire distributed to 407 Yemeni bank employees, after which data was analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics, and exploratory factor analysis. Added to this, the study used the structural equation modeling and the findings confirmed that internal marketing has a significant relationship with job satisfaction. In examining model fit, the value of fit statistics (GFI=.95, CFI=.975 and RMSEA=.068) indicated that the hypothesized model fitted the data.

Introducing the Flipped Classroom method focusses the teacher's attention on knowledge acquisition in face-to-face sessions by providing online preparation beforehand. This approach promotes meaningful learning and media competencies by applying a sensible mix of multi-media tools that is able to offer any kind of content online, thereby leaving time for group work and discussions when learners and teachers actually meet. Focusing on part-time students needs, a scheme of interchanging phases has been compiled in an explorative design by the means of literature review and design science. This approach is the centre of the description of how of how to flip a classroom successfully under ideal conditions; moreover, the approach will be put to use in real-life circumstances, which will provide further knowledge on details such as choice of tools, schedule construction and general organisation. This project achieves two outcomes. Firstly, it allows for an independent, scalable framework, which can be adapted to different learners' and teachers' needs as well as different contents and numbers of students; not only in part-time situations but in distant learning and regular courses as well.

Creativity is an ambivalent and contradictory phenomenon that covers both positive and negative aspects. As a result, management of creativity faces some paradoxes. The paper deals with 10 paradoxes of creativity management including one grand paradox (GP) and nine minor paradoxes (MP). By stimulating creativity, the managers risk to provoke the disobedience for their instructions including an instruction to develop creativity (GP). Successful period of an organization is an obstacle to develop the creative ideas (MP1). A radical implementation of creative ideas threatens the identity of organization (MP2). Creativity provokes the conflicts in organization (MP3). Every inventor or innovator tries to negate his (her) social environment that has educated and stimulated him (her) (MP4). Although hard management kills creativity, the latter needs sometimes very hard decisions (MP5). The worse the results are, the more creative the decisions in organization are (MP6). Organizations should manage both quantity and quality (MP7). Organization needs not only management of knowledge but also management of ignorance and naivete (MP8). The managers should forget the past success of organization and think about future end of it (MP9). The main aim of this paper is to describe these paradoxes. Another aim is to present the different approaches towards creativity management. Finally, the paper seeks to dethrone a naive attitude that creativity in economy solves all possible problems. The biggest challenge to the management is the very creativity.","[Kacerauskas, Tomas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Creat Ind, Dept Philosophy & Commun, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Kacerauskas, T (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Creat Ind, Dept Philosophy & Commun, Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas.kacerauskas@vgtu.lt,"Kacerauskas, Tomas/AAG-9281-2020","Kacerauskas, Tomas/0000-0003-2761-5913",,,,,62,5,6,1,24,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Using data from a sample of 68 manufacturing firms listed on the South African JSE, this paper contributes to the literature by investigating the source of investment cash flow sensitivity. We have found that asymmetric information explains the positive investment cash flow sensitivity better than agency costs. Furthermore, asymmetric information has been observed to be more pronounced in low-dividend-paying firms and small firms. Despite South Africa's having a developed financial system by international standards, small firms are seen to be financially constrained. We attribute the absence of investment cash flow sensitivity due to agency costs to good corporate governance of South African listed firms. Thus the paper provides further evidence in support of the proposition in the literature that the source of investment cash flow sensitivity may depend on the institutional setting of a country, such as its corporate governance.","[Makina, Daniel; Wale, Letenah Ejigu] Univ South Africa, Dept Finance Risk Management & Banking, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Makina, D (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Finance Risk Management & Banking, Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Makina, Daniel/P-2903-2014",,,,,,44,3,4,0,9,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

During the session, a lady asked him: Mr. Gates, Dead Aid, a book by Dambisa Moyo, illustrates that giving more aid to Africa over the course of the years did not alleviate poverty, instead it kept the economy crippled with governments asking for more aid. This fluke made a cycle of aid giving which resulted in nothing productive and it has not been used to solve the immediate problems and the money is not being used to make businesses sustainable in Africa. What's the foundation's view in this regard? To which Mr. Gates responded Books like that are promoting evil. Mr. Gates' sound bite sheds light upon aid as a topic of controversy: in his creed, aid is humane, virtuous and will do the global poor a world of good while anti-aid literature is evil. From Tibor Mende and his famous book From aid to the re-colonization (bestseller in the 70s) to Dambisa Moyo and her book Dead Aid, the issue of assistance to poor countries has been much talked about. Between the fifteen billion dollars transferred to Europe under the Marshall Plan and the thousand billion dollars sucked up by the sub-Saharan Africa since independence, we have come to understand that a poorly-designed assistance automatically produces stateaid recipients. In this paper we will endeavor to weigh the geopolitical and geo-economic impacts of aid and demonstrate why aid, presumably an altruistic deed for the benefit of the poor and the needy, has sparked such a hot debate.","[Nechad, Abdelhamid] ESCA EM, 7 Rue Abou Youssouf Al Kindy, Casablanca, Morocco",,"Nechad, A (通讯作者)，ESCA EM, 7 Rue Abou Youssouf Al Kindy, Casablanca, Morocco.",nechad22@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,203,215,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700023,0

Effective marketing communication should minimize the information asymmetry. The study is primarily related to communication through packaging. The following hypothesis was formulated: the more a consumer knows about food, the more likely they are to look for the information on the product packaging. We assume that the consumers' search for information leads to equalizing the level of knowledge between the consumer and the producer, and thus contributes to the reduction of information asymmetry. Moreover, if the consumer knows more about food, they are less susceptible to manipulation used in marketing communications. Misleading messages or claims increase information asymmetry between producers and consumers, but a well-informed consumer will not believe in any misleading information provided by the manufacturer.","[Nestorowicz, Renata] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Mkt Strategies, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Nestorowicz, R (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Mkt Strategies, Poznan, Poland.",r.nestorowicz@ue.poznan.pl,,"Nestorowicz, Renata/0000-0002-7510-3747",,,,,13,0,0,1,11,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,525,534,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_39,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900039,0

The research aim - to define the conception of sustainable leadership and to carry out research in sustainable leadership - has been implemented. The employed research methods included analysis of scientific literature, comparison, synthesis, methods of summarisation and logical abstraction, and a questionnaire. For the research, non-stochastic random selection of respondents was chosen. 5,142 organisations were invited to participate; however, only 311 questionnaires were filled in and returned. We sought to involve organisations from different fields of activity in our research. The majority of the respondents came from the field of services, as well as of the fields of trade, education, and industry. As established, there were great differences between state-owned and private business organisations with respect to sustainable leadership. Thus, e.g., the respondents of state-owned organisations mainly tended to disagree that the leaders of their enterprises focused on the development and reinforcement of organisational values and that the organisational values coincided with the employees' personal values, while the respondents from the organisations of private. To sum up, we can conclude that business organisations were more guided by the principles of sustainable leadership than the state-owned organisations.","[Simanskiene, Ligita; Zuperkiene, Erika; Pauzuoliene, Jurgita] Klaipeda Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Klaipeda University,"Simanskiene, L (通讯作者)，Klaipeda Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",ligita.simanskiene@gmail.com,"Pauzuoliene, Jurgita/HCI-7503-2022; Zuperkiene, Erika/AAB-7774-2021; Šimanskienė, Ligita/AAA-2764-2021","Pauzuoliene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1034-2296; Zuperkiene, Erika/0000-0002-1505-0962;",,,,,32,0,3,1,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,653,667,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200057,0

The research methodology is based on a comparative and dynamic analysis of the indicators that characterize the level of economic development, the potential for innovation, the technical progress and innovative performance across eight countries members of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The study results indicate that the economic level is positively influenced by the innovation and technical progress stimulation, through allocating a larger percentage of GDP to the research - development expenditures and through a prevailing involvement of business actors in these activities. Also, the technical progress determines the increase of production factors productivity and thus, a greater economic performance. Th governments must stimulate the innovation and technical progress, in order to record growth and to be competitive in the global knowledge economy. Considering that innovation and technical progress are the main market triggers that generate economic growth, the research findings have practical implications. Thus, the results may substantiate the decisions making regarding the economic growth strategy based on innovation, at both macroeconomic and microeconomic level.","[Stefan, Gavril] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Iasi, Romania; [Coca, Oana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania","Iasi University of Life Sciences, Romania; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University","Stefan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Iasi, Romania.",stefang@uaiasi.ro; oanacok@yahoo.com,"Coca, Oana/AAY-5277-2021",,,,,,35,1,1,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,497,506,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700051,0

Performance orientation and flexibility are typical for Y generation on the labour market. They are considered as tech geeks who are really opened to innovations. In this research we analysed job search attitudes with the participation of students in higher education. During the job search preference analysis we examined the considered factors in employment by the young generation. Based on the literature it is observed that job-seekers do not decide mainly on income to accept or decline a job.

Understanding relative degrees of 'adoption readiness' provides innovators with information to choose market segments and indicates opportunities to influence adoption environments. However, there is a little research into the adoption readiness of countries upon which firms can base their new service development decisions. This paper considers these issues through the case of digital money, a service innovation some claim to have the potential to provide major economic and social benefits. Defined as 'currency exchange by electronic means', we conceptualise digital money as a socio-technical system, and propose a Digital Money Readiness Index. This composite index integrates institutional, financial, technological, economic, industrial and social attributes to measure adoption readiness. We identify four stages of readiness and systematically analyse the factors that drive under or over adoption of digital money technologies.","[Thomas, Llewellyn D.

This soft system consisting of a time banking social-economy approach can be described in terms of complementary economics. Its aim is to build communities on basis of equal economic exchange. The use of time banking, like any other system, is often negatively affected by recurring issues which can be identified as system archetypes.

Some global and European level indices were created to be able to capture digitization and ITC related processes. One of such indicator is The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI, European Union level) that was created in context with digital agenda for Europe in 2020. The other is Network Readiness Index (NRI, global level). Also other indicators exist showing country's performance compared with other countries. In this paper the authors compares these indicators between Latvia and other EU countries. No previous research exist that analysis both indicators for European Union. If we take some of the latest indicators in Latvia and compare with previous years, many have improved. This is good. Unfortunately, it turns out that it is not enough. It is revealed that overall Latvia show low performance in mentioned indicators compared with average level of European Union, as well as the other Baltic States. Accordingly in DESI 2015 Latvia has rank 18 (among 28 EU countries), while Lithuanian rank is 11, but Estonian is 7. If we take The Global Information Technology Report 2015, then Latvian rank is 33 (among 143 countries), while Lithuania is 31th and Estonia is 22. Latvia is the lowest in the EU in Integration of Digital Technology dimension; very low indicators are related to selling on-line and cross-border online sales. Other indicators reveal that internet usage by businesses is very low, for example, companies don't fully use internet marketing. There are at least two main cons for country showing low performance. First, these indicators highlight issues that should be improved and identify where more should be done to improve digitization impact on country's performance. Second, the author analyzes indicators that are usually compared within different countries and widely published Thus providing policymakers and business with insights into current market conditions. For country place marketing it is essential to have better results in such indicators as DESI or NRI. This low performance can result in spoiled prestige, while high performance can improve country's reputation. We all know good examples of country level marketing. For instance, Finland for years is known as country with an excellent education system, because of showing high performance within some indicators that were widely compared with other countries.","[Vidruska, Renate] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Vidruska, R (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",renate.vidruska@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,901,916,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200077,0

Over time, federal courts in general-and the U.S. Supreme Court in particular, under Chief Justice Roberts-have in substantial part adopted Easterbrook's limits of antitrust approach, thereby helping to reduce costly antitrust uncertainty. Recently, however, antitrust enforcers in the Obama Administration (unlike their predecessors in the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Administrations) have been less attuned to this approach, and have undertaken initiatives that reduce clarity and predictability in antitrust enforcement. Regardless of the cause of the diverging stances on the limits of antitrust, two things are clear. First, recent enforcement agency policies are severely at odds with the philosophy that informs Supreme Court antitrust jurisprudence. Second, if the agencies do not reverse course, acknowledge antitrust's limits, and seek to optimize the law in light of those limits, consumers will suffer.","[Lambert, Thomas A.] Univ Missouri, Sch Law, Wall Family Chair Corp Law & Governance, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Abbott, Alden F.] Heritage Fdn, Edwin Meese Ctr Legal & Judicial Studies 3, New York, NY USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Lambert, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Sch Law, Wall Family Chair Corp Law & Governance, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",lambertt@missouri.edu; alden.abbott@heritage.org,,,,,,,111,0,0,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Contrary to the common practice of using equal combination weights, we compute weights which are optimal in the sense that they minimize the mean square forecast error (MSFE) in the case of point forecasts and maximize a logarithmic score in the case of density forecasts. We show that this is a viable strategy even when the number of forecasts to be combined gets large, provided that we constrain these weights to be positive and to sum to one. Indeed, this enforces a form of shrinkage on the weights which ensures a reasonable out-of-sample performance of the combined forecasts. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters.

The degree of independence is defined with respect to the principal owners, the management of the firm, and the employees. This definition of independence and the accessibility of detailed data on corporate governance variables, enable precise measurements of board-member independency. The results of this analysis indicate that the directors, who are dependent on the management of the firm, dominate the board of directors. Board-member independence positively affects a firm's financial performance. The negative effect of board-member dependency originates from the firm-related directors, whereas dependence on principal owners, families, and employees does not impact a firm's investment performance. These results are important in the contemporary political debate about the role and the composition of boards of directors. The result of the analysis shows that the definition of independence is important when discussing boards of directors. Directors, independent of the firm, positively influence a firm's investment performance.","[Palmberg, Johanna] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, SE-11156 Stockholm, Sweden; [Palmberg, Johanna] Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Palmberg, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Kungsgatan 33,7trp, SE-11156 Stockholm, Sweden.",johanna.palmberg@entreprenorskapsforum.se,,,Sparbankernas Forskningsstiftelse; Alfa Sparbankstiftelsen; CeFEO (Centre for Family Enterprise and Ownership),Sparbankernas Forskningsstiftelse; Alfa Sparbankstiftelsen; CeFEO (Centre for Family Enterprise and Ownership),"I would like to thank Professor Per-Olof Bjuggren, Ratio and Jonkoping International Business School and Professor Ake E.

However, the equalisation model is lacking in transparency, with few details publicly available as to its exact specification. Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to critically assess fiscal equalisation in Ireland's local government system. More specifically we address the question of whether general purpose equalisation grants bear any relation to expenditure needs and fiscal resources. We achieve this by estimating our own model based upon a number of indicators of potential need and available resources. We outline a number of alternative equalisation models based on different objective criteria, and compare the simulated allocations resulting from the alternative models to the actual general purpose grants, with a view to partly explaining past allocations but also identifying improvements in the future design of fiscal equalisation in Ireland. Our findings show politically sensitive redistribution away from county councils towards city councils, resulting in new winners and losers. The results for Dublin City Council raise the question of whether, given its population size, level of economic activity and budget, it should be treated separately and as a special case with respect to intergovernmental fiscal relations in Ireland.","[Turley, Gerard; McNena, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Flannery, Darragh] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Limerick,"Turley, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",gerard.turley@nuigalway.ie,"flannery, darragh/F-2722-2015","flannery, darragh/0000-0001-7192-8621; Turley, Gerard/0000-0001-8059-7123; McNena, Stephen/0000-0001-7181-1175",,,,,33,3,3,0,3,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Results indicated evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and non-fatal road injuries for both less developed and highly developed countries.

Current heterogeneity in EU port regulation is widely recognised as having an impact on the competitiveness of ports. Moreover, Port Authorities have to take into account a wide range of goals in order to manage the interactions with private operators responsible for port activities. Thus, some trade-offs emerge, as in some cases a revenue stream or a strategic objective for the Port Authority may imply a cost for the concessionaire. This paper discusses how concession agreements can contribute to regulating these trade-offs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When the class sizes are highly unbalanced and the minority class represents a rare event, conventional regression analysis, i.e.logistic regression models, could underestimate the probability of the rare event. To overcome this drawback, we introduce a flexible skewed link function based on the quantile function of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution in a generalized additive model (GAM). The proposed model is known as generalized extreme value additive (GEVA) regression model, and a modified version of the local scoring algorithm is suggested to estimate it. We apply the proposed model to a dataset on Italian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to estimate the default probability of SMEs. Our proposal performs better than the logistic (linear or additive) model in terms of predictive accuracy.

While underlying much of the literature on abortion legalization, this effect had only been approximated by previous work. We find a strong decline in the prevalence of unintended births. Moreover, we find that this decline is mainly driven by pro-choice women. We then propose an empirical strategy to recover the effect of being unintended on life cycle outcomes. We use the differential timing of abortion legalization across states interacted with the mother's religion (which facilitates or hinders legal abortion take up) to instrument for endogenous pregnancy intention. We find that being unintended causes negative outcomes (higher crime, lower schooling, lower earnings) over the life cycle.

This analysis allows identifying some factors that systematically influence forest values. However, it also reveals a lack of a systematized approach to valuation and a lack of sufficiently coherent evidence.

Even considering citizen resistance, cultural adversity or changes in the economic agents' relationship, few would contest that concern over the state of electronic government (e-government) has increased over the years. This concern has been responsible for the emergence of a wide range of new initiatives devoted to development of the information and knowledge society, which occupies a central place in government policies and planning strategies worldwide. In this paper, we aim to analyze the evolutionary patterns of e-government in Portugal and, based on an application of the Delphi technique, provide development prospects considering the perceptions of a panel of administrative agents.

A growing theme of these studies also suggests that the role of client influence should not be understated in explaining the accuracy and variation of valuation outcomes. However, empirical studies on client influence to date have mainly been carried out in the developed markets and lack evidence on the extent of this phenomenon in the developing property markets. The main aim of this study is therefore to examine client influence phenomenon holistically from a developing property market perspective. Considering this research aim and the need to get an in-depth understanding of client influence within the valuation process, a qualitative methodology was utilised. A total of nineteen one-to-one semi-structured interviews with property companies, REITs and valuers in Malaysia facilitated the understanding of each stage of the valuation process. This led to the identification of six main factors affecting client influence in the case study market. These are valuer characteristics, valuation firm characteristics, client factors, valuation characteristics, regulatory framework and valuation process. The results indicate that external factors such as regulation and market environment do affect the degree to which clients influence valuations. The comparative analysis of these factors with the existing client influence framework reveals some new contributory factors such as valuer and valuation firm long-term view of business, reputation risk, valuer information power, client misconception of market value, use of judgement in valuation approach and professional vs. businessman role perception of the valuer. A client influence framework relating to the case study market is proposed utilising these main factors and sub-factors.","[Achu, Kamalahasan] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Property Management, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Achu, K (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Property Management, Utm Johor Bahru 81310, Malaysia.",kamalahasan@utm.my,"ACHU, KAMALAHASAN/M-3596-2013",,,,,,48,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,4123,4137,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700422,0

Project-based firms are increasingly moving towards the realization that innovation management is an integral part of any organizational strategy and the same is true for project-based firms. Moreover, the current body of knowledge regarding project-based firms does not incorporate any findings regarding the integration or use of innovation management in project management. As a result, it becomes important to research organizations to see how innovation management is applied in organizations and what the perspective is regarding innovation in organizations. Secondly, the question of whether slack resources can contribute to higher levels of innovation must also be researched. It has been a longstanding viewpoint that a lack of resources or limited resources results in higher levels of innovation. This study analyzes these two main viewpoints using qualitative analysis of 12 firms. The findings add to the current literature on innovation in organizations and project based firms while expanding the knowledge on innovation.","[ALQubaisi, Saif Saeed] Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Project & Supply Chain Management, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"ALQubaisi, SS (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Project & Supply Chain Management, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",Saif_alqubaisi@hotmail.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2142,2151,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700214,0

But the attainment of industrialization and the accompanying economic stability that guarantee wellbeing for the population have not been that easy for the developing nations. In the free-for all quest for economic advancement, each people, nation, and continent adopt strategies it deems appropriate to pursue its goal. Agriculture have been a common denominator for all nations of the earth, whether developed or under developed. That has been the starting point for the advanced nations through the primitive age to the industrial revolution age to the present information/knowledge worker's age. Africa also started with agriculture through the primitive age to the current information/knowledge worker's age without much to show in terms of economic stability and wellbeing of it citizens. This can be traced to the various approaches they adopted towards industrialization. Before independence, most African countries experienced sustainable growth with agriculture as the core activity. The subsequent discovery and exploitation of various types of mineral resources made many African nations to misplace focus on agriculture. Since then, many African nations including Nigeria have been faced with unsustainable burden of increasing food importation bill, which opens doors to crises that can easily destabilize a nation. The paper presents some failed industrialization strategies of Nigeria and explores the possibility of re-focusing on agriculture as the base for re-inventing the African giant's industrial revolution.

It allows us to estimate the probability of transition into and out of employment and the labour market. Our analyses reported that ethnic minorities were, more likely than their White peers, to become unemployed and less likely to become employed. Living in a deprived neighbourhood was associated (positively) with transitions to unemployment and (negatively) with transitions to employment, especially among men. Ethnic diversity was negatively associated with job loss among employed women, but also for homemaking women and their chances of finding employment.

But consumers tend to buy the food which is insured by the food safety insurance, and this tendency is proportional to consumers' concerns about food safety and their incomes. Consumers have the feeling that the insured food is safer and higher quality than those not insured. But the consumers are not willing to pay more to buy the insured food.

The main contradictions that are considered in this paper comprise inventory, pricing and marketing costs in an unlimited three echelon supply chain. The basics of the game theory make it a suitable and reliable tool for solving contradiction situations by considering all the levels and players' goals. Initially, an unlimited three echelon supply chain, including S suppliers, M manufacturers, and K retailers, is considered in order to solve the aforementioned problem. Further on, a nonlinear mathematical cooperative model based on specific assumptions, game theory approach, Nash equilibrium definition, Pareto efficiency, and revenue sharing contract is proposed. Subsequently, the proposed model is employed in a numerical example, and the results are illustrated according to the genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the proposed model is analysed using the design of experiment.

Dividend payout to shareholders can be considered to be the distribution of economic results while fulfilling legal conditions. The goal of this article is to identify factors that have a fundamental influence on dividend payout and to further determine and evaluate the position of management on dividend theories. This problematic is current for the conditions of Czech joint-stock companies, because deeper studies in this area are not available for recent years. Nevertheless, currently, the greater majority of joint-stock companies now regularly pay dividends, and dividend policy has become a part of their financial policy that is impossible to overlook With regards to the fact that profit is the necessary condition for dividend payout, research was aimed at the sector, Production and Distribution of Electricity, Gas and Water, which is most interesting among Czech joint-stock companies from the perspective of profitability and frequency of dividend payout. For the reasons of quantitative research, a two-part questionnaire was created for workers in financial management specifically, members of the executive board, who are assumed to have comprehensive knowledge and an overview of the company. The survey showed that the most important factors for management when making decisions concerning dividend payout are the following: the requirements of existing shareholders, access to funds, the actual amount of profit and maintaining the target state of debt. Further results confirmed that dividend policy does influence firm value. However, dividends are not supported as a tool for lowering information asymmetry and agency costs between management and shareholders. This conclusion can be caused by ownership structure when the firms investigated are characterized by high concentration of ownership; then, one shareholder is able to better protect the other shareholders against the implementation of management's interests.","[Sejkora, Frantisek; Duspiva, Pavel] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Business Econ & Management, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Sejkora, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Business Econ & Management, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",frantisek.sejkora@upce.cz; pavel.duspiva@upce.cz,,,,,,,35,10,10,0,25,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Therefore author create the hypothesis about positive relationship between advertising expenditure and GDP that will be tested based on the regression analysis. The results of the content analysis of different researches, statistics, journals etc. show that the advertising industry in China is one of the fastest growing industries in China. The results of regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between advertising spending and GDP in China at the 99 % confidence level.","[Slaba, Marie] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Tourism & Mkt, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Slabá, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Tourism & Mkt, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",slaba@mail.vstecb.cz,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,941,951,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700091,0

There are number of EU member states which are using environmental pollution taxes as the main economic instrument of atmospheric air pollution reduction. The energy sector is the main source of atmospheric pollution therefore environmental taxes should have direct impact on sustainable energy development as these taxes create incentives to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and to switch to renewables and cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas. The comparative study of environmental taxes and indicators of sustainable energy sector development in Baltics and Czech Republic and Slovakia was performed to assess what role environmental taxes are playing in achieving sustainable energy development in selected new EU member states. Analysis of environmental taxes in three Baltic States and Czech Republic indicated quite different energy and pollution tax rates as well as quite large differences in the share of environmental tax revenues as percentages of GDP in these countries. Estonia distinguishes with the best results in greening environmental tax system and one of the best results in achieving sustainable energy development targets. Latvia has one of the lowest share of environmental taxes as percentage of GDP and has very high shares of renewables in electricity generation and in final energy consumption however it is more related with favourable climate conditions and well developed hydro power plants.,"[Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Vilnius, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@khf.vu.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,26,7,7,0,21,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Some geographers have suggested that such defiant ideologies are unworthy of serious critique because they are so self-evidently contradicted by local circumstances. The case calls into question the assumption that local circumstance naturally challenges ideological framings such as neoliberalism. Many local details contradict the veracity of idealised neoliberalism, yet its promoters are able to actively morph them (or elide them) into a narrative that supports the wider ideology.","[Hackworth, Jason] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",University of Toronto,"Hackworth, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",jason.hackworth@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,45,13,15,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

J,"Ohlhausen, MK",,,,"Ohlhausen, Maureen K.",,,ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION AT THE FTC: EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR DEVELOPING THE LAW OR RUBBER STAMP?,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENFORCEMENT,"!This article provides the most comprehensive study to date of the Federal Trade Commission's Part 3 process. A unique and defining tool, Part 3 allows the FTC to challenge alleged section 5 violations in-house through administrative litigation. Highlighting the agency's expertise, Congress gave the FTC that authority in 1914 to develop antitrust and later consumer-protection law. Although the Commission has used its Part 3 authority to good effect, especially in some recent competition matters, the process is controversial on due-process grounds. After it finds reason to believe that a violation exists and authorizes staff to litigate before an independent Administrative Law Judge, the Commission reviews the ALJ's decision de novo. The result, some critics argue, is a foregone conclusion. Rather than advance the law, they contend, Part 3 frees the Commission to reach its favored result. Maligned in some quarters as a kangaroo court in which the FTC alleges and later summarily confirms section 5 violations, the key question is whether administrative litigation effectively fulfills the role Congress set out for it. To resolve the debate, we need a clearer picture of how Part 3 operates. Does the FTC rubber stamp its prior determinations, invariably siding with complaint counsel? Or does it change course at the appeal stage and, if so, how often? And, when it does find a section 5 violation on appeal, how often does the FTC nevertheless prune counts and allegations, suggesting that it scrutinizes the factual and legal record before it? Do the answers change with the political constitution of the Commission, such as when a Democratic majority votes out a Part 3 complaint, but a Republican Commission hears the appeal? How often does the Commission's composition change between voting out and later deciding a Part 3 matter, and might the answer resolve the due-process issue? And does the FTC fare better at the U.S. Courts of Appeal if it affirmed or reversed the ALJ? Until now, relatively little empirical work has scrutinized administrative litigation at the FTC. This study tracks every Part 3 case that produced a Commission Decision on or after January 20, 1977. It captures all 145 antitrust and consumer-protection matters falling within that period, tracking their development through initial vote at the reason to believe stage, disposition before the ALJ, appeal before the Commission, and petition for review at the U.S. Court of Appeals and beyond. The emerging statistics are illuminative. In hearing an appeal in the last 10 years, the FTC has never rejected an action that it had previously authorized complaint counsel to bring in Part 3. At first blush, that fact might suggest a preordained appellate process. But that phenomenon dissipates when one looks at a larger time horizon, suggesting that uniformity from initial vote to appeal is neither inevitable nor systemic. Indeed, it is possible that recent consistency may be a function of improved case selection, aided by effective factual, economic, and legal analysis by staff and the Commissioners before they authorize a complaint. Evaluating the ten matters voted out and affirmed by the Commission in the last decade lends some support to that proposition. Indeed, Part 3 has been an effective tool in developing complex antitrust questions. This article provides a host of new evidence with which to evaluate administrative litigation at the FTC. The article concludes by exploring some initial teaching points from the data.","[Ohlhausen, Maureen K.] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Ohlhausen, MK (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",mohlhausen@ftc.gov,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Descriptive statistics, multivariate techniques and spatial analysis have been carried out to identify clusters of Greek regions with an homogeneous development path. Results outline how the gap between wealthy and disadvantaged regions consolidated with economic expansion (2000-07) strengthening the centrality of medium-size urban areas, industrial and tourism-specialised districts. Recession (2008-12) has widened the gap between Athens and the rest of Greece, while mitigating the disparities in per capita income between rich and poor regions. This evidence seem to contrast with literature indicating how dynamic regions came to be less exposed to recession than economically-disadvantaged regions. The 2008-09 crisis stimulates a rethinking of the geography of socio-economic disparities in highly-divided countries, pointing out how expansion and recession differently impact the spatial distribution of wealth.","[Salvati, Luca] Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Salvati, L (通讯作者)，Council Agr Res & Econ CREA, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",luca.salvati@crea.gov.it,"Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021",,,,,,67,80,81,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Moreover, few studies have explicitly addressed R&D activities dispersion among firms in emerging markets. Using a sample of 244 Chinese high-tech firms collected from 2000 to 2009, this study aims to determine how firms in developing countries domestically and globally distribute their activities. The results show that a firm in an emerging market with a decentralized R&D organizational structure with geographically centralized R&D activities has better innovation outputs. Moreover, institutional development positively moderates the relationship between the dispersion of R&D activities and innovation performance.","[Ying, Ying] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Cong] Zhejiang Univ Technol, China Inst Small & Medium Enterprise, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; South China University of Technology; Zhejiang University of Technology,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liuyang.zju@gmail.com,"wei, jiang/GRX-7907-2022; Liu, Yang/T-3751-2019; yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022","Liu, Yang/0000-0002-3232-8524;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71502064, 71233003, 71502065, 71402168, 71502160]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ16G020003]; Private Enterprise Research Fund of School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Private Enterprise Research Fund of School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology","We also acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China [71502064, 71233003, 71502065, 71402168, & 71502160], Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ16G020003], and Private Enterprise Research Fund of School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology.",,63,7,8,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This paper suggests that bonding social capital and bridging social capital possibly accounts for a large portion of the unidentified factors at work that explain a bus operator's community interactions.

Two theoretical perspectives are developed the democratic competition view and the commitment view and various hypotheses are suggested for explaining changes in JI. We find strong evidence that changes in political participation and competition as well as the characteristics of individual leaders such as how they acquired or lost power play an important role in explaining changes in constitutionally safeguarded JI.

In this study, the first of its kind, hypothetical experimental surveys were conducted using a nationally representative sample of 505 respondents to determine factors that motivate personal contributions to HSAs.

While being a major cause of risk, smartphones apps may also serve as a means to control and reduce risky driving behavior. However, it is still unclear which apps should be favored and what features and functions compose such valuable apps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a blueprint for smartphone apps that will have the greatest potential to reduce injury crashes. The study is based on apps mapping and experts' opinions retrieved through an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Thirty seven experts participated in the study and evaluated and graded nine widespread types of apps according to various criteria. When weighing safety considerations versus acceptance concerns, they were found to be almost equally important. The results clearly define the desirable types of smartphone apps: collision warning, texting prevention (both no-typing and no-reading), voice control (both text-to-speech and commands), and Green Box (In Vehicle Data Recorder - IVDR). However, while texting prevention and IVDR are not likely to be widely accepted and used, collision warning and voice control apps are expected to gain public support. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that all three data categories positively impact on the accuracy of GDP nowcasts, whereby the effect is largest in the case of real activity data. When treating variables as if they were all published at the same time and without any time lag, financial series lose all their significance, while survey data remain an important ingredient for the nowcasting exercise. The subsequent analysis shows that the sectoral coverage of survey data, which is broader than that of timely available real activity data, as well as their information content stemming from questions focusing on agents' expectations, are the main sources of the genuine' predictive power of survey data. When the forecast period is restricted to the 2008-09 financial crisis, the main change is an enhanced forecasting role for financial data.

In particular, the diversity of actors and scales, and their power and interest in Earth system resources, increases natural social interconnectivity and the vulnerability of these traditionally local resource systems to disturbances. Using a combination of design conditions and robustness analyses, we argue that institutional maturity and local knowledge of self-organised regimes are pre-conditions for the continuity of local forest socio-ecological systems as long-lasting institutions that survive global market disturbances. Vulnerability and robustness against external natural and social disturbances thus largely depend on institutional robustness, as well as socioecological dynamics.

In the United Kingdom, crowdfunding is a particularly diverse and dynamic economy: the forms taken by funding now range from donations to business loans and the issue of equities by start-up enterprises, and recent rapid growth is concentrated in the financial market circuits of crowdfunding. This article analyzes the changing composition of the crowdfunding economy in the United Kingdom as a process of financial marketization and develops a sympathetic critical engagement with cultural economy scholarship on the geographies of money and finance. Consistent with previous cultural economy research into sociotechnical processes, the financial market circuits of crowdfunding are shown to be produced through the mobilization of economic theory and the enrollment of calculative market devices. When calling for a broadening of the existing analytical remit of cultural economy scholarship, however, emphasis is also placed on both regulation and governance and monetary valuations as constitutive and relational forces in the assembly of markets in the making. Regulation and governance are shown to deploy sovereign powers and techniques to territorialize, legitimize, and bolster the financial market circuits of crowdfunding.

We use data from the first two waves of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, which is a nationally representative sample of 8500 people aged 50+ living in Ireland. To deal with the endogeneity of migration, we apply fixed-effects estimation models and control for a broad range of life events occurring between the two waves. These include the emigration of a child but also events such as bereavement, onset of disease, retirement and unemployment. We find that depressive symptoms and loneliness feelings increase among the parents of migrant children but that the effect is only present for mothers. As the economic burden of mental health problems is high, our findings have potentially significant impacts for migrant-sending regions and countries.","[Mosca, Irene] Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Barrett, Alan] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Barrett, Alan] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Mosca, I (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing, Dublin 2, Ireland.",moscai@tcd.ie,,"Barrett, Alan/0000-0002-1106-2528",Health Research Board of Ireland grant under the Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhancement programme [ICE/2011/7]; Atlantic Philanthropies; Irish Government Department of Health and Children; Irish Life and Permanent plc.,Health Research Board of Ireland grant under the Interdisciplinary Capacity Enhancement programme(Health Research Board - Ireland); Atlantic Philanthropies; Irish Government Department of Health and Children; Irish Life and Permanent plc.,"We would like to thank the Editor and three anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

However, it is far from clear what implications can be drawn from these analyses, because the results suffer from a sample selection problem that undermines their implications. This article uses models of the Federal Trade Commission's enforcement activity to estimate challenge probabilities and address the selection issue. Although the small size of the sample limits the statistical interpretation of the results, general observations are possible. First, significant price effects generally appear in markets with very high challenge probabilities. When challenge probabilities are moderate, say 30 to 70 percent, retrospective results generate price effects in roughly half of the studies. For markets with low challenge probabilities, no price effects are observed in the retrospectives related to collusion theories. Positive price effects are observed for most of the retrospectives in differentiated goods markets, but theoretical analyses imply that most those results are highly problematic. Although retrospectives, interpreted in light of the likely competitive concern, can serve as a test for merger policy, an anomaly between the retrospective and the relevant policy prediction requires some type of case study to be undertaken to resolve the stark difference in implications prior to the analysis. More complete case studies are needed to fulfill the true promise of the retrospective research regime.","[Coate, Malcolm B.] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20530 USA",,"Coate, MB (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20530 USA.",mcoate@ftc.gov,,,,,,,27,2,3,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In a second phase in which one market ceased to provide returns while the other market remained unchanged, participants showed behavioral contrast by decreasing investment in the non-producing market and dramatically increasing investing in the unchanged market. A third phase restored the original return rates and matching was observed. In a fourth phase, one market ceased to provide returns while the other market remained unchanged, and less robust evidence of behavioral contrast was found.

This study utilizes unique data from the records of those who were granted leniency in the Korea Fair Trade Commission's cartel investigations from 2005 to 2009, in which the identities of leniency recipients were revealed. The results identify several company-level attributes that affected the tendency to confess, as well as the cartel-level attributes explored in previous studies. The results also suggest that there are qualitative differences between the first and the second confessors.

More specifically, we investigate whether the premium for an eco-labeled laundry detergent is sensitive to receiving information about the premium paid by other members of one's social group. The information manipulations in the experiment test for two distinct types of social influence, i.e., conformist and payoff-biased transmission. We find strong empirical evidence for a conformist transmission. Participants informed about the positive premium paid by the majority of their peers reported a higher premium than individuals not receiving any information. This result shows that previous studies on the WTP for sustainable products, which explain premiums by attitudinal measures and sociodemographic traits, unwarrantedly provide an under-socialized account.

We argue that political and organizational factors, as well as the interaction between the two, are necessary for explaining executive policymaking. To test this theory, we consider the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), an agency often perceived to be the president's political instrument. Using a new dataset of over 22,000 regulations reviewed by OIRA, we demonstrate that political factors influence review lengths, but organizational factors also exhibit a significant role. We find that reviews are longer when OIRA is understaffed and over-worked. Significantly, we demonstrate that low organizational capacity inhibits the president's ability to expedite priority rules. Overall, this study highlights the organizational limits of political control.

The focus of the paper is on the relation between imitation and ignorance within the organizational structure of high-frequency trading (HFT) firms. In social studies of finance (SSF) literature imitation is considered a strategic act, i.e. imitation is a term applied when traders copy the strategies of other traders. I wish to turn this relation between ignorance and imitation on its head and consider ignorance itself as a strategic unknown and investigate the kinds of imitations that might be produced from structures of not-knowing (i.e. structures intended to divide, obscure and protect knowledge). This point is illustrated through ethnographic studies and interviews within five HFT firms. The data show how a black-box structure of ignorance is replicated within the organizational setting of these firms and re-enacted by the traders. Towards the end of the paper the politics of the relationship between imitation and ignorance is discussed.","[Lange, Ann-Christina] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,2 Floor, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Lange, AC (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,2 Floor, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",ala.mpp@cbs.dk,,,Danish Council for Independent Research [300418],Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),Research for this paper was supported by a 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant [Grant Number: 300418] from the Danish Council for Independent Research.,,24,37,37,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The RV method has become more and more popular recently, and has been found to lead to very different estimation results than conventional RU models. Previous studies have reported these differences but did not explain them, which limited the confidence in the RV model as a useful foundation for transport policy analysis. In this paper, we first analytically show in what way exactly the two models are different and why they may generate different estimation results. Based on this deeper understanding of the connection and difference between the two models, we formulate hypotheses regarding the conditions under which differences in estimation results are expected to be smaller or larger. Using synthetic data, we empirically test these expectations. Results provide strong support for our hypotheses, allowing us to derive a number of practical recommendations for analysts interested in using the RV and RU models in their VTTC-analysis.

Based on the concept of relative absorptive capacity, the study examines how the acquiring firm absorbs and assimilates the knowledge of the acquired firm and creates innovation. Specifically, the technological M&As are examined by presenting dyadic perspective variables, including technological similarity and technological digestibility which affect the assimilation, transformation, and exploitation processes of the absorptive capacity. We additionally investigate the role of M&A experience as a moderator of dyadic characteristics and innovation performance of technological M&As. Two hundred and twelve cases of technological M&As in the biopharmaceutical industry from 1993 to 2007 are investigated using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and negative binomial regression. The findings confirm a positive effect of acquiring small firms having a modest level of similar knowledge on post-M&A innovation performance.

During this time period, urban dwellers generally opposed prohibition and did not voluntarily adopt it. Subsequently, policy changes were more exogenous. The results suggest that there are dynamic aspects of prohibition. State-level prohibition decreased homicides immediately after enforcement began, but after three years of enforcement, the law ceased having a measurable effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we explore two related issues. First, how robust is the finding of a promotion signaling distortion to different ways of modeling the promotion process? Second, what are the various forms that the promotion signaling distortion can take? Our first conclusion is that a promotion signaling distortion exists across a wide range of settings, including some for which earlier work suggests no distortion. Our second conclusion is that, even if there is no inefficiency concerning the number of promotions, there can still be a promotion distortion that takes the form of inefficiencies concerning who is promoted.","[Waldman, Michael] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zax, Ori] Tel Hai Coll, Qiryat Shemona, Israel",Cornell University; Tel Hai Academy College,"Waldman, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Sage Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Zax, O (通讯作者)，Tel Hai Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Upper Galilee, Israel.",mw46@cornell.edu; orizax@gmail.com,"zax, ori/JXE-5734-2024; Waldman, Michael/AAC-8242-2019","zax, ori/0000-0001-9580-2070",,,,,39,17,17,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

This study focuses upon the ethics of students' consumption behavior from a comparative perspective: the students from the Faculties of Business and Faculties of Medicine from Romania and Bulgaria. The results of the analysis indicate the fact that there are no significant differences as to the ethical buying behavior between the two groups of students from the two countries. Moreover there are no significant differences between the students of the two approached majors in Romania and Bulgaria. Despite all these, our research proves that when faced with real shopping situations, most students have the tendency of acting unethically, using different types of pretexts (super-stories) in order to justify their sideslip from the declared behavior. This mismatch between the declared behavior and the real behavior can be explained by means of social factors. In other words, in our case, theoretical education, information and the students' efforts to behave ethically as consumers seem to be highly undermined by the realities of the standard of living, expressed through their families' level of income.","[Coman, Adela; Leoveanu, Valentin Mihai] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Rusu, Virginica] Univ Playa Ancha, Valparaiso, Chile",University of Bucharest; Universidad de Playa Ancha,"Coman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",adela_coman2003@yahoo.com; virginica.rusu@upla.cl; valentin.leoveanu@faa.unibuc.ro,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,535,547,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700055,0

This editorial addresses the question whether the economic approach is still warranted and under which conditions. A broad outline of the trends in both orthodox and heterodox economic approaches is also presented. The traditional split between environmental and ecological economics is not doing justice to recent developments in the field. Instead it is proposed to rather refer to Environmental, Resource and Ecological Economics (EREE), Ecological-Economic Systems (EES) and Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) approaches as well as Heterodox approaches to Environment and Sustainability (HEES). The contributions made to this special issue are placed within their respective subfields of influence. It is concluded that a deeper, self-critical exposition of moral philosophies and values as well as models of reality are needed. A strategy of engagement in an attitude of self-criticism, humility and in participation with others is proposed as a viable way forward. For such a process to be successful two conditions are required, namely valuing the human person and accepting the reality of a non-determinate world full of meaning.","[de Wit, Martin] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"de Wit, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",,"de wit, martin p/A-1851-2017","de wit, martin p/0000-0003-3054-2479",,,,,63,0,0,0,10,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It is believed that societal adoption of insurance as an adaptive response to climate change can have significant implications for insurers. The study investigates empirically insurers' perceptions of climate change and the challenges they face in Nigeria. It examines the proposition that insurance firms in Nigeria are not mindful of the impact of climate change. The study applied the use of descriptive statistics, Kendall's coefficient of concordance and principal component analysis on collected primary data. It was found that insurers in Nigeria were highly aware of climate change and its impact but did not believe it affects their operational costs and payments of claims. Although there is great scope for insurers to increase their client base in the Nigerian market, insurers face challenges of insurance rate-cutting, low patronage and environmental factors. The study concludes that there is a need for insurance regulators to enforce a level playing field for all firms. It also advocates for public support of private insurers to enhance insurance coverage for agriculture, the largest employer of labour in the country.","[Elum, Zelda Anne] Univ South Africa, Agr & Anim Hlth, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Simonyan, Judith Bosede] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Agr Econ, Umudike, Nigeria",University of South Africa,"Elum, ZA (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Agr & Anim Hlth, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Elum, Zelda Anne/AAL-6018-2020","Elum, Zelda Anne/0000-0002-3032-4108",,,,,37,7,8,1,3,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The main research question investigates employees' perception of an ideal leader in developing EU countries. This perception is important for the employees' work performance and sustainable economic growth. The study intends to compare Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian employees' preferences for leader's traditional roles (task-oriented behavior and relations-oriented behavior) and modern more emotional and inspiring views (charisma and social responsibility). 221 employees participated in the cross-sectional quantitative survey with self-administered internet based questionnaires. 124 Lithuanians, 40 Latvians, 57 Estonians filled in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Leadership Behaviors (Yukl, 2012), Transformational Leadership Inventory (Podsakoff et al., 1996) and a scale from Servant Leadership Questionnaire (Barbuto, Wheeler, 2006) was used. Results of this study suggest that charisma is the most preferred characteristic of a leader. Relations-oriented behavior is also a significant factor in predicting an ideal leadership. Employees do not perceive task-oriented behavior and leader's social responsibility as essential dimensions for an ideal leadership. Some significant differences in leadership preferences are revealed among countries. The study is based on under-estimated follower-centric perspective and examines interactive predictive value of different leadership dimensions to employees' preferences. Data reveals that the shift to inspiring leadership have already occurred in the perception of employees from post-soviet Baltic countries. The comparison of three Baltic countries gives the insight about the challenges for management in still developing EU members.

The aim of this paper is to determine the factors that influences the expect well-being of this unique group. Expected well-being is an important determinant of both the decision to migrate and the choice of a country of destination. Knowledge about this determinant therefore informs refugee policies. The results show that only a few of the factors found in the literature explaining the expected well-being of voluntary migrants also explain the expected well-being of forced migrants. However, a number of factors found in the literature that explain the subjective well-being and well-being in general of refugees and asylum-seekers also went towards explaining the expected well-being of this group. These factors include: government assistance, culture, the time spent in South Africa, economic factors, crime, refugee status, reasons for leaving the home countries and the number of people staying in a house in the receiving country. The findings of this study emphasise the differences between forced and voluntary migrants and highlight the factors that influence the expected well-being of forced migrants.

Considering the mechanisms by which timing may affect wages, each is a function of experience rather than age. This transformation also highlights the distinction between a first birth after labor market entry versus before. I show that estimates based on age understate the return to delay for women who remain childless at labor market entry and have obscured the negative return to delay-to a first birth after labor market entry rather than before-for all but college graduates. My results suggest, however, that these returns to first-birth timing may hold only for non-Hispanic white women.","[Herr, Jane Leber] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Herr, JL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jlherr@fas.harvard.edu,,,National Institute for Child Health and Human Development [T32-HD007275],National Institute for Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"I would like to thank David Card, Ronald Lee, Guido Imbens, Jesse Shapiro, Derek Neal, Elizabeth Weber Handwerker, Melanie Guldi, Emily Oster, Colleen Manchester, Sarah Hayford, Lucie Schmidt, Don Cox, Jenna Johnson-Hanks, Ashley Langer, Kevin Stange, Donna Ginther, Martha Bailey, Rachel Sullivan Robinson, two anonymous referees, and participants of the U.C.

The tournament covered a time period of one month and attracted 1,353,506 spectators, many of whom came from the United States. The primary purpose of this descriptive study is to examine the extent to which fans from the United States (and to a lesser extent from other countries) traveled to Canada for the 2015 Women's World Cup, the venues fans attended, the amount they spent, and their motivations for traveling to Canada for the event. A secondary purpose is to examine marketing strategies that were used to create interest in the event and attract tourists including television advertising, the use of other traditional media (e.g., newspaper ads, billboards, etc.) and social media marketing. This paper utilizes secondary data and published reports from the FIFA 2015 World Cup Host Committee and the Canadian Sports Tourism Council, interviews with Canadian sports tourism officials at each of the host cities, and reports from the mass media. The methodology consisted of content analysis of these sources to identify tourism trends. Results of the study show that tourism from the United States to Canada for the World Cup was influenced by the success of the American Women's National Team, the marketing of the tournament in the United States by Fox TV and the growing interest in women's sports by people in the USA. In addition, the analysis also reveals that host cities in Canada that are located near United States population centers (e.g., Vancouver, Montreal, Winnipeg) attracted more tourists than host cities that were more remote and distant from the USA (e.g., Edmonton, Moncton); the transportation infrastructure (e.g., access by airlines, highways, and railroads) also influenced tourism; host cities with better infrastructure attracted more tourists. The results also show that Americans in Canada at the time the World Cup was held were more aware of the tournament than people from other countries, and were more likely to be in Canada to attend World Cup matches than people from other nations. The implications for sports marketing and sports tourism are also discussed.","[Jensen, Ricard W.] Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA",Montclair State University,"Jensen, RW (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,2,BUSINESS & APPLIED SCI ACAD NORTH AMERICA-BAASANA,BLOOMSBURG,"2201 BENTLEY DR, BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815 USA",,,,,,,2016,,,,,,,73,83,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI1BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405497000017,0

Within this regime, central banks choose medium-term inflation target and then manipulates short-term interest rates to control inflation rate, on the one hand and unemployment rate and output on the other hand. So, theoretically, this policy ultimately provides the central bank's objectives. This regime was quite effective till the crisis of 2008. However, after the crisis it becomes obvious that inflation targeting is not perfect regime enough, for counter-cyclical regulation. The main proof of this argument is the unconventional policy such as quantitative easing or forward guidance, which was widely conducted by world's leading central banks, alongside reduction in short term interest rates during and after crisis period.

Insufficient capital, respectively difficult access to finance belongs to the most significant problems in this field. The problem is not limited only to SME's in Slovakia, but is widespread all over the world due to SME's special characteristics. The perception of the sufficiency of finances for SME's on Slovak market can be influenced by many factors. The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of such specific and commonly monitored factors as size and allocation of the enterprise, gender and the level of education of the entrepreneur, and newly the success in business on the perception of SME's access to finance. The method of questionnaire survey carried out on Slovak enterprises in 2016 was used to achieve this aim. Through the statistical verification of our working hypotheses by Pearson chi-square the paper brings the answer to the question which of the selected factors have the significant impact on the finances of Slovak SMEs. The results of the study confirm that there is a significant relation between SME's access to finance in Slovakia and such factors as size, region and success in business. The statistical interdependence was not confirmed in case of age and the level of education of the entrepreneurs.","[Kljucnikov, Aleksandr] Pan European Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Mkt, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",Pan-European University,"Kljucnikov, A (通讯作者)，Pan European Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Mkt, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia.",kliuchnikov@gmail.com,"Ključnikov, Aleksandr/K-6273-2018","Ključnikov, Aleksandr/0000-0003-0350-2658",,,,,30,7,7,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon of creativity is not proportional to how much it is affirmed and promoted nowadays. This is particularly noticeable in work organizations of all kinds. Besides the subjective factors as are the employers' and managers' superficial or inadequate knowledge of what creativity really is, there are objective factors which put pressure on and hinder the creative impulses and processes. Economic, financial and market imperatives such as: fierce competition, short-term goals and deadlines, acceleration of work processes, rationalization, productivism, overall quantification (only measurable parameters and results being taken into account), excessive regulations, tight control systems and the like, contribute to design organizations which crush creativity. Some quite widespread management practices and behaviors, especially the so-called intrusive or micromanagement, are often a reaction to these constraints. As for the employees, they internalize all these pressures into strong inner imperatives of (over) achievement. The imposed standard of a constantly high level of motivation, excellence and self-improvement is unsustainable in a long run. The guiding management principle of performing more and better for less (time, resources, energy, leads to the exhaustion of mental and other psychological resources needed for creative ideas to emerge and develop. Creativity involves complex, subtle and dynamic psychosocial mechanisms. Too often the managerial practices and organizational cultures are detrimental to the well known most powerful source of creativity: the intrinsic motivation. Briefly, this article deals with the paradox which lies in the fact that, in theory, so much emphasis is put on creativity and innovation as indispensable assets, while at the same time so much is done to stifle them in practice.","[Milivojevic, Tatjana] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Culture & Media, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Milivojevic, T (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Culture & Media, Belgrade, Serbia.",tmilivojevic@nezbit.edu.rs,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,430,439,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700045,0

The ISM Manufacturing Reports, Non-Farm Payrolls, International Trade Balance, Index of Leading Indicators, Housing Starts, and Jobless Claims turn out to be the most statistically significant factors in the model. Three trading strategies that realize daily returns on the various macroeconomic announcement days are compared with the buy-and-hold strategy. The choice of announcements with statistically significant regression coefficients yields higher mean daily returns and better Sharpe ratios but possibly lower compound returns.

With the adoption of IFRS, can the audit report contain a professional, objective and independent opinion on the true and fair view of the financial statements, in the most significant aspects, related to the information that reflects financial position and performance, in accordance with an applicable accounting framework?

To achieve the research objectives, a sample of 59 companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) was selected. These companies use IFRS in financial reporting. To obtain the research results, multiple regression analysis, ANCOVA models and GLM were used. Data was collected from the financial statements of companies and from other reports provided by BSE. For data processing, SPSS 20.0 was used. The results achieved from the ANCOVA and GLM regression analysis indicate that information provided by the audit report, auditors' affiliation to the Big 4 and the audit opinion, are value relevant for investors and have a significant impact on the stock price.","[Robu, Alina Mihaela; Robu, Ioan-Bogdan] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Robu, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",mihaela.robu@feaa.uaic.ro; bogdan.robu@feaa.uaic.ro,"ROBU, Ioan-Bogdan/E-4230-2016","ROBU, Ioan-Bogdan/0000-0002-4067-7433",,,,,31,1,3,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,3,15,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_1,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800001,0

Correct information on the environmental impact of cars in terms of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption is necessary in car advertisements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the completeness of information on CO2 emissions and fuel consumption in car advertisements according to the 1999194/EC European Directive. We examined 902 car advertisements published in a monthly Italian car magazine searching for data on CO2 emissions and fuel consumption according to 1999/94/EC Directive and also on further characteristics, such as type of car, engine size and power, power supply and compliance with European antipollution legislation. Our data showed only partial adherence to the statutory provisions of 1999/94/EC Directive: data on CO2 emissions and fuel consumption were published with a high frequency, but they were referred to the specific car advertised in only a low percentage of ads, with relevant differences among car manufacturers. This makes difficult to compare the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of different cars to potential buyers. Full adherence to all provisions of the abovementioned Directive by all car manufacturers is desirable to provide consumers comprehensive and transparent information on the environmental performance of cars. The easiest and most effective way for a full and correct application of 1999/94/EC Directive is the introduction in ads of a label, similar to that currently in use for refrigerators and tires, reporting for each car advertised the official fuel consumption and official specific CO2 emissions figures.

Since the performance of a company heavily relies on its suppliers, it is of vital importance to incorporate environmental criteria into supplier selection problem to satisfy both conventional and environmental criteria, which have only been considered by a limited number of studies. Therefore, following a brief review of green supply chain management (GSCM) and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) concepts and investigation of supplier selection approaches, this study after focuses on a modified Delphi method that has been applied to determine supplier selection criteria. Also, the intuitionistic fuzzy value (IFV) and interval value intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) have been utilised for supplier evaluation regarding the subjective nature and uncertainty of judgment. By using the Choquet Integral operator and fuzzy measures, the best supplier has been selected, and the comparison between IFV and IVIF has been made. This methodology has been applied to a manufacturing company to assess the applicability of the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology can be used for real world problems that contain fuzziness or interacting decision criteria.

This paper presents an agent-based financial market model and simulations in which agents follow technical and fundamental trading rules to determine their speculative investment positions. The model developed by Westerhoff (2009) was chosen for implementation and was extended by FTT and arising transaction costs. Because FTTs may be defined in various ways, this paper defines assets as tax objects. The model includes direct interactions between speculators, which may lead them to decide to change their trading behavior and addresses a technical and a fundamental strategy of market participants. The results suggest that the modified model has a tendency to stabilize itself in the long term if fundamental trading rules outweigh the technical trading method. This model could be used when bubbles and crashes occur in financial markets. Asset prices would be stabilized because their value targets near the fundamental value and volatility would also be minimized. Setting FTTs at a low rate for market stabilization is important. If FTTs and consequent transaction costs are too high, then the financial system will destabilize and prices will grow without limit. The model described in this paper explores dependence market stability to the extent of FTTs. However, the model should not be interpreted as a model only for the introduction of FTT, but as a general model of transaction costs' influence on the financial market.","[Sperka, Roman] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Business Econ & Management, Katowice, Poland; [Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Accounting, Katowice, Poland",University of Silesia in Katowice; University of Silesia in Katowice,"Sperka, R (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Business Econ & Management, Katowice, Poland.",sperka@opf.slu.cz; szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Sperka, Roman/D-8689-2015; Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Sperka, Roman/0000-0003-2371-6450; Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports in the Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports in the Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports in the Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2015.",,37,1,1,0,8,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Using the suggested methodology of cost assigning and of assessment of the energy products cost, we assess the cost of electricity production for CHP plants, as well as for the operation in the cogeneration and the condensation modes. Our results demonstrate that a CHP plant drops out of the zone of acceptable prices in the trade schedule of the day ahead-market, when operating in the condensation mode. Therefore, in too many ways, the efficiency of a CHP is determined by the ratio of electricity generation (as well as the cogeneration and condensation modes) within the calculated period.

According to the original formulation, the price for the game is infinite, and, therefore, paradoxical. Although the St Petersburg Paradox can be seen as concerning merely a game, Paul Samuelson (1977) calls it a fascinating chapter in the history of ideas, a chapter that gave rise to a considerable number of papers over more than 200 years involving fields such as probability theory and economics. In a paper in this journal, Vivian (2013) undertook a numerical investigation of the St Petersburg Game. In this paper, the central issue of the paradox is identified as that of fair (risk-neutral) pricing, which is fundamental in economics and finance and involves important concepts such as no arbitrage, discounting, and risk-neutral measures. The model for the St Petersburg Game as set out in this paper is new and analytical and resolves the so-called pricing paradox by applying a discounting procedure. In this framework, it is shown that there is in fact no infinite price paradox, and simple formulas for obtaining a finite price for the game are also provided.","[Swart, Barbara] Univ S Africa, Dept Decis Sci, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Swart, B (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Decis Sci, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,14,1,1,1,8,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The descriptive and content analysis of the financial statements of the selected banks investigated revealed that Zenith Bank has the highest amount of off balance sheet engagement. It therefore concludes that inspite of the huge profit that may accrue to the deposit money bank for engaging in off balance sheet activities, it may be exposed to a very high risk if the unexpected happens. In view of this, this study recommends a prudent management and monitoring of off balance sheet activities by management, the board and Central Bank of Nigeria.

The research problem is conveyed in the form of the following question: how does the fit between export marketing strategy and competitive strategy affect export performance? Lithuanian companies which operate in the sector of milk and meat processing and export their products were chosen for the empirical verification. Multiple regression analysis (moderated regression and mediation-path analysis) was used to test the hypotheses. The results of the survey revealed that only the distribution adaptation significantly mediates the relationship between cost leadership and export performance. The decrease of cost leadership manifestation level is associated with a higher degree of distribution adaptation that in turn leads to increased export performance. Moderation perspective disclosed that when the level of cost leadership manifestation is low, a higher degree of distribution adaptation significantly determines better export performance.","[Virvilaite, Regina; Seinauskiene, Beata] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Seinauskiene, B (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania.",regina.virvilaite@ktu.lt; beata.seinauskiene@ktu.lt,"Šeinauskienė, Beata/ADO-5527-2022; Šeinauskienė, Beata/ABE-9315-2021","Šeinauskienė, Beata/0000-0003-1791-0214",,,,,47,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,449,465,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_34,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900034,0

This paper is expected to improve the existing theories about construction and operation of university innovation teams and offer a guidance for scientific and technological innovation.","[Yun, Chen; Bing, Li; Jiang, Zhou] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Yun, Chen] Inst Wuhan Studies, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Yun, C (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Yun, C (通讯作者)，Inst Wuhan Studies, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",chenyun135@126.com; 18672971935@163.com; 15972220112@139.com,,,Institute of Wuhan Studies [20162h0165],Institute of Wuhan Studies,This paper is supported by the open research fund from Institute of Wuhan Studies (20162h0165).,,6,0,0,0,6,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,600,607,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400097,0

The purchases of public and private securities started in March 2015 and are intended to be carried out until March 2017 or until inflation path is consistent with inflation target. The programme amounts to (sic) 60 billion of monthly purchases. The aim of this paper is to evaluate macroeconomic effects of the APP on the Eurozone's output and inflation in the first nine months of implementation. It is necessary to understand whether quantitative easing can be used to stimulate output and inflation when stable conditions prevail in financial markets. In order to assess the macroeconomic effects of the APP, the author estimates a Bayesian vector autoregression (VAR) with Minnesota - Litterman prior. The model is then used to conduct counterfactual analysis. The counterfactual scenario is based on empirical evidence from Altavilla et al. (2015) which suggests that, on average, the APP lowered the euro area long - term bond yields by about 40 basis points at 10 - year maturity. The author implements this impact on long - term interest rates by constructing a counterfactual path for the long - term interest rate spread. The results from the Bayesian VAR model suggest that the APP has had a positive impact both on output and inflation after the first nine months of implementation. The analysis also indicates that quantitative easing is an effective policy option to boost output and price level in times of low financial stress as the results do not significantly differ from studies which evaluate the effects of quantitative easing in other countries during the financial crisis.","[Zlobins, Andrejs] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Zlobins, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",andrejs.zlobins@inbox.lv,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,937,950,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200080,0

The use of railway systems in urban logistics should help to mitigate negative externalities such as noise, congestion and air pollution. Additional strengths of rail transport are the use of road-independent infrastructure, providing a reliable secondary mean of transport, and the high energy efficiency. A number of different concepts have been outlined-mostly conceptually, focussing on the intermodal interface, i.e. urban road-rail terminals or urban cross docks. This paper focuses on the rail side of urban logistics. It highlights the operational and technical challenges of operating freight trains in densely used railway networks with mixed traffic, against the background of railway network capacity consumption. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the characteristics of freight train on capacity consumption in mixed traffic railway networks. It devises an impact model to identify the drivers of capacity consumption and consequently to present effective ways to make better use of capacity in urban railway networks. To maximise the number of train paths in a mixed-traffic network, the technical and operational discrepancies between passenger and freight rail transport need to be reduced. Since passenger transport is the predominant user of railway networks in metropolitan areas, freight trains are required to adapt to the characteristics of passenger trains. A variation of the factors speed, acceleration, deceleration and train length has shown that the relative capacity consumption of freight trains can be reduced. The impacts of the factors considered however differ significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the one hand, officials of many countries have announced intentions to participate in its development. On the other hand, numerous studies aimed at measuring the economic viability of the NSR navigation indicate that the route has limited potential and is suitable only for a relatively small segment of shipping. This study is dedicated to solve this contradiction focusing on two different rationales of the NSR use: 1) current economic feasibility which is defined by the level of transportation costs in comparison to alternative transport routes; 2) long-term prospects of the NSR development determined by long-term trends and strategic interests of various countries. It is revealed that the NSR is commercially viable only for bulk cargo transportation in warmer months from and to ports located not far from the NSR. In the long term the effectiveness of the NSR can increase under conditions of further ice melting, development of Russian Arctic zone, in particular, the infrastructure along the NSR, and increasing political and other risks along the traditional trade routes between Europe and Asia. On the contrary, the slowdown in Asia-European trade and the suspension of some oil & gas projects in Russian Arctic worsen to some extent the NSR prospects.","[Makarov, Igor A.] Natl Res Univ, HSE, Dept World Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Makarov, Igor A.] HSE, Ctr Comprehens European & Int Studies, Moscow, Russia; [Sokolova, Anna K.; Stepanov, Ilya A.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Comprehens European & Int Studies, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Makarov, IA (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, HSE, Dept World Econ, Moscow, Russia.",imakarov@hse.ru; aksokolova@hse.ru; iastepanov@hse.ru,"Makarov, Igor/K-6107-2015; Makarov, Igor/AAE-1914-2019","Makarov, Igor/0000-0003-3519-3036; Makarov, Igor/0000-0001-8183-4215",Basic Research Program of National Research University Higher School of Economics,Basic Research Program of National Research University Higher School of Economics,Support from the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics is gratefully acknowledged.,,56,2,2,5,31,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The results show that with low spillover, the high cost firm can capture more input than the low cost firm through cost-reducing innovation. Adding input increases firms' innovation, but it cannot improve the disadvantaged firm's state under input constraint. Compared with non-cooperative innovation, cooperative innovation reduces innovation difference and firm size difference. The research implications are that disadvantage firms could take innovation spillover and capacity constraints as a competition strategy to obtain competition advantage and regulators should stimulate cooperative innovation to higher social welfare. The major value of this paper is that it combines capacity constraints and innovation investment originality.","[Chen, You-hua] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-hua] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Nie, Pu-yan] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, X.

The paper has important conclusions relating to the benefits, in terms of uncertainty in appraisal VTTS, of resampling the base year VTTS and improving on the precision of the estimate of the GDP elasticity in the uprating equation. Importantly it is shown that the interval widths increase dramatically as VTTS is forecast further into the future. This has a significant modelling implication in that it is the uncertainty associated with the process of uprating base estimates of VIE which results in the large interval width, rather than that associated with the base year VTTS estimate. This in turn implies a need to regularly resample the base VTTS, so as to avoid excessive temporal extrapolation of the base VTTS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates from ordered models confirm the presence of a first born advantage in education and occupation, the latter persisting to a lesser extent after controlling for education. Strikingly, parents are on average more likely to make transfers to first-born children, although the vast majority provides cash or property gifts to all of their children. This first-born advantage in transfers is uncorrelated with the likelihood of having attained a higher education or better occupation.

Accessibility factors such as inter-regional transport connectivity and local access to skilled workers have similarly substantial effects. Whether a region belongs to the Eurozone or not seems to be less important.","[Andersson, David Emanuel] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, Dept Quantitat & Appl Econ, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Andersson, Ake E.] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Harsman, Bjorn; Daghbashyan, Zara] Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Jonkoping University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Andersson, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, Dept Quantitat & Appl Econ, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",david.andersson@nottingham.edu.cn,"Andersson, David Emanuel/E-1221-2013; Andersson, David Emanuel/G-8471-2013; Andersson, Ake E./L-3339-2016","Andersson, David Emanuel/0000-0003-3572-8846; Andersson, David Emanuel/0000-0002-1640-1314;",,,,,39,14,14,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

However, few have studied the stability of urban form and location effects under changing economic conditions. This paper presents an analysis of the changes in urban form and location correlates of travel distances in the Danish Zealand/Copenhagen region from before the financial crisis (2006107) to some years after the financial downturn (2010/11). Significant changes are found in the socio-economic as well as urban form and location correlates of travel during the period. The importance of location in explaining travel distances has increased over time. It is suggested that the effects may be explained as cost reducing strategies on behalf of consumers which would lead to an increasing importance of distance to nearest facilities/destinations. It follows that the location pattern, the geographical configuration of the urban region, is a factor in households' adaptive strategies which partly determine the possibilities for reducing travel and the possibilities for adaption and regional resilience.

In other words, these theories treat punishment as a public good. Several parameters are key to calculating optimal levels of punishment: total social costs, total social benefits, and the probability that offenders are apprehended. However, levels of punishment are often determined by aggregating individual decisions. Research in behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience shows that individuals appear to treat punishment as a private good (cold glow). This means that individual choices may not respond appropriately to the social parameters. We present a simple theory and show in a series of experiments that individually chosen punishment levels can be predictably too high or too low relative to those that maximize social material welfare. Our findings highlight the importance of the psychology of punishment for understanding social outcomes and for designing social institutions.","[Ouss, Aurelie; Peysakhovich, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Ouss, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard University; Considine Family Foundation; Harvard Law School's John M.

Business relationships are optimally organized to curtail influence activities-costly activities aimed at persuading decision makers. Sometimes, rigid organizational practices that reduce ex post decision-making quality may be adopted if they reduce managers' incentives to engage in influence activities. Unifying control (integration) may improve ex post decision making, but it intensifies disempowered managers' returns to influence activities unless accompanied with rigid organizational practices. Interpreting influence costs under non-integration as haggling costs between firms and rigid organizational practices under integration as bureaucracy. this model provides a unified account of the costs of both markets and hierarchies that accords with Williamson's classic trade-off. Under this view, however, bureaucracy within firms is not a cost of integration, but rather an endogenous response to influence activities.","[Powell, Michael] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Powell, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",mike-powell@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Powell, Michael/KCY-3126-2024","Powell, Michael/0009-0004-5297-615X",National Science Foundation; Program on Innovation in Markets and Organizations at MIT Sloan,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Program on Innovation in Markets and Organizations at MIT Sloan,"This paper is a revised chapter of my MIT PhD thesis.

This paper uses measures of genetic distance between immigrants' home and host countries as instruments for immigrants' identity. We find some evidence for adverse effects of home country identity on male immigrants' unemployment likelihood. Our results also suggest that a stronger host country identity only has a systematic effect on employment and job satisfaction. Overall, immigrants' identity appears to play only a negligible role in immigrants' labor market performance. Our analysis also shows the importance of accounting for endogeneity in the relationship between immigrants' ethnic identity and labor market outcomes.","[Islam, Asadul; Raschky, Paul A.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Raschky, PA (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",asadul.islam@monash.edu; paul.raschky@monash.edu,,"Raschky, Paul/0000-0002-8033-2958; Islam, Asadul/0000-0002-0928-0454",,,,,27,10,11,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This Bayesian method constitutes an alternative to classical tests and can be employed regardless of the form of the restrictions on the parameters of the model. This approach enables the assumptions about the existence of higher-order moments of the processes that are required in classical tests to be relaxed.

That enables efficient analysis of the recent competing theories of capital structure. After including the costs of financial distress and risk premium of debt in the cash flow model, this paper provides a new look at cost of tax shield from the point of view of risk-return relationship. Cost of tax shield is not constant, but depends on leverage and is mostly between cost of assets and cost of debt. Moreover the simulation of firm value and capital structure in presence of taxes, risk, and growth shows that unique optimal leverages exist for each combination of the above factors. The risk-enhanced cash flow theory can explain both the observations, which support pecking order theory, free cash flow theory and tradeoff theory of capital structure. Moreover it fits some evidence, which resists these theories: highly leveraged low growth companies and moderately leveraged large profitable companies.","Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Corp Finance, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Buus, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Corp Finance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",buust@vse.cz,"Buus, Tomáš/AAF-6157-2020","Buus, Tomáš/0000-0003-0874-1105",,,,,36,8,9,7,108,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Data on TL, POS, and IP were collected through a survey of Malaysian SMEs. The results show that idealised influence, intellectual stimulation, and individualised consideration had significant positive effects on IP. In addition, POS moderated the relationship between TL and IP in terms of idealised influence and inspirational motivation. The results are expected to encourage managers of Malaysian SMEs to stimulate their followers through their motivational and charismatic style. No study of TL and IP has considered SMEs in Malaysia, and therefore, this study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of the relationship between TL and innovation as well as between TL and performance in the Malaysian SME context.

Although many multinational companies include innovation-related words in their mission statements, little effort has been devoted to the relationship between a mission statement and innovation performance. This study investigates how mission statements influence innovation performance and then tests the relationship between innovation performance and non-financial business performance. An empirical analysis was conducted on a sample of the Chinese high-tech industry. Those companies with innovation-orientated mission have better innovation performance than companies without. The results also show strong evidence that mission statements have a positive influence on innovation performance, especially when innovation-related words are present in the statements. The results also indicate that both the newness of a technology and its newness to market can significantly enhance corporate image and customer satisfaction and that is critical for firms to understand the appropriate time to launch new products. This study discusses the practical implications of this work for managers.","[Zhang, Hao] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Inst Mkt Sci, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Garrett, Tony] Korea Univ, Dept Mkt, Seoul, South Korea; [Liang, Xiaoning] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland",Northeastern University - China; Korea University; Dublin City University,"Zhang, H (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Inst Mkt Sci, 11 3rd Alley,Wenhua Rd, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",hzhang@mail.neu.edu.cn,"Liang, Xiaoning/AAE-3552-2022; Zhang, Hao/JUF-7633-2023","Zhang, Hao/0000-0002-0345-1814; Liang, Xiaoning/0000-0001-9475-6092","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71202152, 71472033]; National Higher-education Institution General Research and Development Project [N140604006]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Higher-education Institution General Research and Development Project,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71202152 and 71472033] and National Higher-education Institution General Research and Development Project [grant number N140604006].,,79,8,10,6,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Their aim is to manage car use and support access by more sustainable transport modes. However, their application to new residential developments has received little research attention to date. A series of semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 30 industry representatives, predominately from Australia, to identify opportunities to enhance the impact of travel plans for new residential developments. Results showed general support for travel plans at new residential developments, but limited confidence in the ability to implement them successfully. Application of implementation theory to the research findings has highlighted key gaps in the monitoring and enforcement of residential travel plans, an absence of any sound planning or legal requirement, and limited involvement from property managers in the travel planning process to date. Opportunities to enhance implementation include the adoption of an educational response to enforcement, development of a sound planning requirement, enhancing travel plan quality prior to granting planning approval, preparation of guidelines backed by strong capacity building efforts, and development of a stronger industry focus for residential travel planning. Future research is needed to assess the outcomes of travel plans for new residential developments. An assessment of different approaches for implementing residential travel plans is also needed to establish which methods are most appropriate under different contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Stripped to its bare essentials, the critical questions are who causes urban inequality, what causes it, and how it is caused? While all different, the questions are interrelated. Answering the who causes inequality question requires a related analysis of what and why, and that is connected to the how question. Indeed, the how question has two partshow inequality is caused and how it can be addressed. Both are connected to the why question and to its resolution. Unfortunately, while studies about urban inequality abound, they tend to hive off one aspect or another of the tripartite questions on inequality and, even worse, they study the three questions separately. This article tries to overcome the existing atomistic and piecemeal approach to the study of urban inequality in Africa by contextualizing the work of Jane Jacobs and Henry George, who took a holistic view of urban inequality. It argues that Jacobsianism and Georgism have much to offer in terms of understanding urban inequality in Africa, but neither analysis goes far enough to be able to serve as a solid foundation for policy. Ultimately, it is in their approach to urban analysisthe emphasis on context, on actual urban problems, inductivism, and some of their mechanisms for change such as George's land tax and cautious abstraction, in that order, along with their combined visionwhich I call diversity in equalitythat can add to the insights of postcolonialism in understanding and transforming urban inequality in Africa.","[Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Property Econ, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Obeng-Odoom, F (通讯作者)，UNRISD, Geneva, Switzerland.",Franklin.Obeng-Odoom@uts.edu.au,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,86,21,22,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This is mainly due to the curse of dimensionality typically affecting multivariate volatility models. In practice only a subset of the potentially available models can be effectively estimated, after imposing severe constraints on the dynamic structure of the volatility process. It follows that in most applications the working forecasting model can be severely misspecified. This situation leaves scope for the application of forecast combination strategies as a tool for improving the predictive accuracy. The aim of the paper is to propose some alternative combination strategies and compare their performances in forecasting high-dimensional multivariate conditional covariance matrices for a portfolio of US stock returns. In particular, we will consider the combination of volatility predictions generated by multivariate GARCH models, based on daily returns, and dynamic models for realized covariance matrices, built from intra-daily returns.

The plaintiff-lawyer relationship is embedded in a dynamic principal-agent setup where the lawyer's effort is unobservable by her client. It is shown that such a sequential process induces an interesting spillover effect for the plaintiff: the prospect of payment at the second period acts as carrot for the first period by inciting the lawyer to make effort in the liability stage in order to enjoy the reward in case of winning when damages are litigated. This effect implies a particular contractual design where the lawyer gets no transfer from the plaintiff at the first period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

I use a novel and comprehensive database on licensing agreements as well as detailed firm-level information on revenues and patents in the semiconductor industry from 1989 to 1999. It would be interesting to evaluate the post-1999 time period, but data constraints prevent me from doing so. I estimate a bivariate probit model accounting for endogenous selection. I find that different types of licensing agreements, that is, ex ante and ex post licensing agreements, help firms eventually resolve realized blocking. Firms engage in licensing before inventing a new technology (ex ante licensing) if they believe competitors hold patents that can potentially block the commercialization of their technology. In contrast, firms engage in licensing after inventing the technology (ex post licensing) if other firms hold patents that block the commercialization of the technology. The estimation results also show that firms' activity in technology and product markets plays an important role in explaining choices between ex ante and ex post licensing agreements. It should be kept in mind that the semiconductor industry is high paced and the data patterns might have changed after 1999.","[Siebert, Ralph] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Siebert, Ralph] CESifo, Dept Econ, Krannert Sch Management, Munich, Germany",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Ifo Institut,"Siebert, R (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",rsiebert@purdue.edu,,,,,,,59,7,7,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In order to provide such a procedure, one needs to ask what the evidence is that grounds Bayesian probabilities. After finding fault with several views on the nature of evidence (the views that evidence is knowledge; that evidence is whatever is fully believed; that evidence is observationally set credence; that evidence is information), it is argued that evidence is whatever is rationally taken for granted. This view is shown to have consequences for an account of merging evidence, and it is argued that standard axioms for merging need to be altered somewhat.","Univ Kent, Dept Philosophy, Canterbury CT2 8AX, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Williamson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Dept Philosophy, Canterbury CT2 8AX, Kent, England.",j.williamson@kent.ac.uk,,"Williamson, Jon/0000-0003-0514-4209",UK Arts and Humanities Research Council; NWO; AHRC [AH/I022957/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/I022957/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This research was conducted as a part of the project From objective Bayesian epistemology to inductive logic supported by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council and was a contribution to the Rationality and Decision network supported by the NWO.

However, due to the private parties' incentive compatibility constraints, the agency can only trigger inspection by one more private party compared to the number of inspections when itself inspects with full frequency.

Yet the real costs and benefits for society as a whole of this technology have received limited attention from economists. In this context, the present paper proposes a thorough cost benefit analysis of policies for the development of electric vehicles in Germany. It also reviews the main existing models of EV diffusion to shed light on the modeling issues underlying the evaluation of EV policies. Elaborating on a comprehensive simulation model, it shows that the potential for EV is fairly limited while there is more room for intermediate technologies like Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles and Range Extenders. The paper concludes that most of the investigated policies have a negative benefit-cost balance. These results are strongly driven by the regulatory framework in which EV diffusion could take place and especially the Car Average Fleet Emission regulation EU 443. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the role of external technology acquisition to investigate whether external technology acquisition is complementary or substitutive to internal R&D activities in creating innovation. The results show that external technology acquisition has an inverted U-shaped relationship with subsequent technology innovation performance, and that is not complementary to internal R&D activities. We thus confirm that external technology acquisition has to be seen as a double-edged sword and that managers need to be aware of the potentially negative effects of strong diversity of the firm's external technology acquisition sources on internal R&D and subsequent innovation performance.","[Kang, Ki H.] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Jo, Gil S.; Kang, Jina] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea",Samsung; Seoul National University (SNU),"Kang, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea.",profkang@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,85,33,34,4,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The study replicates and extends previous research on academic entrepreneurship by providing an empirical analysis using data from 140 USOs in China. The empirical results indicate that three dimensions of EO (innovativeness: IN; proactiveness: PR; and risk-taking: RT) and GNPU have positive effects on the financial performance (FP); PR, RT, and GNPU have positive effects on non-financial performance (NFP) of USOs. In the context of moderating effects, this study finds that only GNPU positively moderates the relationships between IN and FP as well as between PR and NFP, failing to find others. Generally speaking, EO is an important strategic asset and GNPU is an important organisational resource that underpin the establishment of USOs.

In most capitalist countries, business communities attempt to exert their direct or indirect influence over journalists either directly or by purchasing the news and media companies. The authors of this article examine the role of factors that relate to the perceived influence of owners on journalists practices using the data from the Worlds of Journalism survey conducted in 21 countries in 2007-2011 and comprising over 2100 journalists from over 400 news organizations. The authors of this article found that in most of the countries from the sample, business organizations attempt to seize the control over the mass media with a purpose of ameliorating their positive role in the society and creating a favourable image of themselves. Moreover, the business influence on the mass media in some countries (e.g. Israel or Germany) is less ubiquitous than in the case of other countries (e.g. Chile, the Russian Federation, Pakistan, or Turkey). The journalists who work longer hours perceive more subjective influences from the owners; the more hours journalists spend on investigative reporting, the less influence from the owners they perceive; journalists, who typically work on specific stories as opposed to those covering different types of stories, perceive more influence from the owners; the more likely journalists accept money or presents from the people or institutions they cover, the larger is the subjective influence of the mass media business owners.","[Cabelkova, Inna] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic; [Mirvald, Michal] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cabelkova, I (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",inna.cabelkova@fhs.cuni.cz; strielkowski@fsv.cuni.cz; michal.mirvald@isis.vse.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019; Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017; Mirvald, Michal/F-2417-2018","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Mirvald, Michal/0000-0001-7746-8240; Cabelkova, Inna/0000-0002-8302-1004",,,,,29,29,29,0,39,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Here we show that the aggregate data on fertility in England before 1880 conceals significant declines in the fertility of the middle and upper classes earlier.

We consider a setting where complete specialization is optimal with no divorce risk. Couples can self-insure through savings which offers some protection to the uneducated spouse, but at the expense of a distortion. Alternatively, for large divorce probabilities, symmetry in education, where both spouses receive an equal amount of education, may be optimal. This eliminates the risk associated with the lack of education, but reduces the efficiency of education choices. We show that the symmetric allocation will become more attractive as the probability of divorce increases, if risk aversion is high and/or labor supply elasticity is low. However, it is only a second-best solution as insurance protection is achieved at the expense of an efficiency loss. Finally, we study how the (economic) use of marriage is affected by the possibility of divorce.","[Cremer, Helmuth] Toulouse Sch Econ IDEI, F-31015 Toulouse, France; [Cremer, Helmuth] Inst Univ France, F-31015 Toulouse, France; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, CREPP, CORE, UCL, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Pestieau, Pierre] TSE, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Roeder, Kerstin] LMU, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Liege; University of Munich,"Cremer, H (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ IDEI, F-31015 Toulouse, France.",helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Salaries were investigated by taking into account both the demand and supply of labour, characterizing their minimum size in the European Union. The complexity of the issue carried out in the article is supported by the literature studies concerning both aspects of remuneration as well as restructuring, which indicates the difficult scale of restructuring process. The work consists of four parts. The first part, introduction, shows what restructuring is in a concise manner. Next part was characterized by the remuneration in the light of the legislation and items of remuneration in the profit-and-loss balance sheet in the company. Afterwards, the empirical part contains a description of the research methodologies and the results of the empirical research. Finally, the article presented conclusions from the main item of this article, which was to verify the hypothesis: Compensation of the employees is one of the most important determinants that influence taking the decision to restructure by large companies in Poland. The conducted discussion shows that, despite improvement in the rate of minimum wage, Poland still belongs to the group of countries with low wages. However, as it has been proven that, despite the fact that earnings are not that high for the entrepreneurs operating in the conditions of the Polish economy, it is one of the most important factors determining their decision to undertake the restructuring process.","[Gasior, Aleksandra] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Str A Mickiewicza 64-411, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Gasior, A (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Str A Mickiewicza 64-411, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",olag@wneiz.pl,"Gąsior, Aleksandra/HTQ-3948-2023","Gąsior, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3959-6094",,,,,38,1,1,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The results of entrepreneurs' interviews in Russia (in Novosibirsk region, in particular) and the analysis of the activity of financial development institutions allow to conclude that the key cause of it is a considerable lack of investment resources for innovative companies at the seed stage and at the start-up stage. The author makes the conclusion about the necessity to modernize the system investment-innovation lift for SME. Recommendations are given on the expansion of investments at the early stage of the innovation process. These recommendations concern the expansion of cooperation of financial development institutions, the integrated support for angel business investment, the improvement of investment climate. The introduction of these directions for modernizing financial institutions will significantly reduce risk factors and uncertainties in the sphere of innovation activity development, which will guarantee the economic safety of the country and regions, and will also contribute into the fastest overcoming of stagnation.","Russian Acad Econ & Publ Adm, Siberian Inst Management Branch, Novosibirsk 630102, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Gurunyan, T (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Econ & Publ Adm, Siberian Inst Management Branch, Nizhegorodskaya Str 6, Novosibirsk 630102, Russia.",taniagur64@mail.ru,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,20,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-251-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,440,444,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD8BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363785400070,0

However, today's Chinese foreign trade environment made change to differ from the past. At economic growth, the Chinese government made change of growth strategy from export orientation to domestic demand to strengthen competitiveness at high level of industrial structure and to let the Chinese enterprises compete with Korean enterprises. In other words, the Chinese market has quite different competition structure. This study investigated the Chinese market based on precedent study on competition structure in the Japanese market (Kwon and Nam, 2013). The study examined changes of foreign trade environment in the Chinese market from point of view of competition structure to empirically investigate Korean enterprises' export strategies. Korean enterprises had strategies of price priority, economy of scale, and product differentiation at changes of competition structure at the Chinese market. The Korean enterprises were found to keep foothold of market entry and to strengthen production ability of special products and to have low profit and insufficient economic outcome, so that they had difficulty at pursuit of profits at the Chinese market.","[Ham, Ki-Soo] Myongji Univ, Grad Sch Business Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Youn] Gachon Univ, Grad Sch Business Management, Seoul, South Korea",Myongji University; Gachon University,"Lee, SY (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Grad Sch Business Management, Seoul, South Korea.",ksham11@naver.com; rmi21lee@hanmail.net,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,2015,,,,,,,401,403,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9RF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365145700072,0

Yet the problem associated with this technique arises from the limited ability of the model to effectively deal with relations among variables, nonlinearity, and multicolinearity. Therefore, several alternative techniques had been explained to improve the reliabilities of forecasting information, one of the most commonly accepted techniques is the application of artificial neural network. Consequently this work intent to develop a forecasting model for residential property prices in Malaysia using an artificial neural network approach. The objective is tested with real time market data. Unemployment rate, population, mortgage rate and household income are chosen as the housing influencing variables (independent variable). On the other hand, Housing Price Index (HPI) was chosen as the dependent variable due to its ability to reflect the country price trend. Quarterly time-series data from 2000 until 2009 are obtained and applied for training and testing the ANN model. Subsequently, data for 2010 and 2011 is used to validate the model. Model validation gives Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 8% thereby suggesting high accuracy of adopting neural network in ability to learn, generalize, and converge time series data efficiently and produce reliable forecasting information.","[Radzi, Mohamad Shukry B.

The purpose of this study is to develop extended technology acceptance model in Internet shopping situation and test it empirically using field survey. Drawing from TAM, trust theory and consumer motivation theory toward surfing the web site, this study identifies usefulness, ease of use, playfulness and trust as the determinants of attitude toward using the virtual store. Also two key antecedent factors(information richness, system quality) affecting these determinants are identified as external variables. The results from an online survey of 278 online consumers indicate that the model is able to explain and predict consumer adoption of virtual stores substantially well. The results reflect the impact of (a) system quality on perceived usefulness; (b) information richness on perceived ease of use; (c) information richness on playfulness (d) perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, playfulness, trust on attitude ( attitude on behavioral intention.

Czechia is the appropriate economy to study this phenomenon because it is heavily involved in foreign trade predominantly owned by international investors and has been applying a floating exchange rate arrangement for many years. We analyze the period from 1993 to 2013 and disaggregate the data according to trading partner and product category. While the effect of exchange rate level is examined by a modified vector error correction model the effect of exchange rate volatility is analyzed through an extended gravity model. The detailed results obtained from empirical estimations clearly show that the relationship between exchange rates and foreign trade in Czechia does not completely correspond with the theoretical assumptions. We revealed that domestic currency depreciation worsens in the long-term trade balance in substantial parts of the Czech foreign trade, such as in the trade of machinery and transport equipment with Germany, Austria and France. The classical J-curve effect was confirmed only for the trading of beverages and tobacco with Italy and for the trading of manufactured goods with Slovakia. We also found that an increased exchange rate volatility does not necessarily reduce foreign trade turnover, as the results for crude materials, fuels, chemical and manufactured products indicate. By contrast, the theoretical expectation of negative impact of volatility was validated for machinery, transport equipment, food and animals. Therefore, although Czechia is a small, open economy, the exchange rate effects on foreign trade significantly differ in magnitude and direction across the trading partners and product groups.","[Simakova, Jana; Stavarek, Daniel] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Simáková, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",simakova@opf.slu.cz; stavarek@opf.slu.cz,"Šimáková, Jana/ABF-8573-2020; Stavárek, Daniel/A-7134-2010","Šimáková, Jana/0000-0002-4194-9971; Stavárek, Daniel/0000-0001-5061-1721",Student Grant System of Silesian University [SGS/7/2013],Student Grant System of Silesian University,Publication of this paper was supported by the Student Grant System of Silesian University (project SGS/7/2013).

Throughout the years, the marketing specialists worked tremendously trying to find a way to deliver friendly interfaces and tools, clear content and structure to online users and to be able to catch the responses and transform them in net value. These responses, being vital to the future marketing campaigns, are important to be identified and captured, but just gathering them in a database is not enough for the marketing campaign to be successful; both a system of reference and a reporting program prove to be needed. With the aim of providing a complex and useful understanding, the paper focuses on the importance, content, structure and design of landing pages in online marketing campaigns for IT companies following two perspectives: an exploratory, qualitative research to underline the point of view of digital marketing subject matter experts, and a quantitative one to reflect the point of view of online users/visitors in this regard.

The creative economy is considered as a leading component of economic growth, especially for developing countries, able to create and circulate intellectual capital, to generate income, employment, innovation and trade earnings while at the same time promoting cultural diversity, social inclusion and human development. In realizing a creative economy three key pillars are needed to be developed and sustained: talent, technology and innovation, and the social context. This paper aims to to provide a snapshot of the state of the art of creative economy of Balkan countries and their dynamics in time, by focalizing on three main elements: talent, technology and social context.

The problem of uneven-aged management within stands and forests can be reduced to the analysis of simultaneous optimal times of harvest and regeheration of interdependently growing trees. Restricting attention to a market environment, a forest investment model is developed which accounts for the opportunity to manage trees or stands individually. As a consequence, age class forests evolve as the optimal compromise between two opposing effects. They allow for a combination of the advantages of uneven-aged management by utilizing differences in tree growth on a larger scale and of even-aged management by exploiting locally effective positive inter-tree dependencies on a smaller scale. Accordingly, the emergence of the forest structure is determined by the dynamics in the balance of value growth and impact rate differences.

This degradation process can be particularly witnessed in the case of the footwear industry which experienced two large waves of decline, one during the change of regime in 1989 and the other after the turn of the millennium. In the background of the changing performance of the footwear sector there were also significant structural changes during both periods of decline. Integration into global production networks by subcontracting or as subsidiaries of foreign enterprises, process and functional upgrading tendencies within the existing value chains as well as the establishment of Hungary's own brand products for niche markets are the most important issues in this respect. This study is built upon two key questions: (1) What kind of dynamics does the Hungarian footwear industry show during its integration into the (global) production networks of the sector? (2) How are global production networks becoming embedded into the local economy; and to what extent can the transformation of the Hungarian footwear industry be considered as a pathand place-dependent process? The empirical research is based on semi-structured and in-depth interviews carried out in the last three years with representatives of enterprises from eleven industrial locations - comprising about 35 % of the total sectoral employment - in addition to sector- relevant national and local institutions.","[Molnar, Erno] Univ Debrecen, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev Planning, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Molnár, E (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev Planning, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",molnar.erno@science.unideb.hu,"Molnár, Ernő/ISS-2070-2023",,Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences),This paper was supported by the Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.,,35,4,4,0,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

In markets with substantial excess demand, however, demand effects may be insufficient to induce any change in firm behavior and enforcement may be required to ensure high quality. Even with enforcement, quality still may not improve at underperforming firms if gaming the system is less costly than improving quality. We test whether information alone or with regulatory enforcement improves outcomes or elicits gaming behavior in our study of 266 kidney transplant centers between 2001 and 2012. In a context of excess demand induced by price controls, we show that information alone has no impact and enforcement may actually increase market inefficiencies; firms respond to costly quality requirements, not by improving quality, but by reducing supply, which exacerbates the disequilibrium between supply and demand, and by cream-skimming, which reduces access to transplantation among sicker patients.","[Stith, Sarah S.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Hirth, Richard A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of New Mexico; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Stith, SS (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",ssstith@unm.edu; rhirth@umich.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy at the University of New Mexico; Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan; Health Resources and Services Administration [234-2005-370011C],Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy at the University of New Mexico; Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan; Health Resources and Services Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA)),"We thank the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy at the University of New Mexico and the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan for the financial support necessary to purchase the data used in this paper as well as Tom Buchmueller, Brady Horn, Alan Leichtman, Lauren Nicholas, seminar attendees at IUPUI and the RWJF Center for Health Policy, and participants at the Fifth Biennial Conference of the American Society of Health Economics for helpful comments.

In this paper, the ITV of cars and public transport trips is analysed. We estimate the effect of each trip stage on the TTV for complete door-to-door public transport trips, including access, waiting, transfer and in-vehicle time. We employ data from Santiago, Chile, in which surveyors performed predetermined trips and recorded each stage on several days between 2007 and 2011, which were complemented by recorded bus GPS data. We found that (i) bus waiting and in-vehicle times are highly significant in explaining total (door-to-door) TTV relative to metro (subway) travel times, whereas walking time is not significant; (ii) metro travel time is generally more stable but may be more skewed compared with the travel time of buses on a segregated right-of-way; and (iii) buses that travel in mixed traffic have not only a larger mean travel time but also a larger variability than buses that travel in bus lanes and segregated busways. Formal cost benefit analysis should consider the effect of (total or partial) segregation of public transport operation on reducing travel time variability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It then contrasts those existing regimes with the specific case of a Community Franchise (CF) business regime with Individual Line Ownership (ILO), as currently exists in the ski lifting industry and as it may potentially be transferred to an urban public transport context. Traditional economic theory is supplemented by considering theories from human psychology, complexity theory and the evolutionary effects from more traditional theoretical understandings of equilibrium economics. This theoretical review highlights the idiosyncrasies of the CF/ILO business regime. Existing regimes are shown to have incentives that do not necessarily benefit consumers of transport services, but are conducive to unintended outcomes shaped by political and commercial forces. The CF/ILO regime, because of its particular structure, is shown to be less prone to these same forces and more responsive to consumer demands with potential benefits for passengers and government transport objectives. As well there is shown to be more incentive in the CF/ILO to manage capital expenditure in a prudent fashion.

Based on the production function approach, we assumed that there are three types of production factors: capital stock, labor force, and seaports capital stock. The functional form of the Cobb -Douglass production function is used in this study. Empirical results confirm the existence of the positive economic effects of the seaports' investments in Tunisia's economic growth. They also show an unequal distribution of the positive economic effects regarding the country's economic sectors. In addition, they revealed that SII seems to be even more beneficial to the services sector than the manufacturing sector. These results are very important for decision makers for developing a policy for the seaports and avoiding the unequal distribution of the economic benefits between the country's economic sectors.","[Jouili, Tahar; Allouche, Mohamed Anis] Northern Border Univ, Coll Business Adm, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia",Northern Border University,"Jouili, T (通讯作者)，Northern Border Univ, Coll Business Adm, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia.",jouili_tahar@yahoo.fr,,,Northern Border University (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia),Northern Border University (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia),The authors would like to thank the Northern Border University (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) for supporting this work.,,24,3,3,0,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Although endowed with gatekeeping responsibilities, executive lawyers face increasing pressure to spend time on strategic efforts. In a fixed-effects model, we quantify that lawyers are half as important as chief executive officers in explaining variances in compliance, monitoring, and business development. In a difference-in-differences model, we find that hiring lawyers as executives is associated with a 50 percent reduction in compliance breaches and a 32 percent reduction in monitoring breaches. We ask if optimal contracting of lawyers into strategic activities implies less gatekeeping effort. Comparing executive lawyers hired from law firms to lawyers poached from corporations, we find that lawyers hired with high compensation delta (indicative of the importance of strategic goals in compensation contracts) do less monitoring, which prevents 25 percent fewer breaches than are typically mitigated by having an executive gatekeeper. Reassuringly, lawyers do not compromise compliance.","[Morse, Adair] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Wei; Wu, Serena] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Queens University - Canada,"Morse, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Wang, Wei/0000-0002-7462-951X",Smith School of Business Research Program,Smith School of Business Research Program,"We thank Dhammika Dharmapala, an anonymous referee, an anonymous editor, Andres Almazan, Shashwat Alok, Jennifer Arlen, Paul Calluzzo, Qiang Cheng, Evan Dudley, Carola Frydman, Todd Gormley, E.

This is reminiscent of the idea of global pipelines of knowledge transfer that is found in the geographical literature. The deep citations are used to identify technological trajectories, which are the main directions along which incremental technological progress accumulates into larger changes. While the origin and destination of these trajectories are concentrated in space, the intermediate nodes travel long distances and cover many locations across the globe.

A discussion of intermodal transport invites us to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of diverse modes, as they relate to strategic planning decisions and particularly land use, along with considering ways that cities could get more out of these synergies. Thinking about cycling and buses in terms of intermodality in cities and metropolitan regions also invites reflection on the nature of a sustainable transport system: Is it enough to contest the mono-mode of the car simply by replacing it with another mono-mode, public transport, or would it be useful to think in terms of ecologies of diverse modes, able to respond to different needs, budgets, and people? Could bike-bus systems become the main articulators of sustainable cities in the 21st century? What advantages would this offer in terms of land use, health, inclusion and other social benefits? This study examines these issues in the context of democratizing governance systems that include strong, collaborative types of citizen participation, which can help to overcome often fragmented urban governance systems, and build toward more integrated, sustainability-oriented transport and urban systems.

However, because property sale price partly reflects speculation on future capital gains, it sheds little light on the renters' willingness-to-pay for living near public transportation facilities, let alone the variation in rent premium for transit proximity. We in this paper employ a spatial quantile hedonic regression method to gauge the rental impact of metro stations on a large sample of two-bedroom-one-bathroom (2b1b) apartments across 2575 residential complex communities (or xiaoqu in mandarin Chinese) in Shanghai, China, as observed between December 2012 and January 2013. We find: a) a community's geographic adjacency to the nearest Shanghai Metro station tends to correlate positively with the xiaoqu's average asking rent of 2b1b apartments, indicating a significant rent premium for transit proximity; b) although the transit premium fluctuates across the different rent levels, the variation is statistically insignificant, suggesting no evidence of transit -induced segmentation of the local private residential rental market. Apart from its policy implications, this paper demonstrates a US-China comparative perspective and a novel spatial quantile regression approach to test the segmentation effect of mass transit in a dynamic urban housing market.

We test the time-series version of this hypothesis by looking at changes in Chilean groups over 20 years (1990-2009). In this period, Chile experienced a deep economic transformation as measured by common proxies of market development (e.g., per capita income doubled). Despite this dramatic transformation, groups remained mostly unchanged in terms of relative size, industrial diversification, vertical integration, control structures, internal capital markets, and reliance on external funds (minority equity plus debt). Only leverage increased. Also, groups' initial conditions were uncorrelated with market development at the time of formation. This evidence casts doubts on the institutional-voids hypothesis, although more subtle institutional voids, not captured by the type of macro proxies we use, might explain the existence and resilience of business groups.","[Larrain, Borja] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm & Finance UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago, Chile; [Urzua, Francisco, I] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Larrain, B (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm & Finance UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago, Chile.",borja.larrain@uc.cl; urzuainfante@rsm.nl,,"Urzua, Francisco/0000-0003-4681-7684; Larrain, Borja/0000-0003-1088-0550",Programa Fondecyt [1141161],Programa Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),Larrain acknowledges partial financial support provided by Programa Fondecyt (Proyecto Fondecyt Regular #1141161).,,42,13,14,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Their relevance is even greater when scale economies are at work since production is concentrated and goods must be shipped. Recent literature has found that highways, by decreasing transport costs, are crucial in influencing agglomeration economies and ultimately urban development. In this article, we contribute to this literature by studying the effect of highway construction on the structure of local economies. In particular, we consider the effect of highways in Italian cities in terms of firm location by explicitly recognizing the pivotal role played by the transport sector and by intersectoral linkages in promoting development. The main research hypothesis is that the location of an highway exit in a given city attracts firms operating in the transport service sector and consequently transport-intensive firms. Our empirical evidence concerns Italian cities over the period 1951-2001 and exploits variation in employment, population and plants induced by the construction of the highway network. To deal with the endogeneity of the geography of highways exits, we propose as an instrument the geography of Roman roads. To this end, we have coded the whole network of Roman roads in Italy. We have found that the location of highway exits increases employment and the number of plants and that this growth is concentrated in transport service-intensive sectors. This result is robust to a number of checks, including eventual instrument non-validity and selection into treatment.","[Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Roentgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Via Roentgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy.",marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,23,47,51,1,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In this paper we address the causes of intra-regional differentiation in decline in the Dutch region Southern-Limburg. The quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that in the 1900-1945 period, differentiation in population development was the result of economic boom and bust in the mining areas. After 1945 (except for 1985-1989) however, the economic argument lost much of its relevance: intra-regional differentiation has primarily been the result of intra-regional and international migration and these flows are steered predominantly by life course motives, the uneven spatial distribution of housing opportunities and access to these opportunities within the region.","[Hoekveld, Josje J.] Ptolemaeuslaan 80, NL-3502 HB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bontje, Marco] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Programme Grp Urban Geog, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Hoekveld, JJ (通讯作者)，Ptolemaeuslaan 80, NL-3502 HB Utrecht, Netherlands.",josje_hoekveld@am.nl; m.a.bontje@uva.nl,"Bontje, Marco A./A-8533-2008","Bontje, Marco/0000-0002-8326-9528",,,,,46,9,9,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We found that the current LUTI models perform well in practical applications with regard to urban policy and infrastructure planning. However, there is concern that a vast fragmented array of models may have limitations in coping with emerging practical requirements, particularly as the analytical requirements for urban policies concerned with sustainability are growing wider and deeper. This paper provides insight into the two viable directions of LUTI studies: one is more flexible and complex, and involves intensive modeling at the local scale; the other involves simplified modeling at regional, national, and global scales. The co-evolution of these two approaches is expected to contribute to sustainability science. By cross referencing these two distinct approaches a balance can be found between the details of reality and the abstraction of theory thus increasing knowledge within the field. This would further enhance the potential of LUTI studies as urban environments become more dynamic and unpredictable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of the measures are to enhance resilience of banks and households to financial shocks and to curb cyclical tendencies in the mortgage market. The timing of the introduction of the measures was carefully considered and reflected emerging imbalances in the market as well as existing vulnerabilities in the household and banking sectors. While similar measures have been introduced in other jurisdictions, the design and application of the measures differ across countries. Some specific aspects of the design of the Irish measures include differentiated treatment for first-time buyers, buy-to-let borrowers and homeowners in negative equity. This paper discusses the rationale for the introduction of the measures as well as issues relating to their design and implementation.","[Cassidy, Mark; Hallissey, Niamh] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Cassidy, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,41,8,9,0,3,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

One criticism of jury sentencing is that jurors will be tempted to issue compromise verdicts, where they return a guilty verdict but a light sentence when they are uncertain about the facts of a case. A simple expected utility model shows that any fact finder with sentencing discretion should engage in behavior that is observationally equivalent to a compromise verdict. Intuitively, the fact finder chooses a more lenient sentence than the punishment that fits the crime because he wants to mitigate the potential cost of a wrongful conviction; in turn, a lower cost of a wrongful conviction leads him to reduce his standard of proof. Although critics of jury sentencing intuit the risk of compromise, a bench trial poses the same risk for a judge. Alternatively, the jury trial format (jury verdict, judge sentence) can lessen the risk of compromise if juries are denied punishment information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Optimism and other forms of inflated perception of the self lead parties to exercise suboptimal precautions when undertaking risky activities and often undermine the incentive effects of tort rules. In this paper, we show that the presence of optimism undermines several critical assumptions, upon which law and economics scholars have relied when modeling the incentive effects of tort law. We construct a model representing the incentives of optimistic tortfeasors and victims, and consider mechanisms for mitigating the effects of biased decision-making. We show that in the presence of optimism, comparative negligence rules are preferable to contributory negligence rules (i.e., the traditional equivalence between contributory and comparative negligence does not hold). Further, we discover the surprising conclusion that the most effective way to correct optimism may often simply be to forgive it, shielding optimistic individuals from liability, rather than holding them liable for the harms they cause.","[Luppi, Barbara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Econ, Modena, Italy; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Parisi, Francesco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Bologna,"Parisi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Parisi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy.",barbara.luppi@unimore.it; parisi@umn.edu,"Parisi, Francesco/CAJ-0100-2022; Luppi, Barbara/J-3175-2016","Parisi, Francesco/0000-0003-2807-2279; Luppi, Barbara/0000-0002-1969-9099",,,,,52,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

HFT is often discussed as a purely technological development, where all that matters is the speed of allocating, processing and transmitting data. Indeed, the speed at which trades are executed and data transmitted is accelerating, and it is fair to say that algorithms are now the primary interacting agents operating in the financial markets. However, we contend that HFT is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. More specifically, both individuals and collective agents - such as algorithms - might be considered cultural entities, charged with very different ways of processing information, making sense of it and turning it into knowledge and practice. This raises issues relating to situated knowledge, distributed cognition and action, the assignment of responsibility when regulating high-speed algorithms, their history, organizational structure and, perhaps more fundamentally, their representation.","[Lange, Ann-Christina] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Lenglet, Marc] European Business Sch Paris, Management Strategy Syst Dept, 10 Rue Sextius Michel, F-75015 Paris, France; [Seyfert, Robert] Europa Univ Viadrina, Robert Seyfert, Grosse Scharrnstr 59, D-15230 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Seyfert, Robert] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Excellence, Cultural Foundat Integratio, D-78457 Constance, Germany",Copenhagen Business School; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; University of Konstanz,"Lange, AC (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",ala.mpp@cbs.dk; marclenglet@ebs-paris.com; seyfert@europa-uni.de,"LENGLET, Marc/M-2815-2019","LENGLET, Marc/0000-0002-7267-9425; Seyfert, Robert/0000-0002-9667-1970","Danish Research Council for Independent Research; 'Evaluation Practices in Financial Markets' project - European Research Council; 'Governing Financial Algorithms' project - UK's Leverhulme Trust; 'Risk, Uncertainty and Non-/knowledge in the Financial Market' project - Cultural Foundations of Social Integration Center of Excellence at the University of Konstanz","Danish Research Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); 'Evaluation Practices in Financial Markets' project - European Research Council; 'Governing Financial Algorithms' project - UK's Leverhulme Trust; 'Risk, Uncertainty and Non-/knowledge in the Financial Market' project - Cultural Foundations of Social Integration Center of Excellence at the University of Konstanz","This special issue evolved out of a series of international workshops that took place at Copenhagen Business School, Denmark, in 2014 and at the University of Konstanz, Germany, in 2015 (the concluding workshop takes place in Paris, France, in 2017).

In addition to the effects of seasonality, holidays and marketing, correlated random disturbances also affect sales across stores that share common characteristics. We propose a novel method, Two-Stage Information Sharing that takes advantage of this challenging complexity. In this method, segment-specific panel regressions with seasonality and marketing variables pool the data, in order to provide better parameter estimates. The residuals are then extrapolated non-parametrically using features that are constructed from the last twelve months of observations from the focal and related category-store time series. The final forecast combines the extrapolated residuals with the forecasts from the first stage. Working with the extensive dataset of a leading Turkish retailer, we show that this method significantly outperforms both panel regression models (mixed model) with an AR(1) error structure and the autoregressive distributed lags (ADL) model, as well as the univariate exponential smoothing (Winters') method. The further out the prediction, the greater the improvement. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The intentions of potential and retained passengers to use intermodal transfer are influenced by the different amounts of information they possess as well as potential intermodal transfer penalties and benefits (perceived value and free bus transfer). Thus, this study adopts the information processing theory to investigate such behavior intentions and to derive various market segmentation strategies between potential and retained passengers concerning their transfer service use. We also look at the interrelationships between the two main constructs, transfer penalties and benefits, and adopt structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. The analytical results show that perceived transfer penalties, perceived values, and free bus transfer all influence metro-bus transfer intentions. Perceived value is the most essential determinant of behavioral intention among all the other attributes related to transit transfer in this study and can mediate the relationship between free bus transfer and transfer intentions. The study's conclusions have managerial implications for metro system and bus system agencies and may be applied to intermodal transfer services in other transportation industries. Perceived value of metro-bus transfer service usage can possibly be elevated through the following measures: timetable coordination between metro and bus agencies, passenger guidance information, comfortable bus shelters and waiting environment provisions, low-floor bus services, and smart card integration between the metro and buses.

Drawing on the exploration/exploita- tion perspective and based on data collected from Statistical Yearbook on Science and Technology Activities of Industrial Enterprises, we look into the relationship between gov- ernment subsidization and Chinese firms' innovation efficiency by applying a stochastic frontier analysis. The results show that when government subsidies are provided in small scale, firms' innovation efficiency decreases; only when government subsidies increase to a certain scale, does firms' innovation efficiency start to increase. We suggest that govern- ment subsidization would generate better innovation performance should it concentrate on a smaller number of firms at one time. As existing research is still inconclusive regarding the relationship between government subsidization and firms' technological innovation output, we shed light on the issue by revealing a U-shaped relationship between the two.","[Huang, Qi; Miao, Jianjun] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, 29 Jiangjun Rd, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Marshall S.] Brock Univ, Goodman Sch Business, 500 Glenridge Ave, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Brock University,"Jiang, MS (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Goodman Sch Business, 500 Glenridge Ave, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",175693638@qq.com; mjiang@brocku.ca; miao@nuaa.edu.cn,,,,,,,38,29,34,2,87,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

It becomes fundamental, in this context, to understand such programs and evaluate their impact, both within companies and externally, in terms of their decision making and business results. This paper aims to do that, through a study of the work-related training practices of in- dustrial firms in the Northern-Spanish region of Asturias. In addition, it develops a new variable - training intensity - and examines its impact on the planning, execution and evaluation of training programs in these firms. Among other findings, our study confirms that training-intensive firms have a more defined strategic approach to the market and are generally more conscious of business competition than their non-training-intensive competitors. Implications for management are also presented.","[Perez-Bustamante Ilander, Guillermo O.] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Business, Avda Cristo S-N, Oviedo 33007, Spain; [Marques, Carla S.

This is the first study that comprehensively explores this phenomenon in Central and Eastern European countries. We find strong evidence that announcement of a takeover creates value for both bidders and acquirers in the short run. Simultaneously, contrary to the stylized fact reported by a majority of U.S. based studies, after controlling for local value, size, and momentum factors the mergers and acquisitions do not destroy the value of the acquirers in the long term. The observations are important for corporate governance and portfolio management. The research is based on 109 deals in years 2001-2014. For the short-horizon event studies, we calculate average cumulative abnormal returns and we employ of the zero, index, and market models.

In this paper, we test the long memory feature of bulk freight rate index and discover scaling behavior. However, the scaling behavior can be eliminated after nonlinear noise reduction technique, thus high-frequency noise can be presumed as the cause of scaling behavior. Additionally, comparison of long memory features between different vessel sizes, Supramax, Panamax and Capesize bulk carriers, is also accomplished both before and after noise reduction. Empirical results show that their differences would disappear after noise reduction, indicating that load capacity is one of the short-term external factors which result in high frequency noises in freight rate index time series.","[Dai, Siyu; Zeng, Yadong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Engn, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feier] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Engn, China Inst Strategy Res Ocean Explorat Equipment, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Chen, FE (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Engn, China Inst Strategy Res Ocean Explorat Equipment, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",daisiyujj@sjtu.edu.cn; zengya-dong@flute.sh.cn; chenfeier@sjtu.edu.cn,"Zeng, Yadong/AAB-7827-2022; Chen, Feier/J-6838-2019; Dai, Siyu/AAX-4082-2021","Zeng, Yadong/0000-0001-5368-7908; Chen, Feier/0000-0002-3234-6896; Dai, Siyu/0000-0002-0924-3629",Center for Teaching and Learning Development of Shanghai Jiao Tong University [STLD15B2001]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [12YJCGJW001]; Inter-discipline Foundation of Social Science and Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University [15JCMY11],Center for Teaching and Learning Development of Shanghai Jiao Tong University; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Inter-discipline Foundation of Social Science and Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"The authors would like to thank the Editor and reviewers for their valuable comments.

This paper studies a principal who only observes the joint output by two limitedly liable agents, while agents receive signals about each other's effort levels. The principal attempts to exploit this information through peer evaluation; agents are asked to report their signal and may receive a bonus for being evaluated positively. Lying aversion ascertains that truthful evaluation is possible, while interpersonal relations between colleagues give an incentive to misreport. This paper shows that peer evaluation gives an incentive for effort, even when the evaluations are not truthful. The peer evaluation bonus is constrained by more intensive coworker relations. Still, the optimal contract always includes a peer evaluation bonus, sometimes complemented with a team bonus. Coworker relations have nonmonotonic effects on profits in the optimal contract.","[Sol, Joeri] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Sol, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands.",j.sol@uva.nl,,"Sol, Joeri/0000-0002-1097-1412",,,,,46,5,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In New York's outer region car travel is four times per capita than what it is in its urban area. The comparative analyses are based on the UK National Travel Survey and the US National Household Travel Survey. The population outside Greater London' Green Belt and New York's periphery has been growing relentlessly since the 1950s. The transport structure of the South East of England and the New York Tri-State area has been largely shaped around the private car. Measures that aim to meet CO2 emission targets will need address the nature of the cardependent developments of London's and New York's growing outer fringe. The paper compares the current travel structure of the outer regions of the two cities that are nearly exclusively moulded around the motorcar. Using specially commissioned spatial breakdowns of the respective household travel survey data, detailed travel behaviour is analysed for both the urban and exurban areas. The data illustrates the stark contrast in mobility of the urban and exurban areas of the cities. Through an analysis of current vehicle use, estimates of CO2 emissions are made using established average emission factors per vehicle in each region. In our study of London and New York regions the exurban areas produce the bulk of car-based CO2 emissions: 77% for the London region and 87% for the New York region. Furthermore, using existing population forecasts and estimates of future average CO2 emissions per vehicle, future levels of CO2 emissions from private vehicles are estimated. Our estimates show that the CO2 emission reduction targets that have been set will not be met by a large margin.

It highlights the importance of IPC and focuses on how crucial interprofessional communication is among professionals to achieve positive IPC. A literature review of health care management, interprofessional care and health sciences related to interprofessional communication and IPC practice among health care professionals are performed. The electronic database for the Health Sciences and Health Administration (MEDLINE) was searched. The selection criteria of this paper include studies that examine the effectiveness of interprofessional communication towards IPC among health care professionals. Health care professionals include nurses, physicians, and a variety of clinical specialists. The review of nearly 200 manuscripts identified that only 24 are applicable for this review. Among all, only one evaluates managers as respondents, others, focus on physicians, therapists, surgeons, graduate students, oncologists, and so on. The key finding suggested that all selected literature provide conclusive findings on the relationship between interprofessional communication and IPC. Physicians and medical graduates appeared to have less attitude towards interprofessional communication and IPC. On top of that, none of the literature evaluates non-verbal aspects of communication in the study. Future research is needed to close the research gaps identified in this review.

The research is conducted on a sample of 16 failed and 21 non-failed non-financial companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange between 2002 and 2012. The Logit analysis is used for identifying the variables that are significant and have predictive power on distress likelihood. By using 12 main financial ratios, we estimate three alternative Logit models for determining their signs, significance, predictive power, efficiency of fit tests. The first model provides the highest explanatory power. Three variables such as Flexibility ratio (FLEX), Assets turnover (ASTU) and Current assets turnover (CASTU) are found to be significant determinants for stock exchange delisting. These three variables provide 52.59% of correct prediction of bankruptcy risk. The percentage for correctly classified observations for the fitted Logit model is of 83.33%. Moreover, this research attempts to reveal the changes that may appear among bankruptcy predictors given that the bankruptcy risk model is developed from the investors' point of view and not from that of a simple decision-making person. For a stock market investor, bankruptcy already starts at the stage of delisting the company because the investment was strongly compromised, whether or it continues its activity or not. Orientation towards investors when predicting bankruptcy risk is the main element of originality that our research adds to the scientific achievements in bankruptcy, until this moment.","[Achim, Monica Violeta] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Borlea, Sorin Nicolae] West Vasile Goldis Univ, Fac Econ Informat & Engn, Arad, Romania; [Gaban, Lucian Vasile] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Fac Econ Alba Iulia, Alba Iulia, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia,"Achim, MV (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",monica.achim@econ.ubbcluj.ro; snborlea@yahoo.com; luciangaban@yahoo.com,"Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/AAP-9288-2020; Achim, Monica/C-5811-2017","Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/0000-0002-9987-3682; Achim, Monica/0000-0003-4701-041X; Gaban, Lucian/0000-0001-7317-4798",,,,,39,1,2,1,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Moreover, due to the importance of the uncertainty in modeling the macroeconomic policy and to the increasing attention that central banks should pay to the anticipation of the future macroeconomic conditions, another objective of the research is to identify and analyze the role of shocks in explaining the business cycles, such as: preference shocks, country-premium shocks and government spending shock.","[Alina, Ionita Georgiana; Adrian, Petre] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Alina, IG (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",georgiana.alina.ionita@gmail.com; adrian.petre21@gmail.com,"Petre, Adrian/HTL-4929-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,1527,1539,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700154,0

One plausible source of such spatial clustering is local social interactions, where individuals' decisions to become entrepreneurs are influenced by entrepreneurial neighbors. Using geo-coded matched employer-employee data for Sweden, we find that sharing residential neighborhood with established entrepreneurs has a statistically significant and robust influence on the probability that an individual leaves employment for entrepreneurship. An otherwise average neighborhood with a 5% point higher entrepreneurial intensity, all else equal, produces between six and seven additional entrepreneurs per square kilometer, each year. Our estimates suggest a local feedback-effect in which the presence of established entrepreneurs in a neighborhood influences the emergence of new local entrepreneurs. Our analysis supports the conjecture that social interaction effects constitute a mechanism by which local entrepreneurship clusters in cities develop and persist over time.","[Andersson, Martin; Larsson, Johan P.] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Dept Ind Econ, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Larsson, Johan P.] JIBS, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ CEnSE, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Larsson, Johan P.] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Blekinge Institute Technology; Jonkoping University,"Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Dept Ind Econ, Karlskrona, Sweden.",martin.andersson@circle.lu.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021","Larsson, Johan P./0000-0001-7432-7442","FORMAS [2011-80]; Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus) [349200680]; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA [2010-07370]","FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus)(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA(Vinnova)","This work has benefitted from financial support from FORMAS (Dnr 2011-80), as well as the Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus Grant No. 349200680) and the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA, (Grant agreement 2010-07370).",,67,69,73,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

A qualitative case methodology using in-depth interviews reflects an ontological and epistemological perspective of a socially constructed reality. Commercial participants with extensive time and experience in the field provide multiple voices to comprehend relationship phenomena in the social media context. Rich data is analysed via thematic coding and understanding is built via data saturation. Findings identify that a relationship generation process based on four focal aspects results in seven positive impacts for the firm. Effective social media strategy may increase enterprise survival capacity, boost customer acquisition and retention, plus - assist online competitiveness. Ultimately, avoidance of the technology desert will assist in the survival of the smaller-sized firm in an increasingly competitive and aggressive retail environment. The paper concludes that communicating via social media will become increasingly important in the pursuit of customer acquisition, retention and effective relationship building as consumers continue to migrate online.","[Ashworth, Catherine J.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business, All St Campus, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University,"Ashworth, CJ (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business, All St Campus, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",c.j.ashworth@mmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,378,385,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700039,0

Despite the growing interest of scientists, the phenomenon is not well recognized, and some aspects remain relatively scarcely studied. World literature on the internationalization of medical services focuses predominantly on describing the market and entities operating on it, and very few research papers have been devoted to the issue of medical tourism in Europe. The authors of the presented article focus on the consumer's perception of the medical services. The theoretical base for a given research paper is the concept referring to the effect of the country of origin (COO). The aim of the study is to answer the following questions: 1/Does the image of a country influence the purchase intentions for medical services; 2/How do the purchase intentions for medical services vary, dependent on the country of origin of the service. Data have been collected using a questionnaire developed by the authors. In order to provide an in-depth analysis, a weighted COO coefficient has been introduced. 264 respondents have participated in the research. The data have been collected from German, Lithuanian and Polish participants. The analysis of regression has been applied as a statistical method. The results confirm that the image of the country is crucial for purchase intentions. Readiness to purchase medical services varies between services offered by Germany, Lithuania and Poland: the lowest is for the Polish medical services, and the highest for the services offered in Germany. The results of the research can be applied in business practice and in the strategies developed by institutions shaping the image of the country and positioning it in the international context.","[Boguszewicz-Kreft, Monika; Magier-Lakomy, Ewa; Sokolowska, Katarzyna] WSB Univ, Gdansk, Poland; [Janiunaite, Brigita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Boguszewicz-Kreft, M (通讯作者)，WSB Univ, Gdansk, Poland.",monika.boguszewicz@gmail.com; magier.ewa@gmail.com; sokkat@wp.pl; brigita.janiunaite@ktu.lt,"Boguszewicz-Kreft, Monika/AAW-1919-2020",,,,,,48,1,1,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,176,187,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500019,0

That transition is about accumulating new narrowly defined 'technological' components of innovation capability and changing the broad organisational and institutional context within which the technological (and economic) process of innovation takes place. During the catch-up phase of technological and economic development in successful emerging economies, that institutional dimension of the innovation system evolves particular characteristics that are well adapted to achieving effectiveness in the catch-up mode of innovation. This paper suggests that (1) these institutional characteristics may be less effective with respect to post catch-up innovation and (2) the institutional context adapted for catch-up innovation may not evolve adequately rapidly into the new forms required for effectiveness in post catch-up innovation. Consequently, these rigidities may become a source of lock-in - so contributing an institution-centred source of 'failure in system transition' in the innovation system.","[Choung, Jae-Yong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 305701, South Korea; [Hwang, Hye-Ran] Daejeon Dev Inst, 160-20 Wolpyung Dong, Daejeon 302280, South Korea; [Choi, Jun Kyun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 305701, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Choi, JK (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 305701, South Korea.",jkchoi59@kaist.ac.kr,"choung, jae-yong/C-1757-2011",,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant; Korean Government [NRF-2011-371-H00002],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korean Government(Korean Government),"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant, funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2011-371-H00002].",,44,11,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The specialised knowledge and international connections of immigrants can be a stimulus for the host country's market. This study focuses on the Austrian province Burgenland because this region of Austria was the one most affected by the improved access to Eastern Europe due to its geographical location. During the last five years, exports from Burgenland rose the most among all Austrian provinces (+ 35.7 percent). In comparison, the average of all Austria's federal states was 20.2 percent. During this period, more than16,500 people from abroad settled in the region. The number of companies grew during the same period by a third to 20,000 businesses. This study addresses the question of whether companies founded by migrants created impetus in the export sector. The proportion of foreign entrepreneurs in Burgenland increased from 3.9 percent in 2005 to 38.3 percent in 2015. An analysis of trade data of the year 2015 indicates that migrants' companies mainly focus on the market and its niches in the host country, particularly in the area of service. Migrant entrepreneurs are less focused on using contacts in their country of origin to start economically important changes in the export sector. Between 4 and 5 percent of migrant businesses are engaged in foreign trade, they show the same export orientation as the domestic entrepreneurs of the observed region.","[Granabetter, Doris Maria] Univ Appl Sci Burgenland UAS, Eisenstadt, Austria; [Granabetter, Doris Maria] Univ Sopron, Sopron, Hungary",University of West Hungary,"Granabetter, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Burgenland UAS, Eisenstadt, Austria.;Granabetter, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Sopron, Sopron, Hungary.",doris.granabetter@wkbgld.at,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,1133,1143,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700112,0

Often it is exercised by a single person but more and more as a team given the multifaceted aspects of a large enterprise such as a company or a government entity. In the political contexts we have seen a variety of styles used to garner support since most situations require leadership and followership. Society is increasingly driven by technology with computer systems playing a major role and in this context the entities are essentially electronic in nature; case in point Amazon. Increasingly traditional business organizations are being replaced and/or complemented by ebusiness; cases in point AliBaba and The New York Times; Kohl closing several stores and trying to do more business online. eLeadership is the type of leadership used specifically for the so-called electronic entities. eLeadership could also mean using electronic means in organizations which may be basically traditional in nature but have to adapt to the new contingencies. Determining which one to use has to do with the specific organizations and situations involved. This study will first explore the multifaceted aspects of leadership and eLeadership and identify their distinct nature. A review of contingency theories of leadership will be undertaken in particular to pinpoint the need to update such theories in light of the tremendous impact of technology on practically all organizations. Contingency theory is a behavioral theory based on the view that there is no one best way to lead an organization, organize a cooperation or make a decision. Contingency theory states that actions taken are dependant (contingent) to the internal and external factors. Two of the most important contingencies for organizations are: competition and technology with the former often driving to the use of more of the latter. In the business sector, how often do we see traditional organizations going under since they are unable to compete with those using eLeadership.","[Owarish, Frank] Int Inst Strateg Res Training, New York, NY USA; [Hsu, Donald K.] Univ Phoenix, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Phoenix,"Owarish, F (通讯作者)，Int Inst Strateg Res Training, New York, NY USA.",drmth56@gmail.com; fowarish@verizon.net; yanyou@email.phoenix.edu,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,BUSINESS & APPLIED SCI ACAD NORTH AMERICA-BAASANA,BLOOMSBURG,"2201 BENTLEY DR, BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815 USA",,,,,,,2016,,,,,,,37,71,,,,,,35,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI1BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405497000015,0

The data was then analyzed by using Structural Equation Modelling analysis to obtain the path coefficient as the determination for the hypothesis testing. The research found that the indirect effect of brand personality toward WOMM is stronger than its direct effect.

A simultaneous regression of a panel Granger causality test for WOM and corresponding film performance was performed. The empirical results show that dynamic causality only runs from box office to WOM volume in the short run analysis, and the causality between WOM volume and box office is bidirectional in the long run analysis. Potential customers attend movies because of WOM in the short run, but in the long run, box office forms a signal and creates WOM. In WOM valence analysis, causality runs from positive critics to the box office in the short run, and it runs from negative critics to box office in the long run. WOM providers may need to develop different strategies for encouraging WOM behavior among their users. The implication for film managers and marketers is that a reliable way to affect box office is to stimulate positive critics in the short run and negative critics in the long run.","[Hsu, Yuan-Lin] Shih Hsin Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Jane, Wen-Jhan] Shih Hsin Univ, Dept Econ, 111,Sec 1,Mujha Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan",Shih Hsin University; Shih Hsin University,"Jane, WJ (通讯作者)，Shih Hsin Univ, Dept Econ, 111,Sec 1,Mujha Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",krisenwerk@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,7,7,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The object of the discussion is to move goodwill from the accounting to the lawyer's office. There appears to be no ready structural rule for goodwill, which could provide useable elements of business goodwill, based on the relationship between business facts and legal case outcomes. Therefore, the dual question naturally arises as to what might be a usable structural rule for business goodwill, and when this rule is identified, how might it be susceptible to damage by fraud. Argument tries to show a structure for business goodwill, and that this structural rule is uniquely susceptible to damage by fraud, simply because its key elements could not be defined per genus et differentiam. The primary methodology of the research isto identify a structural legal rule for business goodwill, using Lord Diplock's procedure for judicial reasoning by analogy. Argument begins with a case law discussion of the relationship between deceit and fraud. Following this, there is an exegesis of Lord Diplock's procedure for applying judicial reasoning by analogy. Then follows an analysis of the rights-based foundation of business goodwill, then argument critically analyses the authoritative decided case law. The research will suggest that the structural legal rule for business goodwillinfers inducing a certain state of mind in the customers. This state results in capital value being added to the business, by individual customer acts. Were this inducement to be of a false state of mind, the business's goodwill would be vitiated. Were the business's nostntms fictional, and the customer relationships insincere, goodwill also could well dissolve.","[Lilienthal, Gary] Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Law Sch, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Ahmad, Nehaluddin] Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic Univ, Fac Shariah & Law, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis Law School (SLS) Pune; Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic University,"Lilienthal, G (通讯作者)，Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Law Sch, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",glilienthal@me.com; ahmadnehal@yahoo.com,"Ahmad, Nehaluddin/GWZ-2326-2022; Lilienthal, Gary/AAL-5275-2020; Lilienthal, Gary/ABH-8056-2020","Ahmad, Nehaluddin/0000-0003-1193-2092; Lilienthal, Gary/0000-0002-1875-0294",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,1549,1558,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700156,0

A good educational manager is the teacher trusted by other teachers, is that favorite teacher of the students, whose results are noticeable and appreciated by most educational actors. The educational manager's qualities derive from the behavior that they have towards colleagues and students. Educational managers contribute to the formation and development of individuals, but also to the formation and development of society, so that their responsibilities require active involvement, adapted to the cultural, economic and societal context. Facilitating rapid insertion of graduates in active professional life should be the main focus of all universities in the country and abroad, especially since the unemployment rate among young people continues to rise from one year to another. The quality of higher education can be guaranteed inside and outside the university once linking higher education with the labour market is no longer a desirable concept in education management, but an achieved goal.

Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we argue that through intangible investments, companies acquire knowledge assets that increase their innovativeness. However, a greater innovation impact is expected from investing more in technological intangibles rather than in intangibles overall, and a greater one from using internal versus external resources. Through a new survey on a large sample of firms in 36 countries, accounting for different intangibles and addressing their endogeneity through proper instruments, these hypotheses are partially confirmed. Developing intangibles internally is actually the most innovation-impacting aspect, but not in manufacturing. Instead, by controlling for this choice and for that of investing in technological intangibles, the intensity of intangible resources is significant for innovation in manufacturing only. Policy/strategic implications about the need of readdressing the boost to intangible investments for the sake of innovation in Europe are drawn accordingly.","[Montresor, Sandro] Kore Univ Enna, Fac Econ & Law, Enna, Italy; [Montresor, Sandro; Vezzani, Antonio] European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain",Universita Kore di ENNA; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Vezzani, A (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",Antonio.vezzani@ec.europa.eu,"Vezzani, Antonio/AAL-9465-2021; Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019","Vezzani, Antonio/0000-0001-8077-2489;",,,,,66,44,45,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Therefore, we draw on the main macroeconomic performance indicators, such as economic growth, current account balance and labour market indicators, such as labour productivity, employment and average net earnings for the year 2013 to propose several prediction models for the European Union countries. Thus, by applying both econometric analysis and classification trees methodology we will attempt to extend the empirical research in the field. A distinction between high performant and less performant European Union economies will be highlighted, and several CHAID classification trees will be elaborated, followed by a sensitivity analysis.

An innovative company is defined as a company that develops innovative products, services and internal processes. An innovative company is not a trend follower but a trend setter and can thus profit from a competitive advantage. Therefore, innovation is received as the actual path to growth because the assumption is that innovation is the success driver for the firm and increases its value disproportionally. However, innovation initially results in only costs and risks. Thus, the question arises regarding how to measure the performance contribution of innovation in scientific studies to provide evidence of whether innovation really gives back, particularly in the context of the concept of second mover advantage, which questions the idea of first mover advantage and favors imitation instead of innovation. Therefore, the application of R&D expenditures as general measure for innovation intensity is widely criticized in the literature as not being sufficient to measure innovativeness. Accordingly, the first part of this conceptual paper has developed a new predictor, which will be tested in this paper.","[Studeny, Michael; Bartels, Andreas; Rauch, Manfred; Scheiblich, Mathias; Just, Vanessa; Buchmuller, Melanie] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Studeny, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",michael.studeny@gmail.com; andie.bartels@gmail.com; manfred.rauch@gmx.at; mathias.scheiblich@gmx.de; vanessa.just@bshg.com; melaniebuchmueller@web.de,"Scheiblich, Mathias/JCE-8039-2023",,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,365,374,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700036,0

On the basis of simulations on an easy spreadsheet financial model of company operations, it proves that: (1) in the case of a growing company operating under conditions of negative cash conversion cycle the FCF are systematically overestimated by a permanent increase in surplus cash generating from credit delivered by suppliers and employees and as such do not satisfy the definition of FCF, (2) indicates that FCF from operations suffer from timing and matching problems because they count accounting periods instead of operating cycles and therefore valuations based on such FCF are systematically overestimated every time the cash inflows from operating cycle occur earlier to the corresponding cash outflows and, reversely, are systematically underestimated every time the cash inflows from operating cycle occur later to the corresponding cash outflows. To overcome these problems, the on-going approach to free cash flows analysis that matches outflows and corresponding inflows is suggested.

When the ex ante cost difference between the firms is large, the less-efficient firm does not employ personalized pricing even when the fixed cost to do so is zero. This is because employing personalized pricing induces the rival firm to engage more in reducing its costs, which is more likely to harm the less-efficient firm.","[Matsumura, Toshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Matsushima, Noriaki] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan",University of Tokyo; Osaka University,"Matsumura, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",matsumur@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp; nmatsush@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Matsushima, Noriaki/D-1819-2012; Matsumura, Toshihiro/F-3997-2010","Matsushima, Noriaki/0000-0002-7865-3875; Matsumura, Toshihiro/0000-0003-0572-6516","JSPS KAKENHI [22530175, 23330099, 24530248]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05728, 24530248, 22530175, 23330099, 15K03347] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the Editor-in-Chief, an anonymous co-editor, and two anonymous referees for their helpful and insightful comments.

Some decisions, notably then-Judge Breyer's Town of Concord opinion, treat the matter as one of economics. Others, such as linkLine and similar appellate court decisions, resolve the matter on narrower legal grounds. This article revisits the Concord opinion's economics, correcting small errors in Judge Breyer's graphical analysis but reaffirming his principal economic point that successive monopoly ordinarily is procompetitive and may well benefit consumers. Decisions upholding price squeezes in a successive monopoly on purely legal grounds are therefore economically correct. The article then argues that the economics of successive monopoly offer an economically sound extrication from the morass in which tying law currently wallows. The economic differences between successive monopoly and tying are inconsequential. So the law governing the two practices (section 2 of the Sherman Act for successive monopoly, section 1 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act for tying) should be reduced to a single set of standards. Parallels to the economics and law of exclusive dealing are also noted as part of the case for legal unification.","[McChesney, Fred S.] Univ Miami, Law & Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"McChesney, FS (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Law & Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

But, little attention has been paid on the precise role and the official economic status of these key industrial actors. The aim of the paper is to provide a systematic assessment of the body of extant publications on 4PL, propose and discuss the structuration of this topic area and suggest how it might advance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a bibliometric viewpoint to analyse the academic literature and the business press that has addressed the study of 4PL. It has examined the Business Source Complete and Science Direct databases since 1996 to 2015. Main findings: 72 academic and magazine articles and have finally been studied to portray 4PL based on three main themes (1) justifications of outsourcing logistics activities to 4PL; (2) 4PL's operations and roles in the supply chain, and (3) optimisation of 4PL's activities. We synthetize and discuss these distinctive features and advance a proposal of portraying 4PL as i) human capital-intensive firms, experts in complex tasks solving, iii) key partners with economic power which need to be regulated in the global supply chain. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to survey a fragmented theoretical field of analysis. It provides an assessment of the concept of 4PL and suggests avenues for future research.","[Saglietto, Laurence] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Nice, France",Universite Cote d'Azur,"Cézanne, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",cecile.cezanne@univ-paris13.fr,,,,,,,85,6,6,2,42,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

However, the process of establishing UCC as a demonstration measure within the set time frame was ultimately stopped without success. By using the experiences from this process, the paper provides a more solid basis for renewed efforts at implementation in the future. With basis in implementation theory, the study identifies key barriers to implementation of UCC. Findings indicate that the barriers are primarily related to financial concerns and stakeholder acceptability. However, institutional, practical and legal barriers are also of significance. Strategies to overcome the identified barriers are suggested, most importantly the need for establishing a credible and sound business model. The study makes use of perspectives from political science regarding implementation theory in order to facilitate urban freight policy. As such, it represents a novel scholarly approach in the field of urban freight research. The evaluation framework can be useful for similar studies to come and for policymakers in the design and implementation of new policy measures for urban freight. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these studies have mainly focused on firm attributes or environmental factors. Deviating from prior works, we propose that firms can take advantage of alliance portfolios to trade resources with potential partners' status. Specifically, a firm that can access high-quality portfolio technological resources can better realize exchanges with partners' status. The degree of positive externality depends on the relationships of focal firms with existing partners and their capabilities to utilize external knowledge resources. Data of alliances formed in the computer industry in the USA reveal that a focal firm is more likely to ally with a high-status partner if it can access high-quality portfolio technological resources. Such positive externality of portfolio technological resources is stronger when the focal firm has more repeated ties with its existing partners and when they utilize more external knowledge resources.","[Zhang, Guangxi] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, 288 Liuhe Rd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; City University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, GX (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, 288 Liuhe Rd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gxzhang@zjut.edu.cn,"Ozer, Muammer/H-9258-2016","Ozer, Muammer/0000-0003-2833-8196","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71502167, 71402168]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project [14YJCZH201]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ16G020010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71502167], [grant number 71402168]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project [grant number 14YJCZH201]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number [LQ16G020010].",,113,4,4,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

According to the encompassing paradigm, we claim that the outperformance of the forecast combination strategy reported by recent works may be related to the issues of model selection and misspecification. To address these issues, we promote the blocking modeling approach to allow us to handle mixed frequencies in a linear framework that is compatible with an automatic model selection algorithm. Selected restricted- and pooled-information models are specified and tested for forecast encompassing in order to determine the best combination strategy. The results suggest that the forecast combination strategy dominates as long as no individual (restricted) model encompasses the rivals. However, when a predictive encompassing model is obtained by pooling the information sets, this model outperforms the most accurate forecast combination scheme.

The focus of the analysis is on supply-side issues, such as airline output, structure of supply, yields, business models, and the position of (former) flag carriers. We find that air transport liberalisation in the EU internal market has facilitated significant growth in both the number and frequency of routes. Greater competition and lower fares at the route level went hand in hand with ongoing consolidation. The first and second liberalisation packages have enabled former flag carriers to develop into full-service hub-and-spoke carriers. It was only after the third package (1993-1997) that low-cost carriers were able to fully develop Europe-wide, point-to-point networks. They rapidly achieved a substantial market share after 2000. Following the adoption of the third package of liberalisation measures, charter operators launched scheduled operations as leisure airlines and adopted in part the new low-cost business model. Until 2013, direct competition between low-cost carriers and former flag carriers was limited due to different route development strategies. This picture has changed in recent years since more low-cost carriers have begun to focus on primary hubs. The competitive impact of the rapidly expanding new generation of hub carriers from Turkey and the Gulf has further increased competitive pressure on the former European flag carriers. Consequently, consolidation of the European airline industry is likely to continue, as well as the ongoing effort to reduce costs. Finally, rising competitive pressure may incentivise EU member states to develop a more protective national aviation policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Beside activating inactive women, one possible solution is to support the re-integration of unemployed women. Due to female-specific labor market constraints (preferences for flexible working hours, discrimination), this is a difficult task, and the question arises whether active labor market policies (ALMP) are an appropriate tool to help. It has been shown that the effectiveness of traditional (ALMP) programs-which focus on the integration in dependent (potentially inflexible) employment-is positive but limited. At the same time, recent evidence for Austria shows that these programs reduce fertility which might be judged unfavorable from a societal perspective. Promoting self-employment among unemployed women might therefore be a promising alternative. Starting their own business might give women more independence and flexibility to reconcile work and family and increase labor market participation. Based on long-term informative data, we find that start-up programs persistently integrate former unemployed women into the labor market, and the impact on fertility is less detrimental than for traditional ALMP programs.","[Caliendo, Marco] Univ Potsdam, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; [Caliendo, Marco] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Caliendo, Marco] DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Caliendo, Marco] IAB, Nurnberg, Germany; [Kuenn, Steffen] IZA, Inst Study Lab, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Potsdam; IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Caliendo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany.",caliendo@uni-potsdam.de; kuenn@iza.org,,,Institute for Employment Research (IAB Nuremberg) [1007],Institute for Employment Research (IAB Nuremberg),"The authors thank Erdal Tekin and four anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

We apply the synthetic control group method and estimate the consequences for life expectancy, mortality, and birth rates. According to standard measures of fit, the method seems to perform well for all countries and outcomes. Our results show a large effect on life expectancy and mortality in two countries, and a small and insignificant effect on birth rates. The impact of the pandemic is very heterogeneous. In Mozambique, the impact of HIV on life expectancy and mortality appears to have been surprisingly small. This heterogeneity is not due to AIDS causing fewer deaths in Mozambique than in the two other countries. Instead, the net effect of HIV in Mozambique appears to be diminished by reduced mortality for other causes-in particular child mortality, respiratory infections, and injuries.","[Karlsson, Martin] Univ Duisburg Essen, CINCH, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Pichler, Stefan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Duisburg Essen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Pichler, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.karlsson@uni-due.de; pichler@kof.ethz.ch,"Pichler, Stefan/AAL-6168-2021; Pichler, Stefan/AGY-6428-2022","Pichler, Stefan/0000-0002-0904-8268",,,,,69,7,7,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The employed instrumentarium is critical systems thinking, with its commitments to the critical awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each research instrument for tackling problems in enterprises, the improvement of managing complex problems, and pluralism - respecting different interpretations of problem situations and enabling the combined use of research instruments. The main finding is that SI can underpin the process of structuring complex management problems in enterprises in a scientifically based and practically useful manner. In a scientific sense, the important implication of the conducted research is that it contributes to holistic understanding, conceptualizing and managing problem situations in enterprises.

By grounding the conceptual framework on empowerment theory, we argue that in addition to financial knowledge other elements such as intrapersonal (e.g., locus of control and motivation) and interactional elements (e.g., parental financial teaching and behavior) also impact youth financial behavior. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling is used on a data set of youth from Western Canada. The results indicate that external locus of control has the highest total effect on youth financial behavior followed by parental influence and motivation. Findings are validated by performing several robustness checks and multigroup analysis. Organizations trying to influence youth financial behavior should broaden the understanding of empowerment to include personal worldview, motivation, as well as social surroundings.","[Angulo-Ruiz, Fernando; Pergelova, Albena] MacEwan Univ, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,"Angulo-Ruiz, F (通讯作者)，MacEwan Univ, Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",AnguloruizL@macewan.ca; PergelovaA@macewan.ca,"Pergelova, Albena/GPX-3002-2022","Pergelova, Albena/0000-0002-4612-4696",,,,,58,28,34,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Using this framework, this article will then contribute to the literatures on innovation and technological modernisation and argue that alongside a technical process of catching up there is a political process that can enable or constrain development.","Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",,"Marques, P (通讯作者)，Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",marquesp@cardiff.ac.uk,"Marques, Pedro/M-3806-2015","Marques, Pedro/0000-0001-5753-1484",,,,,63,7,7,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We analyze whether asymmetry in information affects consumer preferences and willingness to pay for ambiguous claims using the native attribute. An empirical application of pecans is used in the analysis to compare native and improved pecan varieties. With no evidence in the literature of additional benefits of native varieties, the results showed that consumers preferred native varieties. Furthermore tastes and preferences for all product attributes were heterogeneous; heterogeneity in preference for the native attribute was only significant at the 10% level.","[Palma, Marco A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Collart, Alba J.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS USA; [Chammoun, Christopher J.] Georgia Cotton Commiss, Publ Affairs, Perry, GA USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mississippi State University,"Palma, MA (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mapalma@tamu.edu,,,,,,,62,16,19,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

We investigate this process in the important but rarely studied case of China. Using the SOE population for 1998-2008, we track 49,456 wholly state-owned firms and identify 9,359 privatization cases. Our econometric analysis concludes that privatization selection is a complex decision-making process in which local governments balance various economic, financial, and political objectives. In the recent Chinese privatization, firm performance relates to the selection, staging, and sequencing in privatization in an inverted-U fashion. The worst-and the best--performing SOEs are more likely to remain state owned, more likely to maintain higher levels of state holding when privatized, and less likely to be privatized later. These patterns suggest a privatization reform slowdown and underlying changes in the privatization policy.","[Du, Jun] Aston Univ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Liu, Xiaoxuan] Chinese Social Sci Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China",Aston University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Du, J (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",,,"Du, Jun/0000-0002-0449-4437","project Privatisation, Foreign Investment, and Firm Performance in China - UK Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-0729]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G00191X/1, ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1, ES/G00191X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","project Privatisation, Foreign Investment, and Firm Performance in China - UK Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Du grateful acknowledges financial support from the project Privatisation, Foreign Investment, and Firm Performance in China, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (award RES-000-22-0729).

First, we show that integrated games are associated with higher sales and higher prices than independent games. Second, we find suggestive evidence that most of the difference in performance is due to better release strategies and selection in game quality. We show that post-release marketing strategies do not seem to add value to vertically integrated games.

The purpose of the paper is to construct a new methodological approach by developing fuzzy logic model based on experts' knowledge for conceptual insights on possible solutions for measuring stakeholders' influence. The objective of the research includes identification of possible organization stakeholder interactions considering stakeholders' influence according to such attributes/ factors as interest, power, benevolence, and reliability. The results reveal that fuzzy logic technique is a reliable and valid tool for modelling and visualizing knowledge about stakeholders' influence on the organization. Finally, the results were tested on the real business data concerning stakeholders' influence. A contribution of this paper is the application of fuzzy logic model to evaluate and/or predict stakeholders' influence to the issues the organization seeks to solve and to provide relevant information for the stakeholder relationships management.","[Susniene, Dalia] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Fac Management & Adm, Dept Econ, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania; [Purvinis, Ojaras] Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Fac Technol, Dept Phys Sci, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Susniene, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Panevezys Inst, Fac Management & Adm, Dept Econ, Klaipedos G 1, LT-35209 Panevezys, Lithuania.",dalia.susniene@ktu.lt; ojaras.purvinis@ktu.lt,"Susniene, Dalia/A-1626-2016","Susniene, Dalia/0000-0003-1639-7180",,,,,53,11,13,0,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In this paper, their political construction is examined, and the conflicts that can arise between biological temporalities on one hand and the interests of international business and state politics on the other are discussed. A detailed map of major deviations from theoretical time zones in China and Europe is presented. The geographically complex and uneven adoption of daylight saving time is also shown on a map. An extended case study of time zone politics in Iceland is then presented. Its current time zone allocation has been contested from two very different viewpoints, where business concerns and geographical position are in conflict. Finally, new challenges to the global time zone system, arising from the increased economic globalisation and opportunities for social interaction in the new reality of cyberspace, are discussed. The concept of time elasticity' is proposed for partially grappling with these conditions.","[Benediktsson, Karl] Univ Iceland, Fac Life & Environm Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Brunn, Stanley D.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Brunn, Stanley D.] Yunnan Normal Univ, Coll Tourism & Geog Sci, Kunming 650092, Peoples R China",University of Iceland; University of Kentucky; Yunnan Normal University,"Benediktsson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",kben@hi.is; stan.brunn@uky.edu,"Benediktsson, Karl/HGB-1911-2022","Benediktsson, Karl/0000-0001-5383-9254",,,,,51,1,2,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Today it represents an essential infrastructure asset of a country. In the majority of cases the network was initially built and maintained with public funds through direct state provision. In the early 1990s many developed and emerging countries moved towards private involvement in toll roads provision, increasing the need for sound economic regulation. However, no comprehensive analysis of the existing regulatory and institutional frameworks has been carried out so far. Starting from a survey involving 21 countries, the paper tries to fill in this gap through a review of existing motorway regulatory frameworks. Various aspects of regulation have been collected and analysed in order to provide an overview of the current practices, both in quantitative and qualitative terms evidencing the strengths and the weaknesses among the various models.

Relevance is determined by comparing our monthly indicators to the gross domestic product at chained volumes, as the most important measure of the level of economic activity. Representativeness is achieved by considering a very large number of (timely) time series of monthly indicators relating to the level of economic activity, providing a more or less complete coverage. The indicators are modelled using a large-scale parametric factor model. We discuss its specification and provide details of the statistical treatment. Computational efficiency is crucial for the estimation of large-scale parametric factor models of the dimension used in our application (considering about 170 series). To achieve it, we apply state-of-the-art state space methods that can handle temporal aggregation, and any pattern of missing values. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

First, the so-called industrial crisis was met with more industrial policies that exacerbated the problems and led the city into a severe crisis in the early 1990s. Then Malmo inverted its strategy and embraced the post-industrial city'. Nowadays, as the 2008 crisis has not seemed to have disappeared and the current economic situation is uncertain', the official rhetoric in Malmo is seemingly as optimistic as ever, as a new congress/concert hall, new shopping centres and new hotels are being built: the production of the post-industrial city continues with full force. By investigating the city-crisis dialectics and discussing theories on crisis and crisis management, inspired by Marx, Schumpeter and Keynes, this paper asks the question as to whether Malmo today is making a similar mistake as in the 1980s, that is, reproducing yesterday's city.","Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Holgersen, S (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 10, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",Stale.holgersen@keg.lu.se,"Holgersen, Stale/A-8809-2017","Holgersen, Stale/0000-0002-6421-9381",,,,,88,7,8,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The aim is to test for cultural gravity effects on both the geographic concentration and human capital productivity of immigrants in the EU15 countries. Operationally, we proceed to construct an empirical cultural gravity measure and test it with the use of a composite cross-sectional database, comprising, inter alia, the World Value Survey and Eurostat Census data. After an initial exploration of relevant cultural data by means of multivariate statistical analysis, we present an extended formulation of a gravity model approached through logistic regression methods and a three-stage least-squares estimation. Our results clearly demonstrate the existence of a cultural gravity effect among immigrants. Finally, an interesting finding is that cultural gravity also plays a significant role in the context of the Culture-Based Development (CBD) growth model.","[Tubadji, Annie] Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Aegean; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Tubadji, A (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece.",atubadji@hotmail.com; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,"Tubadji, Annie/IUP-4828-2023","Tubadji, Annie/0000-0002-6134-3520; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,115,37,38,1,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The item used for the experimental design was canned tuna fish, a product on the market that is already exhibiting various kinds of certification related to social and environmental attributes. Two different kinds of certifications were examined, namely Friend of the Sea, which involves environmental aspects, and SA8000, related to workers' rights and more general social attributes. We implemented experimental auctions, taking into account three information treatments. The initial findings show that the WTP for both CSR labels is higher than the WTP for tuna fish without any CSR certification. Nevertheless, the information provided on CSR certification did not change consumers' WTP among the certification schemes. Our findings could also serve to fine-tune marketing strategies to consumer preferences and determine which CSR activities are worth undertaking.","[De Magistris, Tiziana] Gobierno Aragon, Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agr & Recursos Nat, Leon, Spain; [Del Giudice, Teresa; Verneau, Fabio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Econ, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"De Magistris, T (通讯作者)，Gobierno Aragon, Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agr & Recursos Nat, Leon, Spain.",tmagistris@aragon.es; agriqual@unina.it; verneau@unina.it,"Verneau, Fabio/AAU-1005-2021","Verneau, Fabio/0000-0003-0581-0582; de Magistris, Tiziana/0000-0001-5480-183X; Del Giudice, Teresa/0000-0001-9417-7816",,,,,36,44,46,2,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

An obvious advantage of financial data in forecasting monthly oil prices is their availability in real time on a daily or weekly basis. We investigate the predictive content of these data using mixed-frequency models. We show that, among a range of alternative high-frequency predictors, cumulative changes in US crude oil inventories in particular produce substantial and statistically significant real-time improvements in forecast accuracy. The preferred MIDAS model reduces the MSPE by as much as 28% compared with the no-change forecast and has a statistically significant directional accuracy as high as 73%. This MIDAS forecast is also more accurate than a mixed-frequency real-time VAR forecast, but is not systematically more accurate than the corresponding forecast based on monthly inventories. We conclude that there is not typically much lost by ignoring high-frequency financial data in forecasting the monthly real price of oil. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

Because the large number of these smaller regions and the decay of their contribution to growth is slow (generating a fat tail distribution), their cumulated contribution is actually around two-thirds of aggregate growth.","[Garcilazo, Enrique; Martins, Joaquim Oliveira] OECD Reg Dev Policy Div, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Garcilazo, E (通讯作者)，OECD Reg Dev Policy Div, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",JoseEnrique.GARCILAZO@oecd.org; Joaquim.OLIVEIRA@oecd.org,"OLIVEIRA MARTINS, Joaquim/ABB-7737-2021","OLIVEIRA MARTINS, Joaquim/0000-0003-3736-3035",,,,,29,8,8,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Using a stochastic frontier approach, applied to panel data, we have estimated bank efficiency levels in a sample of 189 banks from 12 countries during the period 2000 to 2008 and we have analyzed the influence of some bank characteristics on these efficiency levels. The results show that European integration has significantly improved the cost efficiency of banks in these countries, but profit efficiency has significantly decreased. We have found very small differences between different ownership types and only a very small impact of foreign ownership on cost efficiency, showing that the entry of foreign ownership is not enough to explain the significant variations in banking efficiency after the accession.","[Luis Gallizo, Jose; Moreno, Jordi] Univ Lleida, Fac Law & Econ, AEGERN Dept, Lleida 25008, Spain; [Salvador, Manuel] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Business & Econ Studies, Dept Stat Methods, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",Universitat de Lleida; University of Zaragoza,"Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Fac Law & Econ, AEGERN Dept, C Jaume 2,73, Lleida 25008, Spain.",gallizo@aegern.udl.cat; jmoreno@aegern.udl.cat; salvador@unizar.es,"Moreno Gené, Jordi/ABA-6265-2021; Salvador, Manuel/H-2664-2015; Gallizo, Jose/ABF-5297-2021; Gallizo, José L./ABH-5490-2020","Moreno Gené, Jordi/0000-0002-0363-2762; Gallizo, Jose/0000-0002-5351-6321;",,,,,60,11,11,1,32,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Competing risk models are applied to a Spanish motor insurance database. The empirical analysis yielded two main findings. First, in some cases the severity of temporary injuries was found to be negatively associated with the time to settlement of the claim, suggesting that more severe cases do not always take longer to settle; this supports the assumption that the time to settlement depends primarily on the degree of informational asymmetry among litigants regarding the magnitude of damages. Second, time-varying effects were observed for the explanatory factors related to the victim's age and the seriousness of injuries. The effect of these factors on the time to settlement of the claim is attenuated overtime, suggesting that the asymmetries in information present a dynamic pattern during the negotiation process, since the insurer's incomplete information is enriched during the course of negotiations.

While KIBS literature traditionally emphasizes tight client-provider interactions with service customization, modularity literature emphasizes inter-organizational decoupling with service standardization. We disentangle this tension by exploring how KIBS firms utilize service modularity and shape their client-provider relationships in terms of information and knowledge sharing. Conducting two in-depth case studies of third-party logistics (TPLs), we show that TPLs extensively rely on service modularity with standard procedures as their constitutive element. We also demonstrate that service modularity and inter-organizational decoupling are aligned for knowledge sharing but not for information sharing, which remains high regardless of the service architecture. Overall, we suggest that modularity in KIBS differs in many aspects from modularity in products and that these differences significantly impact the organizational design consequences of service modularity.

Our results confirm the importance of gender, age, nationality, employment status and prior convictions on recidivism within 5 years after release from prison. We also find significant differences in hazards of recidivism by type of initial offense, penal status at entry, and type of release (early release under parole, etc.), while controlling for prison fixed effects.

On average, police efficiency for the period studied is 84 %. The mean efficiency ratio ranges from 0.82 to 0.87. The upper limit corresponds to 2004, and the lower limit is found in the years 1998, 2000 and 2002. The results obtained show the inverse relationship between police efficiency and the crime rate while a direct relationship is obtained for the variable literacy. Similar findings were obtained in our robustness analysis, in which police efficiency negatively affects other measures of delinquency levels, such as the UN victimization survey variable.","[Parra Dominguez, Javier; Garcia Sanchez, Isabel Maria; Rodriguez Dominguez, Luis] Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Domínguez, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",javierparra@usal.es; lajefa@usal.es; lrodomin@usal.es,"Parra-Domínguez, Javier/AAO-6749-2020; Parra, Javier/ABE-5866-2021; García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/F-4271-2016; Rodriguez-Dominguez, Luis/A-7539-2017","Parra-Domínguez, Javier/0000-0002-1088-9152; Parra, Javier/0000-0002-1088-9152; García-Sánchez, Isabel-María/0000-0003-4711-8631; Rodriguez-Dominguez, Luis/0000-0001-9607-5274",,,,,51,8,8,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

All other things remaining equal, this so-called demographic burden will have a downward effect on economic growth. This paper examines whether the Europe 2020 employment targets would be sufficient to compensate for the downward impact of demographic burden and whether the impact of demography on economic growth differs between EU countries and between urban and rural regions. The results show that raising employment rates to the Europe 2020 targets can restore positive opportunities for economic growth, but not in all countries and only to a limited extent. They also show that even though urban and rural regions differ in terms of population growth and growth of the working age population, the prospects for demographic burden are highly similar for both types of regions.","[Van der Gaag, Nicole; de Beer, Joop] Univ Groningen, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); University of Groningen,"Van der Gaag, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, POB 11650, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands.",gaag@nidi.nl; beer@nidi.nl,,,,,,,32,29,32,10,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

More recent studies have reexamined the issue in different contexts with mixed results. These approaches are based on stipulating a linear relationship between market power and efficiency in banking, which might be problematic, as suggested by the literature on efficiency analysis. We explore how bank cost efficiency measures are related to market power using flexible techniques, which are more consistent with those employed to measure efficiency in the first stage of the analysis. Our study focuses on the Spanish banking industry, which has been experiencing substantial change in the last few years, combining institutions with different ownership structures and business models. Results show that the relationship varies according to the level of market power, the component of efficiency evaluated (cost, technical or allocative) and the type of banking firm (commercial bank or savings bank), suggesting that the quiet life might be a reality only for some financial institutions.","[Faere, Rolf; Grosskopf, Shawna] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Faere, Rolf] Oregon State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Maudos, Joaquin] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Maudos, Joaquin] Univ Valencia, Inst Valenciano Invest Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Tortosa-Ausina, Emili] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Valenciano Invest Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Oregon State University; Oregon State University; University of Valencia; University of Valencia; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Tortosa-Ausina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",rolf.fare@oregonstate.edu; shawna.grosskopf@oregonstate.edu; joaquin.maudos@uv.es; tortosa@uji.es,"Maudos, Joaquín/I-2453-2015; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/B-1205-2017","Maudos, Joaquín/0000-0001-6490-1623; Tortosa-Ausina, Emili/0000-0002-7873-1714",,,,,63,19,19,0,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Renewal of Land Lease policy implemented is to provide security of tenure and security of title. The changes made to this policy are because of premium rates had changed every two years. Although the SSG was made an effort for better implementation of the policy but landowners still not satisfied with it because of some reasons. Therefore, enforcement should be carried out with a solid foundation, without neglecting the interests and needs of landowners. The higher the disputes on the aspects of justice, it will lower the confidence of RLL policies implemented by the government and thus increases the degree of non-compliance. The study was conducted, firstly, to measure the fairness of a SSG in the implementation of a policy, optimizing the ownership right in the land and finally, the application of equality theory of rights. This study was highlighted the problem statement and disputes that arise among the landowners since it was introduced by the SSG. From the study, it was found there were certain conditions imposed where it changes the premium rates which have caused landowners not satisfied because it affected their right to equality. The findings of the study proved that, justice must be measured by how the government implements the RLL policy in order to remain relevant and beneficial to the citizen. Although the land administration system in Sarawak is different from Peninsular Malaysia, but the sentiments and perceptions of landowners on the administration system are similar. However, in the process to achieve equality, equality should be measured by using appropriate and effective approaches.","[Ali, Nurlaila; Husin, Khadijah; Awang, Adibah; Ashmat, Ismail] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Land Adm & Dev, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ali, N (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Land Adm & Dev, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",qasihku.abby@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,4006,4013,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700410,0

The research outcomes confirmed different impacts of motivational and hygiene factors, even in respondents who hold managerial positions in hotels and hotel chains. One or two statistical correlations dealing with some above mentioned criteria were found in ten out of fourteen examined factors. When dividing respondents into groups according to the level of management, a statistical correlation of four factors was found, and a further three relationships were identified while dividing the respondents into groups by their age and hotel category.

The major goal of this paper is to present a neuro-fuzzy model for evaluating project status. This model is based on the EVM method. The ANFIS Editor in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in MATLAB software was used to create the neuro-fuzzy model. The model consists of two input variables, one rule box and one output variable. The input variables are represented by SPI deviation (SPI) and CPI deviation (CPI). The output from the rule box and the output variable is PS deviation (PS). The advantage of the model is the ability to transform the input indices SPI and CPI into linguistic variables, as well as linguistic evaluation of overall project status (output). Using this approach it is possible to simulate the risk and uncertainty that are always associated with real projects. The case study contains real data on the development of values of indices SPI and CPI for one project in the field of IT. The indices SPI and CPI were obtained from control project milestones. There are 5 control milestones in total. ANFIS Editor generated model parameters (parameters of membership functions, rules).

We distinguish four socio-material situations of learning where each situation implies a specific combination of three basic social communication technologies: observation (Beobachtung), encounter (Begegnung), and relationship (Beziehung). This paper assesses the empirical importance of these communication technologies for the acquisition of market intelligence in stock photography, a sector of the creative industries. Our analysis is based on a unique global survey of the stock photo market as well as interviews with picture agencies conducted at several international congresses. Our findings demonstrate that picture agencies develop market intelligence predominantly through observation and relationships over distance rather than through temporary encounter. Although congresses and trade fairs have grown in number and size over the last decades, their primary function can be defined as a social relay: During congresses, picture agencies organize innumerable appointments to rewire their global partnerships which then, after being set in practice, become sources of relational market intelligence.",,,,,"Panitz, Robert/ABC-4230-2021; Glückler, Johannes/K-3807-2018","Panitz, Robert/0000-0002-8312-6228; Gluckler, Johannes/0000-0002-2507-1556",,,,,63,5,5,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

The implications of the crisis were not limited to the financial sector. With the deterioration of living standards in many countries and as result the reduction of consumer spending, the entire structure of international trade was heavily affected. The payments system involving money transactions went in disarray. Following the reduction of employment, the payment of wages was disrupted, which in turn triggered a reduction in expenditures on consumer goods and services. A vicious circle was formed. This process of economic decline has been cumulative in the sense that all categories of the labor force were affected. This work is a presentation and analysis of the labor market in the European Union and the impact of the economic crisis on this market. We considered that this market is very important because it relates to jobs and the wellbeing of the people, especially the young generation.

At the same time, this method enables to evaluate mutual relation of individual variables and to define whether there are complements and substitutes for steel. Initial parameters of the model are based on common econometric model of demand. Those ones that represent 2/3 of world output are chosen from macroeconomic figures. These are particularly economies of the US, EU, China and Japan. The results imply that the data sample is not very suitable for complex multiple-factor regression. Nevertheless, this model clearly shows extreme interconnection of world economies and comparatively big sensitivity of demand for steel to random variable, represented by worldwide military expenditures. Positive factors include world production of coal and annual inflation in China. The negative factor is represented by the price of iron ore. These results show that the demand is mostly influenced by price and production of complements.","[Jiri, Lunacek] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Jirí, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",lunacek@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1318,1330,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700131,0

The hypothesis is that changes to marginal rates affect not only the revenue base, but also tax efficiency and the optimum level of taxes that supports economic growth. Using an optimal revenue-maximising rate (based on Laffer analysis), the elasticity of taxable income is derived with respect to marginal tax rates for each taxable-income category. These elasticities are then used to quantify the impact of changes in marginal rates on the revenue base and tax efficiency using a microsimulation (MS) tax model. In this first paper on the research results, much attention is paid to the structure of the model and the way in which the database has been compiled. The model allows for the dissemination of individual taxpayers by income groups, gender, educational level, age group, etc. Simulations include a scenario with higher marginal rates which is also more progressive (as in the 1998/1999 fiscal year), in which case tax revenue increases but the increase is overshadowed by a more than proportional decrease in tax efficiency as measured by its deadweight loss. On the other hand, a lowering of marginal rates (to bring South Africa's marginal rates more in line with those of its peers) improves tax efficiency but also results in a substantial revenue loss. The estimated optimal individual tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio in order to maximise economic growth (6.7 per cent) shows a strong response to changes in marginal rates, and the results from this research indicate that a lowering of marginal rates would also move the actual ratio closer to its optimum level. Thus, the trade-off between revenue collected and tax efficiency should be carefully monitored when personal income tax reform is being considered.","[Jordaan, Yolande; Schoeman, Niek] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Jordaan, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Jordaan, Yolanda/0000-0001-7540-6070",,,,,34,5,6,0,13,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Furthermore, the authors of this article described the difficulties regarding the precise definition of the term 'problem area' and discussed the current principles and theories (territorial approach, endogenous growth theory and polarization-diffusion model) that should be considered when formulating a new type of regional policy. The desk research, deduction and synthesis were used to accomplish the objectives of the study, verify the research hypothesis and formulate recommendations for the development of sustainable regional policies in problem areas.","[Kryk, Barbara; Skubiak, Beata] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Str Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Kryk, B (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Str Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",krykb@wneiz.pl; bskubiak@wneiz.pl,,"Kryk, Barbara/0000-0003-1269-3142",,,,,25,2,2,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Very promising forms of supporting experimental research in economic science are the interactive, virtual environment simulations called the virtual worlds. They are as close as possible to the real world. The article aims to analyse the possibilities and limitations of applying the virtual worlds in experimental economics. It explains what a virtual world is and presents the most widely recognized ones with the examples concerning the research that was has already been done with the use of such tools.

By comparing the efficacy of information transmission between equity style index and Bursa Malaysia Industrial Index, our results show that there is unidirectional causality from growth style to leading economic index. Second, there is also unidirectional flow from growth style to Bursa Malaysia Industrial Index. Third, there is a bidirectional relationship between growth style and KLCI broad market index. Finally, there is bidirectional causality between both growth style and value style. Further analysis from cross-correlation function reveals that growth style index is better than Bursa Malaysia Industrial Index. The former provides accurate and stronger cross-correlation with leading economic index. From these empirical evidences, it can be concluded that growth style index is a leading indicator which has more economic content than stock market index. It is better than stock market index in its efficacy of information transmission. The study brings to the awareness to policy makers and practitioners of the usefulness of equity style in constructing future leading economic index and early warning system of financial crisis.","[Lau, Wee-Yeap] Natl Univ Singapore, Risk Management Inst, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Lau, Wee-Yeap] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Lee, Chin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",National University of Singapore; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Lau, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Risk Management Inst, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",wylau@um.edu.my; leechin@econ.upm.edu.my,"LAU, WEE YEAP/B-2772-2010; Lee, Chin/AAR-5222-2020","LAU, WEE YEAP/0000-0002-3447-9895; Lee, Chin/0000-0002-8651-2204",FRGS Grant under Ministry of Education; University of Malaya,FRGS Grant under Ministry of Education; University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),"The authors would like to express their appreciation for useful comments by participants in presentation at the 19th Annual Conference of PBFEAM held in Taiwan, July 2011.

As Northeast asian countries are geographically adjacent to Northwest coast of Pacific ocean, in case economic cooperations are intensified, transportation & communication costs could be diminished as well as transaction cost caused by economic exchanges could be minimized. In order to analyze trade decision factor of both 2 countries, Index of trade intensity invented by trade intensity theory(Kruger, A.O.1997) is used to analyze it. Even though specific factor should be materialized in terms of analysis of trade decision factor, realistically, concreted explanations are difficult as there are so many unsolved factors and its diversifications. Therefore, this research focus on reviewing trade structural factors and external trade structural factor of trade decision factor's analysis, namely, time-series analysis is efficient. First, these Index of A value/ B value means Korean against Chinese market share/Korean against world market share, of which is comparative market intensity. Second, So, Korea is taking comparative advantage of export specialization and on the contrary, China is taking comparative advantage of import specialization respectively. Third, RCA indexes are considerably improved compared to that of 2000. However, still as RCA indexes are much smaller than +1 means Korea is in a position to comparative disadvantage against China compared to those of other industries. This research is analyzed by quantitative measurement with trade intensity theory, trade specialization and revealed comparative advantage index to see how inter-trade relations are changed between Korea and China during past 10 years(2000, 2005, 2012). Through this survey of time series, we can figure out structural factor of trade dependence relationship between 2 countries.

The results from different computing methods indicated that the carbon sink value of sugarcane in China presented a fluctuant trend during 2003-2012. Moreover, the carbon sink value of sugarcane in Guangxi province was the highest, while its productivity of Guangdong province was optimal. Therefore, for the sake of developing carbon sink market, it is necessary to improve the trading market of agricultural carbon sinks, implement the ecological compensation for the sugarcane industry and apply the modern technology to increase the productivity of sugarcane.","[Lin, Ketao; Zhu, Chaozhi; Chen, Rukai] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Tech Res & Dev Ctr Natl Sugarcane Ind Syst, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University,"Lin, KT (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Tech Res & Dev Ctr Natl Sugarcane Ind Syst, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.",fafu948@126.com,"liu, liu/JEO-6900-2023; Ling, Jie/JJF-9995-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023",,,,,,21,0,0,0,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-251-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,290,299,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD8BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363785400047,0

These services can be identified as public transport, postal service, water management or social services. Within the concept of SGEI a proportionate restriction on the application of EU competition rules can be imposed to the benefit of those undertakings that are providing these services to that extent that is necessary to perform their task and that is proportionate to the threat that it cause to the market freedoms and competition. The way in which all modern democracies have structured also their pension system is under severe pressure. This is obviously due to an omnipresent problem: ageing. The number of pension beneficiaries is increasing at higher rate than the economically active population needed to fund the pension benefits. With regard to the situation in the EU Member States, one thing is clear: the challenges that confront Member States warrants a revision of the pension system. Scientific aim: The aim of this paper is to provide analysis of employment policy with a special respect to ageing population in the Czech Republic in comparison with the situation in EU. Methodology/methods: To fulfil the aim of the study a detail analysis of the service of general interest and service of general economic interest focused on employment policies in the Czech Republic and in EU was provided. The analysis was based on literature and databases review. Findings: The Czech Republic imposes standards regarding working conditions to protect employees, but more could be done. As an EU member, the Czech Republic has transposed EU legislation into the national labour law. The country is additionally bound by other international conventions in this area, in particular ILO conventions. Through its National Programme of Preparation for Ageing (2013-17), the Czech Republic intends to raise companies' awareness of age management tools for creating working conditions and trends that help older workers stay in the labour market as long as possible. Conclusions (limits, implications etc.): The employment policy in the Czech Republic is nowadays facing a big challenge connected to ageing population. The response of the main policy makers could be seen in adaptation of the main strategic documents to the new goals settled by European Union 2020 Strategy. The approach of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is focused on the keeping workers approaching retirement age in employment. This is achieved by two different tools. The passive employment policy tools focus on providing unemployment benefits which duration is substantively prolonged for people older than 50 years.","[Mikusova, Jana; Rasticova, Martina] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Management, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Mikusová, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Management, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jana.mikusova@mendelu.cz; martina.rasticova@mendelu.cz,"Rašticová, Martina/AAB-9977-2022; Rasticova, Martina/L-9230-2015; mikusova, Jana/JNS-5205-2023","Rašticová, Martina/0000-0001-9322-0763;",,,,,21,2,2,1,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,4214,4225,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700432,0

The idea behind this combination is to know how the stock markets of these three prominent countries are related to each other. The study employs monthly data from the stock indices, namely JALSH (South Africa), NIFTY (India) and NASDAQ (USA) composite from April 2004 to March 2014. After testing for the normality of the data distribution and the stationarity of the time series data, this paper discovered a strong correlation between the stock market indices of South Africa, India and the USA. The correlation among the stock markets is high, particularly between South Africa and India. In addition, the paper attempts to discover the presence of any predictive ability among these markets by applying the Granger causality test. The result indicates that the NASDAQ index has no predictive ability as far as the JALSH and NIFTY indices are concerned. However, the JALSH index has a predictive ability on the NIFTY index. After testing the Granger cause relationship, the existence of a long-run and short-run relationship is tested. The long-run relationships among the stock market indices are analysed, following the Johansen and Juselius multivariate cointegration approach. The result suggests the absence of a long-run relationship among the three stock market indices. Short-run relationship is investigated with the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, and the outcome obtained shows that both the USA and the South African stock markets are predicted only by their own past lags. However, the Indian stock market is seen to be a function of its own past lags and the past lags of the South African stock index.","[Mohanasundaram, Thangamuthu; Karthikeyan, Parthasarathy] Kongu Engn Coll, Sch Management Studies, Daejeon, South Korea",,"Mohanasundaram, T (通讯作者)，Kongu Engn Coll, Sch Management Studies, Daejeon, South Korea.",,"Mohanasundaram, T./AAE-6084-2021; Karthikeyan, P/AAL-8737-2020","Mohanasundaram, T./0000-0003-4511-7539; Karthikeyan, P/0000-0002-9902-1869",,,,,37,2,3,0,5,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The objective of this research is to empirically investigate the relationship between human capital efficiency (as measured by value-added human capital) and the financial and market performance of companies listed on the Main Board and Alternative Exchange (ALT-X) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Return on assets, revenue growth and headline earnings per share were used as financial performance indicators; while market-to-book ratio and total share return were used to measure market performance. Multivariate regressions were performed, with panel data covering 390 companies in the financial, basic materials, consumer services, consumer goods, industrial and technology industries from 2001 to 2011. First, human capital efficiency was found to have no effect on the market performance of listed companies in South Africa. Secondly, higher human capital efficiency was found to result in the extraction of greater returns from both tangible and intangible assets in all industries. Thirdly, higher profitability was found to be associated with higher human capital efficiency in almost every industry in South Africa, with the exception of the technology industry, where human capital efficiency was found to be independent of headline earnings per share. Finally, higher revenue growth was found to be positively associated with human capital efficiency in those industries which are not consumer-driven. In the consumer-driven industries, human capital efficiency contributes to bottom line profitability even though it is not a driver for revenue growth. Overall, the results of this study confirm that human capital efficiency enhances a company's financial performance, whether it be through a greater capacity for production and service delivery, tighter cost controls or better use of company resources. Management in all South African industries are encouraged to develop the value-creating abilities of their employees through employer-driven personnel enrichment and training programs and by incentivising workers to pursue further education.","[Morris, Carla] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Morris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",,,"Morris, Carla/0009-0000-8564-5278",,,,,34,16,21,0,28,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The maize price is strongly and positively correlated with the cultivated area, r=0.829, but very weakly with production, r = 0.170, and yield, r = 0.03. The regression correlation between maize price and production and yield: R = 0.1707643, and respectively R=0.0037907 with a low R-2, only 0.029168, and 1.43896. But between price and cultivated land, the correlation was higher, R = 0.7289934 and R-2 = 0.531431.

The validity of the models was confirmed by F test, reflecting the various links between these indicators and a sinuous trend. The price elasticity coefficients varied in the two variants, V1 and V2, being higher when 2007 was term of reference. In most of cases, it was noticed a relatively inelastic price, with no response to production growth. The price volatility could influence producers to carry out products with a low price variation and this will also affect consumption and trade. Price-production and price-yield regressions are more important to better identify the relationships between these economic indicators.","[Popescu, Agatha] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Popescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania.",agatha_popescu@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Agatha/KBB-4359-2024","Popescu, Agatha/0000-0003-2330-7120",,,,,12,10,10,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2205,2213,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700221,0

In comparison with other European countries, the family business remains still underrated in the Czech Republic Family business has in the recent history of the Czech Republic relatively short tradition, which is of course determined by political developments in the country. In the Czech Republic there was the development of private enterprise and family business after Velvet Revolution which marked the fall of the former totalitarian regime in general. But if we continue questing in history, particularly in the era of the First Republic, we would find that at this time was family business relatively well developed especially in small businesses, which had been handed down from father to son; this procedure in the transmission of family craft was completely normal. The paper is focused on strategic drivers of family business and on advantages and disadvantages of this type of business. The approach combines a literature review that highlights family business and key strategic drivers with primary data from questionnaire survey in family businesses.

The initial field study on banks and the government funded organization namely; Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) showed that they are reluctant to provide mortgages to low-income citizens as it is considered of high risk whereas mortgages from REDF are very limited and usually take very long time to be granted due to bureaucratic financing process and mechanisms. Poor population has certain socio-economic needs which cannot be ignored. These would change over time such as: change of the family size, the need to get extra income and so on. To accommodate these needs, low-income citizens usually make changes to their properties such as interior and exterior alterations; repairs and renovation. The initial field study on banks and REDF showed also that Banks and REDF are happy to provide some limited support regarding some citizens' on-going needs but this would come under price which the poor population cannot afford. This paper argues that providing initial support i.e. mortgages and on-going financial to poor population is crucial as it would help citizens to meet various rising obligations and carry on with life normally and smoothly. A field survey has been undertaken in 2011 in Dammam and Alkhober cities, Eastern province, KSA to find out the satisfaction of low-income citizens about the on-going financial support of banks and REDF. Two hundred and seventy eight valid responses were received. The survey's results showed that the majority of respondents did not manage to get a mortgage thus to buy a property though they are planning to do so. The survey showed that poor population is characterized by a unique longitudinal pattern of socio-economic requirements. This would affect the present or future dwellings in a specific way over a period of time. The respondents said that they are not happy about banks' initial and potential on-going financial support. The absence of financial support for the socio-economic needs as expressed by the respondents-, would hinder them to do proper changes to the property thus affect negatively the property's quality and value. This paper recommends that the present financing system in KSA should be reformed and innovative financing mechanisms should be created to accommodate the citizens' initial and on-going needs.","[Sidawi, Bhzad] Univ Dammam, Dept Architecture, Dammam, Saudi Arabia",Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,"Sidawi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Dammam, Dept Architecture, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.",Bsidawi@ud.edu.sa,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3645,3655,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700380,0

Using mainly descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests, real project data were analyzed from forty-five Dutch transportation infrastructure projects with a total construction contract value of over 8.5 billion. First it was explored if we could find evidence for the presumption that contractors bid low on contracts to recover the loss of bid profit by claiming contract change costs in the project implementation. We conclude that we could not find evidence for the opportunistic behavior of contractors. Second, the different sizes and reasons for the contract changes were explored. We conclude that: scope changes are the most significant reason for contract changes, followed by technical necessities; smaller projects tend to have higher relative contract change costs; and contract changes due to omissions in the contract are more present in smaller projects than in larger projects. The results of the analysis suggest among.other things that policymakers and planners should pay more attention to flexible contracting, and to the contract management of smaller projects.

Based on industry-wide data, this study surprisingly finds that the behavior of container selection for container shipping lines does not follow the pattern of perfect substitution, but rather the pattern of fixed proportions technology, through a constant elasticity of substitution production function. Combined with the observed relationship between the approximately constant leasing rates and the shrinking price premiums for leasing companies over the past two decades, the empirical results suggest that concerns with both the capital cost and strategic means may play key roles in determining the mix of owned and leased containers for the shipping lines. Several strategic concerns including the long-term leasing contract, supplier diversity program, and option contract are discussed and suggested as approaches that can be applied by the shipping lines to arrange their leasing policies with lessors and to moderate the competition of these two parties in expanding their container fleets. These approaches not only can reduce the costs and the associated risks for the shipping lines, but can also alleviate the situation of over-supplied containers in the global container shipping industry.

Meanwhile, it explores the function of moderator in task interdependence which is widespread nowadays. There are two research findings of this paper: (1) workplace ostracism has a significantly positive impact on the behavior of employee silence, and ostracism does more harmful than good to the survival and development of organization; (2) task interdependence moderates the relationship between workplace ostracism and acquiescent/defensive silence.

Building on the multiplicative competitive interaction model from retail location theory, this paper develops a geomarketing model that can be used to devise supermarket location strategies. First, attributes that explain a supermarket's pull on consumers were determined. These attributes included objective (taken from databases and empirical observation) and subjective (based on managerial judgements) variables relating to the supermarket and its trade area. Then, geographic information system tools were used to analyse real data at a highly detailed level (road section). From a geomarketing viewpoint, the model shows that sociodemographic characteristics of the supermarket's trade area affect firms' location strategies. The paper also discusses improvements for calibrating and validating this model. Adding the spatial organization of supermarkets to the model yields a different consumer behaviour pattern. This geomarketing model can help managers to design supermarket location strategies according to shop features, competitors and environment, whilst estimating supermarket sales.","[Baviera-Puig, Amparo; Buitrago-Vera, Juan; Escriba-Perez, Carmen] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Baviera-Puig, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",ambapui@upvnet.upv.es; jmbuitrago@esp.upv.es; carespe@upv.es,"Buitrago, Juan/AAA-7503-2019; Baviera-Puig, Amparo/M-1417-2015; buitrago, juan/JDV-6959-2023; Escriba-Perez, Carmen/K-8976-2014","Buitrago, Juan/0000-0003-1681-1310; Baviera-Puig, Amparo/0000-0002-2258-1155; Escriba-Perez, Carmen/0000-0003-4820-4099",,,,,46,24,27,5,86,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

It provides a history of foreign investment in mining, and discusses several resources booms that shaped the landscape of the continent and the role of governments (state, federal and territory governments) in this process. The paper presents a chronological account of the development of the Australian mining industry, the primary activities of which are the extraction, and export of unprocessed coal, iron, minerals and increasingly natural gas. The paper analyses the industry's interaction with foreign investment and government assistance (that is, government spending in relation to the industry such as subsidies, loans and infrastructure construction, etc.). Australia's trade and foreign investment environment have long been deregulated. The Australian mining industry has benefited from this deregulation. But its most spectacular period has been the 'commodities super-cycle' of the 2000s-2010s. Overall, its contribution to exports has long typified the mining industry. The discussion herein draws attention to the applicability of the 'eclectic theory' in reference to foreign investment in mining. That is, investing mining MNEs (multinational enterprises) have three main types of 'locational advantages' in Australia: (i) volume of the availability of resources; (ii) foreign investment regulatory environment; and (iii) government assistance that benefits the mining industry's expansion.","[Bayari, Celal] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, H70 Abercrombie St & Codrington St, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Bayari, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, H70 Abercrombie St & Codrington St, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.",economicsandbusiness@aol.com,,"Bayari, Celal/0000-0002-6736-0516",,,,,130,6,7,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

To evaluate the relevant marginal likelihoods, analytic integration methods are utilized when possible; otherwise multivariate adaptive quadrature methods are employed to estimate the required quantities. The usual Bayesian interval estimate for a proportion is also examined in this context. The size and power properties of the proposed methods are examined via a simulation study, illustrating favourable comparisons both overall and with their frequentist counterparts.

We explore the determinants of such behaviour, by integrating economic and psychological perspectives on tax compliance. Results suggest that respondents perceive a strong connection between the quality of political and of tax institutions, while trust seems to play the most significant role in increasing intended compliance and in deterring strategic tax evasion. We contrast the theoretical results with the actual reported compliance behaviour of entrepreneurs and analyse how this behaviour is influenced by factors like perceived nature of power of tax authorities (legitimate versus coercive), perceived fairness of the tax system, etc. The strategy currently followed, that is toughening the profile of tax authorities is a viable short-term response to increase enforced tax compliance. The present study, however, has provided evidence on the multifaceted nature of power and trust and their relation with tax compliance, and the link between power and trust in political regulatory strategies. Current policies seem to completely miss that link.","[Kaplanoglou, Georgia; Rapanos, Vassilis T.] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, 1 Sofokleous Str, Athens 10559, Greece; [Daskalakis, Nikolaos] Univ Brighton, Brighton Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Brighton,"Kaplanoglou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, 1 Sofokleous Str, Athens 10559, Greece.",gkaplanog@econ.uoa.gr; vrapanos@econ.uoa.gr; N.Daskalakis@brighton.ac.uk,"Daskalakis, Nikolaos/AAM-8860-2021; Daskalakis, Nikos/AAB-5314-2022; Rapanos, Vassilis/HKM-8686-2023; Kaplanoglou, Georgia/AAL-7674-2021","Daskalakis, Nikos/0000-0001-5253-2752;",,,,,41,14,15,2,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Moreover, it is particularly suitable for handling longitudinal data where small number of units and huge number of variables have been collected. Findings highlight that a qualified concept of size matters in determining good financial performance.

The estimates of a Composite Cost Function econometric model highlight the presence of global scope and scale economies only for multi-service operators (providing urban, intercity and for-hire bus and coach transport services) with output levels lower than the ones characterising the 'average' firm. This indicates that relatively small, specialized companies would benefit from cost reductions by evolving into multi-service firms providing urban, intercity and coach renting services. For operators of a bigger size, scope economies can be still exploited by linking urban and intercity services or by linking intercity services and coach renting, whereas the couple urban service-coach renting is associated with strong diseconomies of scope. Our results can help policymakers (that must define the boundaries of the service area to be tendered) and firms (that, as a result of the ongoing liberalization process, have increased opportunities to invest in regulated and non regulated passenger transport activities)to make informed decisions.

A focus of these agreements and related policies is the requirement for participating governments to procure goods and services via public tender. While such tendering is purportedly to obtain 'value-for-money' solutions for governments, in practice, tendering is often aimed at procuring goods and services at the lowest possible price. Against this blanket approach there are circumstances in which alternatives to tendering can and should be utilised. This paper reviews academic research over the past decade, in particular research developed for and presented at Thredbo Series Conferences, which examines how public transport and particularly bus services should be procured in the context of a discussion about service cost and quality. It outlines the successful implementation of negotiated performance-based contracting (NBPC) in Victoria, Australia, in respect of its bus network, and concludes that there is no reason why competitive tendering should be viewed as the most appropriate method of procurement in each and every instance or even the 'default' position. Indeed, when there are existing private providers of such services, NPBC appears to be a better alternative to tendering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic Swiss pulse timetabling technique is reviewed, along with the application of the approach to a remote rural case study in Graubunden's Lower Engadine and Val Mustair.

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is the traditional welfare approach to demonstrate the value of using public funds. CBA captures the tangible costs and benefits for users, the benefits and costs of externalities and some of the wider economic benefits. However, this welfare approach does not distinguish the distribution of activity impacts in terms of spatial locations, timing, or economic sectors, nor does it capture all impacts on the economy of a region. Economic Impact Analysis (EIA) shows such changes in terms of jobs, compensation and business output. Economic impact changes are very much the language used by politicians in explaining the benefits of an investment and making the points better understood by the electorate. This paper provides the rationale for using an extended analysis EIA as a complement to the welfare based CBA. The approach is illustrated by a case study of a bus rapid transit (BRT) proposal in Sydney. It shows how these approaches are complementary, answers different questions, and can be used together to provide a more holistic evaluation of the value of a public transport infrastructure change.

Consequently, establishing an open access regime is currently intensively being discussed. We contribute to the literature by using a contest-model in which differently talented researchers compete for limited journals space. The contest perspective adds a rent-seeking motive into the publishing game which questions that private incentives for research are always too low due to the positive externalities of scientific progress. In our model, open access always leads to higher social welfare when incentives are too high. When incentives are too low, then open access is only superior if the benefits from larger readership is sufficiently high.","[Feess, Eberhard] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnenstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Scheufen, Marc] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Law, Massenbergstr 11, D-44787 Bochum, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Ruhr University Bochum,"Feess, E (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnenstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",e.feess@fs.de; marc.scheufen@rub.de,,,,,,,46,7,8,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

By abolishing transfer fees after the expiration of contracts, as well as liberalizing the migration of professional football players within the European Union, the Bosman ruling could negatively impact the participation of national players in their home league. To explore this issue, we use data from the First Division of the Spanish League for the seasons 1980/1981-2011/2012. The results suggest a decline in the number of native Spanish players as a consequence of the Bosman ruling, although the impact does not appear to be permanent. However, we find that the Bosman case has a negative and lasting impact on the performance of Spanish players in their home league. Our findings do not change when we use different subsamples or introduce controls for unobserved characteristics, or for observed characteristics that could drive the presence of Spanish players, such as participation in European competitions, the performance of the Spanish national team, and the success of teams' youth academies, among others. This work also takes into account other changes in the nationality quota rules and the impact of other post-Bosman legislative changes, such as the Kolpak case and the Cotonou agreement.","[Marcen, Miriam] Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Marcén, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",mmarcen@unizar.es,"Pérez, Miriam Marcén/V-8124-2019","Pérez, Miriam Marcén/0000-0002-1944-4790",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-34828],Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),The author is grateful for the financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (Project ECO2012-34828).

Typically, forecasting competitions are judged on a variable-by-variable basis, but a multivariate analysis is required to determine how each competitor performed overall. We use three different multivariate tests to determine an overall winner for a forecasting competition for the German economy across 25 different institutions for a single time period using a vector of eight key economic variables.

To accomplish this objective and to add the stronger evidence to the controversial issue, the tests were done under a new framework that embeds wavelet analysis, a novel tool, in nonlinear causality test approaches developed recently. The classical linear causality test procedure was also involved for comparison. The empirical data sources from the USA Energy Information Administration and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) CountryData database. Sample period is from January 1993 to October 2014. The results indicate significantly the existence of unidirectional causality from EG to REC and support the conservation hypothesis. In additional, further evidences show that the causal relationship among them is not constant and depends on the time scale or frequency ranges, and that wavelet analysis is an important aid to capture the nonlinear causality. This suggests that renewable energy limitations do not seem to damage economic growth. These results have implications of importance for research analysts as well as policy makers of energy economy.","[Xu, Haiyun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, 169 Shuang Gang East Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Haiyun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, HY (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, 169 Shuang Gang East Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Xu, HY (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",haiyunxu_jxufe@yeah.net,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71061006],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71061006).,,36,8,8,0,14,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We show that if a court cannot perfectly determine which party's model is more likely to have generated the evidence, then adversaries face a trade-off: a model farther from the most likely interpretation has a lower probability of winning but also a higher payoff following a win. We characterize an equilibrium in which both adversaries construct optimal models, and we use the characterization to compare adversarial decision making to an inquisitorial benchmark. We find that adversarial decisions are biased and that the bias favors the party with the less likely, and more extreme, interpretation of the evidence. Court bias disappears as the court is better able to distinguish between the likelihoods of the competing models or as the amount of evidence grows.","[Froeb, Luke M.; Tschantz, Steven] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Ganglmair, Bernhard] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",Vanderbilt University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Froeb, LM (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",,,"Ganglmair, Bernhard/0000-0002-3821-2813",,,,,74,4,4,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

This paper demonstrates the merit of the non-parametric nearest neighbor (NN) approach for S&P 100 realized variance forecasting. The NN approach is appealing a priori because, unlike model-based methods, it can reproduce complex dynamic dependencies, while largely avoiding misspecification and parameter estimation uncertainty. We evaluate the forecasts through straddle trading profitability metrics and using conventional statistical accuracy criteria. The ranking of individual forecasts confirms that there is not a one-to-one mapping between statistical accuracy and profitability. In turbulent markets, the NN forecasts lead to higher risk-adjusted profitability levels, even though the model-based forecasts are superior statistically. A directional combination of NN and model-based forecasts is more profitable than any of the individual forecasts, in both calm and turbulent market conditions.

There is no clear evidence of such bias for other inflation forecasts. To explain this observation a model is constructed to analyse the effectiveness of monetary policy committee voting when the inflation forecast signals, upon which decisions are based, may be subject to manipulation. Using a discrete time intertemporal model, we examine the distortions resulting from such manipulation under a three-way voting system. We find that voting itself creates persistence and volatility in inflation. In the case when the expected value of the inflation distribution is not far from the target, alterations to the forecast signal, even if well intentioned, results in a diminished probability of achieving the inflation target and an increase in persistence. However, if committee members 'learn' in a Bayesian manner, this problem is mitigated. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We construct hedonic rent models to control for other known rent determinants. It turns out that proximity matters: holding everything else constant, investors located closely to their office buildings are able to extract significantly higher effective rents from these assets, especially if these buildings are of low quality. This effect is due to significant differences in occupancy levels. Interestingly, property managers can affect this relationship, mitigating the adverse effects of investor distance on effective office rents. Especially if the owner does not reside in the same state as the building, external property management is of importance, most prominently so for class-B office buildings.","[Eichholtz, Piet; Holtermans, Rogier] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Yonder, Erkan] Ozyegin Univ, Fac Business, Nisantepe Mh Orman Sk 34-36, TR-34794 Istanbul, Turkey",Maastricht University; Ozyegin University,"Holtermans, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.holtermans@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Yönder, Erkan/AAV-6196-2020; Yonder, Erkan/I-7799-2015","Yonder, Erkan/0000-0003-4758-7841; Holtermans, Rogier/0000-0002-3597-6703",,,,,27,14,14,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

These practices require the introduction of environment-friendly equipment and facilities not only by shipowners, but also by other supply chain players who control critical complementary assets. In particular, these assets, whose nature is both specialized and cospecialized, are those where there is respectively unilateral or bilateral dependence between innovation and complementary assets.

The research is conducted utilizing a multiple case-study analysis based on leading container shipping companies involved in cooperative networks. The main findings unveil that the implementation of successful green shipping practices not only requires the operational integration of green attitudes/technologies among supply chain players, but also the strategic coordination among them.","[Ferretti, Marco; Risitano, Marcello; Tutore, Ilaria] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management Studies & Quantitat Methods, Via Gen Parisi 13, Naples, Italy; [Parola, Francesco] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Business, Via Francesco Vivaldi 5, Genoa, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of Genoa,"Ferretti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management Studies & Quantitat Methods, Via Gen Parisi 13, Naples, Italy.",marco.ferret-ti@uniparthenope.it; parola@economia.unige.it; marcello.risitano@uniparthenope.it; tutore@uniparthenope.it,"Tutore, Ilaria/AAL-3840-2020; Tutore, Ilaria/AAZ-1329-2021; Ferretti, Marco/ABI-2417-2020; jam, amir/O-6460-2019","Tutore, Ilaria/0000-0002-3520-1449; Risitano, Marcello/0000-0001-9579-5931",,,,,38,7,7,2,19,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Installed capacity is increasing, and developments in technology mean that wave energy is likely to play an important role in the future mix of electricity generation. Short-term forecasts of wave energy are required for the efficient operation of wave farms and power grids, as well as for energy trading. The intermittent nature of wave energy motivates the use of probabilistic forecasting. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts of wave energy flux from a variety of methods, including unconditional and conditional kernel density estimation, univariate and bivariate autoregressive moving average generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) models, and a regression based method. The bivariate ARMA-GARCH models are implemented with different pairs of variables, such as (1) wave height and wave period, and (2) wave energy flux and wind speed. Our empirical analysis uses hourly data from the FINO1 research platform in the North Sea to evaluate density and point forecasts, up to 24 h ahead, for the wave energy flux. The empirical study indicates that a bivariate ARMA-GARCH model for wave height and wave period led to the greatest accuracy overall for wave energy flux density forecasting, but its usefulness for point forecasting decreases as the lead time increases. The model also performed well for wave power data that had been generated from wave height and wave period observations using a conversion matrix. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters.

Targets for these indicators are related to an action and economic development plan for the EU regions and have been incorporated into European Regional Policy programming. The analysis of regional development is based on the estimation of the spatial Durbin model, containing endogenous and exogenous interaction effects. We compare the performance of different specifications of the spatial weights matrix describing the spatial arrangement of the sample regions finding evidence in favour of an exponential-decay distance matrix.

However, most DEA models applied to airports assume that inputs and outputs are known with absolute precision. Here, we use Fuzzy-DEA models to capture vagueness in input and output measurements obtained from Nigerian airports. These results are subsequently treated by bootstrapped truncated regressions to control the random effects inherent to any sample. Results indicate that the joint use of bootstrapped regressions and FDEA models leads to more robust results, in the sense that fewer significant contextual variables are identified as efficiency drivers. When controlling for fuzziness and randomness, capacity cost was found to be the only significant variable, in addition to a learning component represented by trend. Policy design for Nigerian airports should focus simultaneously on third-party capacity management - such as privatization - while fostering continuous improvement practices to sustain the learning curve.

The model is specified to decompose the total effect of antitrust on democracy into two channels: one through efficiency and the other through equity. The model's purpose is to identify whether and how antitrust affects democracy through these two variables. The model's results suggest that equity (improving income distribution) rather than efficiency (promoting economic development) serves as the main channel through which antitrust influences democracy. However, even if improving income distribution by protecting consumers and small businesses is the channel through which antitrust safeguards political democracy, its effect is very small. Therefore, the goal of improving income distribution to promote democracy should fall into the realm of taxation and transfer payments rather than antitrust.","[Ma, Tay-Cheng] Chinese Culture Univ, Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Ma, TC (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",tcma1234@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,4,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In particular, wage reductions in the labor market caused by stigmatization (Rasmusen, 1996), and profit reductions in commercial markets caused by reputational losses due to a firm's previous wrong-doings (Iacobucci, 2014) share many similarities. In this article, I construct a model in which Rasmusen (1996) and Iacobucci (2014) emerge as special cases. I use this model to show that increasing the legal sanction (or the probability of detection) cannot cause a reduction in reputational losses that off-sets the increase in expected total sanction. This clarifies ambiguities in the previous literature, and implies that, absent further considerations, deterrence is enhanced by an increase in legal sanctions and/or the probability of detection. Thus, standard Beckerian dynamics are preserved even when reputational sanctions interact with formal sanctions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In essence, we show how to use the maximum possible amount of information from the sample in the evaluation of the prediction accuracy, by commencing the forecasts at the earliest opportunity and weighting the prediction errors. Via a Monte Carlo study, we demonstrate that the proposed framework selects the correct model from a set of candidate models considerably more often than the existing standard approach when only a small sample is available. We also show that the proposed weighting approaches result in tests of equal predictive accuracy that have much better sizes than the standard approach. An application to an exchange rate dataset highlights relevant differences in the results of tests of predictive accuracy based on the standard approach versus the framework proposed in this paper.

We argue that the diplomatic use of geographic quantities in state-led efforts to structure and shape international interactions has demonstrable geopolitical consequences. Using the case study of Iceland, one of the first casualties of the international financial crisis, we examine this state's geopolitical repositioning towards EUrope' through use of geographical uniqueness and concomitant reaffirmation of Nordic closeness.

An analysis of the mechanism by which pools discourage innovation indicates that this decline is driven by technologies for which the creation of a pool weakened competition in R&D.,"[Lampe, Ryan] Calif State Univ, East Bay, CA USA; [Moser, Petra] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Moser, Petra] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lampe, R (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, East Bay, CA USA.;Moser, P (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Moser, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ryan.lampe@csueastbay.edu; pmoser@stern.nyu.edu,,,"Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS); National Science Foundation through CAREER [1151180]; Stanford Institute for Policy Research (SIEPR); Olin Center for Law and Economics at Stanford; Driehaus College of Business; Department of Economics at DePaul University; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1151180] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS); National Science Foundation through CAREER; Stanford Institute for Policy Research (SIEPR); Olin Center for Law and Economics at Stanford; Driehaus College of Business; Department of Economics at DePaul University; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Moser thanks the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS), the National Science Foundation (through CAREER Grant 1151180), the Stanford Institute for Policy Research (SIEPR) and the Olin Center for Law and Economics at Stanford for financial support.

Most assessments of BEVs use highly taxed road fuel prices and ignore efficient pricing of electricity. We use efficient prices for transport fuels and electricity, to judge what battery costs would make BEVs cost competitive. High mileage, low discount rates and high oil prices could make BEVs cost competitive by 2020, and by 2030 fuel costs are comparable over a wider range. Its contribution lies in careful derivation of efficient fuel and electricity prices and the concept of a target battery cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper draws on a unique hand-collected dataset of commercial claims filed at Slovenian courts to examine the determinants of two salient adjudicatory outcomes: whether a case was resolved via trial or settlement and if the case was tried, whether the plaintiff was awarded the initial claim. Consistent with the divergent expectations theories of litigation, we find that trial-based resolution is less likely when parties use mediation and more likely when the case is complex as proxied by appointment of an expert. In contrast, stakes do not predict the prospects of trial. Addressing sample selection concerns, we show that defendants' legal representation, plaintiffs' profitability, and court identity are robust predictors of plaintiff victory at trial. We discuss possible explanations for these data patterns.","[Grajzl, Peter] Washington & Lee Univ, Williams Sch, Dept Econ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Grajzl, Peter] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Dimitrova-Grajzl, Valentina] Virginia Mil Inst, Dept Econ & Business, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Zajc, Katarina] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Law, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Washington & Lee University; Ifo Institut; University of Ljubljana,"Grajzl, P (通讯作者)，Washington & Lee Univ, Williams Sch, Dept Econ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.;Grajzl, P (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",grajzlp@wlu.edu; dimitrova-grajzlvp@vmi.edu; katarina.zajc@pf.uni-lj.si,,,CERGE-EI Foundation under the Global Development Network (GDN) program,CERGE-EI Foundation under the Global Development Network (GDN) program,"We are grateful to Janko Marinko, Sebastijan Potepan, and Nevenka Rihar for assistance in collecting the data and for helpful suggestions.

The implications range from earnings inequality to intergenerational mobility. Using German data from 1996 and 2006, we analyze the determinants of racist and xenophobic feelings towards foreigners in general, and against specific groups such as Italians, Turks, and Asylum Seekers. We also analyze racist and anti-Semitic feelings towards German citizens who differ in ethnicity (Aussiedler from Eastern Europe) or in religion (German Jews). Individuals' perceived (or actual) economic well-being is negatively related to the strength of these feelings. Education, and having contact with foreigners mitigate racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic feelings. People who live in states which had provided above-median support of the Nazi party in the 1928 elections have stronger anti-Semitic feelings today. The results are not gender-driven. They are not an artifact of economic conditions triggering feelings about job priority for German males, and they are not fully driven by fears about foreigners taking away jobs.

Specifically, we test the use of random lottery-based reward schemes to promote public transit usage during off-peak periods. We derive the theoretical equilibrium for this decision-making game and test the validity of the proposed mechanism through monetized laboratory experiments. We use methods from experimental economics to investigate the behavioral assumptions within such an incentive-based mechanism. We find counterintuitive results where a Pure Nash Equilibrium explains behavior in one regime and Quantal Response Equilibrium explains behavior in another regime. Specifically, there is no shift to off-peak periods when the expected value of traveling in the off-peak is less than that at peak, which is explained by a Pure Nash Equilibrium. However, there is a substantial shift to the off-peak period when the expected value of traveling in the off-peak is larger than that of the peak, but much less than that predicted by a Pure Nash Equilibrium. The Quantal Response Equilibrium performs reasonably well in this condition, and we conclude that risk attitudes play a significant role in explaining behavior in lottery-based incentive mechanisms. This study, which relies on the gamification of travel behavior, finds that the proposed mechanism can provide a sustainable shift in users' choices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The increase in beta is solely due to an increase in banks' correlations, improving portfolio diversification.

The technique of data envelopment analysis is applied due to its flexibility to incorporate multiple inputs and multiple outputs without any underlying assumption on the functional form. There is growing tendency of public sector banks operating under increasing returns to scale, implying that substantial gains could be obtained from altering scale via either internal growth or consolidation in the sector. In terms of productivity, the results show a positive change in both the sectors due to technological change, possibly as a result of adoption of latest technology and new business practices in post reform period. However, there is an evidence of shrink in the market and negative growth in productivity in both the sectors during the period of global financial crisis.

The principal non-linearity in the development of the socioeconomic systems that arc managed under conditions of uncertainty and partial observability of the functioning processes, has helped to formulate the expediency of their forecasting based on neural networks. Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of different forecasting methods is implemented using the example of the Astrakhan region socioeconomic development forecast for 2014-2015. The initial data has been compiled of the GRP (gross regional product), the volume of industrial production, gross agricultural product, the amount of investments in fixed assets, the scope of construction work, the average monthly salary, the CPI (consumer price index) and the unemployment rate in 2001-2012.

After some cases of expansionary episodes of fiscal consolidations in eighties of XX century, an intensive international research on the possibility of non-Keynesian effects of fiscal contractions in highly developed countries has started. The aim of the article is to analyze the possibility of obtaining non-Keynesian effects of fiscal consolidations in post-transformation countries of Central Europe. An important aim of macroeconomic policy in the analyzed economies is to benefit the advantages of convergence process. Thus, the empirical analysis is made within conditional beta-convergence framework. The verification of hypothesis of beta-convergence enables to identify the long term tendency of output per capita, in the same time it enables to identify non-Keynesian effects of fiscal prudence and to assess their role in the process of reducing GDP gap between the analyzed economies. Then the potential transmission channels for non-Keynesian effects of fiscal policy were analyzed. In the research the data from Eurostat and European Commission for the years 2000-2013 was used. The paper provides arguments in favor of the existence of non-Keynesian effects of fiscal consolidations in Central Europe that support the process of conditional convergence.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland; [Rogalska, Elzbieta] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Olsztyn, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland.",apb@umk.pl; e.rogalska@interia.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Rogalska, Elżbieta/AAB-7586-2020","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Rogalska, Elżbieta/0000-0003-4995-5791",,,,,28,24,24,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,271,282,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_18,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800018,0

The aim of our research is to analyse generational differences with regard to honest behaviour and honesty as a personal value in Post-Soviet Business Environment: in Estonia and Latvia. In this study we explore differences in approaches towards values and especially honesty amongst four generations of retail sector employees-starting from those, who were still to great extent exposed to pre-Soviet values, continuing employees who started their careers during the Soviet times and ending with those, who were educated and entered the workforce after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 781 service employee from 6 retail organizations in Estonia and Latvia were surveyed to assess likelihood of dishonest behaviour and to rank their values according to the Rokeach instrumental value scale. Arguing that for post-Soviet countries rather specific events and timelines could have left the main impact on worldviews, in order to assess the generational differences, we define four generations currently active in the workforce - Post-war generation, Early Gen X, Transition generation and Millennials. We confirm that despite dual morality and ambiguous ethics in the Soviet Union, twenty-five years after the collapse of the system retail sector employees tend to report likelihood of rather honest behaviour. Moreover older generations report higher likelihood of honest behaviour than younger generations. And Post-war and Early generation X, born between 1945 and 1970, rate honesty and responsibility higher as their individual values. We also find that in a post-Soviet context there are significant differences between early and late generation X, at least as far as honesty in the retail business environment is concerned. Originality of this study is the following - the complexity of generational differences towards ethical behaviour, values and honesty amongst them has not been widely researched in Post-Soviet business environment.","[Baumane-Vitolina, Ilona; Apsalone, Madara; Sumilo, Erika] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Baumane-Vitolina, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",ilona.baumane@lu.lv,"Apsalone, Madara/AAG-8276-2019",,,,,,37,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,68,85,,,,,,18,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200006,0

Gaining a better understanding of the minds, behavior and personality profile of individuals who become entrepreneurs can be beneficial to the growth of the economy of a country. The literature provides numerous theories that link entrepreneurial intention and personality and at the same time there is a link between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial intention. However, limited evidence was found where personality, emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial intention were investigated in the same study. Furthermore, some studies focus on the link between personality, as one construct, and entrepreneurial intention. The purpose of this paper is to determine the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and the Big Five individual personality traits as well as the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and emotional intelligence. To investigate these relationships, 177 nascent entrepreneurs, who indicated strong entrepreneurial intentions to start a business, completed a self-completion questionnaire. The findings suggest that two of the Big Five personality traits (i.e., conscientiousness and openness to experience) have positive relationships with entrepreneurial intention while one trait (i.e., neuroticism) has a negative relationship with entrepreneurial intention. Openness to experience seems to be the personality trait most strongly correlated with entrepreneurial intention compared to the other four traits. Furthermore, a positive relationship between entrepreneurial intention and emotional intelligence exists. A better understanding of individuals who possess entrepreneurial intention and which personality traits can enhance entrepreneurial intention may assist government programs, career councillors and business schools to identify, develop and support individuals who aspire to start their own businesses.","[Botha, M.; Fouric, W.; Wasserman, D.

This study aimed to update a systematic review published in 2008 by searching peer-reviewed and unpublished literature of economic evaluations of transport interventions that incorporate the health related effects of physical activity. Our analysis of methods for the inclusion of physical activity related health effects into transport appraisal over time demonstrates that methodological progress has been made. Thirty-six studies were included, reflecting an increasing recognition of the importance of incorporating these health effects into transport appraisal. However, significant methodological challenges in the incorporation of wider health benefits into transport appraisal still exist. The inclusion of physical activity related health effects is currently limited by paucity of evidence on morbidity effects and of more rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of interventions. Significant scope exists for better quality and more transparent reporting. A more consistent approach to the inclusion of benefits and disbenefits would reinforce the synergies between the health, environmental, transport and other sectors. From a transport sector perspective the inclusion of physical activity related health benefits positively impacts cost effectiveness, with the potential to contribute to a more efficient allocation of scarce resources based on a more comprehensive range of merits. From a public health perspective the inclusion of physical activity related health benefits may result in the funding of more interventions that promote active transport, with the potential to improve population levels of physical activity and to reduce prevalence of physical activity related diseases.

The analysis is singularized to emergent contexts, as the Romanian market is the case study, and it is focused on the process of value allocation between the components of a group of assets. Having an application on fixed assets, the paper shows how fair value estimation is critical and implies risks on such an atypical market. The process of value allocation may bring a high level of arbitrariness to fair value accounting, this being crucial to apply correctly the valuation methodology in relation to the nature of the asset and market information available, and the selection of the allocation keys. The empirics of our study show a consistent expertise of Romanian valuators, as the most frequently used method for value allocation is the deduction of the value of those assets that was estimated based on the market approach, and not the values that were estimated based on the cost or income approach. Other findings show the frequent use of replacement cost, gross or net, to the detriment of book value, a very important aspect for an emergent market, even more so as revaluation in Romania does not guarantee that dedicated valuation methodology was used. These results are all the more important as land and buildings were the majority of fixed assets valuated, with the highest values as a result of the real estate bubble prior to the financial crisis, and with an essential role in the activity of the companies.","[Deaconu, Adela] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Audit, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Crisan, Sorana] Univ Babes Bolyai, KPMG Romania Branch, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Buiga, Anuta] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Stat Prognosis Math, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Deaconu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Audit, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",adela.deaconu@econ.ubbcluj.ro; soranastanciu@yahoo.com; anuta.buiga@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"DEACONU, Adela/E-3889-2013; Buiga, Anuta/IAQ-2094-2023","DEACONU, Adela/0000-0002-7898-2740;",,,,,30,6,6,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Worldwide management consultancies year after year keep providing research based evidence that Employee Engagement levels strongly influence productivity of a firm. Companies with higher Employee Engagement scores also have better Employer brand and are more competitive at hiring top talent. Employee Engagement is historically medium to low in Latvian companies, according to the market surveys provider TNS who have been researching Employee commitment and engagement with their Employers for many years in a row. Percentage of actively engaged ones fluctuates around 13% only. At the same time, share of actively disengaged or detractors represent high 40% and more. Research shows that the most engaging setting is game environment. People are most engaged when feeling playful. In medicine, researchers even have been experimenting with game environment to reduce permanent pain in patients who became so much engaged with a game that reported relative reduction in pain levels. Appropriately designed games have ability to engage people for hours and psychologists have been researching game dynamics required to achieve such high levels of engagement. Human resources is one of the business areas where gamification has been successfully used in different companies worldwide. Processes like Recruitment, Onboarding,Training and Development, Performance Management, Reward and Recognition, Internal Communication, are most commonly being gamified. Authors, therefore, have drawn the hypothesis that Employee Engagement in Latvia can be positively influenced through gamifying Human Resource Management processes. (Gamification for the purpose of this article is defined as application of game elements to the non-game context (S. Deterding, et al., 2011)). This article proposes methodology for researching the linkage between Employee Engagement and application of gamification in Human Resource Management processes at Latvian companies. Result of the article is proposed methodology for quantitative and qualitative research to find out how many companies in Latvia are using game elements in their Human Resource Management processes. It intends to clarify, which processes are most commonly gamified in Latvian companies and whether or not those companies that do use gamification as a tool experience relatively more engaged workforce. Value of such research is in helping business organizations to design their Human Resource Management processes with the most positive impact on Employee Engagement. This is, however, a very early stage paper. It proposes methodology for the research to be carried out, while the actual research has not been started yet.","[Ergle, Daiga; Voroncuka, Inesa] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Ergle, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",daiga.ergle@airbaltic.lv,,,,,,,24,1,1,2,36,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,219,230,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200019,0

We explore the socioeconomic conditions that support choosing these motives. We used data from a 2012 nationwide survey, processed through logit models. Significant factors influencing the desire to conserve as a motive were family welfare improvement, land use change intention, and training. Those affecting income as a motive were formal education, indigenous people participation and training. Finally, factors related to both conservation and income, as a motive, were formal education, training, PES influence in water management, and land boundary conflicts.

The trend of excessive indebtedness of households is not losing but gaining momentum. The problem of personal over-indebtedness becomes focus of interest of regulators, research community and the public in general. In Croatia the numbers of citizens whose bank accounts are frozen as well as the level of their debt are steadily rising. One of the reasons of such trend is easier access to debt. There is evidence that accessibility and volume of household credit instruments grows. The literature suggests the influence of new, technologically powered techniques of screening as one source of broadening of the borrowing capacity of households. Studies also document the process of, credit democratization, one of the reasons enabling it being the relaxation of financial regulation. Only few studies can be found that research the role of bank operations policies in inducing the higher levels of household debt. Bank marketing, specifically the advertising and promotion are the tools to communicate with clients, and it has been proven that effective marketing content is as powerful as the interest rate level in deciding upon getting a credit. This leads the way to the research of possible relation between marketing efforts of the bank and the level of household indebtedness. This paper focuses on the possible proactive role of banks, driven by the profitability, and accompanied with the inappropriate quality and level of regulation, in the rise of the number of over-indebted persons in Croatia. The effect the economic downturn on proposed relationship is also taken into account. Analysis is based on the bank financial statements data and selected macroeconomic indicators. The goal of the paper is to describe how banks impact the consumer behavior, and consequently give incentive to the rise of personal indebtedness in Croatia.","[Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunja; Stambuk, Ana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,,ivan.filipovic7@gmail.com; skalamer@efri.hr; ana@efri.hr,"Škalamera-Alilović, Dunja/R-6910-2018; Štambuk, Ana/Y-9689-2018","Škalamera-Alilović, Dunja/0000-0003-2346-154X; Štambuk, Ana/0000-0002-5138-1662",,,,,46,2,2,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,66,79,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700008,0

For most part of Malaysia's economy, much importance is placed on the contribution of forest in agronomy development. Due to apparent large scale land clearing that brought grave consequences to the environment, various initiatives to protect forests from misuse, abuse and overexploitation of forest resources, mainly by plantation companies, were implemented. The attribution of haze caused by burning of forests further pushed for appropriate policies and laws to protect atmospheric quality in Malaysia. Local laws on preventing deforestation and haze are mainly provided in the Environmental Quality Act 1974 and National Forestry Act 1984. Efforts to resolve issues of deforestation and its environmental impacts on air quality should re-emphasize the benefits of practicing Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) to limit environmental impacts of forest activities through continuous participation and commitment from stakeholders, such as the plantation companies. The penalties for deforestation offences in current Malaysian laws whilst it is punitive, should be improved by imposing an environmental tax on polluter companies as a corrective and rehabilitative tool, thus affirming the 'polluter pays principle'. Environmental tax law could be utilized, for example, in restoring the affected forest area to its natural and original state. The categories of persons contributing to the Environmental Fund should be reviewed to address impacts from deforestation and haze. The study attempts to enhance and strengthen the role of companies in their corporate legal responsibilities towards deforestation and haze issues in Malaysia.

Many of them were found illusory, and appeared to be not robust to the methodology, sample or period choice. Some anomalies weakened substantially, reversed themselves, disappeared or even reappeared after some time. There have been anomalies that have fascinated economists from all over the world. One of these was the short-term underpricing and long-term underperformance phenomenon observed after initial public offerings (IPOs). Are IPOs really offering investors an unfailing opportunity to earn money at the moment of going public, resulting in a huge amount of money being left on the table by the issuing firms? Is investing in IPO firms in the long run an easy way to lose money? Are the short-and long-term abnormal returns robust enough to become recognised as statistically and economically significant? The research aimed to answer the questions using a broad set of benchmarks and empirical approaches.

Over the last 80 years there have been several main schools of leadership theory. A considerable body of research has been conducted on leadership styles, with two styles getting more interest than others. Those two leadership styles are transactional and transformational style, identified by Bass (1990). Muller and Turner (2007) concluded, that the transformational leadership style is preferred on complex change projects and a transactional style preferred on simple, engineering projects. To verify their conclusion about the transactional leadership, a study investigating leadership styles in 2 Czech engineering companies was conducted.

In this context, the deeper econometric analysis could provide additional information about the common and diverging aspects of the dynamics of lending rates in the Baltic countries. Therefore, the aim of the paper to explore the pass-through of funding costs of banks to lending rates in different lending segments in the Baltic countries during the period of 2005-2015 taking in account risk considerations. To reach the set aim, appropriate comparisons are made between different specifications of the error correction model, first of all, relating specifications with three-month EURIBOR rate and weighted average costs of short-term euro liabilities and, secondly, specifications with and without the measures of borrower credit risk and banking risk. As a result, the conclusion was reached about superiority of three-month EURIBOR rate as a measure of funding costs of banks. The measures characterizing creditworthiness of borrowers and banking risk are significant factors determining lending rates in the Baltic countries. Across the Baltic states, the pass-through from funding costs of banks to lending rates are high. Long-term pass-through from funding costs of banks to lending rates tends to be higher in Lithuania, but creditworthiness of borrowers appeared to have the highest influence on lending rates in Latvia.","[Micune, Vija] Bank Latvia, Riga, Latvia",,"Micune, V (通讯作者)，Bank Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",vija_micune@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,496,510,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200042,0

It utilized 320 female employees, which were working in Indonesian and Malaysian banks, and tested four proposed hypotheses by implementing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed, firstly, work-family conflict (WFC) influenced Indonesian banks' employees to have a lower job satisfaction significantly while family-work conflict (FWC) gave positive effect on Malaysian employees' job satisfaction. Secondly, job satisfaction drove a negative effect on Indonesian employees' turnover intention while it gave an adversely effect on Malaysian employees' one. Finally, job satisfaction pushed higher job performance for both countries' dual-roles women. It implies that culture similarity does not matter in the nexus of work and family conflict with job satisfaction in which each country shows different findings.

Empirical evidence with solid quantitative findings recently conducted by Pankaj Ghemawat has confirmed that more 'open and connected' economies display higher rates of economic growth, higher per capita income levels and greater levels of human welfare. Against this backdrop, it is notable that the available evidence - whilst incomplete - suggests that African economies are amongst the least integrated in the world. Given that integration and connectedness matter, and that there are material gaps in the evaluation of integration for African economies, it is important to develop better measures of African economies' connectedness with their neighbours and with the world, how this connectedness is evolving and establish more comprehensive and robust means of economic integration compared to those historically available. Using Ghemawat's framework, which measures flows of trade, capital, information and people (TCIP) to determine connectedness, we develop the Visa Africa integration index to provide a more comprehensive and detailed gauge of economic integration for 11 African countries in three clusters: East Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa. The index results suggest that African economies are emerging off a modest base, with some economies demonstrating progressive structural improvements toward higher levels of integration with their respective regions and the world. East Africa, in particular, shows signs of rising connectedness over the survey period. The index also illustrates that some countries are more integrated globally than regionally and vice versa, which is important information for policy makers toward improving deeper and broader integration in their respective regions. The index builds on previous research in the broad area of integration and helps us better understand the challenges and opportunities presented by Africa's economic changes and some of the implications for economic growth.","[Saville, Adrian] Univ Pretoria, Citadel Asset Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Saville, Adrian] Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, Econ & Finance, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [White, Lyal] Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, Ctr Dynam Markets, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Saville, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Citadel Asset Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.;Saville, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, Econ & Finance, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"White, Lyal/0000-0002-7254-0968",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, the issue is while the female labour force participation rate is highest in the 25-34 years age group (72%), it dropped 5 percentage points to 67% in the 35-44 years age group. A research by Talent Corp (2014) shows that the top three reasons women dropout from the workforce are: to raise a family, lack of work-life balance and to care for a family member. So, this perception study examined whether family friendly policies (FFP) could be a tool to retain women in the labour market and subsequently a tool to manage the nation's resource. The main aims of this study are: firstly, to examine whether there is a relationship between demographic factors and women's decision to remain in the labour market, and secondly, to examine whether FFP may encourage them to remain in the labour. Using a self-administered questionnaire, working women who were married were identified in the Klang Valley. A total of 158 usable questionnaires were collected in June 2016. Cross tabulation analysis and frequency analysis were used. The crucial findings showed that women who work in organisations with FFP have higher intentions to continue working compared to women who work in organisations without FFP. This study found that ethnicity, occupational sector and having children below 6 years old are significant factors that influence women's decision to remain in the labour market.

The major contribution of this study is that it is the first effort to empirically analyse the short- and long-run effects of the outward FDI using panel data of ASEAN-8 countries, which could provide useful policy implications for governments at both regional and international levels to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development. Using pool mean group analysis, this paper finds that the gross domestic saving, inward FDI and outward FDI have a positive long-run impact on the gross domestic investment even though their long-run estimates are inelastic. The empirical study reveals that both inward FDI and outward FDI, to some extent, are complementary to the gross domestic investment.","[Tan, Bee Wah; Goh, Soo Khoon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Wong, Koi Nyen] Sunway Univ, Sch Business, Selangor 46150, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Sunway University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Goh, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",bewahtan@gmail.com; skgoh@usm.my; koinyenw@sunway.edu.my,"Tan, Bee Wah/AAL-5374-2021; goh, soo khoon/P-1663-2015; Wong, Koi Nyen/C-5711-2014","goh, soo khoon/0000-0001-6732-0592; Wong, Koi Nyen/0000-0001-9767-712X",Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001/CDASAR/816277],Universiti Sains Malaysia(Universiti Sains Malaysia),This work was supported by a research grant 1001/CDASAR/816277 from Universiti Sains Malaysia.,,31,16,17,1,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The multi-channel distribution structures are always enriched by adding new channels. Investments in new channels are predetermined above all by the dynamic changes in consumer behavior in respect to the process of decision making for purchasing and stronger competition. As a reaction to changes companies try to find the suitable configuration of channels which should comply with the conditions of the environment, consumers' expectations and the priorities for long-and short-term development of business. The aim of this study is to present the different approaches in designing multi-channel distribution, the advantages of using them and implementation issues when putting them into practice. Reviewed are the approaches of complementarity between channels, competition and integration between channels, with a focus on their characteristic features that distinguish one from another and make them recognizable. The research is based on an online survey among companies registered in Bulgaria. This survey places an emphasis on companies, the distribution channels they use; the channels they add; and the multichannel approach they apply. Companies' intentions to abandon some of the channels used in the past are of particular interest as well. The results of the research show that adding new distribution channels to the already functioning ones appears as one of the solutions to overcoming the negative effects of long-lasting recessions on businesses, often accompanied by a decline in sales and the outflow of customers. In the last three years the e-channel has been the most preferable channel for adding to the previously existing structures of distribution by the companies covered by the survey. The most often applied multichannel approach in companies' business is based on the complementarity between channels, followed by integration between channels and competition between them. The interest of customers and companies in multi-channel distribution will continue to grow. The example of successful channel configurations will be transferred to different spheres of economy and social life thus contributing to better customer service and efficient distribution of products and services.","[Tonkova, Evgeniya] Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Tonkova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria.",evge@mbox.digsys.bg,"Tonkova, Evgeniya/AAN-6109-2020",,,,,,15,0,0,1,10,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,858,869,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200073,0

Using the recent literature on this topic, the study develops a conceptual model to be tested with PLS-SEM (partial least squares structural equation modelling), using the data collected from 98 Romanian SMEs from the services sector that participated in a survey conducted in the spring of 2016. The variance-based structural equation modelling, PLS-SEM, was the method of choice for model testing, as it allows a complete statistical analysis of both formative and reflective models. The findings show that innovation and quality, the technological development and the social networks capitalisation influence business sustainability. Entrepreneurs are using social network capitalisation (SNC), innovation and quality (I&Q) and technological development (TH) to achieve sustainability. Still, the main driver of sustainable businesses is the innovation and quality approach that acts as a mediator bridging firm's orientation towards technological development and business transactions with sustainable objectives fulfilment, such as long-term profitability, customers' loyalty, environmental footprint and improvements in community welfare.","[Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm SNSPA, Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch Econ & Int Business, Fac Management, 11 Tache Ionescu St,Sect 1, Bucharest 010352, Romania; [Pinzaru, Florina; Zbuchea, Alexandra] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm SNSPA, Fac Management, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania; [Andrei, Andreia Gabriela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Interdisciplinary Res, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, 11 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700506, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Vatamanescu, EM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm SNSPA, Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch Econ & Int Business, Fac Management, 11 Tache Ionescu St,Sect 1, Bucharest 010352, Romania.",madalina.vatamanescu@yahoo.com; florina.pinzaru@facultateademanagement.ro; andrei.andreia@gmail.com; alerandra.zbuchea@facultateademanagement.ro,"Pinzaru, Florina/ABC-5633-2021; Andrei, Andreia/I-9722-2017; Zbuchea, Alexandra/A-2771-2011; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017","Pinzaru, Florina/0000-0002-8371-5284; Andrei, Andreia/0000-0002-1093-6713; Zbuchea, Alexandra/0000-0002-5341-7622; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/0000-0002-9397-0385",,,,,59,23,23,3,23,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

There is a lack of research in which the implementation of social responsibility is examined in the context of management culture exclusively, thus a problem of actual complex decision-making models is encountered in the primary stages of implementing CSR. The level of difficulty in the process of managerial decision-making requires simplified measures, therefore, the aim of this research is to form the model of establishment of the level of management culture for managerial decision making with the aim of implementing corporate social responsibility. The model of establishment of the level of management culture for managerial decision-making with the aim of implementing corporate social responsibility is presented which is made up on the basis of theoretical insight and the results of empirical research provided by the authors of the article. The model of establishment of the level of management culture for managerial decision making with the aim of implementing corporate social responsibility proceeds through the stages of organizing, processes, analysis, solutions and changes. The essence of Organizing stage is to highlight the problem, identify the goals and objectives, and also to involve the employees of all levels. At the Processes, diagnostic stage the information is collected while solving the foreseen objectives and in accordance with the methodological requirements. At Analysis stage, the level of management culture and CSR are determined. At Decision making stage, detailed problems allow preconditions to make specific management decisions.

It can hurt firms and benefit consumers in a one-sided market. However, in two-sided markets, its primary goal is to attract more agents or increase profits. Here, the performance of a second-degree price discrimination strategy in the context of duopoly two-sided platforms is analysed. Two exogenous variables, which include the discount rate and the price discrimination threshold, are used in order to examine whether the price discrimination strategy could help two-sided platforms achieve their objective, which is to maximise their market value. Three cases are considered, and we demonstrate that the price discrimination strategy cannot attract more agents and at the same time increase the profits; a lower price discrimination threshold cannot ensure larger markets shares; a higher discount rate is detrimental to the profit of a platform. However, this is good for its market shares. Moreover, discriminative pricing increases the competition.","[Zhang, Kai; Liu, Weiqi] Shanxi Univ, Inst Management & Decis, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China",Shanxi University,"Zhang, K (通讯作者)，Shanxi Univ, Inst Management & Decis, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.",,,"Liu, Weiqi/0000-0001-6262-9312","Natural Science Foundation of China [71102173]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013M530890]; China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation [2014T70232]; Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi [2015052005]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Shanxi [2015-024]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation; Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Shanxi(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars)","The authors alone are responsible for the remaining errors.

We find that different forms of precarious employment exhibit different spatial patterns. The most striking locational pattern is shown by fixed-term contracts and part-time work where we observe clusters of high levels of precarious employment primarily in southern regions. Northern regions, in contrast, are characterised by clusters of low levels of precarious employment. We also find that precarious employment is predominantly a rural phenomenon with the exception of temporary (interim) work which displays higher average levels in urban communes. Finally, modelling results suggest that the geographical distribution of precarious forms of employment is linked to factors such as the unemployment rate, the industrial composition of a region, gender and the structure of family households.","[Jacquemond, Marc; Breau, Sebastien] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada",McGill University,"Jacquemond, M (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",sebastien.breau@mcgill.ca,"stud, zool/G-4030-2011","Breau, Sebastien/0000-0002-5594-2674",,,,,53,5,6,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

It may not always do so, they write, but it canand during 1947-1950 in Japan it did. Land reform may sometimes raise productivity, but it did not raise it in Japan. The claim that it did is a fable, a tale people tell and re-tell only because they wish it were true. A lease is a credit transactiona way for local elites (tied to local information networks in ways that banks can never be) to extend funds to farmers. Elites could lend money directly, but would need to create a security interest to protect their loans. Doing so requires legal procedures, however, and most local elites in prewar Japan lacked the university education necessary to manipulate those procedures. By contrast, a lease lets local elites protect their funds simply by retaining the right to evict tenants who fail to pay. As such, it represents a way for investors and farmers jointly to economize on credit market costs. The Japanese land reform program effectively banned this transaction-cost economizing credit-market strategy, expropriated the wealth of the investors who used itand cut the rate of growth in agricultural productivity.","Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Ramseyer, JM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ramseyer@law.harvard.edu,,,Harvard Law School,Harvard Law School,"The author gratefully acknowledges the generous financial support of the Harvard Law School, and the helpful comments and suggestions of Penelope Francks, Sheldon Garon, Tom Ginsburg, Andrew Gordon, John Haley, Todd Henderson, William Hubbard, Temple Jorden, Heiko Karle, Yoshiro Miwa, Carl Mosk, Richard Smethurst, Frank Upham, David Weinstein, and participants in workshops at ETH Zurich, Harvard Law School, the Japanese Law & Economic Association, Northwestern University, Tel Aviv University, the University of Chicago, Yale University, and the referees and editors of this journal.",,75,4,4,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

J,"Worsley, D",,,,"Worsley, David",,,The economic viability of a Parallel Cross Country Route for England,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rail routes; Economic appraisal; Gravity modelling,,"This paper is a contribution to the debate about the uses to which Britain's existing rail infrastructure should be put following the completion of High Speed 2. The provision of rapid high capacity rail services from London to Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Manchester and Birmingham will remove the principal long distance passenger flows from the East Coast Main Line (ECML), Midland Main Line (MML) and West Coast Main Line (WCML). Most of the suggestions for alternative uses of the released capacity on these routes have involved either increased connectivity between existing secondary stations, better connections from the principal population centres to off route destinations, or increased capacity for commuting in to London. This paper suggests an alternative proposal, namely that sections of the ECML, MML, WCML and Great Western Main Line (GWML) could be linked together to form a new long distance route running on a south west to north east axis; the route would provide a broadly parallel (but slower) alternative to the existing Cross Country Route between Bristol and York, as it would run via Swindon, Oxford, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Leicester, Nottingham and Doncaster. This paper will utilise various methods for estimating the capital expenditure required and passenger demand expected from the provision of this route and accompanying rail services (along with standard assumptions regarding operational expenditure), in order to gauge whether there may be a case for developing this proposal further.

By focusing on how the knowledge needed in support of innovation is professionalised and reaches accepted modes of organising work, the paper examines the interplay between the emergence of a new professional domain and the institutional dynamics of the industry(ies) within which professionals operate. To this aim, we propose a reflection on the mechanisms that underpin the professionalisation of design activities in food industries. Empirical evidence draws attention to those practices that allow knowledge originated in different contexts to be socialised and converge towards the same institutional umbrella, that is, a new professional domain. The degree to which such professionalisation resonates with extant professions literature is discussed.","[D'Ippolito, Beatrice] Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"D'Ippolito, B (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Management Sch, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",beatrice.dippolito@york.ac.uk,"D'Ippolito, Beatrice/AAS-3936-2020; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","D'Ippolito, Beatrice/0000-0003-0778-4373","Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Piacenza, Italy)","Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Piacenza, Italy)","I am indebted to Francesco Timpano, Marcela Miozzo, Davide Consoli, Stan Metcalfe, Daniel Muzio, and Qin Zhou for constructive feedback on previous versions of the manuscript.

With leniency policies offering immunity to the first reporting party, a high fine is the main determinant of deterrence, having a strong effect even when the probability of exogenous detection is zero. Deterrence appears to be mainly driven by distrust; here, the fear of partners deviating and reporting. Absent leniency, the probability of detection and the expected fine matter more, and low fines are exploited to punish defections. The results appear relevant to several other forms of crimes that share cartels' strategic features, including corruption and financial fraud.","[Bigoni, Maria] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Fridolfsson, Sven-Olof] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Uppsala, Sweden; [Le Coq, Chloe; Spagnolo, Giancarlo] SITE, Udine, Italy; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] EIEF, Udine, Italy",University of Bologna; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Bigoni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,"Le Coq, Chloe/HGB-7597-2022; Bigoni, Maria/R-4995-2019","Le Coq, Chloe/0000-0002-0759-8733; Bigoni, Maria/0000-0001-5988-6115; SPAGNOLO, GIANCARLO/0000-0003-4117-6283",Konkurrensverket (the Swedish Competition Authority); Wallander and Hedelius foundation,Konkurrensverket (the Swedish Competition Authority); Wallander and Hedelius foundation,We gratefully acknowledge research funding from Konkurrensverket (the Swedish Competition Authority) and the Wallander and Hedelius foundation that made this research possible.,,53,42,44,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

To address such questions, this article develops a neo-institutional theory-inspired analysis of the case of English law firms and their impacts on institutional change in Germany. The article shows that the shaping of the direction of institutional change by English legal TNCs was a product of conjunctural moments in which local institutional instability combined with the presence, resources and strategies of the TNCs to redirect the path of institutional evolution. This draws attention to the need to go beyond the TNC and its resources and to consider the way a diverse array of local actors and their generating of instability in existing institutional structures influence the ability of TNCs to become involved in processes of institutional change in particular, conjunctural moments in time.","[Faulconbridge, James R.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Org Work & Technol, Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Muzio, Daniel] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Lancaster University; Newcastle University - UK,"Faulconbridge, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Org Work & Technol, Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",j.faulconbridge@lancaster.ac.uk,"Faulconbridge, James/JZE-5154-2024","Faulconbridge, James/0000-0003-1809-4271",UK's Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-2957]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G006423/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G006423/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Data upon which this article is based on was collected as part of a project funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (grant reference RES-000-22-2957).,,77,30,32,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We investigate changes in mortality after the introduction of screening guidelines for breast and prostate cancers in the USA and UK. We use differences in the timing of guideline adoption, differences in ages recommended for screening, and differences in which cancers are detectable by screening to identify the effect of cancer screening guidelines. Our quadruple-differencing strategy finds a moderately sized mortality benefit from mammography and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening guidelines among recommended age groups and little change in mortality rates among age groups not recommended to receive screening. As a falsification test, we verify that prostate cancer rates among men did not fall after the introduction of mammography screening and breast cancer rates among women did not fall after the introduction of the PSA test.","[Leive, Adam] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Colonial Penn Ctr, Dept Hlth Care Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University of Pennsylvania; George Mason University,"Leive, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Colonial Penn Ctr, Dept Hlth Care Management, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",leive@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,36,5,5,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

It finds that ties with service intermediaries have positive relationships with both service innovation and product innovation, and technology search and market search mediate these relationships. Moreover, technology search has a stronger impact on product innovation than on service innovation, but the effects of ties with service intermediaries and market search on service innovation are not different from those on product innovation. The findings enrich our knowledge on the antecedents of service innovation and provide some insight into the debate on whether the antecedents of product innovation can be generalised to service innovation. Moreover, they draw a more comprehensive picture on how a firm's external ties affect innovations.","[Zhang, Wenhong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Donghan] Commun Univ China, Grad Sch Management, Beijing 100024, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yapu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Communication University of China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhao, YP (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",zhaoyapu@hotmail.com,"zheng, wei/IQT-9639-2023; zhang, yan/JGL-8022-2023; Zhang, Wanying/HMO-7118-2023; Lu, Jia/JVO-6891-2024","Zhang, Wanying/0000-0001-5816-0929;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71002024, 71372026]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71002024, 71372026).",,63,10,11,4,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The fit between transport alignments and contemporary poverty mappings is rarely considered in the design of transport systems funded or leveraged through the public purse. Given a present world of severe public finance constraints, this gap requires attention. Furthermore, the tension between the funding of expanded mobility and the funding of enhanced local accessibility to services within a digitalized environment requires a more thorough consideration than previously afforded by the literature. This article uses case examples to explore these hitherto professionally neglected dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this purpose it used nonlinear time varying factor model. The obtained results have provided evidences for the existence of some degree of segmentation in China's housing market. By further dynamic analysis of the convergence, we have found that important housing policies from Chinese central government can significantly alter the housing market but with a time lag of 4 to 5 months, and that quite different behaviors exist between the new house market and the second-hand house market in China, which provides the evidence for the complexity of housing market in China. Multiple factors together are the driving forces for the regional house price convergence. And the driving forces differ among three clubs. The basic conclusion provided from the realized research is that the conventional definitions of economic regions may not be appropriate to analyze house price segregation in China. Heterogeneous convergence exists in China's regional house prices, indicating the complexity of regional house prices in China. And housing policies should be implemented with different focus among the regions. The way of the central government is to make housing policies aiming at different sub-markets of the new house market and the second-hand house market.","[Lin, Rui; Zhang, Xin; Li, Xiuting; Dong, Jichang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Lin, Rui] Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Chicago","Li, XT (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",linrui0704@163.com; zhangxin2970@163.com; lixiuting@ucas.ac.cn; jcdonglc@ucas.ac.cn,"Chen, Feng/JQW-8742-2023; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173213, 71203217, 71403260]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013M540129]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71173213; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71203217; 71403260 and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant No. 2013M540129.,,29,5,5,1,26,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

In 2000, the market underwent a significant change; as a result, some of the bus services on fixed routes that were previously provided by two monopolistic operators are currently provided by means of competitive tendering. The research examined the reasons for this change, the measures taken in order to implement it, and the outcomes from the perspective of time. The findings indicated that, as in other countries, competitive tenders in Israel have succeeded in reducing costs, compared with the past, and this has led to a reduction in the related subsidies required of the government. At the same time, there was a general rise in the level of service provided to the public and a decline in fares. It seems that the government succeeded in improving its degree of control over the provision of bus services, but frequent changes in the structure of the tenders and their characteristics might reflect difficulties in the implementation of competition in the bus services in Israel.

A TwoStep cluster analysis was conducted to identify the natural groupings of respondents' living environment based on six built environment indicators. The analysis resulted in five types of neighbourhoods: urban TODs, activity centre TODs, potential TODs, TADs, and traditional suburbs. HABITAT survey data were used to derive the commute mode choice behaviour of people living in these neighbourhoods. In addition, statements reflecting both respondents' travel attitudes and living preferences were also collected as part of the survey. Factor analyses were conducted based on these statements and these derived factors were then used to control for residential self-selection. Four binary logistic regression models were estimated, one for each of the travel modes used (e.g. public transport, active transport, less sustainable transport such as the car/taxi, and other), to differentiate between the commuting behaviour of people living in the five types of neighbourhoods. The findings verify that urban TODs enhance the use of public transport and reduce car usage. No significant difference was found in the commuting behaviour between respondents living in traditional suburbs and TADs. The results confirm the hypothesis that TADs are the evil twin of TODs. The data indicates that TADs and the mode choices of residents in these neighbourhoods is a missed transport policy opportunity. Further policy efforts are required for a successive transition of TADs into TODs in order to realise the full benefits of these. TOD policy should also be integrated with context specific TOD design principles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The answer is that lessening inequalities in well-being serves a fundamental commitment to equality of moral status.

The paper addresses the most relevant outcome variable, the probability of victory in state-by-state elections, while also solving for the traditional outcomes, and ensuring that the forecasts are easy to update continuously over the course of the main election cycle. In an attempt to maximize both these attributes and the accuracy, I create efficient forecasts for each of these three types of raw data, with innovations in aggregating the data, then correlate the aggregated data with the outcomes. This paper demonstrates that all three data types make significant and meaningful contributions to election forecasting. Various groups of stakeholders, including researchers, election investors, and election workers, can benefit from the efficient combined forecasts defined in this paper.

We do that in a context of households that consume public goods in addition to private goods. For the Becker-Coase theorem to hold in this setting, utility must be transferable both within marriage and upon divorce, and the marginal rate of substitution between public and private consumption needs to be invariant in marital status. We show that if divorce alters the way some goods are consumed (either because some goods that are public in marriage become private in divorce or because divorce affects either the marginal rate of substitution between public and private goods or even the cardinalization of a spouse's utility), then the Becker-Coase theorem holds only for very specific preferences. We conclude that, in general, divorce laws will influence the divorce rate, although the impact of a change in divorce laws can go in either direction.","[Chiappori, Pierre-Andre] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Iyigun, Murat] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Iyigun, Murat; Weiss, Yoram] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Weiss, Yoram] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Columbia University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Tel Aviv University,"Chiappori, PA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 1009A Int Affairs Bldg,MC 3308,420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pc2167@columbia.edu,,,,,,,39,14,21,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

An analysis of survey data collected from 118 foreign subsidiaries in South Korea reveals that their R&D capacity growth is positively related to external knowledge sourcing, but only marginally associated with internal knowledge sourcing. We also find that subsidiaries' R&D capacity growth is positively related to their managerial autonomy. Furthermore, cultural distance between MNE home and host countries has a marginal negative effect on R&D capacity growth and weakens the link between internal knowledge sourcing and R&D capacity growth. Overall, our results suggest that researchers, managers, and policy-makers who are concerned with the growth of R&D activities by MNE foreign subsidiaries should consider knowledge sourcing dimensions and relational factors not in an isolated manner, but in concert.","[Hemmert, Martin] Korea Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Chaisung; Kim, Seunghoi] Konkuk Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Konkuk University,"Lim, CS (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.",edisonfoot@gmail.com,"Hemmert, Martin/AFB-9011-2022",,Konkuk University,Konkuk University,This paper was supported by Konkuk University in 2013.,,64,1,1,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Envisioning LIBOR as a commodity beset by inherent contradictions, the paper mobilizes the tropes of arbitration, arbitrage and arbitrariness to illuminate, respectively: the market-making work performed by LIBOR; its role in enabling the transfer of financial risk, most notably when fraudulently manipulated; and the nature of the regulatory prosecution of such manipulation.","[Ashton, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Christophers, Brett] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Uppsala University,"Ashton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, 412 S Peoria,231 CUPPA Hall MC 348, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",pashton@uic.edu; brett.christophers@ibf.uu.se,,"Ashton, Philip/0000-0001-9257-9424",,,,,63,35,37,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Congestion charges are a case in point; despite their being considered an effective policy measure for improving environmental and health problems in cities, it has proved difficult to secure public acceptance for them. This paper analyses the policy process behind the introduction of a congestion tax in the Swedish city of Gothenburg, focusing on strategies for building legitimacy for the tax. The results show that the tax was legitimated primarily through its broad support in the City Council, which had been secured by integrating the tax with infrastructure investments, while strategies for directly involving the citizens in the process, such as public consultation and local referendums, were neglected or actively opposed. The process successfully generated a capacity for decisive political action legitimated through representative government. Over time the decision may gain public acceptance, but the process used might also prove detrimental to the future of the congestion tax and undermine trust in the democratic institutions.

It argues that local user firms of the textile machinery industry did not play a role in building up the competence of specialised suppliers through convergence innovation. The diversity of textile machinery is so large that their convergence types of innovation are distinctive in creating new functions and products. The convergence innovation between the two industries and the resultant positive synergy has not been generated much in Korea. Strong user firms rather escaped from cooperative work with specialised suppliers, which otherwise may have generated convergence innovation and strengthened their competence. Weak convergence innovation by both textile firms and specialised suppliers caused their economic activities concurrently downturned. The Korean textile machinery industry and its user sector have lost their competence in relatively short period.","[Lee, Kong-rae; Yun, JinHyo Joseph] DGIST, Dalseong Gun 711873, Daegu, South Korea; [Jeong, Eui-Seob] KISTI, Seoul 130741, South Korea",Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST); Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI),"Lee, KR (通讯作者)，DGIST, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Dalseong Gun 711873, Daegu, South Korea.",leekr@dgist.ac.kr,"Lee, Kong-Rae/AAG-8986-2021; Yun, JinHyo Joseph/AAL-3521-2020","Yun, JinHyo Joseph/0000-0003-2690-3550",,,,,19,8,10,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We find that, relative to counterparts who did not complete educational requirements, IDA participants who completed program requirements for financial education had higher average monthly savings, saved a higher portion of their income, and deposited savings more frequently. Notably, we find that participants aged 36 or older experienced increasing returns on investment in financial education, and the best outcomes are found among those with more than 200% of the required dose of financial education.

Bankruptcy courts that allow lawyers to charge more for Chapter 13 bankruptcy see a significantly larger fraction of Chapter 13 filings (elasticity of 0.3).

While much evidence exists on levels of corruption, less is available on its impact, particularly its impacts on consumer markets. This paper investigates empirically the effect of the corrupt sale of spectrum licenses to ineligible firms on the wireless-telecommunications market in India. I find that the corrupt allocation had, at worst, no impact on the number of subscribers, prices, usage, revenues, competition, and measures of quality. I argue that the market-based transfer of licenses to competent firms other than the original awardees, combined with fierce competition in the telecommunications sector, may have mitigated potential deleterious impacts of corruption on consumers. These results suggest that the original corrupt allocation did not matter, which provides support for the Coase theorem.","Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Sukhtankar, S (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,,,,,,,53,8,9,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Based on the analysis it can be concluded that the level of profitability in the Czech food and beverages industry is relatively low, and moreover, there is a tendency to decrease during the observed period. The highest values of ROA are achieved by the largest companies (expressed by the number of employees) and on the contrary, the ROA values of the smallest companies are often negative and in the whole observed period there are significantly lower than ROA values of other size groups of enterprises. The analysis has shown that the level of profitability is determined by the company size.

We measure the novelty of product innovation using three well-established categories, ranging from highly novel new-to-world products to new-to-firm products that are essentially imitative, with products that are new-to-country (but not the world) being an intermediary category. In turn we investigate how knowledge derived from different external and internal (within-firm) sources of ideas can help firms increase innovation with different degrees of novelty. Our empirical analyses are conducted on a large sample of manufacturing firms from the South American emerging market of Colombia and show that many of the same sources of knowledge - such as scientific sources, production departments and managers - are associated with higher innovation in all three categories of novelty. However, some sources - notably external clients and internal interdisciplinary groups - are more significantly associated with more novel innovation than imitation. The implications of these findings for the literatures on innovation and imitation, and innovation by emerging market firms are discussed.","[Corredor, Sandra; Somaya, Deepak] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Forero, Clemente] Univ Los Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia; [Somaya, Deepak] Univ Illinois, Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Champaign, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Corredor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",,,,,,,,82,3,4,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,161,199,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028010,0.0,,,39,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300009,0

The surveys indicate that enterprise size is a key factor influencing the provision of training to their employees. The amount of enterprises that provided training to their employees and participation in training courses increase with the size of the enterprises. Furthermore, small enterprises spent less on training courses than mediumsized enterprises which spend less than large enterprises. The findings also suggest that enterprises generally preferred to provide training through formal external and internal courses rather than the use other form of training. The main reason for enterprises does not provide any form of training to their employees was that the existing skills and competencies correspond to the current needs of the enterprises.

Due to the complexity of energy efficiency notion, the problems must be solved by using an integrated approach. As long as the energy efficiency is a category within the efficiency notion, the approaches defining and assessing efficiency were applied in this study. Among these approaches there are the following: approach based on benefit - cost ratio, approach based on the system's capacity to exploit its potential, approach based on the efficiency of functioning process, approach based on the sustainable development theory, approach based on the needs satisfaction of key stakeholders. In the framework of each approach problems of energy efficiency at different economic levels, such as national economy, regional economy, economics of enterprise, were determined, and the suggested solutions were presented. Thus, the energy efficiency priorities were grounded in this article. These should be as follows:. increasing the efficiency of energy resources utilization, implementing energy efficient equipment and technology, decentralizing the energy system, developing the alternative energy sources, optimizing the transaction costs. In order to succeed in solving problems of the energy efficiency, the suggested complex approach must be applied.","[Gontareva, Irina; Ivanenko, Olena] Simon Kuznets Kharkiv Natl Univ Econ, Dept Econ Enterprise & Management, UA-61166 Kharkov, Ukraine; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Business Econ & Management, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Kharkiv National University of Economics; Vilnius University,"Gontareva, I (通讯作者)，Simon Kuznets Kharkiv Natl Univ Econ, Dept Econ Enterprise & Management, Bldg 2,Off 40,Pr Lenina 9a, UA-61166 Kharkov, Ukraine.",lider.06@mail.ru; dalia.streimikiene@khf.vu.lt; alyssa19@yandex.ua,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Gontareva, Irina/H-9100-2018; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Gontareva, Irina/0000-0002-1345-6950; Gontareva, Irina/0000-0002-2242-378X; , Pawel Daszkiewicz/0000-0001-9956-644X",,,,,33,4,4,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Combined with the unique challenges of an operating entity, this could potentially expose the profitability of sustainable businesses on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate employees' justice perceptions of performance management practices in a company in the chemical industry. The population includes all the employees in the chemical industry that was used in this study. A total of 140 questionnaires were issued to all the employees in an organisation which had undergone a performance appraisal and 102 respondents completed the surveys, giving a response rate of 72 per cent. A cross-sectional survey design was used in this study. The justice perceptions were measured according to an existing framework developed by Thurston and McNall (2010). The framework is founded on a hypothesised four-factor model constructed according to theories on organisational justice. The employees of the organisation in the chemical sector were involved in this study. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to measure perceptions of justice based on theories on organisational justice. The measuring instrument used was based on recognised models and theories. The study supports the construct validity of the measuring instrument and the reliability of the scales used. The justice constructs were used to identify specific items in the performance management practice that required improvement. The implications of the results are that continual interventions are required if employee commitment and productivity levels are to improve, resulting in a positive impact on business performance. Significant differences in perceptions by demographic groups were reported and discussed. This study explored the importance of understanding justice perceptions of performance management practices as an enabler for sustained business performance. Further, the study confirmed that justice perceptions have a direct impact on both the organisational climate and employee morale.","[Govender, Thanasagree; Grobler, Anton] Univ S Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Joubert, Yvonne T.] Univ S Africa, Dept Human Resource Management, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of South Africa,"Govender, T (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Joubert, Yvonne Trijntje/J-6008-2015; Grobler, Anton/M-7636-2016","Grobler, Anton/0000-0003-3017-3247",,,,,43,1,3,1,21,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Retailers increasingly use store flyers as a common form of feature advertising. Promotions featured in store flyers represent two sources, manufacturers and retailers, who pursue different objectives-support sales of National Brands (NBs) and increase store traffic and PL sales, respectively. Store flyers design implies a very difficult trade-off between promoting PLs or NBs. The aim of this study was to examine whether featuring PLs vs. NBs on flyers is equally effective in terms of memory. We found that free recall and recognition-commonly used as proxies of memory-did not differ between PL and NBs. For retailers, this means that despite the different presence in terms of flyer space, featuring PL is as effective as NB in terms of flyer space allocation. We also explored the association between memory and customer characteristics, an area of investigation that has not specifically covered PL feature advertising before. Flyer proneness and loyalty to the retailer were discovered to be significant predictors of-respectively-NBs free recall and PL recognition. These findings support the relevance that customers characteristics play as far as memory for feature advertising is concerned. Retailers and manufacturers are therefore encouraged to segment the audience for flyers and target different segments with versions of the flyer that place different emphasis on NB or PL.","[Ieva, Marco] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Parma, Italy; [Ziliani, Cristina; Carlos Gazquez-Abad, Juan] Univ Almeria, Fac Econ & Business, Agrifood Campus Int Excellence CeiA3, Almeria, Spain",University of Parma; Universidad de Almeria,"Ieva, M (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Parma, Italy.",marco.ieva@studenti.unipr.it; cristina.ziliani@unipr.it; jcgazque@ual.es,"Ziliani, Cristina/AAD-4601-2019; Gázquez-Abad, Juan Carlos/AAF-1571-2020; Ieva, Marco/K-4525-2019","Gázquez-Abad, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-9181-2850;",,,,,23,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-20182-5; 978-3-319-20181-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,43,50,,10.1007/978-3-319-20182-5_5,0.0,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1YX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380446600005,0

This paper also attempts to analyse and identify the awareness of companies of various sizes concerning the importance of design. The primary aim of research was to investigate companies' concern for design in relation to other factors: price, quality and reliability. A comprehensive review of the extant literature and journals identified several sources of design approach for Czech companies. The research consists of two main parts. Firstly, a method of smart internet Google SpreadSheets questionnaires designed by the authors was used. Total of 168 entries collected from 305 addressed respondents were used in the research. In the second part of research, the results were analysed using quantification and by means of seeking a mutual dependence. The results obtained were subjects to a statistical study. The results of the research have offered interesting findings. It was discovered that design represents a very important competitive factor that influences firms' final decision. On the other hand, quality, reliability and price are still perceived as more interesting factors of innovation. Briefly, design is not likely to be perceived as the main innovation factor in the Czech Republic. This paper identifies several interesting aspects regarding design within Czech companies, including the mindset of management.","[Kramolis, Jan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Stankova, Pavla; Richtr, Michal] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kramolis, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",kramolis@fame.utb.cz; stankova@fame.utb.cz; michal@dynamodesign.cz,"Kramoliš, Jan/M-2492-2019; Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023; Kramoliš, Jan/C-7481-2015","Kramoliš, Jan/0000-0002-1687-8067; Stankova, Pavla/0000-0001-7068-8937",,,,,21,7,7,0,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Thus volatility is an integral aspect of living, while the ancient societies believe in fate; modem man tries to manage the risk associated with change. In the investment analysis risk is a measure of financial vulnerability and it is measured in terms of volatility of return. Investors select their investments based upon their risk tolerance. It is possible to find optimal portfolios which maximize the expected return, for a given risk, or minimize the risk for a given return. It is also possible to find portfolio which optimize risk and return simultaneously. Risk return trade off in market was extensively analyzed in the past. It was studied that there is a relationship between expected return and beta and conduced that lowest risk assets provides highest returns, while the highest risk securities gave lowest returns and so the risk return relationship appeared to be positive.

At the same time, interested parties such as the online shopping platform, government regulatory agency and the sellers try to mitigate the uncertainty from four dimensions: trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity and social presence. Based on the above findings, this article constructs the model of three-level product quality control system in Chinese online shopping.","[Li, Bo] Shandong Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Jinan, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Political Science and Law,"Li, B (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Jinan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,2015,,,,,,,205,211,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9RF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365145700038,0

Environmental effects are reflected by the levels of main air pollutants: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dusts, quantity of generated waste, quantity of sewage and water used. The main energy production raw material is coal which is characterized by specific parameters such as: calorific power, i.e. combustion temperature and calorific value, ash content, sulphur content and other trace elements. The analysis is based on data from one of the Polish power plants located in Silesian Voivodeship. Environmental threats are becoming one of the major concerns in industry today. Power industry belongs among branches whose environmental impact is particularly negative. The main source of pollution in Polish and European power plants is hard coal and lignite, both of which are used as fuel. Proper prevention or dealing with environmental threats is the key element of a power plant management system. We analyse the influence of use of hard coal on the level of environmental effects.

Methodology; A field survey was conducted around the study area. The survey gives insight of the property user perspective on facilities and services offered by local and foreign commercial banks in Malaysia. Data were collected by questionnaire and direct observation. A total of 72 questionnaires were administered to the respondents. This was then used to analyze the information pertaining to corporate real estate on the user characteristics of the local and foreign commercial banks in Malaysia. Findings; The results show that all of the respondents of local and foreign commercial banks were coming far from their residences to the parent bank of more than 15 km. All the commercial bank's respondents have responded similarly regarding the distances of the banks from their residential places. The facilities of the local commercial banks have been rated mostly either excellent or very good. This shows that these banks have sophisticated facilities. Likewise the facilities of the foreign commercial have been rated excellent except for the customer waiting areas for local and foreign commercial banks like Cimb, AmBank and Alliance bank for local commercial banks and UOB and OCBC bank for foreign commercial banks. All the commercial bank's services have been rated accurate by the respondents, showing that they have excellent and competitive services to attract their customers. Limitations; the study was limited to 12 commercial banks of Malaysia, six being local and the other six as foreign commercial banks.

The research hypothesis claims that the level of nominal income of regional inhabitants is compensated for by the level of costs of living. Therefore, it is highly inaccurate to consider socio-economic situation of the region's population by comparison of nominal income variables such as net disposable household income (NDHI) without taking the interregional price differences into account The paper briefly outlines the methodology for the construction of spatial cost-of-living index (CoLI) based on the adjusted consumer basket for consumer price index. Authors then estimate the values of NDHI on the level of district cities (since the data is available on the level of NUTS3 only). These two indicators enable verification of research hypothesis. The results correspond to the fact that the disparities in real incomes are lower than those in the nominal incomes. Therefore, assesing the real regional social-economic disparities yields more accurate results about the social-economic position of regions which is a crucial finding especially for the process of creation and implementation of economic, social, and cohesion policies.","[Simanova, Jana; Kocourek, Ales] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Simanová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",jana.simanova@tul.cz; ales.kocourek@tul.cz,"Simanova, Jana/HII-5280-2022; Kocourek, Ales/HKW-2602-2023","Simanova, Jana/0000-0003-1441-2375; Kocourek, Ales/0000-0002-5880-7515",,,,,17,2,2,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,192,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000019,0

The paper reveals that implementation of wavelet transform allows to use financial/real sector ratio as a predictor of global crisis in a certain country about 4-5 years before the active phase of the crisis.","[Svirina, Anna; Parfenova, Elena; Shindor, Olga] Kazan Natl Res Tech Univ, Kazan, Russia",Kazan National Research Technical University - KAI,"Svirina, A (通讯作者)，Kazan Natl Res Tech Univ, Kazan, Russia.",anna_svirina@yahoo.com; elena_parf@mail.ru; o_v_sh@mail.ru,"Parfenova, Elena I/T-5101-2017; Svirina, Anna/AAF-6960-2021; Svirina, Anna/HTS-1465-2023","Svirina, Anna/0000-0001-8598-558X",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,4290,4296,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700439,0

Yet, it is not difficult to find examples of brands that have been extended successfully into perceptually distant domains. In an attempt to resolve this discrepancy between research insights and practical experiences, the study investigates the role of Brand Relationship Quality (BRQ) as a critical factor determining consumer responses to brand extensions. The proposed model is tested separately in the context of three different fit scenarios (high, moderate, and low) with data from 502 consumers. The results indicate that BRQ and perceived fit exert independent effects on consumer responses and complement each other as they jointly influence evaluations of brand extensions. The study therefore extends existing theory by providing evidence that the brand extension phenomenon cannot be explained justly without including constructs that portray personal relationships consumers develop with brands and provides insights for marketers and researchers as to how such relationships can be integrated in formulations of successful brand extension strategies.","[Arikan, Esra] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Mkt, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Cengiz] Middle East Tech Univ, Mkt, Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Cengiz] Abdullah Gul Univ, Kayseri, Turkey; [Bodur, Muzaffer] Bogazici Univ, Mkt & Int Business, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Bilgi University; Middle East Technical University; Abdullah Gul University; Bogazici University,"Arikan, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Mkt, Istanbul, Turkey.",esra.arikan@bilgi.edu.tr,"ARIKAN, Esra/Z-3545-2019","Yilmaz, Cengiz/0000-0002-9383-1457",,,,,36,7,9,0,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

I use hypothetical mergers in a big cross-section of airline route markets to assess UPP's sign, rank, and magnitude predictions. In its best case scenario, it gives correct sign predictions in 90-percent observations; correct decile predictions in 75-percent observations; and a mean magnitude difference of $17, when compared against merger simulations.

Because the duty of constraint in these accounts does not depend on the cause of the disadvantage, the advantaged's duty of constraint is what I call a come-what-may' duty.

Nevertheless, success may not be the only destination on this road. Decades after the first initiatives using this procurement method, thousands of failures, renegotiations and adjustments have been pointing pitfalls in PPPs (Macario, Ribeiro, & Costa, 2015). Developed in a complex network of stakeholders, PPPs depend on an efficient tendering process to build a sustainable project. However, decision at such critical moment relies on complex environment of expectations, negotiation and behaviour. Hence, in order to develop the discussion on stakeholders' behaviour, this work presents a game theory model for the effect of financial support on stakeholders' risk appetite during the tendering process.

This often involves simultaneous formalisation of informal paratransit operators, and restructuring of public transport networks into centrally planned trunk-feeder systems. Such interventions might radically affect passenger access and social inclusion in ways that are as yet poorly understood. The paper uses a new accessibility metric called access envelopes to examine the potential impacts of various restructuring options on passengers' wage earning potential at job opportunities across space. The Corridors of Freedom initiative of the City of Johannesburg is used as a case study of a BRT-led restructuring exercise with land use and transport components. The study finds that it is hard to improve on the accessibility provided by the current near-ubiquitous informal minibus-taxi network. The only way that BRT implementation can improve access and affordability in the short run is by offering a fully integrated trunk with feeder services. Should such feeder services be supplied via a hybrid formal informal approach, an integrated and progressive fare policy is critical to maintaining affordable access for poor passengers. A laissez-fare approach where taxis are allowed to provide ad hoc feeder services without any fare integration, is likely to decrease affordable access. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis covers a wide set of geographically proximate economies with different degrees of integration with the old fifteen European Union members: new member states, accession and candidate countries, as well as European Neighborhood Policy countries and the Russian Federation. The article aims to shed new light on the heterogeneity of MNE preferences for the host countries' regulatory settings (including labor market and business regulation), legal aspects (i.e., protection of property rights and contract enforcement), and the weight of the government in the economy. By employing data on 6888 greenfield investment projects, the random-coefficient mixed logit analysis shows that, although the quality of the national institutional framework is generally beneficial for the attraction of foreign investment, MNEs' preferences over economic institutions are highly heterogeneous across sectors and business functions.","[Ascani, Andrea; Crescenzi, Riccardo; Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ascani, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.ascani@lse.ac.uk; r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk; s.iammarino@lse.ac.uk,"Ascani, Andrea/T-7092-2019; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014","Ascani, Andrea/0000-0003-4738-3144; Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700","European Union [FP7-SSH-2010.2.2-1 (266834)]; European Research Council under the European Union [H2020/2014-2020, 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG]; Economic and Social Research Council [1096607] Funding Source: researchfish",European Union(European Union (EU)); European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research leading to these results received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme: [Grant Agreement no.

We extend this research by examining the variation in investor responses to a salient feature of analyst forecasts. We focus on the roundness of analyst forecasts as a salient signal of imprecision. We examine whether: (1) investors notice rounding, even though it is binary and potentially has limited information content, (2) the investor reaction to rounding is affected by its repetition, and (3) the investor reaction to rounding varies by investor type. We document a weaker market reaction to rounded forecasts than to non-rounded forecasts, which is consistent with investors using rounding as an indicator of lower forecast precision. The investor response to rounding is more pronounced in the presence of multiple rounded forecasts, disclosed in analyst reports simultaneously, and is attributed primarily to less sophisticated investors. We also provide evidence of investors' delayed assimilation of the information contained in rounded forecasts subsequent to the forecast announcement date. Our results shed light on the scope of limited investor attention. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from the Chinese census,JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Parental sex selection; Marriage squeeze; Marriage market sex ratio; Missing women,IN-DIFFERENCES; MISSING WOMEN; POPULATION; ALLOCATION; PREFERENCE; WELFARE; BALANCE; GENDER; DOWRY,"Recent increases in the (male/female) sex ratio at birth in eastern Asia are thought to be associated with a preference for sons and to result from parental sex selection. However, males are less likely to marry and to have offspring as the ratio increases, and that decreases the expected number of grandchildren. Using data from the 2000 Chinese census, we test whether the sex ratio in the marriage market has an effect on the gender of subsequent births and hence on the sex ratio of the birth cohort. The slow population growth caused by the Great Famine in the early 1960s and the quick recovery that followed produced major changes in the sex ratio for those of marriageable age two decades later. We estimate that an increase of 1 % in the number of marriageable males relative to females, the marriage market sex ratio, would decrease the probability of having a son by 0.02 percentage points. That implies that the Great Famine, which occurred around 1960, led to an increase in the early 1980s of 5.8 extra male births per 100 females.","[Li, Xing] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chan, M.

High school dropouts reinforce a LBW outcome by providing less investment in the human capital of their LBW children relative to their normal birth weight children whereas higher educated mothers compensate by investing more in their LBW children. In addition, an increase in the number of LBW siblings present in the home raises investment in a child, which is consistent with reinforcement, but this positive effect tends to be concentrated among high school dropouts. These results suggest that studies analyzing the effects of LBW on child outcomes that do not account for heterogeneity in investment responses to a LBW outcome by maternal education may overestimate effects of LBW on child outcomes for those born to low-educated mothers and underestimate such effects for those born to high-educated mothers.","[Restrepo, Brandon J.] US FDA, Off Commissioner, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA),"Restrepo, BJ (通讯作者)，US FDA, Off Commissioner, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA.",brandon.restrepo@eui.eu,"Restrepo, Brandon J/I-2247-2019","Restrepo, Brandon J/0000-0002-8005-4839",,,,,56,36,40,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Evidence for privacy havens,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Privacy; Firms' location; Internet; Legal restrictions,INTEGRATION STRATEGIES; ECONOMICS,"This paper empirically studies the location decisions of internet firms when they face high legal standards of privacy protection. Many factors might influence them: technological spillovers, lower taxation, and so on. Internet firms can also arbitrate national differences and many of them actually locate their activity in order to escape from national laws they consider over-stringent. In the current stage of development of the internet-the so-called Web 2.0-the ease of access to personal data proved to be strategic input. So the more a jurisdiction makes collecting and using these data easy, the more attractive the country is, if all other things remain constant. One way for a firm to avoid such legal restrictions is to locate or to expand its business in less privacy protective countries. Our empirical results support this 'no-privacy haven' hypothesis. In particular, we highlight a new privacy paradox according to which the more stringent certain online privacy laws are, the more they induce firms to locate their business in less stringent countries, and finally the weaker actual privacy protection on the internet is.","[Rochelandet, Fabrice] Univ Paris 03, IRCAV, 13 Rue Santeuil, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Tai, Silvio H.

But this literature largely ignores the acquisition and assertion of SEPs by entities that do not participate in SDOs (Outsiders). SDO Outsiders, which are not themselves bound by the licensing and other requirements imposed by SDOs, have far greater freedom to employ a range of litigation tactics not available to SDO participants when they enforce SEPs against manufacturers of standardized products (Producers). This article describes the first study that has been conducted to collect and analyze data relating to SEP assertions by SDO Outsiders, a large number of which are so-called nonpracticing entities (NPEs). Over a fifteen-year period, the proportion of Outsider assertion of SEPs has been significant. More importantly, both SDO Outsiders and participants assert a combination of SEPs that are encumbered by SDO FRAND licensing commitments and that are unencumbered. Thus, while NPE Outsiders are responsible for numerous assertions of unencumbered SEPs, the greater threat of hold-up and rent extraction could arise from assertions of unencumbered SEPs by SDO Outsiders that are themselves Producers.","[Contreras, Jorge L.] Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Contreras, Jorge L.] Amer Univ, Washington Coll Law, Program Informat Justice & Intellectual Property, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; American University,"Contreras, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, SJ Quinney Coll Law, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;Contreras, JL (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Washington Coll Law, Program Informat Justice & Intellectual Property, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jorge.contreras@law.utah.edu,,"Contreras, Jorge/0000-0002-7899-3060",Albert and Elaine Borchard Fund for Faculty Excellence at the University of Utah,Albert and Elaine Borchard Fund for Faculty Excellence at the University of Utah,"Associate Professor, University of Utah S.J.

We develop a simple two-period principal-agent model showing that some degree of inertia benefits the principal. We then analyze how organizations can optimally combine several policies to approach the optimal degree of inertia. In particular, we consider the optimal mixture of (abstaining from) exploration, managerial vision, organizational task-specific investments, and incentive pay.

Unfortunately, even in case that individuals are aware of the fact that there might be potential sources of misperceptions, intuitive behavior within routines may lead us to biased judgments. As regards transport, research has demonstrated that many car drivers are subject to a 'time saving bias', reflecting the failure of individuals to correctly predict the right potential of speed to save journey time. The resulting overestimation of the time saving benefit from speeding leads travelers to drive faster than privately optimal and, as a consequence, causes excessive costs in particular due to higher fuel consumption and accident risk, thereby reducing personal well-being. This paper develops a framework to determine the individual welfare cost of (the private willingness to pay to avoid) the 'time saving bias' and exemplarily uses highway data for Germany to calculate the magnitude of the bias. We find that if novice drivers were aware of the bias and expect to travel a moderate annual highway kilometrage over their lifetime as active drivers, they could be willing to pay a cash-equivalent of around (sic)500-1500 in order to avoid the bias, e.g. either by novel car equipment (inverted speedometer, autonomous car technology) or in the form of driving school training programs. If the avoidance of the bias could be realized by the latter, a mark-up of at least roughly one-third (but more likely two-thirds) on regular total driving school fees would be justifiable on average. On a per kilometer basis, the individual cost is in the order of at most 1.2(sic)-cents/km (upper bound prior to revenue recycling/use) for a representative driver. In the presence of costs of early or late arrival (schedule delay) it is far below 1.2 (sic)-cents/km. Surprisingly, when additionally account is taken of tax revenue recycling due to excess fuel consumption, the individual burden due to the bias vanishes.","[Tscharaktschiew, Stefan] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Transport & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Tscharaktschiew, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Transport & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",stefan.tscharaktschiew@tu-dresden.de,,"Tscharaktschiew, Stefan/0000-0002-4697-3858",,,,,153,16,16,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

However, the local geographic impacts remain under-examined in European contexts, including Ireland, limiting the ability to accurately identify the casualties of the crisis and understand the manner in which they are affected. This paper draws on quantitative survey data to examine the Irish mortgage arrears crisis in a suburban spatial context. The socio-economic and mortgage characteristics of households struggling with arrears are examined, while participants' open-ended responses elaborate upon the drivers of arrears and impacts upon households' quality of life. The results demonstrate the extreme distress faced by suburban mortgagors and the role of the banks' underwriting practices in driving arrears difficulties.

From an antitrust standpoint, there is a strong consensus that while MFN provisions can lead to procompetitive outcomes or at least play a competitively neutral role, they may also result in competitive harm and a loss of consumer welfare. Therefore, US and EU enforcement agencies and courts have held that MFNs should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific characteristics of both the contractual provision and the industry. While a case-by-case approach is valid, it is not ideal from a variety of standpoints: that of the competition authorities seeking to make best use of their limited resources and that of practitioners seeking to advise their clients. Accordingly, published guidelines on the use of MFNs, containing presumptions and safe harbors, would be both efficient and useful. The paper argues that it would increase the efficiency and accuracy of antitrust enforcement if one of the leading competition authorities issued MFN guidelines. The paper suggests a set of presumptions and safe harbors that should be included in any such guidelines.","[Gurkaynak, Gonenc; Guner, Ayse; Diniz, Sinan] ELIG, Law, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gurkaynak, Gonenc] Bilkent Univ, Sch Law, Ankara, Turkey; [Gurkaynak, Gonenc] Yeditepe Univ, Sch Law, Istanbul, Turkey",ELIG Attorneys at Law; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Yeditepe University,"Güner, A (通讯作者)，ELIG, Law, Istanbul, Turkey.",ayse.guner@elig.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

A Knowledge Gap Model (KGM) based on a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach was then proposed to evaluate the perceived gap on those SRAs between air freight carriers and their customers (air freight forwarders). Finally, as an empirical study, the air freight carriers and air freight forwarders in Taiwan were investigated. The results indicate the top SRAs with higher gaps are: Cargo delivery perfectively, Information system supports and Adequate shipping spaces. The result provides practical information for air freight carriers to improve service quality. Further, The KGM provides a methodology for relevant studies on service quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial heterogeneity, caused by uneven distribution of influencing factors over space, is widely acknowledged in the European airport industry, but rarely included in airport benchmarking procedures. We utilise modern methods of spatial econometrics to identify the importance of spatial heterogeneity for estimates of airports' resource elasticity and efficiency values. A set of utilised models includes the spatial error model, spatial stochastic frontier model, geographically weighted regression model, and their modifications. The empirical findings of the research are based on a sample of 356 European airports (in 2011) and include evidence of the significant effect of spatial heterogeneity on airport's efficiency and productivity estimates. A multi-output approach to production frontier specification is utilised; served passenger and cargo traffic flows are considered as airport outputs. Elasticities of airport input resources that are infrastructure (runways), catchment area characteristics (population size and welfare), regional tourist intensity, and airport status (hub, international) were estimated and discussed. We paid special attention to the geographical variability of input elasticities over Europe. The paper also contains individual estimates of the sample airports' efficiency levels. The main contributions of this paper are the proved necessity of incorporation of spatial heterogeneity into airport benchmarking procedures and the suggested methodological framework for spatial analysis of airports' productivity and efficiency.

Utilizing empirical mode decomposition, data post-processing techniques and time-frequency representations, we argue that focusing on periodicity rather than amplitude information, insights on dynamic cyclical patterns can be derived and possible stylized facts can be identified. Through the LFI we explore the potential of long term freight rate dynamics, in order to assess indications of so-called Kuznets and Kontratiev type long term periodic effects in the shipping industry. We then investigate the consistency of previous exercises, utilizing the composite NSN-BFI-BDI index, focusing on business, inventory cycles, Kitchin type cycles as well as on higher frequency patterns. By building a conceptual link between history of shipping and economic thought, we conclude that our exercise provides indications for the presence of previously unexplored long term spectral dynamics and cycles, as well as useful tools for assessing underlying mechanisms and contingencies with respect to maritime industry business decisions, events, shocks and structural changes in the shipping industry.","[Angelopoulos, Jason; Chlomoudis, Constantinos] Univ Piraeus, Dept Maritime Studies, Athens, Greece; [Duru, Okan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Maritime Adm, Galveston, TX USA",University of Piraeus; Texas A&M University System,"Angelopoulos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Maritime Studies, Athens, Greece.",jang@hol.gr; duruo@tamug.edu; chlom@unipi.gr,"Angelopoulos, Jason/AAE-1424-2021; Duru, Okan/G-5323-2016","Duru, Okan/0000-0001-7966-0025; Angelopoulos, Jason/0000-0001-9499-1201; Chlomoudis, Constantinos/0000-0003-4812-5331",,,,,60,8,8,1,6,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

However, very little research has been conducted in this field, in contrast to short-term price forecasting. Previous studies of electricity price forecasting have tackled the problem of medium-term prediction using fundamental market equilibrium models with daily data, or at most, averages of groups of hours. Similarly, the limitations of point forecasts are recognized widely, but the literature dealing with probabilistic forecasts is sparse. In this study, a novel methodology for the medium term hourly forecasting of electricity prices is proposed. This methodology is unique in the sense that it also attempts to perform punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions simultaneously. The approach consists of a nested combination of several modeling stages. The first stage consists of generating multiple scenarios of uncertain variables. In a second stage, a market equilibrium model that incorporates Monte Carlo simulation and a new definition of load levels is executed for a reduced combination of the scenarios generated. The application of spatial interpolation techniques allows us to estimate numerous feasible realizations of electricity prices from only several hundred executions of the fundamental market equilibrium model without any loss of accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is verified in a real-size electricity system that is characterized by complex price dynamics: the Spanish market.

In this paper, we only present the methods that showed the best results. For electric load forecasting, our strategy consists of producing temperature scenarios that we then plug into a probabilistic forecasting load model. Both steps are performed by fitting a quantile generalized additive model (quantGAM). Concerning the electricity price forecasting, we investigate three methods that we used during the competition. The first method follows the spirit of that used for the electric load. The second one is based on combining a set of individual predictors. The last one fits a sparse linear regression to a large set of covariates.

This study adds to these insights by examining a regional economy in France, that of Cognac, in which 300 firms are operating under homogeneous institutional preconditions. Despite these similarities, we identify different development trajectories from the 1990s onwards.

We use point and confidence interval estimates from the Phillips et al.'s (2001) local-persistent model as our preferred measures of the persistence of real exchange rates. We find that the adjustment to purchasing power parity is more rapid after accounting for structural breaks, with half-life deviation from parity below 18 months, which is consistent with the explanation based on nominal rigidities. The estimated narrow confidence intervals for the half-lives invalidate the purchasing power parity puzzle for transition and some core European Union countries. The novelty of our results lies in the finding of strong evidence for purchasing power parity as the local-persistent model produces shorter half-lives and much narrower corresponding confidence intervals than those obtained by standard Dickey-Fuller and local-to-unity models. Our evidence for PPP suggests that the transition countries have maintained their long-run competitiveness against their trading partners.","[Baharumshah, Ahmad Zubaidi; Soon, Siew-Voon] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Fountas, Stilianos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia St, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Mohamad Shariff, Nurul Sima] Univ Sains Islam Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Bandar Baru Nilai 71800, Nilai, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; University of Macedonia; Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia,"Baharumshah, AZ (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",baharumshah@yahoo.com; sv_soon2001@yahoo.com; sfountas@uom.gr; nurulsima@usim.edu.my,"Soon, Siew-Voon/AAL-4245-2020; Soon, Siew-Voon/V-3715-2017; Fountas, Stilianos/AAP-7402-2021","Soon, Siew-Voon/0000-0002-4103-3779; Baharumshah, Ahmad Zubaidi/0000-0002-2725-6546",Universiti Putra Malaysia [06-02-12-2255RU],Universiti Putra Malaysia,The authors would like to thank the Editor and anonymous referees of this journal for very constructive comments on earlier versions of the paper.

Growing demand for air travel combined with improvements in environmental performance in other industrial sectors means that commercial aviation has become a key focus for tackling climate change. The aim of this paper is to quantify the impacts of capacity-induced airport congestion using the case of London Heathrow Airport. The paper quantifies the environmental effect of airborne delays to inbound aircraft at the heavily constrained London Heathrow Airport on emissions and local air quality. The findings reveal that the additional CO2 and NOx emissions resulting from airborne delays are significant and will increase if capacity constraints on the ground are not addressed. The results are analysed in the context of Heathrow's climate change targets and current debates surrounding expansion and the challenge of reconciling environmental sustainability with aviation growth.

In this period, the country's aspiration to join the European Union and its position vis-a-vis Europe proved to be determining factors in its identity transformation process, taking into consideration its traditional Western orientation. By specifically focusing on the last decade, this study analyses how Turkey's decision-makers constituted the identity of the state in relation to a specific conception of Europe. It argues that these decision-makers, through references to the distinctive history and geography of Turkey, reconceptualised the identity of the state in order to transform Turkey into an effective actor in the world and, in doing so, challenged the dominant inclusive, multi-cultural and normative characterisations of the European Union's identity.","[Arkan, Zeynep] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Int Relat, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Arkan, Z (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Int Relat, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",zarkan@hacettepe.edu.tr,"Arkan, Zeynep/AEO-7371-2022","Arkan, Zeynep/0000-0002-3999-081X",,,,,47,1,1,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We critically evaluate the operational and financial performance of DTC's bus fleet from 1989-90 to 2010-11 - that is, from ten years prior to CNG implementation until 10 years after - to assess how this performance was affected by the fuel switch, as well as the introduction of low-floor CNG buses. CNG implementation caused a significant reduction in the capacity to deliver transit service at DTC in the initial stages of the fuel transition. Also, it necessitated investments in buses at a considerable cost premium relative to their diesel counterparts. Operating costs per kilometre grew, due to increased fuel 'expenditures per kilometre, because of the lower fuel economy, and increased maintenance costs and breakdowns per kilometre, on the CNG buses. These costs were further exacerbated by the introduction of the low-floor CNG buses. Despite increased capacity due to the investments in the CNG buses, passenger - kilometres generally declined over our analysis period. As a result, operating costs per passenger kilometre, and the ratio of operating costs to traffic revenues, have progressively worsened. We conclude that the financial situation resulting from these effects due to CNG implementation may have detracted from the ability to enhance transit capacity and provide transit service overall. Our study also demonstrates the need to analyze policies such as CNG implementation broadly, in terms of conflicts and trade-offs between environmental, and other (transit operation, socio-economic and equity) objectives, rather than narrowly in terms of only environmental outcomes.

Methodology: We used a bio-economic model of the French Forest Sector (FFSM++) that is able to consider and integrate: (a) the effects of climate change over forest dynamics; (b) forest investment decisions (among groups of species) according to expected profitability; and (c) market effects in terms of regionalised supply, consumption and trade of HWP, depending on the forest resource stocks and international prices. By including both forest dynamics and forest products, we can evaluate the carbon balance taking the following elements into consideration: (a) carbon sequestered in live and dead biomass in the forest; (b) carbon sequestered in HWP; (c) carbon substituted when wood is used in place of fossil fuels or more energy-intensive materials; and (d) carbon released by forest operations. When the model is run at constant conditions for the next century, the average carbon potential of French forests is 66.2-125.3 Mt CO2 y(-1), depending on whether we consider only inventoried wood resources, HWP pools and direct energy substitution, or if we also account for the carbon stored in tree branches and roots and if we consider the more indirect, but also largely more subjective, material substitution. These values correspond to 18.3% and 34.7%, respectively, of the French 2010 emissions (361 Mt CO2). However, when we consider both the probable increment of coniferous mortality and changes in forest growth, plus the rise in HWP demand worldwide, the average sequestration rate of the French forest decreases by 6.6-5.8% to 61.8-118.0 Mt CO2 Y-1. Running partial scenarios, we can assess the relative interplay of these two factors, where the price factor increases the HWP stock while decreasing the forest stocks (where the latter effect prevails), while the physical impact of climate change reduces both, but to a lesser extent. Considering short-sighted forest managers, whose behaviour is based uniquely on the observed conditions at the time decisions are made, we obtain a limited effect of the overall carbon balance but a relatively large impact on the area allocation of broadleaved vs. coniferous species.

Data come from surveys of Denver Housing Authority (DHA) households who lived in public housing scattered throughout Denver County. Because DHA allocations mimic random assignment to neighborhood, this program represents a natural experiment for overcoming geographic selection bias. We use the neighborhood originally offered by DHA to instrument for neighborhood experienced during adolescence. Our control function logistic analyses found that higher percentages of foreign-born neighbors predicted higher odds of no post-secondary education and (less reliably) neither working nor attending school. Neighborhood occupational prestige predicted lower odds of young adults receiving public assistance and (less reliably) neither primarily working nor attending school. Effects differed for African Americans and Latinos.

We consider a game in which each one of n players must simultaneously choose whether to incur a cost and thereby prevent a social harm. Players could be rewarded for helping, be punished for not helping, or be subject to any combination of rewards and punishments. We show that because of the substitutability of players' efforts, the use of rewards rather than punishments minimizes social costs (expected costs of helping, expected harm, and expected transfer costs) for nearly any number of players and ratio of cost-of-helping to social harm. This helps to explain the paucity of affirmative legal duties and the prevalence of whistle-blower and most-wanted rewards.","[Tabbach, Avraham] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Leshem, Shmuel] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Tel Aviv University; University of Southern California,"Tabbach, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Law, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",adtabbac@post.tau.ac.il,,,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [040.11.315],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We thank Andy Daughety, two anonymous referees, and the audience at the American Law and Economic Association Annual Meeting (2014) for their comments.

This may arise because shopping environments prevent a full evaluation (e.g., online). We develop a model of simultaneous search in which consumers have limited ability in product evaluation in order to study the impact of search cost on prices, consumer surplus, and social welfare. If consumers are endowed with the ability to choose how much information to acquire from a searched product, they may choose limited product evaluation. We find that consumers may evaluate more firms, enjoy lower prices, and higher surplus despite this limited ability. This implies that prices can decrease and consumer surplus can increase in search costs. We then extend our setting to the case of multiproduct firms and find similar effects due to changes in within-firm search costs.","[Liu, Lin] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Business Adm, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Dukes, Anthony] Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University of Southern California,"Liu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Coll Business Adm, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.;Dukes, A (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA USA.",lin.liu@ucf.edu; dukes@marshall.usc.edu,"LIU, Lin/HMD-3358-2023; LIU, Lin/IXE-0079-2023; Dukes, Anthony/AAW-4545-2020","LIU, Lin/0000-0003-0580-5310; LIU, Lin/0000-0003-0580-5310; Dukes, Anthony/0000-0003-2699-8019",,,,,26,16,17,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Such collusion can limit competition and decrease the revenue obtained by the seller (or buyer in the case of procurement) and distort the efficiency of the final allocation. This article provides an elementary, non-technical survey of theoretical and empirical research on bidder collusion with an emphasis on identifying factors that facilitate or inhibit collusive schemes as well as circumstances where detection is possible and an auctioneer's best response to bid rigging. The results of existing literature show that good auction design complements antitrust enforcement, and both play a role in deterring bidder collusion.","[Wang, Hong] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hong-min] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Wang, H (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chen, HM (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",tonywh05@163.com; hmchen@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71101026, 71472121]; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [15YJC790103]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China,"Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200052, China.

Deposit redemptions face, at least given current technology, a lag between when they are requested and when they are delivered. This fact leads some to argue that as a deposit is not fully available, all deposits are, in fact, loans and that the legal obligation of the depository changes. We argue that this lag does not nullify the original economic intent of the deposit, and hence, does not alter the legal obligations that a depository faces.

Market forces play a role in mitigating these problems, but based on existing empirical studies, there can be doubts about whether these forces are sufficient for protecting investor interests. When market forces fail, there is room for fund boards to add value for investors. U.S. funds have mandatory independent directors who are empowered to be the watchdogs for the fund investors, negotiating fees with the fund management company on their behalf. This is not the case for Luxembourg funds that are established in accordance with the EU Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive. This study uses a sample of Luxembourg UCITS funds and shows that, although there is no regulatory requirement, approximately half of the sample funds have appointed at least one independent board member. A survey among board members of the sample funds showed that, in the absence of the requirement to negotiate fees with the fund management company, Luxembourg boards give relatively low priority to costs, which they see as primarily the responsibility of the promoter, leaving the monitoring to market forces. This finding is irrespective of whether or not the board has (semi-) independent board members.","[Hazenberg, Jan Jaap] ING Investment Management, POB 90470, NL-2509 LL The Hague, Netherlands",,"Hazenberg, JJ (通讯作者)，ING Investment Management, POB 90470, NL-2509 LL The Hague, Netherlands.",jan.jaap.hazenberg@ingim.com,,"Hazenberg, Jan Jaap/0000-0002-3716-8726",,,,,24,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We devise a cross-sectional sample of approximately 410,000 firms that were active in all subsectors of the manufacturing industry and that were located across 191 NUTS 2 regions of 15 European Union member states in 2005. For each firm, we calculate two profitability indicators and a labour efficiency indicator. We find that the part of the variance of the profitability and labour efficiency indicators that is attributed to regions is very small. Furthermore, fitted multilevel models show that the quantitative effect of regional specialisation, despite being statistically significant, is very small. The results are robust across more refined geographical scales and subsectors. However, the NUTS 2 level remains the major spatial scale of the design and implementation of European Union regional policy. Our results benefit from the power and safety of a large sample and challenge conventional approaches to agglomeration research and cluster policy.","[Stavropoulos, Spyridon] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, GR-26110 Patras, Greece; [Skuras, Dimitris] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Patras; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Stavropoulos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, GR-26110 Patras, Greece.;Skuras, D (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",spstaur@upatras.gr; skuras@econ.upatras.gr,,"Stavropoulos, Spyridon/0000-0003-0783-2988; Skuras, Dimitris/0000-0002-7146-9549",,,,,41,17,18,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

However, this paper argues that the effort to 're-embed' the corporate entity by making it subject to non-economic claims expands the scope of corporate personhood and that doing so within extant power relations of the firm opens the door to alternative projects that undermine the benefit corporation movement's goal of fostering corporate social responsibility.","[Collins, Jane L.; Kahn, Walker N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Community & Environm Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Collins, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Community & Environm Sociol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jcollins@ssc.wisc.edu; wnkahn@ssc.wisc.edu,,,US National Science Foundation [BCS-1233030],US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by US National Science Foundation grant number [BCS-1233030].,,51,11,12,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The circular economy through eco-design, waste prevention and increased re-use and recycling of products, provides that the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and tackles the current environmental problems. Circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design and calls for considerable change in the mindset of businesses and hence radical changes in business education. Circular economy and eco-design are a focus of EU policy, like the adopted Circular Economy Package that seems to be a crucial turning point for further implementation of the eco-design concept into various sectors of the economy and will contribute to closing the loop of product lifecycles. The aim of the current paper is to study what competencies students should acquire in business and economics education and to formulate guidelines for human resource development through higher education according to requirements of a circular economy. The authors use literature studies, semi-structured interviews and an analysis of the syllabuses of bachelor and master degree business and economics study programmes in three Latvian higher education establishments as the main methods for the study. The authors concluded that study programmes in higher business and economics education should review the key competences regarding circular economy issues. Proposed measures in the development of a circular economy require systems thinking, development of an approach to product lifecycle, transdisciplinary knowledge, long-term thinking, more flexible approaches to interdisciplinary studies, as well as creativity, consciousness and a proactive attitude. According to the framework of a circular economy, human resource development should be considered as a principal precondition for a sustainable and competitive economy.","[Dimante, Dzineta; Benders, Juris] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Atstaja, Dzintra] BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia; [Tambovceva, Tatjana] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; Riga Technical University,"Dimante, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",dzineta.dimante@lu.lv,"Tambovceva, Tatjana/G-2828-2010; ATSTAJA, Dzintra/A-6576-2010","Tambovceva, Tatjana/0000-0002-9516-1530; ATSTAJA, Dzintra/0000-0002-9411-7212",,,,,30,3,3,0,18,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,168,179,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200014,0

The look of the environment is not sufficient to achieve a sense of comfort, but the focus is rather shifted on scents that characterize assortment of the store. Since the choice of the store is not random but depends on various factors such as proximity, store design, product range, services offered and similar, it is necessary to examine what impact has the scent compared to other factors in the perception of the store. In this paper we will prove a set of hypotheses which assume that scent has a great impact on consumers' behavior and in creating purchasing decision in the store. Scent plays an important role in creating a perception of the store from which it derives the frequency of visits to the store with pleasant scents which ultimately influence the decision to purchase. When environment is pleasant people spend more time on certain places even though it was not initially planned. In relation to pleasant environment which is influenced by pleasant scents consumers will need less time to make final purchase decision and spend more.","[Doric, Barbara] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Primorac, Dinko; Kozina, Goran] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University North - Croatia,"Doric, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",barbara.doric@azu.hr; dinko.primorac@unin.hr; goran.kozina@unin.hr,"Primorac, Dinko/AFQ-8288-2022; Primorac, Dinko/IVH-5297-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,2,11,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500001,0

Life expectancy at age 65 for males and females has improved by 1.3 and 1.7 years respectively compared to the year 2006. Despite the apparent improvement of the indicator, keeping in mind population aging issue special attention should be paid to the quality of life and in particular to the healthy life expectancy at pre-retirement and retirement ages. The decrease of the relative share of years spent without activity limitations to total life expectancy at age 65 for both genders emphasizes the necessity and importance of the study of mentioned indicators to evaluate the real society benefits from increasing life expectancy. Unlike other countries in Latvia life expectancy in recent years is calculated only for males and females, while information on the indicator by area and region is missing. Previous studies have shown that differences between Latvian regions in terms of life expectancy and healthy life expectancy exist. The current study aims to analyse regional differences and development trends of life expectancy and healthy life expectancy at age 65 for both genders based on activity limitations and chronic morbidity in Latvia during 2006-2014 as well as to identify Latvia's regions with the best and worst life expectancy and healthy life expectancy indicator values.","[Dubkova, Natalja] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Dubkova, N (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",natalja.dubkova@inbox.lv,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,189,195,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200016,0

This is a global phenomenon. Since the 1980s, changes have been in the direction of the inclusion of knowledge dissemination and transfer and not only of development of human capital and knowledge creation. These changes in roles correspond with the evolution of economic growth theories from neo-classical theories to neo-Schumpeterian economic growth theories. The latter economic theories place emphasis on the importance of innovation and especially the impact of innovation systems on economic growth. Universities play an important role in these innovation systems and, in order to successfully contribute in the performance of an innovation system, universities should manage knowledge dissemination effectively. The performance of the South African innovation system needs to improve in order to address the high rates of poverty and unemployment. In this article South African universities are evaluated to determine how they have been changing to include the role of knowledge dissemination. The importance of this paper lies in the contribution to evolutionary economics literature on the changing role of universities in innovation systertis.

Out of the 250 questionnaires distributed, 179 were returned and analyzed. Being a categorical data, the study employed optimal scaling regression to measure the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

The study found that loan delinquency, undercapitalization and payment of utility bills were significant in measuring the inclusive growth initiative of the Central Bank of Nigeria. It therefore recommends among others that government should make policies that will increase the credit worthiness of the rural dwellers as well as encourage banks to support investment in the rural communities so as to equip the rural dwellers with the financial muscle to drive inclusive growth in Nigeria.","[Ehimare, Omankhanlen Alex; Babajide, A.

Research results revealed that experts in Baltics evaluate eWOM communication as a highly influential factor in consumers' decision where to buy and which brand to buy; they also acknowledged the eWOM ability to raise consumers' interest in some product. The research also discovered that significant barriers to advanced eWOM usage in Baltics are an availability of qualified specialists and investments needed.

The research method is based on construction of composite indicators describing national performance within five innovation capabilities in two periods: 1998-2000 and 2010-2012 as well as regression analysis in order to test the accuracy of the main findings. The study has allowed to arrive at a conclusion that CEECs have been able to catch up to highly developed European economies with respect to absorptive capacity related to the existence and use of technological infrastructure as well as participation in inward technology transfer in the form of FDI and capital goods imports. There is, however, a lingering performance gap in new knowledge and innovation creation capabilities and R&D effort. Continuation of this trend and lack of considerable improvement also in terms of absorptive capacity related to the quality of human resources might result in CEECs' permanent inability to catch up to their highly developed European counterparts.","[Kondratiuk-Nierodzinska, Monika] Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Syst, Ul Warszawska 63, PL-15062 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Kondratiuk-Nierodzinska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Syst, Ul Warszawska 63, PL-15062 Bialystok, Poland.",mkn@uwb.edu.pl,"Kondratiuk-Nierodzinska, Monika/S-5005-2018","Kondratiuk-Nierodzinska, Monika/0000-0001-8150-9711",,,,,41,16,16,3,24,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Historic district boundaries enable us to measure the external view effect of historic amenities, defined as the effect of a historic amenity on the price of other buildings through an improved view from the other buildings. We use a semiparametric regression-discontinuity approach to control for unobserved location characteristics and focus on houses constructed after 1970. It is shown that the (external) view effect of historic amenities is 3.5% of the house price. Rich households have a higher willingness to pay for a view on historic amenities and therefore sort themselves in historic districts, which contributes to an explanation for the substantial spatial income differences within cities.","[Koster, Hans R.

The reporting of FG250 MNCs was examined to determine if greenwashing was occurring or whether MNCs had committed to operating a green supply chain. A mixed methodology was used consisting of quantitative analysis of 25 MNC CSR/sustainability reports which were randomly selected from the FG250 listing. Qualitative analysis using content analysis was also conducted on the reports. Both methodologies concentrated on the sustainability reporting of the selected MNCs in regard to their supply chain. Findings were mixed as there were great variations among the MNCs in their level of sustainability reporting about their supply chains. Some MNCs did not report on the activities of their supply chain at all (20 %), the majority of the MNCs reported on their supply chain impacts at the value and goal level (48 %), while the rest reported at the management approach level (32 %). A majority of the sampled MNCs could be accused of greenwashing due to the lack of detailed quantitative information provided by the MNCs on the environmental impacts of their supply chain.","[Lewis, John Kennedy] Salve Regina Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Newport, RI 02840 USA",,"Lewis, JK (通讯作者)，Salve Regina Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Newport, RI 02840 USA.",lewisj@salve.edu,"Jimenez-Diaz, Alex Andres/JFS-8393-2023",,,,,,44,12,14,3,44,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,347,362,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_27,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900027,0

Consistent with the findings of a special edition of Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ), the research finds few examples of detailed reporting on biodiversity issues. This is despite the fact that South Africa has a well-established code of corporate governance, a long history of including non-financial information in corporate reports and is an advocate of the integrated reporting movement.

The paper adopts a critical-dialectic approach to expand the debate surrounding the possible limitations of strategic consensus elements on the long-term impact and outputs pursued by a public university. The context for the investigation is the Higher Education arena where recent protests on South African university campuses have affirmed the need to rethink strategic management practices at universities. The paper argues that strategic consensus is inextricably interwoven with organisational identify and should include ends consensus and means consensus, with an ultimate focus on the strategic priorities. Key stakeholders should agree on strategic actions to be taken in line with the strategic priorities, to ensure commitment and ultimately coordinated implementation.

Furthermore, different forms of social capital may have either a positive or negative effect on economic and social development. The current analysis examines how different cultural values can determine what type of social capital is present in a community. Using voting patterns in the United States the study demonstrates that liberal counties (the percent of the county that voted for Barack Obama) had different forms of social capital present than conservative counties (the percent of the county that voted for Mitt Romney). Liberal counties had significantly higher forms of sports and nonprofit organizations, while conservative counties had increased religious institutions.

Data collected from National Survey of Innovation (NSI) 2012 with 445 firms in Malaysia are used to test the related hypotheses. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to empirically assess the research model. Smart-PLS software was used to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement models and structural models. Among the innovation characteristics, we find that compatibility is the strongest driver in determinants of TI adoption. Among the TOE variables, technology contexts are the greater effect on the TI adoption.","[Ngisau, Noni; Ibrahim, Nurhani Aba] Sch Business Management, Campus Kota Samarahan, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia",,"Ngisau, N (通讯作者)，Sch Business Management, Campus Kota Samarahan, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia.",noni.ngisau@gmail.com; nurhani.ai@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,7,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,304,313,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400050,0

A growing body of medical literature documents a robust fact: women undergoing cesarean sections end up having less children. Unlike most of the medical literature, which assumes that this association is mostly working through a physiological channel, we investigate a possible channel linking c-section and subsequent fertility through differences in maternal behavior after a c-section. Using several national and cross-national demographic data sources, we find evidence that maternal choice is playing an important role in shaping the negative association between cesarean section and subsequent fertility. In particular, we show that women are more likely to engage in active contraception after a cesarean delivery and conclude that intentional avoidance of subsequent pregnancies after a c-section seems to be responsible for part of the negative association between c-sections and subsequent fertility.","[Norberg, Karen] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pantano, Juan] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Washington University (WUSTL),"Pantano, J (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1208, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",pantano@wustl.edu,,,Weidenbaum Center at Washington University in St. Louis,Weidenbaum Center at Washington University in St. Louis,"We thank Qi (Clare) Li for truly outstanding research assistance.

We study the cost impacts based on an unbalanced panel of thirty-nine contract areas between 1999 and 2011, using econometric techniques. We conclude that competitive tendering reduced costs by around 11 per cent. Importantly, this cost reduction was not associated with falling quality; quite the reverse. We thus conclude that the gradual exposure of rail maintenance to competitive tendering in Sweden has been a success.","[Odolinski, Kristofer] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Dept Transport Econ, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Smith, Andrew S.

Some characteristics of the rate of return time series (fat tails mainly) lead to the failure of certain widely used tests of symmetry. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possible skewness of the unconditional distribution of Polish stock or index returns using different types of tests. Four specific approaches are briefly reviewed and discussed for testing the skewness in the whole return distribution. Classical Jarque-Bera test, the adjusted Jarque-Bera test (taking fatter tails into consideration), the test based on the GARCH(1,1) model with the Pearson type IV conditional distribution and the test proposed by Peiro (2004) without any assumptions about the type of distribution (distribution free test for skewness for 2 subsamples) are used. In the empirical part of the paper, 282 Polish financial time series (stocks, indexes) are examined with the given tests. The results have proved that about 40% of the tested daily return distributions and about 18% of weekly return distributions are skewed, however, in many cases, the tests give different conclusions and the results are ambiguous.","[Piontek, Krzysztof] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Piontek, K (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",krzysztof.piontek@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,4,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Regression analysis showed a strong statistically significant correlation between the level of wages and pensions size in rayons of Tomsk region. The study of retirement income based on the panel data of Tomsk region reveals a statistically significant difference in average income level by territory. In particular, a significantly higher amount of retirement payments was found in the territories where large industrial production was located. At the same time, the analysis of income and pensions on rayons' level does not bring to light urban / rural differences, which are observed at the level of Russia. We suspect that differences for cities and villages in Tomsk region are more complex and such factors as salary level, mining of oil and gas, northern regional coefficient and wage rise for arduous working conditions might be helpful in explanation of these discrepancies.

There were selected indicator EVA as the one of modern performance indicator and 41 financial indicators which were grouped into seven groups and to detect interrelations correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used. Using the method of PCA, we identified two principal components, on which the performance of the enterprise depends. In terms of indicators, the performance depends mainly on the cost, efficiency and profitability, but what was not confirmed by us is high relationship on liquidity and property commitment, which could be due to the methodology for calculating the price for the equity using model CAPM.","[Sofrankova, Beata; Horvathova, Jarmila; Kiselakova, Dana; Matkova, Svetlana] Univ Presov, Presov, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Sofrankova, B (通讯作者)，Univ Presov, Presov, Slovakia.",beata.sofrankova@unipo.sk; jarmila.horvathova@unipo.sk; dana.kiselakova@unipo.sk; svetlana.matkova@unipo.sk,"Maťková, Svetlana/L-8879-2018; Horváthová, Jarmila/D-2360-2018; Sofrankova, Beata/F-6890-2017; Kiselakova, Dana/H-9007-2018","Horváthová, Jarmila/0000-0003-3388-8635; Sofrankova, Beata/0000-0001-9766-0467; Kiselakova, Dana/0000-0001-5662-5809",[VEGA 1/0791/16]; [APPV-15-0322],;,"This article is one of outputs of project VEGA 1/0791/16 Modern approaches to improving enterprise performance and competitiveness using the innovative model - Enterprise Performance Model to streamline Management Decision-Making Processes and project APPV-15-0322 Competitiveness, economic growth and firm survival.",,13,1,1,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,1336,1345,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700133,0

The lower the rate of economic effects based on their threshold value, the more efficient the R&D project is. The usefulness of the proposed method is assessed based on the example of a research unit conducting activities in the area of advanced research and development of technical solutions and their deployment in the field of electro-technical equipment and systems. The presented method of evaluation of R&D projects can be used in the initial assessment of the project, at the phase of preparation of the project concept when the research unit seeks to choose variants of implementation, as well as at various stages of project implementation (at R&D project checkpoints) when the research unit seeks to effectively manage the research process, deciding whether to continue or curtail research activities.","[Stawasz, Edward; Stos, Daniel] Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Stawasz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",stawasz@uni.lodz.pl; danstos@poczta.fm,,"Stawasz, Edward/0000-0003-4744-6096",,,,,21,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,263,279,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_16,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100016,0

The financial analysis indicators of an enterprise are to find already in the end of 19th century. This was facilitated by widespread of double entry accounting throughout the world, as well as the emergence of accountability forms, that are similar to the modern counterparts. The aim of the paper - to examine the emergence and formation of financial analysis as a science, starting from the end of the 19th century. The authors of the paper first of all will analyze the emergence of financial analysis, based on the different papers of the best financial analysis researchers from all over the world. The authors will briefly review different points of view on the origins of the financial analysis, according to academics. In the paper are analyzed first financial analysis schools from the second part of 19th century and from the beginning of the 20th century, where the major scientific figures of that time are marked. Next to the first financial analysis schools, the authors also examine the new financial analysis schools and their main achievements. In the paper the authors are using qualitative method, logically constructive method and empirical research method. Every author is defining the definition of financial analysis on its own way, depending on the extent of their needs. The authors of the paper analyzed five main financial analysis schools: Empirical Pragmatists School, Ratio Statisticians School, Multivariate Modellers School, Balance studies, Commercial calculation. Based on the background of the above mentioned schools, the authors analyze the modern stage - the beginning of 20th-21st century, where the authors of the paper take six major financial analysis schools as a basis, they are: Distress Predictors School, Capital Marketers School, Pragmatic Empiricism, Deductive Approach, Inductive Approach, Confirmatory Approach.","[Tissen, Maria; Shneidere, Ruta] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Tissen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",maria@katiss.lv,,,,,,,35,0,0,1,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,831,844,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200071,0

Thus, we will use Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat)'s cross-sectional data set of income and living conditions of the households which are published since 2006 and the study will use 2010 data to constitute a statistically significant measure. One of the main advantages of this measure is not to identify an arbitrary poverty threshold for being poor or non-poor, instead, concentrates at their similarities with respect to their scores on various dimensions. Initial analyses show that housing indicators are one of the most important dimensions on multidimensional poverty and thus the households are generally more vulnerable when they are deprived on this dimension.","[Ugur, Mehmet Sedat] Cukurova Univ, Dept Econ, Adana, Turkey",Cukurova University,"Ugur, MS (通讯作者)，Cukurova Univ, Dept Econ, Adana, Turkey.",sugur@cu.edu.tr,"Ugur, Mehmet Sedat/JBS-7371-2023","Ugur, Mehmet Sedat/0000-0002-2562-5299",,,,,53,2,2,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,12,19,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500002,0

J,"Blake, HJ",,,,"Blake, Holly Jacklyn",,,Marie Howland19th-Century Leader for Women's Economic Independence,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EQUAL-RIGHTS; MARKET; HEALTH; REFORM; WOMAN; WORK,"Marie Howland (1836-1921) was an important working-class figure in the early U.S. women's movement who mounted an inspired challenge to separate spheres and the prevailing domestic ideology. Well before Edward Bellamy and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, she called for domestic work to be respected, paid, and collectively organized. Howland made it her life's work to remove barriers to economic independence for women through the overhaul of social and economic institutions that posited the home as the center of female existence and exploited workers. She wanted women to have the economic freedom to marry for love, not economic necessity, leave a bad marriage, survive widowhood, or not marry at all. By delving into Howland's early years in rural New Hampshire and the Lowell textile mills, her close association with radical bohemians in New York City, and her later participation in experimental communities, the following treatise provides a long overdue, comprehensive account of her life and work. My inquiry reveals how Marie Howland promoted women's freedom within a class analysis, rejecting Marxism and embracing the utopian socialist theory of Charles Fourier. It also offers an in-depth look at her popular utopian novel, Papa's Own Girl, where a cooperative community of economically independent women and enlightened men replace the patriarchy and individual competitiveness of the emerging, but by no means entrenched, industrial order. In addition, my treatise focuses on Howland's efforts to put ideas into practice. Unwilling to limit her activism to intellectual discussions, she lived in a Fourierist household in New York City, a cooperative settlement in western Mexico, and the single-tax community of Fairhope, Alabama. She pushed the Grange and the International Workingman's Association to focus on women's issues. She also made sure that her personal relationships with men were based on free love and mutual respect, not economic necessity and legal contract. I also examine how Howland dedicated her life to changing gender and class relations, but made little effort to improve conditions for African Americans. Like many white reformers, she drew on popular scientific theories of biological difference to justify the unequal treatment of African Americans. Besides shedding light on important intellectual and social developments, like phrenology, free love, Fourierism, the Grange, and theosophy, this examination of Marie Howland reveals the complexities, possibilities, and limitations of the women's rights movement before the passage of the 19(th) Amendment.","[Blake, Holly Jacklyn] Univ Richmond, Westhampton Coll, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Blake, Holly Jacklyn] Univ Richmond, WILL Program, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Blake, Holly Jacklyn] Univ Richmond, Course Women Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Blake, Holly Jacklyn] Univ Richmond, Course Gender Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Blake, Holly Jacklyn] Univ Richmond, Course Sexual Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",University of Richmond; University of Richmond; University of Richmond; University of Richmond; University of Richmond,"Blake, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Westhampton Coll, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",,,,,,,,358,3,5,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Effects of Tort Reform for Fast Food,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OBESITY; IMPACT; CONSUMPTION,"After highly publicized lawsuits against McDonald's in 2002, 26 states adopted commonsense consumption acts (CCAs)-also known as cheeseburger bills-that greatly limit fast-food companies' liability for weight-related harms. We provide the first evidence of the effects of CCAs using plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of CCA adoption across states. In two-way fixed-effects models, we find that CCAs significantly increased self-reports of attempts to lose weight and consumption of fruits and vegetables among heavy individuals.

However, this is often detrimental to the resilience and added value of these projects. This article uses the concept of strategic capacity for analyzing the decision-making process on mega projects. This concept consists of three elements: strategic ambiguity (the tension between different purposes and goals), redundancy (having more options than necessary from an efficiency perspective) and resilience (is the process reactively or proactively resilient to outside demands?). Two transport mega projects in the Netherlands are analyzed. Our analysis demonstrates that creative solutions and added value are to be found in the recombination of policy options made possible by enhancing strategic capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It presents a qualitative analysis of the calculative models and techniques that are promoted by financial trading schools, service firms and books. Broadly, the popularization of trading in this field involves a focus on technical analysis' (TA) and relies upon a socio-psychological reading of financial charts. Incorporating explicitly non-economic ideas into traders' calculative logic - including an emic notion of performativity' - popular TA constitutes an attempt to reverse' the making of markets: to calculatively trace price formations back to the minds, hearts and arrangement from which they had allegedly sprung as a means of foreseeing their future shape before it fully materializes. Tying the psyche and the market in a calculative loop, popular TA transcends existing social theories of financial calculation.

While competition is encouraged among petrol stations on free motorways, the regulations for toll motorways allow private concessionaires to auction all petrol stations to the same provider, thereby limiting competition and consolidating market power. This paper reports how this regulatory asymmetry results in higher prices and fewer stations. Specifically, we empirically show that competition is constrained on toll motorways by the granting of geographical monopolies. The lack of competition would seem to account for the price differential between toll and free motorways.","[Albalate, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Grp Recerca Govern & Mercats GiM, IREA, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Perdiguero, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Grp Recerca Econ Aplicada GREAP, IREA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Albalate, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Grp Recerca Govern & Mercats GiM, IREA, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",albalate@ub.edu,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; Perdiguero, Jordi/K-8460-2017; Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589",,,,,29,3,3,0,7,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

In these countries, overall life satisfaction did not significantly decrease, but the disaster significantly increased environmental concerns among Germans. One underlying mechanism likely operated through the perceived risk of a similar meltdown of domestic reactors. After Fukushima, more Germans considered themselves as very risk averse. However, drastic German policy action shut down the oldest reactors, implemented the phaseout of the remaining ones, and proclaimed the transition to renewables. This shift in energy policy contributed to the subsequent decrease in environmental concerns, particularly among women, Green party supporters, and people living in close distance to the oldest reactors. In Germany, political support for the Greens increased significantly, whereas in Switzerland and the UK, this increase was limited to people living close to reactors.","[Goebel, Jan; Krekel, Christian; Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] DIW Berlin German Inst Econ Res, German Socioecon Panel SOEP, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Tiefenbach, Tim] German Inst Japanese Studies DIJ Tokyo, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020094, Japan; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] Cornell Univ, PAM, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Cornell University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Ziebarth, NR (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin German Inst Econ Res, German Socioecon Panel SOEP, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",jgoebel@diw.de; ckrekel@diw.de; tiefenbach@dijtokyo.org; nrz2@cornell.edu,"Krekel, Christian/AFL-1370-2022; Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/A-2812-2012; Tiefenbach, Tim/H-3770-2019","Krekel, Christian/0000-0001-5960-3891; Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/0000-0003-3562-2371; Goebel, Jan/0000-0002-3243-1935",,,,,105,48,55,3,90,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This article estimates the short- and long-term impact of the US FAA downgrade of the Philippine civil aviation system in 2008 and the EU ban of Philippine carriers in 2010 on tourist expenditures, arrivals, and length of stay using monthly time series data. The econometric model, consisting of three equations due to the endogeneity of the tourist arrivals and length of stay variables in the tourist expenditures equation, is estimated simultaneously using the generalized method of moments. The results indicate that the US FAA downgrade and the EU ban impact monthly tourist receipts negatively in the short term while the downgrade also impacts tourist expenditures in the long term. Moreover, the ban impacts length of stay negatively in the short and long term while the downgrade impacts length of stay negatively only in the long term. The substantial decline in tourism receipts from 2008 to 2010 despite an increasing trend in tourist arrivals is due to the shorter stay of tourists, indicating that high-spending tourists have not returned following the downgrade and ban.

For these countries, we compare estimates of two diffusion models: the Bass model and the Bemmaor model. We find evidence of network externalities in MSN adoption for all of these countries, captured by the left skew of the cumulative adoption curves.

Since October 15, 2010 electronic tolls have been collected in three concessions and since December 8, 2011 electronic tolls have been collected in four other concessions, as well as in a segment of another motorway (A23). The experience of collecting tolls in SCUTs is interesting for the debate in the specialized literature. First, SCUT users may respond in different ways to the imposed collection of tolls compared to planned toll motorways. Second, because SCUTs were not prepared for the installation of toll plazas, vehicles using these motorways in Portugal need an electronic device for automatic payment (transponder). If the vehicles have no transponder, drivers have to pay the tolls in pay-shops or in post offices, incurring in an additional cost because of the time and effort involved. Moreover, less frequent users of SCUTs may have insufficient incentive to install transponders, and therefore they avoid the use of motorways with electronic tolls. In this paper we evaluate to what degree the toll component of price elasticity in travel demand is higher on motorways initially projected and operated as toll-free than on motorways initially projected and operated as toll turnpikes. For this purpose we analyse the case of the A28 motorway (concession Norte Litoral) connecting the cities of Porto and Viana do Castelo in north-west continental Portugal.","[Ferreira, Sara] Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, City Management, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Costa, Josa da Silva] Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Ferreira, S (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, City Management, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",jcosta@fep.up.pt,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,21,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The construction of many of these lines, which run in parallel to conventional railways, has significantly reduced the commute time between interconnected cities. Moreover, deployment of the HSR network has freed capacity of the low-speed tracks, which have absorbed most of the freight railway traffic. Therefore, HSR infrastructure represents an advantage for exporting companies, which benefit from higher slot availability and greater efficiency in terms of railway freight management. This empirical paper uses the gravity equation to analyse the impact of HSR on international trade with a dataset of 119 countries during the period 1960-2012. The estimation results suggest an overall positive but moderate impact of HSR on international trade.

With large numbers of observations for calibrating ensembles, relatively small numbers of component forecasts, and low rates of missingness, the standard approach to calibrating forecasting ensembles introduced by Raftery et al.

In these circumstances, EBMA models may miss-weight components, undermining the advantages of the ensemble approach to prediction. In this article, we explore these issues and introduce a wisdom of the crowds parameter to the standard EBMA framework, which improves its performance.

Evidence from Sweden,JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Immigrants; Inventors; Children; Adults,KNOWLEDGE FLOWS; WELFARE-STATE; IMMIGRATION; DETERMINANTS; SCIENTISTS; INNOVATION; MIGRATION; CITATIONS; DIVERSITY; SELECTION,"Using a new database that matches patent applications by Swedish residents with demographic information from 1985 to 2007, we examine differences in inventive performance by individuals of foreign and domestic origins, in terms of quantity (probability of patenting, total number of patents per inventor) and quality (forward citations, probability of grant) of patents. We further compare adult and child immigrants with their Swedish-born counterparts. Holding other variables constant, we find that the immigrants are generally less likely to patent than the Swedish-born. Nonetheless, the general group of immigrant inventors, including those who migrated as adults, performs as well as the native inventors and therefore seems more positively selected. Compared with the Swedish-born, the immigrants who migrated as children are disadvantaged in both quantity and quality of patents, which may be linked to a lack of Sweden-specific human capital. Whether education was received in Sweden does not seem to make a difference for the immigrants who migrated as adults. In summary, this study provides an initial impression of the inventive performance, contribution and challenges of distinct groups of immigrants who have differing characteristics and backgrounds.","[Zheng, Yannu] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, CIRCLE, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Ejermo, Olof] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Zheng, YN (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, CIRCLE, POB 117, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",yannu.zheng@circle.lu.se; olof.ejermo@circle.lu.se,"Ejermo, Olof/K-7293-2012",,Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) [85958435056]; Swedish Research Council [421-2011-2068],Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA)(Vinnova); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

For a panel of OECD countries, we estimate a production function incorporating as additional inputs a measure of transport infrastructures and the levels of CO2 emitted by the various means of transport to proxy for the use of the environment. Using a GMM estimate and a translogarithmic function the output-elasticity of aggregate transport infrastructures is negative, whereas the elasticity takes a positive and significant value with regard to the use of the environment. By types of infrastructures, most of the elasticities are not significant, suggesting that transport infrastructures do not generate economic growth directly, but do so indirectly by a higher consumption of the environment.","[Cantos Sanchez, Pedro; Gumbau Albert, Mercedes] Univ Valencia, Dept Analisis Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Sánchez, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Analisis Econ, Campus Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",pedro.cantos@uv.es,"Cantos-Sanchez, Pedro/E-6396-2016","Cantos-Sanchez, Pedro/0000-0002-5685-9573","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-43959-, ECO2013-45045-R]",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad under the projects ECO2013-43959-and ECO2013-45045-R.,,45,6,6,1,25,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This poses a challenge for the appraisal of transport infrastructure projects. The current paper addresses this challenge by elaborating on a concept that considers the issue of risk by transport infrastructure evaluation concepts, on the basis of already applied methodologies. The paper begins by substantiating the pattern of 'risk' in transport infrastructure planning. Subsequently, five basic methodologies that incorporate the issue of risk in transport project appraisal are briefly presented: sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Quantified Optimism Bias and qualitative approaches. For each methodology, real-world applications of infrastructure appraisal in individual countries, regions or supranational organizations are presented. After providing a synoptic overview of these methodologies, a concept is presented that reflects the occurrence of risk in the assessment of transport infrastructure projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we empirically examine how judges differ in their view of the relevant law to a case. We create a unique dataset looking at the universe of published opinions in federal appellate court cases from the United States between 2001 and 2005 that include a dissenting opinion. We find that judges who disagree on the outcome of a case disagree as to which binding precedents apply. Authoring judges gravitate toward precedents that are ideologically similar to their own preferences. Precedents cited only by the majority are strongly ideologically correlated with the majority author's preferences; precedents cited only by the dissenting judge are ideologically similar to her preferences. Precedents cited by both the majority and dissent (i.e., precedent that both judges agree are relevant to the case before them) are not ideologically correlated with either judge. Our findings provide strong evidence that judicial differences over case outcomes do not reflect judges' divergent interpretations of the same precedent, but gravitation towards largely different precedent.

Moreover, nonbinding law can also have a liberating effect, enabling some leaders to take action when they otherwise would have done nothing. In addition, we illustrate how voters may face a trade-off between the legal standard that induces optimal behavior of the current leader (i.e., that most effectively addresses the moral hazard problem) and the legal standard that optimizes selection of future leaders (i.e., that most effectively addresses the adverse selection problem).

Interviews conducted in Stockholm and Copenhagen showed that the organisation of the departments affects the social relations between the planners and creates power relations that either foster or marginalise cycling within planning processes. In Copenhagen, an integrated planning organisation allows for more knowledge exchange between urban, transport, and bicycle planners and creates an environment of understanding for different professional views on planning. However, this is not the case in Stockholm where cycling is marginalised in planning and in the existing infrastructure. This study concludes that the integrated transport and urban planning organisation in Copenhagen promotes cycling more than the less integrated planning organisation in Stockholm. Furthermore, it is concluded that the different organisations have led to different power relations that shape the outcome of the planning processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The second suggests that Malthusian concerns have an enduring presence in recent and contemporary politics. In them we find a government of life that tethers the question of poverty to that of population, as both a national and international concern, links biopolitics to questions of national security and is a key source of the modern environmental movement. It remains present in areas such as welfare reform and immigration policy, notions of sustainability and in the global public health and environmental movements.

Since accessibility and connectivity are major determinants of international transport costs, the analysis of their main ports' connectivity is crucial for keeping costs under control. Since different port authorities manage the major ports of the Canary Islands, they could be tempted to compete for transshipment cargoes, instead of working together to facilitate supply chain integration that would increase their competitive standing. The aim of the paper is twofold. First, the infrastructure and superstructure endowment of the main Canarian ports and their accessibility, by evaluating site and situation factors, is documented. Secondly, the connectivity of the main Canarian ports is assessed by means of graph theory. This provides important measures that define a port's competitiveness, and its potential to achieve or keep regional or global hub status, and also to follow its evolution. A brief review of papers measuring port connectivity based on graph theory is included to illustrate the current approaches in port network analysis, and to justify our methodological framework. A sub-network of 53 ports directly related with Las Palmas and Tenerife ports has been selected for this purpose. Our findings are mainly related to the connections among the nodes in the sample network, and to the position that the targeted ports hold. Additionally, some policy recommendations, regarding how to improve the connectivity and competitiveness of the Canarian ports, are also enumerated. Previous analysis indicates that, at present, the Las Palmas port is the only regional hub in the Canaries. Both Canarian port authorities should differentiate themselves by specializing in certain valued added services and increasing traffic in these services.

The first focuses on analysis of Slovak currency from the perspective of its usefulness for generating profits through time series control charts. The second involves regulation of financial flows for a heteroskedastic financial process by EWMA and ARIMA control charts. We use Box-Jenkins methodology to find models of time series of annual Argentinian Gross Domestic Product available as a basic index from 1951-1998. We demonstrate the versatility of control charts not only in manufacturing but also in managing financial stability of cash flows. Specifically, we show their sensitivity in detecting even small shifts in mean which may indicate financial instability.

For doing so, we present the induced probabilistic ordered weighted averaging (IPOWA) operator. It is an aggregation operator that unifies the probability with the OWA operator in the same formulation and considering the degree of importance of each concept in the aggregation. Moreover, it also uses induced aggregation operators that provide a more general representation of the attitudinal character of the decision-maker. We study its applicability and we see that it is very broad because all the previous studies that use the probability or the OWA operator can be revised and extended with this new approach. We briefly analyze some basic applications in statistics such as the implementation of this approach with the variance, the covariance, the Pearson coefficient and in a simple linear regression model. We focus on a multi-person decision-making problem in strategic management. Thus, we are able to construct a new aggregation operator that we call the multi-person IPOWA operator. Its main advantage is that it can deal with the opinion of several persons in the analysis so we can represent the information in a more complete way.","[Merigo, Jose M.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Business Adm, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Merigo, Jose M.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Barcelona; University of Manchester,"Merigó, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Business Adm, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jmerigo@ub.edu,"Merigó, José M./K-1500-2019","Merigó, José M./0000-0002-4672-6961",,,,,53,27,29,0,56,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Smart phone penetration has a 34% market share and, according to recent 'data, approximately 16 million smart phones entered the market in the first quarter of this year, which is a 53% increase compared to the same period in 2012. The latest moves in the telecommunications industry in Latin America point to consolidation and great potential for growth. This is why we decided to measure the efficiency of Latin American telecommunication services. By measuring efficiency we mean creating some sensible ordering that would order given companies from less to more efficient. We used data envelopment analysis, which is considered a powerful tool for measuring the efficiency of units. The methodology of data envelopment analysis (DEA), has traditionally been used to estimate the relative efficiency of a set of production units. We focused on joint stock companies, because they publish their income statement, balance sheet and cash flow information yearly. All this information was downloaded from Thompson Reuter's database. We created a two stage DEA model. The first measured the efficiency of asset allocation within the companies. The second measured the overall efficiency of the companies with the efficiency of asset allocation as an input. We measured such efficiencies and their changes for the period from 2008 to 2013. Eight Latin American companies and eight from other countries were analyzed (in total 96 observations). In this way we were able to compare the Latin American companies performance to other companies in the sector to determine which are the most efficient telecommunications companies in Latin America and how it might affect this position if we include in our analysis the index of Doing Business to see exactly if the business environment in the country could affect its effectiveness.","[Aramayo, Lourdes Gabriela Daza] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Soldatyuk, Nataliya; Odintsov, Kirill] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Aramayo, LGD (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Prague, Czech Republic.",lourdes.aramayo@vse.cz; nsoldatyuk@gmail.com; kodintsov@hotmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,7,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2659,2670,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700275,0

In the second section, the results and findings of the team pilot survey of family business, conducted by the Department of Business Economics and Management, EF, TUL, are presented. The aim of this survey was to identify perceptions, attitudes and evaluation of family business enterprises as such. Despite the low number of respondents it can be stated that family firms benefit from their names, which guarantee the quality of their products and services. Dependence analysis was performed, based on the logarithmic regression and chi-squared test, specifically through the association table. According to these analyses, the survey showed that in small localities family firms are considered as key employers. In terms of the traditional character of the core business weak dependence on the type of business (whether it is family or non-family type) was reflected, where more non-family firms operate in traditional industries in the region. However, the result could have been influenced by the low number of respondents. It is necessary to continue to investigate this type of business, in order to identify relevant data, on the basis of which institutional support for the development of family firms could come forward. It could then help, especially in municipalities with smaller population, to reduce disparities in the regions concerned and create new jobs for these disparities (reduce the often higher unemployment) in connection with the elimination of social benefits payment and encourage consumption in the municipality.","[Frankova, Zuzana; Jac, Ivan] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Franková, Z (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",zuzana.frankova@tul.cz; ivan.jac@tul.cz,"Jáč, Ivan/AHB-3088-2022; Horčičková, Zuzana/U-5036-2017","Jáč, Ivan/0000-0003-4759-2990; Horčičková, Zuzana/0000-0001-7711-9999",,,,,10,0,0,1,9,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,47,55,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000005,0

The additional measure analyses the volatility spill-over effects among stocks within the same portfolio. Using intraday stock returns from five top-40 listed stocks on the JSE between July 2008 and April 2010, volatility spill-over effects were estimated with a residual-based test (aggregate shock [AS] model) framework. It is shown that when a particular stock attracted fewer volatility spill-over effects from the other stocks in the portfolio, the overall portfolio volatility decreased as well. In most cases market beta showcased similar results. Therefore, in order to construct a more efficient risk-adjusted portfolio, one requires both a portfolio that has a unit correlation with the market (beta-based), and stocks that showcase the least amount of volatility spill-over effects amongst one another. These results might assist portfolio managers to construct lower mean variance portfolios.","[Heymans, Andre; Brewer, Wayne Peter] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Heymans, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.",,"Heymans, André/W-7520-2019","Heymans, André/0000-0003-3879-6887",,,,,40,1,4,0,9,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This paper compares different approaches to measure NIC, reveals related problems and provides possible explanations accordingly. The findings of the paper show that there is a big gap between academic research and policy makers. Four major directions of explanations to bridge this gap are highlighted in the paper: (1) poor awareness of IC concept among policy makers, (2) methodology related issues, (3) changing leadership profile and (4) collaboration related issues. The insights to possible solutions are also presented. They reveal the need to research different countries regarding their NIC policy.

Focusing on four basic cable network segments-the outdoor, cartoon, movie, and Comcast affiliated networks-this study finds that vertical integration has reduced program availability for cable subscribers by increasing their access to integrated networks and by limiting their access to unaffiliated networks. It also finds that an increase in the regional concentration of cable systems positively affects the availability of overall basic cable networks, regardless of vertical ownership. An increase in regional concentration is also associated with a decrease in the effects of vertical integration, suggesting that system efficiency through regional concentration may mitigate the vertical integration effect.","[Ji, Sung Wook] So Illinois Univ, Dept Radio Televis & Digital Media, Commun Bldg Mail Code 6609,1100 Lincoln Dr,Room 2, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Ji, SW (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Radio Televis & Digital Media, Commun Bldg Mail Code 6609,1100 Lincoln Dr,Room 2, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",jisw@siu.edu,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

South African exchange rates, in particular, have a significant impact on imports, inflation, consumer prices and monetary policies. Consequently, it is imperative for economists and investors to assess accurately the associated exchange risks. Exchange rates, like most financial time series, are leptokurtic and contradict the classical Gaussian assumption. We therefore introduce subclasses of the generalised hyperbolic distribution as alternative models and contrast these with the normal distribution. We conclude that the variance-gamma model is the most robust for describing the log-returns of daily USD/ZAR exchange rates and their related Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimates. The model selection methodologies utilised in our analyses include the robust Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Akaike information criterion. Backtesting on the adequacy of VaR estimates is also performed using the Kupiec likelihood ratio test.","[Kemda, Lionel Establet; Chinhamu, Knowledge] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Huang, Chun-Kai] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Cape Town,"Kemda, LE (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Durban, South Africa.",,"kemda, Lionel/GRR-9473-2022; CHINHAMU/N-5325-2019; Huang, Chun-Kai/ABG-2286-2021","CHINHAMU/0000-0003-4296-7677; Huang, Chun-Kai/0000-0002-9656-5932; Kemda, Lionel Establet/0000-0002-7350-1960",,,,,26,3,3,1,11,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The third and fourth generations of PL products provide a very favorable price/value ratio, which is very important for the price sensitive Hungarian consumers. The increasing ratio of PL products urges the suppliers to take part in this business. According to the interviewed Hungarian food processors, the most important advantages of production of PL products are capacity utilization, calculable income and the large production volume.

The authors developed and tested a model for predicting the future use of management tools based on the current use of tools by employees in organizations, underlying assumptions of the theory of planned behavior and the information-perception-behavior link. Descriptive statistics suggest that there are differences in management tools use patterns among Slovenian and Croatian employees. Among the most used tools, employees in both countries significantly and differently use (especially) outsourcing, mission and vision statements, knowledge management, total quality management, and customer segmentation. Using structural equation modeling for testing the proposed relations in the developed model on samples of Slovenian and Croatian employees reveals that the current use of tools plays an important role in predicting the future use of tools in Slovenian organizations, while linkages for the Croatian sample are rather insignificant. More specifically, the current use of management tools has a positive influence on the future use of management tools, while the impact of the current percentage of satisfied users with management tools is very weak. Further, a comparison of results with international data reveals differences in the patterns of management tools use between former catching up countries (studied are two former transition economies) and economies with a longer tradition in the market economy. Based on the current state of management tools use, linkages between their current and future use, and patterns of tools use in high-developed economies, the authors speculate about the future pattern of management tools use in catching up countries based on experiences from high-developed market economies. Those assumptions represent a building block for boosting the use of management tools in organizations in catching up economies, and thus helping those organizations to reduce the gap between them and most developed organizations.","[Nedelko, Ziatko; Potocan, Vojko] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Org, Maribor, Slovenia; [Dabic, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ, Dept Int Econ, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Maribor; University of Zagreb,"Nedelko, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Org, Maribor, Slovenia.",zlatko.nedelko@uni-mb.si; vojko.potocan@uni-mb.si; mdabic@efzg.hr,"Dabic, Marina/E-6728-2014; Dabic, Marina/L-9040-2019","Dabic, Marina/0000-0001-8374-9719; Nedelko, Zlatko/0000-0002-6840-877X",,,,,62,11,13,1,33,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This research aims at understanding why consumers engage in OBCs of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs), which are traditionally considered a low involvement and low risk category of products. A multi-method approach-using nethnography and in-depth interviews-was chosen to collect primary data from German consumers taking part in four selected OBCs. Findings show that key motivational drivers appear to be brand related, as the emotional engagement triggers not only the initial stimulus to enrol, but also to actively participate, and social drivers, like expected benefits, identified in terms of interaction with the brand and a specific product and in terms of interaction within the community. Findings support existing research on OBCs, suggesting that motivations to participate in FMCG online communities have commonalities with some studies conducted in different contexts.

This is particularly a case for some vulnerable groups who in search for an employment are facing serious problems. The aim of this paper is to focus on the current situation of disadvantaged groups on the labour market of the Slovak Republic from the point of view of managers of selected organisations. By the method of questionnaire survey of the managers we were examining their attitudes towards selected disadvantaged groups on the labour market. Furthermore we examined the motives of the managers in relation to the employment of selected candidates pointing to the discriminatory or nondiscriminatory behaviour of managers on the Slovak labour market. In our research we also focus on the evolution of the labour market in terms of disadvantaged groups in order to identify whether any change of the situation of selected groups of participants on the labour market occurred. The purpose of our analysis also is to verify whether managers discriminate selected groups of participants on the labour market intentionally and whether there exists any shift in the perception of these groups by the managers. In order to fulfil this objective we conducted a questionnaire survey focused on selected managers of organisations, in two reference periods: 2008 and 2014. The target group of the survey was composed of both public and private companies that carry out their activities on the territory of the Slovak Republic during the period of conducting the research.","[Pawera, Rene; Pazderova, Vladimira] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ & Finance, Bratislava 81806, Slovakia; [Suplata, Marian] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava; Matej Bel University,"Pawera, R (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ & Finance, Bratislava 81806, Slovakia.",Rene.Pawera@fm.uniba.sk; Vladimira.Stefancova@fm.uniba.sk; Marian.Suplata@umb.sk,"Suplata, M./AAD-7354-2022; Šuplata, Marian/AAG-4464-2019; Pawera, Rene/C-2894-2016","Pawera, Rene/0000-0003-0700-8243",,,,,21,0,0,0,14,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Despite of the European Union efforts to reduce disparities continuously between regions, there are still significant differences between them.

The sector specialization could show how large the share of the people works in specific area is. For this paper will be main sector specialization in health and social care because this area related with social disparities. The sector's specialization could be determined by a localization quotient. Authors assume that in region where the support is higher, the specialization in this sector will be higher than in other regions, because more finance to social sphere should create more workplace in this sector.

Concepts, statements and conceptual frameworks were used as structure to analyse the body of scientific knowledge. After consulting 31 major research databases using the systematic literature review methodology, only seven journals articles that examined the link between leadership, innovation and organisational performance were identified. The synthesis of the journal articles revealed (a) that consensus exists among researchers as far as the relevant concepts are concerned; (b) that most agree on the definition of leadership and innovation but that a uniform understanding of what constitutes organisational performance is lacking; and (c) that conceptual models are too simplistic and do not consider mediator variables or multiple financial criteria measures. The findings further reveal that innovation is significantly and positively related to superior organisational performance, and that, although transformational leadership style is significantly and positively related to innovation, transactional leadership style is more appropriate when the aim is to instil a culture of innovation. Transformational leadership style, by contrast, is mostly associated with organisational performance. In addition, the findings further reveal that none of the studies investigate the mediating effect of the nature of innovation (incremental and radical) on the relationship between leadership and organisational performance, and that none of the studies use the objective measures of financial performance such as ROA, ROE, price/earnings (P/E) and Tobin's Q calculated from annual financial reports.","[Sethibe, Tebogo; Steyn, Renier] Univ S Africa, Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Sethibe, T (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Steyn, Renier/M-4675-2017; Steyn, Renier/ABA-2208-2020","Steyn, Renier/0000-0002-2446-3662; Steyn, Renier/0000-0002-2446-3662",,,,,41,23,36,14,134,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Finally, we use the same methodology to determine whether the Fed's forecasts of GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment, taken together, present an accurate overall view of the economic situation, and compare the Fed's forecasts to those of the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

The fact that purely choice elasticities are conditional on a fixed number of trips is used to build the trip generation part of total travel demand. The generation elasticity for all modes in the group is the difference between ordinary and choice elasticities. Demand elasticities incorporate 'pure substitution' and 'money expenditure' effects, relating conditional demand to ordinary demand. Choice elasticities replace conditional demand elasticities and a correction compensates for the choice estimation method. The result obviates the error of treating choice elasticities as market demand elasticities.","[Smith, Brett W.] Univ Western Australia, Business Sch M261, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Smith, BW (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Business Sch M261, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",brett.smith@uwa.edu.au; john.taplin@uwa.edu.au,,"Smith, Brett/0000-0002-3053-5941; John, Taplin/0000-0002-7218-1950",,,,,56,1,1,1,13,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

The noosphere continually manifests through the geosphere and biosphere in the form of human interventions in these, and is visibly represented by the physical and economic development of the Earth. One of the many phenomena which may be used to characterize the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is the rapid change which occurred in retail trade relations in various parts of the country. The common feature of these changes was the flow of retail business from small towns to large cities. However, no general analytical laws were known to describe the rise and distribution of this flow of retail business in space and time. From 1927-1930 W. J. Reilly conducted a nationwide study of retail dynamics. One of the findings of this study was the scalar law of retail gravitation. This law of Reilly considered the unidirectional flow of retail trade from small towns to cities. The reverse flow of retail trade from large cities to small towns was not considered because at the time it was far less significant compared to the flow of retail trade from small towns to large cities. Reilly's scalar one-dimensional model of retail gravitation is generalized in the three-dimensional vector model of retail gravitation for the geoid. The scalar potential of retail gravitation is introduced along with the vector of an intensity of retail gravitation.","[Zeithamer, Tomas] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic; [Zeithamer, Tomas] IIPESP, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zeithamer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic.",zeithamer.tomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,4,4,0,6,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,199,203,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800033,0

Consequently, well-intentioned policies can lead to overall counter-productive effects by licensing people to behave badly in related behaviors. On the other side, motivational crowding theory argues that constraining people to adopt a desirable behavior can backfire. We use of a classroom experiment to test whether a regulatory framework to incentivize individuals to adopt pro-environmental behavior generate similar spillovers in terms of licensing effect than a non-regulatory framework. We show that the way the good deed is caused doesn't seem to influence the licensing effect. Nevertheless, we found that business- and environmental-orientated majors react adversely to the regulatory framework. We show that environmental-orientated students exhibit higher intrinsically motivations than business-orientated ones. Accordingly, we suggest that the licensing effect is more likely to arise when the preceding 'virtuous' act is freely chosen (respectively regulatory caused) for non-intrinsically (respectively intrinsically) motivated individuals.","[Clot, Sophie] ENSAM, UMR 1135, LAMETA, 2 Pl Pierre Viala,Bat 26, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France; [Grolleau, Gilles] ENSAM, LAMETA, UMR 1135, Burgundy Sch Business,LESSAC, Montpellier, France; [Ibanez, Lisette] INRA, LAMETA, UMR 1135, Montpellier, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Clot, S (通讯作者)，ENSAM, UMR 1135, LAMETA, 2 Pl Pierre Viala,Bat 26, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.",clot@supagro.inra.fr; grolleau@supagro.inra.fr; ibanez@supagro.inra.fr,,,,,,,48,34,35,3,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Data is examined from 4400 fixed guideway transit stations across the United States. We use a multiple-level model to account for variables at both the regional level and the neighborhood level. This is one of the first studies to include a variable that measures the network accessibility of jobs and population within walking distance of the transit network. Significant variables in predicting the mode share for transit commuting at the neighborhood level include income, population and jobs intensity, nonwhite status, transit type, jobs-population balance, walkability, and transit service frequency. However, the strongest predictor was the regional network accessibility variable. The results of this study support policies that promote transit oriented development (TOD) at both the neighborhood and regional scales. The findings of this study should guide planners and policymakers to encourage dense, mixed-use development with high-quality walking environments near transit stations to boost the mode share of transit commuting.

Theory gives little guidance because possibly positive effects from larger school size can be offset by negative effects from reduced choice and competition. We investigate these issues empirically by analyzing the effects on students' achievement of a consolidation reform that took place in Dutch primary education in the mid1990s. The reform was implemented by increasing the minimum required school size, leading to an increase in actual school size and a reduction in the number of schools. For identification, we exploit variation between municipalities. We find that an increase in the minimum required school size of 10% has a small positive effect on student achievement of 0.72% of a standard deviation. Further analysis indicates that this effect can be mainly attributed to the increase in actual school size; reduced competition and choice do not seem to have harmed student achievement.

Some performance areas lend themselves well to operationalization while others do not. One area that has received comparatively little study is the assessment of a plan's impacts on environmental justice and social equity. Although research on regional planning usually emphasizes larger metropolitan areas and agencies, these issues are especially relevant in smaller regions where planners lack the capacity for innovation and careful analysis. Further, the transit services on which disadvantaged populations depend are often lacking or non-existent in less-populated regions. Understanding how planners in these locations undertake social equity-related analyses and providing suggestions for improvement is thus an important endeavor. While prior work has assessed whether, and to what extent, equity objectives are included in plans, there are few detailed investigations of the key analytical choices that shape equity outcomes. This paper fills this important research gap, providing such an analysis of existing practice in a largely rural region in California, the San Joaquin Valley, as well as recommendations for future analyses aimed at improving the consistency between equity analyses and the real-world impacts of transportation plans.

This analysis is particularly relevant in understanding why young firms may be more or less successful in their application for public subsidies. Using data from an extensive database of 19,236 firms in Catalonia, we estimate a maximum likelihood probit model with sample selection. Our results show that firm age does not exert a significant direct impact on the application propensity in R&D public call, but younger firms tend to show a larger propensity to receive an R&D subsidy. They also show that firm age exerts a moderating role through different internal resources. They highlight the need to design R&D public policies that explicitly favour applications by young firms to help overcome their obstacles to innovation.","[Segarra-Blasco, Agusti; Teruel, Mercedes] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Res Grp Ind & Terr, CREIP, Reus, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Teruel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Res Grp Ind & Terr, CREIP, Reus, Spain.",mercedes.teruel@urv.cat,"Teruel, Mercedes/K-1355-2017","Teruel, Mercedes/0000-0002-4104-7679; Segarra, Agusti/0000-0001-6316-3171",Consolidated Group of Research [2014-SGR-1395]; Xarxa de Referencia en Economia Aplicada (XREAP),Consolidated Group of Research; Xarxa de Referencia en Economia Aplicada (XREAP),This work was financially supported by the Consolidated Group of Research [grant number 2014-SGR-1395]; Xarxa de Referencia en Economia Aplicada (XREAP).,,49,15,15,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The correct application of these optimization methods requires a knowledge of how and when these techniques will yield beneficial outcomes. We highlight the need for future research to focus on appropriate protocols and a systematic approach to model selection when computer intelligence optimization methods are being utilized, particularly within the realm of financial forecasting.

An exploratory analysis of pedestrian perceptions and attitudes,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pedestrian attitudes; Bicycles; Shared space; Random parameters ordered probit,SERVICE; CHOICE; LEVEL,"Bicycling and walking are gaining popularity for both commuting and recreation. However, when faced with limited right-of-way width, many transportation agencies find it impractical to designate separate space for bicyclists in urban roadway corridors, instead devoting their limited funds to other projects. As a result, some bicyclists - feeling threatened by motor vehicles - use sidewalks for at least part of their trip. Laws governing bicyclist use of sidewalks are not consistently enforced in various cities and countries. Pedestrian-bicycle shared space has rarely been studied from a pedestrian's perspective in an urban context. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the factors that influence pedestrian attitudes toward sharing a sidewalk with bicyclists can be useful in evaluating shared space strategies and guiding investments in bicycle facilities. Using the responses of 114 persons to 15 carefully constructed 60-s video clips of urban sidewalks in four Chinese cities, this study characterizes pedestrian attitudes regarding sharing sidewalks with bicycles under different sidewalk configurations. By estimating a random parameters ordered probability model (to account for unobserved heterogeneity across respondents), we found pedestrians who wanted a safe distance greater than 1.5 meters were more likely to possess a less tolerant attitude. Attitudes of pedestrians toward bicyclists on sidewalks also depend on the presence or absence of dedicated bicycle facilities. The effects of other significant factors are also quantified in this paper. Implications for policy makers in evaluating shared-space strategy can be drawn from this empirical study.

Currently there is a process of transit formalization taking place in Latin American cities that is changing the publicness of their systems. This paper identifies four publicness types- public space, public goods, public ownership, and public concern and discusses the implications of transit projects in Santiago, Bogota, Quito, and Mexico City on all four. While the impacts are not heterogeneous, governments are recognizing transit as a public good and introducing public funding and public ownership of Bus Rapid Transit and other infrastructure. These changes have the potential to strengthen public transit's role as public space and are increasing transit as an issue of public concern, but there has been little formalization of public participation in the process. Public transit is now a three way relationship between private operators, government agencies, and the community, but most of the focus in this new arrangement has been on the contracts between the operators and government and less attention has been paid to the relationship with the public.

The empirical model considers how the relationship between FDI and Trade determine whether type of FDI into SEE-5 and EU-NMS-10 from core OECD-20 countries, is vertical or horizontal. With regard to the relationship between exports and FDI, the findings of the research showed mixed evidence, thus supporting vertical FDI for EU-NMS-10 countries, and horizontal FDI for SEE-5 countries. On the other hand, based on the relationship between imports and FDI, the results of the research supported vertical FDI for both EU-NMS-10 and SEE-5 group of countries.

Offshoring is modeled as international transfer of management practices and production techniques that allow Northern firms to design and implement performance compensation contracts. Performance-pay contracts address moral hazard issues stemming from production uncertainty and unobserved worker effort. We find that worker effort augments productivity and compensation of those workers assigned to more offshorable tasks. An increase in worker effort in the South, caused by a decline in offshoring costs, an increase in worker skill, or a decline in production uncertainty in the South, increases the range of offshored tasks and makes workers in the North and South better off. An increase in Southern labor force increases the range of offshored tasks, benefits workers in the North, and hurts workers in the South. International labor migration from low-wage South to high-wage North shrinks the range of offshored tasks, makes Northern workers worse off and Southern workers (emigrants and those left behind) better off. Higher worker effort in the North, caused by higher worker skills or lower degree of production uncertainty, decreases the range of offshored tasks and benefits workers in the North and South.","[Dinopoulos, Elias] Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Tsoulouhas, Theofanis] Univ Calif Merced, Ernest & Julio Gallo Management Program, SSHA, Merced, CA 95343 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of California System; University of California Merced,"Dinopoulos, E (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Tsoulouhas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Ernest & Julio Gallo Management Program, SSHA, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",dinopoe@ufl.edu; ftsoulouhas@ucmerced.edu,"Tsoulouhas, Theofanis/P-9601-2019",,,,,,37,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In order to achieve this goal we will compare the GCR findings with the findings of a composite index of competitiveness, named 6 BIC (Basic Indicators of Competitiveness). We have developed this index on the theoretical basis provided by Krugman, Fagerbergs, Scott, Lodge, Aiginger and others. Economists are aware that any theoretical conception, including the GCR, relies on a number of assumptions and postulations. If some of those have been under scrutiny, then the whole construction and its findings would lose their credibility. One of the most significant assumptions rooted in the Global Competitiveness Report is its longevity. In the long-term, the change in productivity level through price competitiveness certainly brings out a change in outcome competitiveness level. However, the effects in short-to-middle term are not certain. Our findings show that there is a whole range of countries whose national competitiveness is either under-estimated by the GCR (for example Russia, Turkey, Estonia, Moldova) or overvalued (Finland, Ireland, Iceland, Portugal, Spain) in short-to-middle term. The basic conclusion from the obtained results of the research is that the GCR does not provide sufficiently good view of the current competitiveness of the countries, and that this indicator needs to be extended also with other competitiveness indicators, such as those selected in our paper.","[Djogo, Marko] Univ East Sarajevo, Fac Econ, Alekse Santica 3, East Sarajevo 71420, Bosnia & Herceg; [Stanisic, Nenad] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Dure Pucara Starog 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of East Sarajevo; University of Kragujevac,"Djogo, M (通讯作者)，Univ East Sarajevo, Fac Econ, Alekse Santica 3, East Sarajevo 71420, Bosnia & Herceg.",markodjogo@yahoo.com; nstanisic@open.telekom.rs,"Stanisic, Nenad/W-2573-2019","Stanisic, Nenad/0000-0002-7070-4826; Dogo, Marko/0000-0001-6898-9968",,,,,21,14,15,0,22,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

In the estimated vector autoregressive models, we test its stability and find the short-run relationship between HR and EPU is unstable. As a result, a time-varying approach (bootstrap rolling window causality test) is utilized to revisit the dynamic causal link, and we find EPU has no impact on HR due to the stability of the real estate market in Germany. HR does not have significant effects on EPU in most time periods. However, significant feedback in several sub-periods (both positive and negative) are found from HR to EPU, which indicates the causal link from HR to EPU varies over time. The empirical results do not support the general equilibrium model of government policy choices that indicate EPU does not play a role in the real estate market. The basic conclusion is that the real estate market shows its stability due to the social welfare nature and the rational institutional arrangement of the real estate in Germany, and the real estate market also shows its importance that it has significant effect on the economic policy choice in some periods when negative external shocks occur.","[Su, David; Li, Xin] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lobont, Oana-Ramona] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania; [Zhao, Yanping] Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; West University of Timisoara; Ocean University of China,"Su, D (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",2303639470@qq.com; 912393320@qq.com; lobont_oana@yahoo.com; qupipizyp@163.com,"zhao, yan/GWC-9174-2022; Lobont, Oana Ramona/AHA-3609-2022; Lobont, Oana-Ramona/AAP-8584-2020","Lobont, Oana Ramona/0000-0002-2942-3715; Li, Xin/0000-0001-6063-8717","National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through project KnowReset [14-SEE-PC-RO-TIMISOA01, 2/21/07.2014]","National Social Science Foundation; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through project KnowReset","This work is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (No. 15BJY155), and Supported by a grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the project 14-SEE-PC-RO-TIMISOA01 KnowReset, Contract no. 2/21/07.2014.",,34,20,21,2,22,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The relationship is not unidimensional; therefore, we propose three dimensions of resource-induced structural change. The first dimension describes the links between the two critical input factors into agricultural production, namely land and water. To systematize this perspective, we use the concept of linking patterns that depict direct and indirect intersectoral linkages from a property rights perspective. Second, we examinee the dimension of how structural change in agriculture can be triggered by scarcity of natural resources. The third dimension describes structural change that may lead to overuse and scarcity. In this regard, we introduce resource scarcity not only as physical but most important as institutional scarcity. To illustrate these dimensions, we have chosen a case in Central Asia, where the availability and the control of access and withdrawal rights to land and water is of utmost importance for the agricultural sector. Tajikistan faces physical and institutional scarcity in arable land. The institutional scarcity is due to the non-transparent and costly processes that need to be followed to gain land rights. Likewise there is sufficient supply in water, in Tajikistan, but the de-facto access rights to water are limited for some groups. For instance, the post-socialist irrigation infrastructure is now inappropriate to serve all small-scale users on a canal. In the future, land use change due to a predicted increase of major investors, will have additional impact on the de-facto water rights. We conclude that a solid study not only on the physical but also on the institutional relations of agriculture to natural resources is important to come to reliable predictions of structural change in agriculture. We also show that structural change in agriculture may have wider implications for rural society that go beyond the agricultural sector.","[Theesfeld, Insa] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agrar & Ernahrungswissensch, Von Seckendorff Pl 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Kluemper, Frederike] Leibniz Inst Agrarentwicklung Mittel & Osteuropa, Halle, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Theesfeld, I (通讯作者)，Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agrar & Ernahrungswissensch, Von Seckendorff Pl 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",insa.theesfeld@landw.uni-halle.de,"Theesfeld, Insa/AAE-2214-2020","Theesfeld, Insa/0000-0002-0200-756X",,,,,59,4,6,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Numerous efforts have been made, with limited success, to mitigate this problem by limiting the subsidy to small or mid-size farm operations. The 2014 farm bill, adopted by the U.S. Congress, made the situation worse. Rather than imposing stricter limits on subsidies to the largest farms, the legislation removed existing limits, ended direct payments, and increased subsidies for insurance against crop losses and income risk. The new law not only provides a windfall to owners of very large farms, it also encourages plowing of fragile soils, since the risks of crop failure are now borne primarily by taxpayers.

Both approaches are suitable for nowcasting low-frequency variables such as the quarterly GDP using higher-frequency business cycle indicators. Three differences between the approaches are identified: (1) MIDAS is a direct multi-step nowcasting tool, whereas bridge equations provide iterated forecasts; (2) the weighting of high-frequency predictor observations in MIDAS is based on functional lag polynomials, whereas the bridge equation weights are fixed partly by time aggregation; (3) for parameter estimation, the MIDAS equations consider current quarter leads of high-frequency indicators, whereas bridge equations typically do not. To assist in discussing the differences between the approaches in isolation, intermediate specifications between MIDAS and bridge equations are provided. The alternative models are compared in an empirical application to nowcasting GDP growth in the Euro area, given a large set of business cycle indicators.

Such a design is appropriate to identify underperforming individual judges or underperforming courts or court districts. However, it is not appropriate to identify institutions conducive to judicial performance. A dataset produced by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice contains very detailed information on the judicial systems of the 47 member countries of the Council of Europe. Drawing on robust regressions and using an objective variable, we find that (1) resolution rates are not a function of per capita income. In other words: poor countries can also afford them. (2) Countries belonging to the French legal tradition enjoy relatively lower resolution rates. (3) Resolution rates are negatively-and very robustly-correlated with court budget. As such, a higher budget will not buy more court decisions. (4) Resolution rates are never positively correlated with the presence of judicial councils. (5) Mandatory training for judges is correlated with higher resolution rates. Drawing on the subjectively perceived efficiency of the judiciary as the dependent variable we find that (6) countries belonging to both the French and the socialist legal tradition are less efficient and that (7) judicial councils are also negatively correlated with our measure of judicial efficiency, in other words: countries that do not have them should not introduce them.","[Voigt, Stefan; El-Bialy, Nora] Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Johnsallee 35, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Voigt, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Johnsallee 35, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",Stefan.Voigt@uni-hamburg.de; Nora.Elbialy@ile-hamburg.de,,,IREF,IREF,"The authors thank IREF for supporting this research and for constructive comments on a first draft.

We show that the Directive resolves the uncertainty following the Pfleiderer and subsequent judgments on a national and EU level, but creates new uncertainties by introducing provisions in order to protect either leniency incentives or victims' right of compensation. We argue that an alternative solution could have been chosen, according to which cooperating undertakings that have received immunity or reduction from fines would be granted the same protection against damages liability. Following this alternative solution, the non-cooperating members of the cartel would then have to compensate the victims for the harm caused by the cartel. We show that, under certain conditions, this alternative is a superior approach to resolve the conflict between optimal leniency incentives and compensation for all victims.","[Kirst, Philipp] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van den Bergh, Roger] Erasmus Univ, RILE, Law & Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Van den Bergh, R (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, RILE, Law & Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",r.vandenbergh@law.eur.nl,,,,,,,18,5,5,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

However such work relies upon a foundation that was developed in the field of finance and has drawbacks when used in transportation contexts. We show that the approach lacks flexibility for modelling departure time choice and non-normal distributions of travel time. The paper presents an alternative formulation of mean-variance, capable of incorporating multiple risk attitudes in its utility function and able to represent the commonly observed skewed travel time distribution. We apply this method using discrete choice modelling methods and find that it estimates a lower reliability ratio than the standard approach. We argue that the value estimated by the proposed framework is a closer estimate of the true reliability ratio and an improvement over traditional methods.","[Leahy, Christopher] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Leahy, C (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",ts08cl@leeds.ac.uk,,,ESRC White Rose Doctoral Training Centre; Transport for London,ESRC White Rose Doctoral Training Centre; Transport for London,"The author would like to thank both the ESRC White Rose Doctoral Training Centre and Transport for London for funding this research.

Mortgage processing capacity constraints typically bind when the demand for mortgage refinancing rises far above average levels, such as when mortgage interest rates drop to record low levels. As a result, high capacity utilization leads mortgage lenders to ration mortgage credit by focusing on mortgage applications that require less underwriting resources. This is hypothesized to have a particularly adverse impact on relatively higher credit-risk borrowers' ability to obtain mortgages, particularly for purchasing borrowers with low-to-modest credit scores.","[Sharpe, Steve A.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 20th & Constitut Ave NW,MS K1-144, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Sherlund, Shane M.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 20th & Constitut Ave NW,MS K1-149, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Sherlund, SM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 20th & Constitut Ave NW,MS K1-149, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",steve.a.sharpe@frb.gov; shane.m.sherlund@frb.gov,"Sharpe, Steven/R-6988-2019",,,,,,16,5,8,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Most political economy analyses of the Eurozone crisis have focused on political leaders, clashes between creditor and debtor member states and public opinions in analysing the handling of the crisis. This paper focuses instead on the input of corporate actors. It is argued that both the setting up of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the handling of its crisis were congenial to corporate preferences. Europe's nascent corporate elite was concerned with eliminating currency risk when the EMU was set up and therefore did not push for fiscal federalism. When the flawed architecture of the Eurozone transformed that currency risk into sovereign credit risk, corporate preferences adapted and now favoured fiscal liability pooling and ultimately the setting up of a fiscal union.","[Georgiou, Christakis] Univ Montpellier, CNRS UMR 5112, Ctr Etud Polit Europe Latine, 3 Rue Arc Mourgues, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Georgiou, C (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, CNRS UMR 5112, Ctr Etud Polit Europe Latine, 3 Rue Arc Mourgues, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",christakis.georgiou2@gmail.com,,"Georgiou, Christakis/0000-0001-9093-885X",,,,,55,3,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

When a service is determined to be an SGEI, Member States may enact measures and undertakings entrusted with the provision of the SGEI may engage in behaviour which would otherwise be contrary to the rules of the Treaties, notably the competition rules. Member States retain a wide discretion to define, provide and finance SGEIs; i. e. to use the entrustment of an SGEI as a tool to intervene in the market. This discretion is subject only to a test for manifest error of assessment by the Commission. To increase legal certainty, ensure effective intervention in markets and prevent their use in industrial policy, it is highly relevant to clarify what SGEIs are. The various definitions published by the Commission and in the literature are examined, and a new definition of an SGEI based on economic theory (networks and network effects) is formed. This definition is consistent with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the General Court.

The rise of blogshops is due to a combination of low barriers to entry and the informal institutions that bind the blogshop community for mutual support, and the development of a self-regulatory regime. Blogshops are spatially embedded and supported by the contextualised network of economic actors which facilitate the open exchange of practices and ideas through information diffusion across both virtual and physical space. The overlap between virtual and physical space is further illustrated by businesses extending their virtual space to bricks and mortar shops, which in turn supports their sustainability by widening their market penetration. Therefore, blogshops not only reverse the development path from conventional to online retailer, but also illustrate the importance of physical space for the accumulation and transfer of tacit knowledge.","[Yeung, Godfrey] Natl Univ Singapore Geog, Arts Link, Singapore 19711, Singapore; [Ang, Kim Leng] Chua Chu Kang Secondary Sch, 3 Teck Whye Crescent, Singapore 688845, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Yeung, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore Geog, Arts Link, Singapore 19711, Singapore.;Ang, KL (通讯作者)，Chua Chu Kang Secondary Sch, 3 Teck Whye Crescent, Singapore 688845, Singapore.",geoykyg@nus.edu.sg; kimmy.angkl@gmail.com,"Yeung, Godfrey/D-3122-2013","Yeung, Godfrey/0000-0002-7027-5005",,,,,84,11,14,5,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Many researchers attempted to use AC in real-world applications such as: text classification, medical diagnoses, fraud detection and website phishing. However, there are a few concerns about using this technique and they are as follows: first, it generates too many rules that consume a lot of time and memory compared with the classical data mining techniques. Second, the support and confidence threshold values are estimated by the user and hence the ranking process is always affected by these values. To overcome these issues, we investigated a modified technique to enhance the performance of the Apriori algorithm used in Classification Based on Association (CBA). The technique we discovered that works well involves using the harmonic mean measure to generate more confident rules and to improve the process of ranking the generated rules. To prove our idea, we compared the new algorithm named Enhanced CBA (ECBA) with the three well-known AC algorithms, namely CBA, Classification based on Multiple Association Rules (CMAR) and Multi-Class Classification based on Association Rule (MCAR). The comparison was based on ten gold standard UCI datasets using five common measures including: building time model, accuracy, precision, recall and the F-measure. Experimental results showed that ECBA overcomes the other AC techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. It also showed that ECBA enhanced the building time model of the original CBA algorithm.","[Alwidian, Jaber] Isra Univ, Amman, Jordan; [Hammo, Bassam H.; Obeid, Nadim] Univ Jordan, King Abdullah II Sch Informat Technol, Amman, Jordan",Isra University; University of Jordan,"Alwidian, J (通讯作者)，Isra Univ, Amman, Jordan.",jaber.alwidian@iu.edu.jo; b.hammo@ju.edu.jo; nadim@ju.edu.jo,"Hammo, Bassam/GRR-6624-2022; Obeid, Nadim/B-8076-2011","Obeid, Nadim/0000-0001-9218-0923",,,,,28,4,5,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,4291,4306,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700429,0

More specifically, we compare and contrast two related, but in many ways also differing, ways of thinking about totalitarianism and its legal repercussions. To this end, we examine two sets of studies: Arendt's The origins of totalitarianism and Eichmann in Jerusalem: A report on the banality of evil and Shklar's After utopia: The decline of political faith and Legalism: An essay on law, morals, and politics. While The origins of totalitarianism and After utopia discussed totalitarian ideology and its consequences for modern political thought, the Eichmann report and Legalism dealt with the question of whether and how justice is possible after the extreme experience of totalitarianism. We argue that the maieutic impulse led Arendt and Shklar to find distinct routes to address a common concern. Our paper ends with a discussion of some of the surplus meaning that was generated by the different maieutic performances of the two thinkers.","[Ashenden, Samantha] Univ London, Dept Polit, Birkbeck, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Hess, Andreas] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Sociol, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland",University of London; Birkbeck University London; University College Dublin,"Ashenden, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Polit, Birkbeck, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",s.ashenden@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,14,14,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Contemporary organisations invest more and more in enterprise systems, including ERP systems, and high growth of these investments is still predicted. The complexity and dynamics of modern management systems in fact determine the simultaneous and sequential application of many management concepts and methods. In the main, however, the coexistence of implemented solutions should be beneficial for an organisation. The theoretical views on the relations of ERP and selected management methods have thus been empirically verified in the analysis of differences in the assessment of a number of effects of using the selected management methods in pairs with ERP as well as separately (business, efficiency, management, social and environmental effects) were investigated. One-way ANOVA was used for a sample of 167 Polish organizations.","[Bienkowska, Agnieszka; Walecka-Jankowska, Katarzyna; Zgrzywa-Ziemak, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Bienkowska, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",agnieszka.bienkowska@pwr.edu.pl; katarzyna.walecka-jankowska@pwr.edu.pl; anna.zgrzywa-ziemak@pwr.edu.pl,"Zgrzywa-Ziemak, Anna/AHC-8894-2022","Zgrzywa-Ziemak, Anna/0000-0002-6904-8040; Walecka-Jankowska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-2764-6763; Bienkowska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-7498-6322",,,,,38,0,0,0,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,13,28,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_2,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100002,0

Self-administered questionnaires with 18 items on organizational commitment construct and 4 items on turnover intention construct were distributed to the randomly-selected sample. A measurement model and structural model was later constructed using AMOS. Results indicate that the measurement model to test hypotheses was valid and reliable. However, based on the structural model constructed, no relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intention was indicated. There is also no relationship between affective commitment and turnover intention as well as normative commitment. Only continuance commitment significantly affected turnover intention. The finding is supported by few arguments regarding the characteristics of generation Y and the nature of SMEs industries.

Furthermore, the paper aims to draw general conclusions on how the share of conventional power plants in the companies' generation mix has affected their operation as a whole. Finally, the paper discusses the trends in the energy industry, in particular regarding gas-fired power plants, as well the opportunities and threats facing them in the context of achieving the EU strategic energy goals. The results show that companies with a higher share of conventional thermal power plants in their energy mix operate with a significant decrease in profit, and generally face a decrease in their asset value. This is opposite to companies with large diversified portfolios and shares of hydropower and new renewables. Since conventional power plants, especially high-performing and flexible gas-fired cogeneration ones, may play a key role in producing the peak load and even the base load power, as well as in maintaining high quality in the electricity grid, this situation might jeopardize the achievement of the EU strategic energy goals. Hence, it calls for new energy reforms.","[Borozan, Djula; Starcevic, Dubravka Pekanov] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Starcevic, DP (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",borozan@efos.hr; dpekan@efos.hr,"Borozan, Đula/AAA-3997-2021","Borozan, Đula/0000-0003-0607-1574",,,,,29,4,4,1,2,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,231,246,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_15,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800015,0

Constant skills' upgrading of the workforce to promote employability requires innovative approaches at national, regional and local level and demands new forms of strategic partnerships. This sets new tasks also for public administrations involved in vocational education and training (VET) provision. In Latvia VET reform is ongoing, with gradual changes in VET governance through increased involvement of social partners. It is important to evaluate the existing institutional mechanisms for co-operation among the social partners and, if necessary, improve them or develop new ones. A research was carried out in Latvia in 2014 among the top and medium level public administrators regarding the approaches to the development of competitive labor force by the VET system. A parallel analogous research was carried out among the employers. The aim of the research was to learn the opinions of the respective target groups, make a comparison between their opinions regarding research relevant issues and to identify the key challenges for public administrations in VET for improved decision making in the training of competitive labor force.","[Buligina, Ilze; Sloka, Biruta] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Buligina, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Riga, Latvia.",Ilze.Buligina@gmail.com; Biruta.Sloka@lu.lv,"Sloka, Biruta/K-5043-2017",,,,,,17,1,1,1,11,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,229,244,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_19,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900019,0
