Avoiding payoff inequity, the group reward scheme is optimal as long as the firm faces no credibility problem. The individual reward scheme may, however, become superior albeit introducing the prospect of unequal pay. This is due to two reasons: Group incentives are relatively low-powered compared to individual incentives, requiring higher incentive pay and impeding credibility of the firm. Moreover, with individual rewards, the firm benefits from the incentive-strengthening effect of envy, allowing for yet smaller overall incentive pay and further softening the credibility constraint. I also show that contracts combining both individual and group rewards are often optimal, depending on the firm's credibility problem. These contracts include joint and relative performance pay schemes.","EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, EBS Business Sch, Dept Management & Econ, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University,"Kragl, J (通讯作者)，EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, EBS Business Sch, Dept Management & Econ, Rheingaustr 1, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany.",jenny.kragl@ebs.edu,,"Kragl, Jenny/0000-0003-2533-1271","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [CRC 649, DE 1169]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I would like to thank Dominique Demougin, Martina Gogova, Julia Schmid, Dorothee Schneider, Anja Schottner, two anonymous referees, and the assigned co-editor for helpful comments.

This study investigated uncertainty in four-stage transport models by analysing a Danish case-study: the Naestved model. The model describes the demand of transport in the municipality of Naestved, located in the southern part of Zealand. The municipality has about 80,000 inhabitants and covers an area of around 681 km(2). The study was implemented by using Monte Carlo simulation and scenario analysis and it focused on how model input and parameter uncertainty affect the base-year model outputs uncertainty. More precisely, this study contributes to the existing literature on the topic by investigating the effects on model outputs uncertainty deriving from the use of (i) different probability distributions in the sampling process, (ii) different assignment algorithms, and (iii) different levels of network congestion. The choice of the probability distributions shows a low impact on the model output uncertainty, quantified in terms of coefficient of variation. Instead, with respect to the choice of different assignment algorithms, the link flow uncertainty, expressed in terms of coefficient of variation, resulting from stochastic user equilibrium and user equilibrium is, respectively, of 0.425 and 0.468. Finally, network congestion does not show a high effect on model output uncertainty at the network level. However, the final uncertainty of links with higher volume/capacity ratio showed a lower dispersion around the base uncertainty value. Results are also obtained from the implementation of the analysis on a real case involving the finalization of a ring road around Naestved. Three different scenarios were tested. The resulting uncertainty in the travel time savings from the comparison of the three scenarios expressed in terms of coefficient of variation, turned out to be between 0.133 and 0.145, thus confirming the importance of uncertainty analysis in transport policy assessment.

We conceptualise the innovation type as exploration and exploitation and test the hypotheses on balancing these two contradictory innovation activities. We further explore the congruence between a firm's competitive strategy and its innovation activities because the strategy can influence the way in which a firm deploys its resources to innovation activities. An analysis of 255 Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Korean IT industry indicates that (1) the extent of exploratory innovation has inverted U-shaped relationship with firm survival, providing support for the ambidexterity perspective; (2) the differentiation strategy moderates the exploratory innovation - firm survival relationship. These findings contribute to the organisational ambidexterity literature. First, the study provides clear empirical evidence that the exploration-exploitation balance plays an important role in the SMEs' survival. Despite the theoretical assumption and common belief that balancing exploration and exploitation is important for long-term performance and survival, most empirical studies have focused mainly on the short-term financial performance outcomes. Second, the results suggest a need for a good fit between a firm's competitive strategy and its innovation orientations, providing a contingency approach to underscore the effectiveness of a firm's exploratory and exploitative innovation under different contexts.","[Kim, Guktae; Huh, Moon-Goo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taegu 702701, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Huh, MG (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, 80 Daehak Ro, Taegu 702701, South Korea.",moongoo@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,46,8,10,0,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

There is a range of variants of their implementation fulfilling a number of different functions, which examined in terms of the effects of implementing systems informing about the environment in an enterprise, usually focus on typical areas of their use in environmental management, with particular reference to the evaluation of their practical importance. Implementation of the objectives related with instruments for environmental management in the aspect of improving the effectiveness of environmental protection in an enterprise enables the achievement of a specific goal implied by ecological controlling. However, these instruments are characterised by specific attributes, as most of them, having a nature of satellites, are implemented as a complement to conventional instruments. A wide range of applications of systems informing about the environment allow enterprises to systematically implement such instruments without significant financial outlay. Despite numerous unfavourable economic and ecological conditions, it should be stressed that the effects illustrating the implementation of such systems are very reliable and so evocative that integration of environmental information systems with the structures existing in an enterprise determines high quality of the final data. In the relationship between environmental management and instruments, it is very important for effective environmental protection implemented within an enterprise that the instruments are compatible and can be combined with one another, which will have a significant impact in the future on the paradigm of constantly increasing interest of enterprises in systems for environmental management through the perspective of ecological indicators and balances.

In our analysis of intergenerational cooperation and intragenerational competition, the altruistic parents care about the efficiency of the children-provided merit goods and the equity of the children's incomes. For an optimal allocation of wealth, the parents strategically partition it into two pools: one to be distributed equally whereas the other unequally according to their children's supply of merit goods. We look at motivation of the parents in allocating their wealth to the two different pools. The analysis of endogenous division rules has implications for the compatibility between equal postmortem transfers and unequal inter vivos gifts, both of which are consistent with parental altruism.","[Chang, Yang-Ming] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Luo, Zijun] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Kansas State University; Colgate University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 319 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ymchang@ksu.edu; zluo@colgate.edu,,"Luo, Zijun/0000-0003-0046-7666",,,,,42,15,15,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Since the reform and opening up, the system was supplemented by the basic medical care insurance, supplementary health insurance (including commercial health insurance) and so on. At present, China has established a wide coverage and multi-level medical insurance system, which is based on basic medical care insurance and complemented by other insurance. China's medical insurance system has undergone a fundamental change, but the problem of moral hazard has been in existence for a long time, which was various and has tremendous range and deeper level. This not only led to the raise of medical price and cost, but also affects the rational allocation of medical resources and protection efforts. How to suppress the moral hazard of health insurance becomes one of the most significant issues in the field of whether the universal health care system can become successful implementation and ongoing operation. Chinese scholars studying the moral hazard of health insurance are mainly based on qualitative research, and their researches are focused on the theoretical analysis of its existence using the methods of welfare economics, utility theory and game theory. This paper confirmed and analyzed the degree of moral hazard in the medical care insurance using quantitative method. This paper draws on the latest methods of foreign medical insurance to measure the degree of moral hazard, and combined with China's actual situation. Based on the current situation and the moral hazard behavior in China's medical insurance system, the paper analysis the elasticity of different insurance plans (urban workers' medical insurance, medical insurance for urban residents, the new agricultural cooperative medical insurance, public health and commercial health insurance), using Utility theory, Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The elasticity can indicates the degree of moral hazard. Higher value means higher risk. The paper also analyses the factors of elasticity by multiple regression models. The results show that public health has greater risk of moral hazard, which is followed by medical insurance for urban workers and urban residents. The new rural cooperative medical insurance has smaller risk of moral hazard. Furthermore, the paper finds that the degree of moral hazard is negative to co-payment rate, education, household size, and positive to age. Finally, the paper gives the appropriate control measures of moral hazard from the view of moral, medical reform deepening, credit system and regime improvements. This paper expanded and refined the domestic research from quantitative perspective of moral hazard, which has theoretical and practical significance.","[Chen Zhichu; Ma Qianqian] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, ZC (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Finance, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",tjchenzhichu@126.com; mqmqtill@126.com,"Chen, Zhichu/K-7204-2014",,,,,,30,0,0,0,22,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,281,300,,,,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700022,0

We explain how assessments of such policies will overestimate their effectiveness if market responses are not taken into account. The substantial difference between market price and extraction cost of oil means that consumption reductions will be watered down by price responses causing increased consumption in other places (spatial leakage) and in the future (intertemporal leakage). The difference between market price and extraction cost also has negative implications for the viability of alternative technologies. Leakage effects become larger when consumption reductions are only undertaken by a subset of countries: we review some theoretical evidence why strong binding international climate agreements are so difficult to reach and to enforce.

However, discounted expectancy of actual loss under real-world P probability measure, the simple idea in actuarial science, ignored the role of financial market and failed to keep pace with modern financial economic, which differenciate itself from the option pricing based on no-arbitrage method. So, the traditional actuarial pricing method must be corrected by a covariance term which reflects the interaction between the insurance claim and the financial market. Nevertheless, after conducting the change from real-world probability measure to risk-neutral probability measure, the time-honored actuarial pricing method will be the same with option pricing. We started by giving a brief introduction to the actuarial approach to option pricing, and then investgated the structural similarity between option and insurance contracts like stop-loss ro excess loss and compared the differences between Bladt & Rydberg(1998) together with its subsequent articles and standard BS formula, which followed by analyzing their idiological roots. Then, we, with the modern asset pricing theory, discovered the essential discrepency between actuarial pricing which neglects the function of financial market and Black-Scholes method based on dynamic hedging strategy in market. Besides, we put forward the modified actuarial valuation method which is identical with the BS method in complete market and is also applicable to option pricing in incomplete market.","Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 312000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Hu, SQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou 312000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",crazyrobert3478@sina.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,6,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,549,560,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700044,0

We find strong evidence against the threshold constancy, symmetry, homogeneity, and overall unbiasedness assumptions of the CP method. To address these violations, we generalize the CP method using a hierarchical ordered probit (HOPIT) model. By comparing the quantified inflation expectations with quantitative expectations obtained from the same set of households directly, we show that the generalized model performs better than the CP method. In particular, when the CP unbiasedness assumption is replaced by a time-varying calibration, the resulting quantified series is found to track the quantitative benchmark well, over diverse time periods.

The research results suggest that entrepreneurial orientation enhances export performance in the analysed SMEs, particularly innovation and proactiveness, through the amount of funds invested, human resources dedicated to this activity, number of new products or services introduced in the market and frequent change in product lines or services and materialization of a long-term perspective, which is accompanied by innovative activities or new businesses.

The authors of this article want to emphasize that the local attitudes, the features of national economic system and the institutional regulations mostly explain the unemployment rate among the young people in Romania. At the same tune, this approach attempts to show that the difficulty of young people to find a job is related, in particular, to the subjective factors.

On the other hand, project scheduling, being one of the most modeled project management process stages, still faces a wide gap from theory to practice. Demanding computational models and their consequent call for simplification, divert the implementation of such models in project management tools from the actual day to day project management process. Special focus is being made to the robustness of the generated project schedules facing the omnipresence of uncertainty. An easy way out is to add, more or less cleverly calculated, time buffers that always result in project duration increase and correspondingly, in cost. A better approach to deal with uncertainty seems to be to explore slack that might be present in a given project schedule, a fortiori when a non-optimal schedule is used. The combination of such approach to recent advances in modeling resource allocation and scheduling techniques to cope with the increasing flexibility in resources, as can be expressed in Flexible Resource Constraint Project Scheduling Problem (FRCPSP) formulations, should be a promising line of research to generate more adequate project management tools.

This phenomenon is present on RCBS market regarding the Information on price causing the unexpected consumer behaviour - suboptimal product choice regarding the price and the range of the demanded services. We study this phenomenon to identify main causes and its range. At first we present the main characteristics that increase the information asymmetry influence (low share on household expenditures) but also decrease (close substitution). Then we present the outcome of European Union wide research identifying sources of information asymmetry. Then we describe our data source (RCBS comparison tools), Based on its dataset we compute the share of optimal choices among the electronic banking users of the RCBS. We define the optimal choice as the lowest fees for the account that provides all the demanded services. The result is that the optimal share of the consumer choices of RCBS is as low as shows the confidence interval 95% of (0.159; 0.171). The result is based on more than 14 500 individual consumer behaviour records. For the second analysis the geographical difference variables are filtered off to eliminate geographical differentiation even more. This led to expected improvement in ratio but very low one.

The presented concept first represents the general standard of a product to be improved by a weighted average of the product feature levels, thus drawing on concepts from multicriteria decision-making theories. The paper then models the weights appearing in the average so that the average could be calculated, and the product could be improved, achieving at the same time that the modelled weights reflect a specific behaviour of the customer who is the ultimate judge of the product quality or standard. The reason for doing so is the fact that it is the customer who defines the weights which attach importance to each product feature. Since the behaviour of the customer is unknown, the weights are unknown, and must be modelled. If the weights are modelled in such a way that the resulting model reflects a specific customer behaviour, companies may refer to this model, when improving their products, provided there are reasons to believe that such a specific customer behaviour is occurring in the market. The approach to modelling the weights presented in the paper is compared to another approach for finding the weights, the alternative approach offering itself as a more natural way for these purposes. The paper shows, however, that the alternative approach lacks some desirable properties that the approach proposed in the paper is able to provide. The concepts presented in the paper are proved generally, using known mathematical optimization techniques, and the proved theory is accompanied by examples which support the validity of the general statements.","Silesian Univ, Fac Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Katowice, Poland",University of Silesia in Katowice,"Tosenovsky, F (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Fac Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Katowice, Poland.",tosenovskyfilip@opf.slu.cz,"Tosenovsky, Filip/ABH-1856-2020","Tosenovsky, Filip/0000-0003-3946-7815",,,,,16,5,5,0,9,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Our analysis is based on micro data from the 2010 Malawi Demographic Health Survey, and uses a flexible instrumental variable regression approach.

We used the excess number of hospital admissions and emergency department visits to quantify the morbidity effects and used medical costs to estimate the economic impact. With data from 187 hospital facilities and 140 emergency departments located in five counties in southern California, we found evidence of significant acute adverse health reactions to wildfire-smoke exposure. Specifically, we found approximately 80 excess respiratory-related hospital admissions, 26 excess acute cardiovascular-related hospital admissions, nearly 760 excess respiratory-related emergency department visits, and 38 excess acute cardiovascular-related emergency department visits. We estimated that the associated medical costs were over $3.4 million. Since these cost estimates do not consider costs related to other adverse health effects, such as mortality, symptoms that were not severe enough to warrant going to the emergency room or hospital, or the costs of avoiding exposure to wildfire smoke, our estimates do not reflect the full health-related costs of wildfire smoke exposure.

In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.","[Samuel Baixauli-Soler, J.; Encarnacion Lucas-Perez, M.; Francisco Martin-Ugedo, Juan; Minguez-Vera, Antonio; Sanchez-Marin, Gregorio] Univ Murcia, Dept Management & Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Lucas-Perez, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Management & Finance, Fac Econ & Business, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",samuel@um.es; me.lucas@um.es; juanfran@um.es; minver@um.es; gresanma@um.es,"Minguez-Vera, Antonio/Z-5658-2019; CHORMALE, Devyani/L-4782-2019; Lucas-Perez, Maria Encarnacion/L-1877-2014; Sanchez-Marin, Gregorio/C-1732-2013; Baixauli-Soler, Juan Samuel/L-1831-2014","Sanchez-Marin, Gregorio/0000-0003-0175-814X; Baixauli-Soler, Juan Samuel/0000-0003-2444-6894","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain) [FEM2013-40578-P, ECO2014-54301-P]; Fundacion CajaMurcia",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain); Fundacion CajaMurcia,The authors gratefully acknowledge the helpful comments and suggestions received during the editing/review process.

Direct extrapolation methods tested include the Geometric method, Ediev variant, Lee-Carter method, BMS variant and a relational model. Indirect methods include the extrapolation of parameters of models fitted to the age profile of death rates and a new method involving the extrapolation of features of death frequency distributions namely the modal age and concentration. The geometric, Ediev and Lee-Carter BMS methods were very successful in projecting death rates and very elderly populations. Differences between these methods were small. The extrapolation of parametric functions proved successful for males but less so for females. Very elderly populations can be viably projected by directly extrapolating death rates by age when rates of decline in death rates show consistent relationships between ages and are stable over time.

Using a simple model, we determine the optimal corporate structure for such a partnership between the local government and any regulated monopoly. The government's strategic option of using its stake in the partnership to generate budget revenue from sale proceeds and/or dividends encourages the relevant authorities to increase the commercial attractiveness of the joint enterprise by setting appropriate tariffs. We show that such a strategic partnership can lead to improvements in welfare if the local cost of public funds is relatively high.

Yet, few studies have attempted to understand the impact of active transportation investments on housing prices. This study attempts to understand the relationship between a new bicycle sharing system and home sale prices in Montreal, Canada. Using multiple sales for units in multifamily housing that are reported in the Multiple Listings Service (MLS) of Montreal between 1996 and 2012 we develop step wise multilevel longitudinal hedonic regression models analyzing this relationship while controlling for various spatial and temporal factors that are known to impact home sales. Our results show that the presence of a bicycle sharing system in a neighborhood with 12 stations serving an 800-meter buffer is expected to increase the property value for units in multifamily housing by approximately 2.7 percent. Policy makers wishing to improve the local urban environment while benefiting from economic gains can work on increasing the availability of bicycle sharing systems as this will likely result in increasing property values, improved neighborhood health, and a more vibrant urban environment.

The aim of the policy was not per se for single mothers to leave welfare completely but to encourage them to find a job if only a part-time job. Two policy instruments were introduced: an earnings disregard and job creation. The experiment was performed at the municipality level in the Netherlands, a country with relatively high benefits and low incentives for single mothers to leave welfare for work. In our analysis, we make a distinction between native and immigrant welfare recipients. For immigrant single mothers, we find a positive employment effect of an earnings disregard. Job creation in addition to the earnings disregard increased working hours for some groups of single mothers. Although the outflow from welfare was not affected, welfare expenditures were reduced.","[Knoef, Marike] Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, POB 9520, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [van Ours, Jan C.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Ours, Jan C.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Ours, Jan C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [van Ours, Jan C.] CEPR, London, England; [van Ours, Jan C.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [van Ours, Jan C.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University of Melbourne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Knoef, M (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, POB 9520, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",M.G.Knoef@law.leidenuniv.nl; j.c.vanours@tilburguniversity.edu,"van Ours, Jan C/N-2579-2016; van Ours, Jan/O-6197-2015","van Ours, Jan/0000-0002-0144-9956; Knoef, Marike/0000-0003-4134-4961",Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment; CentERdata; Instituut Gak,Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment; CentERdata; Instituut Gak,"The authors thank the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, CentERdata, and Instituut Gak for financial support.

J,"Ward, EJ; Dimitriou, HT; Dean, M",,,,"Ward, E. John; Dimitriou, Harry T.; Dean, Marco",,,Theory and background of multi-criteria analysis: Toward a policy-led approach to mega transport infrastructure project appraisal,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Multi-criteria analysis; Policy-led multi-criteria analysis; Project appraisal; Multiple stakeholders; Mega projects; Sustainable development,DECISION-MAKING; CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; ANALYSIS MAMCA; POWER; STRATEGY; SCIENCE; RISK,"The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, to present a review and critical analysis of the varying forms and functions of Multi-Criteria Analysis presented in the literature, and secondly, drawing from this, to introduce methods and processes by which policy leadership can be introduced into such processes for the appraisal of large-scale transport infrastructure projects to form a policy-led multi-criteria analysis. Following the discussion in the first paper of this Special Issue, 'Presenting the Case for the Application of Multi-Criteria Analysis to Mega Transport Project Infrastructure Appraisal', this contribution commences by outlining further the generic features and challenges of multi-criteria analysis approaches to project appraisal whilst emphasizing the difference among various frameworks and attendant processes for such approaches. It also highlights the important role/value of the multi-criteria mapping of stakeholder policies and agendas affecting project decision-making as a means of defining and scoping the boundaries of the project exercise under study and the trade-off decision-spaces for stakeholder dialogues and negotiations in their search to arrive at mutually agreed actions and outcomes. The paper discusses how multi-criteria analysis frameworks can be tailor-designed for particular agencies and stakeholders developed around problems, challenges and issues. This is done in the acknowledgement that such exercises, especially when applied to mega infrastructure project appraisal, typically attract a multiple-institutional response and where ultimately an institutional leader (or partnership of stakeholders) exists/emerges that impose its/their priorities on others. Alternatively, the approach can be tailor-made for specific institutions with its imbedded hierarchy of policies and priorities that frame the stakeholder decision space within which other parties can participate and trade off interests. The first part of the paper highlights the important role of scenarios of policy-making contexts and policy leadership indicating the new risks, uncertainties and opportunities these may offer in multi criteria analysis exercises, indicating that some/many past processes have been conducted outside of any real reference to such matters. In so doing, such applications have them silently and implicitly adopt scenarios and policy assumptions that are not transparent frequently reflecting, it is alleged, 'business as usual' circumstances in contexts when the signs are very much that these trends will not/cannot prevail. The authors contend that without explicit policy leadership there is a danger that certain institutional stakeholder priorities will be imposed over others by the most powerful without adequate dialogue. Understanding that this matters a great deal in contexts when project stakeholder powers shifts occur is very significant Examples of such circumstances are when national governments become, less or more powerful and economically affluent, when relative legislative and regulation powers become less or more binding and powerful, and when a major private sector investor upon which a project depends goes bankrupt. The second half of the paper builds on these observations to offer a generic multi-criteria analysis framework and attendant processes that imbed policy leadership firmly within multi-stakeholder decision-making (termed Policy-led Multi-criteria Analysis). The framework developed is to be applied to mega transport projects via the use of suitable appraisal criteria in the pursuit of sustainable development goals, which seek to address both quantitative and qualitative dimensions and concerns of multiple stakeholders, with particular emphasis on the processes required to identify and incorporate suitable policy leadership, including feedback between appraisal and policy.

This paper analyses the views of private forest owners and the general public in Sweden on the values of the forest. Two main dimensions were identified: preservation and recreation' values, reflecting ecological and social aspects; and production' values, reflecting economic aspects. While the general public emphasised the importance of forest uses which cater to ecological and social forest values more strongly compared to the forest owners, no significant difference was found concerning economic forest values. This suggests that while there is scope for contestation over forest land use, there is also some potential for common ground across stakeholder groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge of the views on the use of forest lands, and can inform forest related planning, management and policy development.","[Haugen, Katarina] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Haugen, K (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",katarina.haugen@umu.se,"Haugen, Katarina/AAC-8788-2022","Haugen, Katarina/0000-0001-8301-4296",research council FORMAS; Wenner-Gren Foundations; Margit Althin Scholarship Fund at The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,research council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Wenner-Gren Foundations; Margit Althin Scholarship Fund at The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,This research was funded by the research council FORMAS.

To solve this problem, this study uses a Logit model to conduct an empirical analysis of relevant factors in the farmers' demand for forest insurance, based on field survey data of Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province. The results show that the farmers' understanding of forest insurance, the proportion of forestry revenues in the total household income, forest size, forest disaster frequency, forest insurance liability, insurance amount setup, and the farmers' satisfaction regarding the premium subsidy policy, are the main factors that affect the farmers' demand for forest insurance.

The predictor can be seen as a weighted average of the futures of past situations, where the weights increase with the similarity between the past situations and the actual one. In addition, this strategy also provides simultaneous predictions at multiple horizons. These weights induce a probability distribution that can be used to produce bootstrap pseudo predictions. Prediction intervals are then constructed after obtaining the corresponding bootstrap pseudo prediction residuals. We develop two propositions following the KWF strategy directly, and compare it to two alternative methods that arise from proposals by econometricians. The latter involve the construction of simultaneous prediction intervals using multiple comparison corrections through the control of the family-wise error (FWE) or the false discovery rate. Alternatively, such prediction intervals can be constructed by bootstrapping joint probability regions. In this work, we propose to obtain prediction intervals for the KWF model that are valid simultaneously for the H prediction horizons that correspond to the relevant path forecasts, making a connection between functional time series and the econometricians' framework.

The restrictions that we impose are consistent with a two-sector model in which the variables grow at different rates in steady state. The restrictions are imposed by an exponential-tilting of simple auxiliary forecast densities. We show that imposing the consumption-output restriction yields modest improvements in the long-horizon output growth forecasts, and larger improvements in the forecasts of the cointegrating combination of consumption and output: the transformation of the data on which accuracy is assessed plays an important role.

And yet, justice considerations have traditionally played only a marginal role in transportation decision-making, such as those regarding investment in a new infrastructure project. Considerations of justice stress the plight of disadvantaged populations and thus aim to further equality between groups and individuals, especially equality of opportunities and mobility. But how can such considerations be derived from theories of justice and fairness in ways that make them applicable to real-world situations? In this article we offer a new framework for incorporating justice considerations into decision-making association with transport service provision. Our analytic framework is based on the capabilities approach developed by Sen and Nussbaum After explaining the essence of this approach, we show how transportation allocation criteria can be derived and then incorporated into de facto decision-making. Finally, we provide a real-world example of the implementation of this approach in the provision of transportation services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are no papers testing whether travel time has a direct effect on airline pricing. This paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test and quantify the effect of rail travel time on airline fares, using unique data at flight-level. We find that airlines design pricing strategies taking into consideration the travel time of competing rail transport service. Airlines are found to set, on average, higher fares as rail travel time increases. However, the competitive pressure induced by rail travel time is perceived by airlines only as the day of departure gets closer: from the 40th to the day before departure it increases while it gradually decreases as the departure date gets further away.

They were interrupted by an incoming telephone call five times during the task period (after 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 min). The interruption was related to a long-term project linked to a bonus payment at the end of the year. Results indicate that 6 out of 10 participants spent less time on an interruption if it occurred late in the 40 min in-basket task session. This supports the assumptions that, in customer relationship management activities, individuals work on smaller tasks whose outcomes occur sooner rather than on tasks with larger but later outcomes. Hence, the results support the idea that discounted utility of outcomes plays an important role in understanding choices in an organizational setting.

The study involved the comparisons of consumer preference for different marketing attributes by placing them on a comparable pricing scale, or pricing out non-monetary stimuli (e.g., ordering type, shipping, size, pictures, donation to charity, and guarantee). The research framework adopted was the Behavioral Perspective Model of consumer choice. The results of the conjoint study (Pearson's R=0.998, p<0.05) showed an inverse relation between price and utility, with higher prices corresponding to lower utility. This inverse relationship for utility also holds true for other attributes, such as shipping cost. In line with behavior analytical focus on individualization and increasing emphasis on personalized marketing, we show partial utility scores from different consumers based on altered interventions for decision-making with scenario testing and a demand curve. We discuss the implications of conjoint analysis as an experimental survey technique for decision-making in managerial economics and its role as an efficient pre-testing for more direct measures on behavior in online experimental analysis of behavior.

Increased market uncertainty, which is a second-moment variable associated with equity price changes, is also a useful predictor of new recessions in these countries. These findings are robust to the inclusion of the term spread and oil prices. The new recession forecasting performance of our baseline model is superior to that of a similar model estimated over all recession and expansion periods, highlighting a difference between the probabilities of a new recession versus a continuing recession.

However, the existing evidence on the equity effects of congestion pricing has come only from developed countries. In this paper, we shed light on the distributional consequences of a congestion pricing scheme currently under consideration in Beijing. We find that under this scheme, which covers the areas within the city's third ring road, a very small proportion of motorized trips would be subject to the full congestion charge. The directly affected individuals typically have higher household incomes and are wealthier than individuals who are not directly affected by the congestion pricing scheme. This finding reflects the fact that individuals who drive to work in Beijing are relatively wealthy. More important, we find that the Suits index for the congestion charge is 0.027, indicating that the congestion charge is slightly progressive. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

(2009), which incorporates the asymmetric stochastic volatility model with the realized volatility, is investigated. Considering the well-known characteristics of financial returns, namely heavy tails and skewness, the model is extended by employing a wider class distribution, the generalized hyperbolic skew Student's t-distribution, for financial returns. Using the Bayesian estimation scheme via a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the model enables us to estimate the parameters in the return distribution and in the model jointly. It also makes it possible to forecast the volatility and return quantiles by sampling from their posterior distributions jointly. The model is applied to quantile forecasts of financial returns such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall, as well as to volatility forecasts, and the forecasts are evaluated using a range of tests and performance measures. The empirical results using the US and Japanese stock indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nikkei 225, show that the extended model improves the volatility and quantile forecasts, especially in some volatile periods.

The paper fits the stochastic production frontier to the micro data describing the performance of the Lithuanian family farms during 2004-2009 in order to define the current trends of efficiency and productivity in the sector. Indeed, this is the first application of stochastic frontiers to gauge the performance of Lithuanian family farms. The technical efficiency of the Lithuanian family farms fluctuated around 80%. The analysis confirmed that the livestock farms were peculiar with higher mean technical efficiency if compared to that of mixed or crop farms. The estimated partial output elasticities imply that the intermediate consumption was the most productive factor, whereas assets were four to six times less productive depending on the farming type. The land factor was peculiar with the lowest partial output elasticities.

Unique features of the data allow me to create two alternative counterfactuals: (i) anchovy fishing operations in a region of the country that was mandated to implement quotas with a delay, and (ii) variation in quota allocations across ships. I find that quotas do not increase within-asset or within-firm productivity in quantities. Instead, a 200% increase in anchovy prices benefits extraction firms through higher revenues, consistent with two mechanisms enacted by individual fishing quotas: more orderly industry operations reducing excess supply and an increase in bargaining power of extraction firms with respect to fish-processing. Several market characteristics across geographies differentially affect market prices after the quota regime. Supplementary evidence on fewer operational infractions, higher product quality, and a lower banking delinquency observed during the quota regime suggests the existence of efficiency gains rather than purely rent transfers.","[Natividad, Gabriel] Univ Piura, Dept Econ, 162 Martir Olaya St, Lima 18, Peru",Universidad de Piura,"Natividad, G (通讯作者)，Univ Piura, Dept Econ, 162 Martir Olaya St, Lima 18, Peru.",gabriel.natividad@udep.pe,,"Natividad, Gabriel/0000-0001-6568-8561",,,,,52,4,7,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Empirical analysis is based upon unique data collected by the authors through a questionnaire completed by 317 foreign and domestic firms in 2009 and on-site interviews with 100 firms conducted between 2009 and 2011. Data analysis has identified a low share of domestic suppliers in the total supplies of Czech-based foreign firms and diverse spillover effects from foreign to domestic firms. Domestic firms vary in their capabilities and absorptive capacity which, along with the particular nature of the contemporary automotive value chain, significantly influence their ability and potential to benefit from linkages and spillovers.","[Pavlinek, Petr] Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Pavlinek, Petr; Zizalova, Pavla] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Zizalova, Pavla] PricewaterhouseCoopers, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Nebraska System; Charles University Prague,"Pavlínek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Geog & Geol, 6001 Dodge St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",ppavlinek@unomaha.edu,"Pavlinek, Petr/AAG-9131-2021; Zizalova, Pavla/H-2949-2014","Pavlinek, Petr/0000-0003-2799-1230;",Czech Science Foundation [13-16698S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation [Grant Number 13-16698S].,,121,65,70,6,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Consumers of many regulated services, including energy and banking, need to make active moves to switch suppliers, with profound consequences for how well the market functions. We identify differences in expected gains across demographic groups, particularly with respect to age and income, the associated changes in activity and implications for policy. We find that potential gains and anticipated switching time are associated with changes in consumer activity, but with differences between markets, demographic groups and individuals. Rather than concentrate on the average consumer response, we find variations across demographic groups, and that well informed vulnerable consumers are not necessarily less responsive than others, once we control for their expectations. We conclude that sector regulators and agencies who wish to encourage consumer action need to differentiate their policies: strategies to emphasize potential gains and reduce anticipated switching time are the most likely to increase consumer activity, but programs need to be tailored to particular markets and target groups if they are to be effective in stimulating consumer activity.","[Price, Catherine Waddams] Univ E Anglia, CCP, Econ Regulat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Price, Catherine Waddams] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Zhu, Minyan] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Ind Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; University of Nottingham,"Price, CW (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, CCP, Econ Regulat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Price, CW (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Zhu, MY (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Ind Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",c.waddams@uea.ac.uk; minyan.zhu@nottingham.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Assistant Professor in Industrial Economics, Business School, University of Nottingham.

Using a sample of 162 twin A/B-shares issued by 81 listed firms, we find that the portfolio of B-shares, which are treated and held in large volumes, obtains a significant positive treatment effect of 2.08% relative to that of A-shares over a 3-day event window. The treatment effect indicates that the collective action problem undermines the compensatory function of the private enforcement system, which is the primary goal it was designed to achieve. In addition, we look into the determinants of the abnormal return between A/B-shares issued by the same firm and find that the efficiency of the regional court system is positively correlated with the magnitude of the abnormal return.

The recent approaches to railway institutional change in the leading economies of the world was guided by deregulation and liberalization of railway transport. Rail reform in the European Union aimed at a more open market and a clear division of roles between infrastructure managers and railway operators is well documented. The reforms taking place elsewhere in Europe received less attention. This paper deals with the reform of the Ukrainian Railways taking into account the difficult economic, political, social and financial environment the country is in. We analyzed the processes of institutional change in Ukraine and the effectiveness of this institutional change for the development of Ukrainian Railways. Theoretical concepts from institutional economics were applied to map how railway administration and railway players modify existing institutional arrangements to their interests. The analysis in this paper demonstrates the place-dependent nature of changes in the institutional organizational framework for the rail sector. The case of Ukrainian Railways supports this notion. Ukraine presents a unique case given the path dependence created by its former Soviet history, the great significance of rail in the national transport network and the role of industrial tycoons in cargo generation. We believe railway transport in Ukraine should not be exposed to shock reforms given its great importance to the national economy. However, further changes in the Ukrainian Railways institutional framework are needed to fit even better into the economic realities. We propose specific recommendations for the rail institutional framework adjustments in Ukraine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Transfers within a public transport trip are the least appreciated part of the trip. This research quantifies the experienced transfer disutility of a transfer between BTM and train. The influence of travel time, transfer time, headway, costs and station facilities on the valuation of a transfer is estimated, based on a web-based stated preference (SP) experiment with over 1145 respondents. A set of mixed logit models was estimated, including sub-models by trip purpose, travel frequency, access/egress mode and journey stage (access or egress). The modeling results show that the total disutility during the interchange depends on the total time, the distribution of the time spent (access, transfer, waiting time) and headway. In general, the most optimal transfer time is found to be 8 min, but relevant differences are found among respondents and stations. The highlighted preferences of different groups of travelers can be used by public transport service to meet the travelers' needs in a transfer, and decrease the transfer disutility.

According to Zohar (1980), safety climate perceptions are shared between employees on performance and commitment of management in terms of procedures, practices and security policies. Researchers believe that the level of safety climate has a relationship with the accident rate. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the level of safety climate in Pulp and Paper Industries. The study was conducted using questionnaires where the questionnaire was distributed to 100 respondents consisting of managers, executives, engineers, clerical and technicians in the organization. To support the result findings, Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), version 16.0 was used to analyze the result. The result was shown that, climate use a high level of safety. Safety climate was practicing in the organization with the value at 3.86. Thus it shows that, workers in Pulp and Paper Industries have a good awareness, have a positive attitude and behavior on issues related to safety practice. The result was supported that safety climate has relationship with the accident rate among workers at Pulp and Paper Industry.","[Ahmad, S.; Roslina, M.; Talib, Hayati Habibah Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, UTM Razak Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Jalan Sultan Yahya Petra, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ahmad, S (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, UTM Razak Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Jalan Sultan Yahya Petra, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",ahmadsallehl01@gmail.com; mroslina.kl@utm.my; hayati@utm.my,,,Ministry of Higher Education; MyBrain15 MyPhD Ministry of Higher Education; UTM Razak School of Engineering & Advanced Technology; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),Ministry of Higher Education(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)); MyBrain15 MyPhD Ministry of Higher Education; UTM Razak School of Engineering & Advanced Technology; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),"The authors wish to express the greatest appreciation and utmost gratitude to the Ministry of Higher Education, MyBrain15 MyPhD Ministry of Higher Education, UTM Razak School of Engineering & Advanced Technology and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for all the support given in making the study a success.",,10,0,0,0,1,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,195,199,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400033,0

If the concentration of the industry increases then small number of firms can dominate the industry, which could on the one hand increase the prices for customers. But it is not necessarily a negative situation as with the increase in firm size they may be able to benefit from economies of scale. Therefore, higher concentrated market may cause higher prices as well as higher profits and performance. This is likely to occur in industries with high fixed costs and scope for specialization as life insurance industry. Based on this assumption, we decided to reveal the presence of a link between the changes in the industry concentration and market performance. For the purpose of the analysis, we use life insurance industry data from the Slovak Republic during the period 1993-2012. During analyzed period, this industry has developed from monopolistic market with one dominant insurance company and few very small ones to competitive market with 19 insurance companies offering life insurance products in 2012. Our model proved that decreasing life insurance industry concentration increases profit and performance of the industry.","[Brokesova, Zuzana; Ondruska, Tomas; Pastorakova, Erika; Peliova, Jana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Brokesová, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",zuzana.brokesova@euba.sk; tomas.ondruska@euba.sk; erika.pastorakova@euba.sk; jana.peliova@euba.sk,"Peliova, Jana/AAQ-4757-2021","Peliova, Jana/0000-0002-0305-0906; Brokesova, Zuzana/0000-0002-9188-3720; Ondruska, Tomas/0000-0002-3134-6149; Pastorakova, Erika/0000-0003-1549-3664",,,,,24,1,1,1,13,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,29,37,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_3,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100003,0

Accepted standards and regulations require defining of key performance indicators, but the process and the method of their choice and the definition is optional to institutions. Higher education institutions are obligated to measure and track performance. They need to define key performance indicators, in accordance with the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG) and defined strategic goals. Tracking performance is important for program financing of higher education and performance monitoring of selected institution's program goals and higher education in general. For higher education institutions, it is important to monitor and improve the quality. For that purposes they need to develop adequate and comparable performance indicators. In order to create comparable indicators it is necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of performance measurement of related higher education institutions in Croatia and the European Higher Education Area. The basis for performance measurement is information that institution owns, acquires and processes. In order to be relevant, indicators need quality information basis for their measurement. This paper analyzes the current performance indicators of selected institutions from Croatia, Great Britain, Canada and Australia. Based on the analysis, as the result of work, we propose indicators for one higher education institution. Authors propose a methodology for development of indicators, as well as a way of measuring and monitoring performance.","[Budimir, Verica; Idlbek, Robert] Polytech Pozega, Social Dept, Pozega, Croatia; [Lutilsky, Ivana Drazic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Lutilsky, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Zagreb, Croatia.",vbudimir@vup.hr; idrazic@efzg.hr; ridlbek@vup.hr,"Idlbek, Robert/AFF-6073-2022; Idlbek, Robert/GYJ-0987-2022; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/I-2428-2018","Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/0000-0003-3562-9864",,,,,72,2,2,6,25,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,17,46,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_2,0.0,,,30,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800002,0

In a large set of in-sample and out-of-sample forecast exercises, we show that high yield spreads are not reliable predictors of future economic activity, as measured by the real gross domestic product and industrial production. Their predictive content for economic growth, which is statistically and economically significant between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the new century, vanishes in the second half of the 2000s. This disappearance is coincident with (i) structural breaks in the relationship, which largely occurred in the early years of the past decade and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and (ii) the reappearance of the leading properties of the term spread in recent years. In general, despite the recent deterioration of much of their predictive content, high yield spreads still tend to outperform the term spread for predicting economic growth at horizons of up to one year in both the in-sample and out-of-sample exercises, even after accounting for time-varying parameters in the model specifications.

Over time, the state can both intensively found companies and, later on, make decisions on company privatization based upon situation assessment. These processes are defined state-specific goals, needs, and the state, as the company owner, defines specific functions and tasks of the company. Bailey's (Bailey, 2010) statement: As the regulatory movement of the 1930s reflected the view that market failure was pervasive, so the deregulation movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s reflected the view that economic regulation of prices and entry was a government failure, generating misallocations and inefficiencies. The Latvian government has also admitted that involvement of public persons in commercial operation creates the risk of market disturbance. The main economically justified purpose of a public person participation in a capital company is the elimination of market deficiencies and, thereby, enhancement of public welfare. Up until now, this sector in Latvia has been relatively poorly researched - operation of state-owned companies, therefore the aim of the research is to analyse the state-owned companies, their establishment purposes and scope of operation, for example, the number of employees, state capital investments and profit during two periods of time (1920s-1940s and the period after Latvia regained its independence). In addition, the research gather the main reasons and economic aspects, which are the reason for establishing the state companies in Latvia during the respective period of time, as well as the risks and problems identified in respect to their management and control. For comparison, also the data on state-owned companies located outside the state were summarized. In the research qualitative analysis methods were used - analysis of scientific literature, normative acts and historical sources, as well as quantitative analysis methods - analysis of statistical data. Both in the 20th and 21st century, profit-making is not the main argument for the state during the process of company establishment, as the owner. Survey results show that, the state invested more in companies than received from them. The reasons of establishment can be found in the economic and historical situation, for example, takeover of companies owned by other states, and in the social aspect, for example, companies operating in the hospital sector or cultural sector where a private owner is not able to make profits sufficient enough for the company operation and development. Certain of examined sectors the operating volumes of state-owned companies are relatively significant.","[Gasune, Dzintra; Denins, Andris] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Gasune, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",dzintra.gasune@inbox.lv,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,267,278,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200023,0

The co-operative model of stakeholder management is examined as a possible mitigating organisational form in this high-conflict environment. International experience indicates some success with co-operative models but they are not easy to implement effectively and face severe obstacles. Trust and knowledge sharing are critical for enabling a co-operative model of stakeholder management, which requires strong governance and adherence to strict rules. The model must balance the tension between optimisation of governance structures and responsiveness to members' needs. Furthermore, support from social and political institutions is necessary. We find barriers to scalability which manifest in the lack of depth of business skills, negative perception of the co-operative model by external stakeholders, government ambivalence, and a lack of willingness on the part of workers to co-operate for mutual benefit.","[Hammond, Darrell; Luiz, John] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Hammond, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Rondebosch, South Africa.",,"Luiz, John/AAU-9761-2020; Luiz, John M/B-5554-2008","Luiz, John/0000-0003-3806-4424; Luiz, John M/0000-0003-3806-4424",,,,,37,2,4,0,13,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This study examined the sightseeing tour buses' service quality factors according to 27 parameters applied as criteria for evaluating and improving service. Data were gathered from 3387 teachers and educational staff involved with educational field trips. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) classified the parameters into three groups: vehicles, drivers and crews, and management factors. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the factor structure. The findings verified that the 27 parameters can indicate three perspectives of quality performance. CFA loading scores were quite high, implying that the parameters had strong potential usefulness for assessing sightseeing bus service quality. Likewise, the second-order CFA found that the three aforementioned latent variables are powerful indicators of tour service quality level at the 0.01 significance level. In this regard, the factor of vehicles exhibited the largest CFA loading (beta=0.935).

Project management plays an important role in different fields of human life. The amount of resources spent on a project renders management of these resources a sensitive task. Determinant factors' influencing the payoffs of a project mainly encompasses time, cost, quality and also the risk of each activity. Therefore, a critical path method is presented to find the longest path of a project completion time in order to draw managers' attention to the critical activities. Critical path method is a well-known and widely accepted method to find the critical activities of a project and to concentrate on them for accomplishment of the project without any deviation. Classical critical path methods usually consider only a time factor, but growing complexity and importance of projects entail cost, quality and risk as the critical factors to be considered in project management. Due to the unavailability of certain information relating each factor of each activity, considering a novel approach to deal with such vague and unstable situations is really a controversial issue. Thus, another challenge of the project management contains uncertainty for approximating time, cost, quality, and risk factors of the project activities. Taking into account these two challenges, a grey multi-objective critical path model is proposed in this paper, where parameters of the activities are evaluated as grey numbers, dealing with their uncertainty. Meanwhile, a goal programming based method is illustrated to solve the problem of critical path identification, considering four considerable criteria including time, cost, quality, and risk. Eventually, a numerical example is represented to address applicability of the proposed method.","[Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran 14174, Iran; [Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi] Khatam Inst Higher Educ, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Hashemi, Shide Sadat] Saramadan Andisheh Avina Co, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Tehran; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Mahdiraji, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran 14174, Iran.;Hajiagha, SHR (通讯作者)，Khatam Inst Higher Educ, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran.;Hashemi, SS (通讯作者)，Saramadan Andisheh Avina Co, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran.;Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania.",h.amoozad@ut.ac.ir; s.razavi@khatam.ac.ir; shide_hashemi@yahoo.com; Edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/AAT-9996-2020; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/0000-0002-8382-6603; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,45,10,11,2,25,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This chapter compares the export performance of these two groups of countries in the period 2000s through the analysis of two specific representative countries: Portugal and Poland. The study is based on a Constant Market Share analysis, which allows to decompose the export growth into several components; and a combination of revealed comparative indexes with a geographical orientation measure. We conclude that while Poland registered a great and impressive export performance across the analyzed period, increasing around 100 % the country's market share to the EU15, Portugal has evolved in the opposite direction, with an average market share decrease of 7 %. Although it was not the only factor, we conclude that Poland's competitiveness effect was essential to explain Poland's increasing industries export share.

They assume that bilateral trade is directly proportional to economic sizes (usually described in terms of GDP or income) of both trading partners and inversely proportional to their distance. The aim of this study was to examine Germany's latest (2012) yearly aggregate exports to its major international partners by a gravity equation without and with selected trade frictions including a geographical adjacency (the so called border effect), an influence of the same or different currency (Euro), and a location in the Schengen Area, the zone of a free movement of persons. Gravity models both without and with selected trade frictions fitted the data well, while the model with frictions performed significantly better. The adjacency was found the most important single trade friction, the location in the Schengen Area appeared to be the least important friction (but it was still statistically significant). Other feasible trade frictions, such as border length, a location in Europe or democracy index were examined too, but their effect on the trade was rather negligible. A possible explanation of the border effect, based on information deficiency, is included in the study as well. Furthermore, it was observed that yearly Germany's exports data are susceptible to large year-to-year fluctuations especially for countries with low imports. Therefore, using averaged data over five or ten years long periods might be more appropriate.","[Mazurek, Jiri] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Mazurek, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math Methods Econ, Opava, Czech Republic.",mazurek@opf.slu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019","Mazurek, Jiri/0000-0002-7965-0457","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2015.",,25,2,2,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Likewise, numerous studies have concentrated on how government in particular, through a small business policy, can be instrumental in providing business support. This article evaluates South Africa's small business policy by concentrating on its objectives, outputs and outcomes. Studies evaluating small business policy according to its objectives, outputs and outcomes, have been limited. Such policy evaluation goes beyond merely reporting to understanding why certain phenomena take place. As an emerging economy, South Africa is in dire need of well-developed policies. This article proposes that understanding the link between small business policy and the age and location of a business may help government to refine policy formulation and design. Using a survey method and cross-sectional research design, the sample size of 340 respondents consisted of start-up and established business owners. This study found that not the age of the business, but only its location (the metropolitan municipality where the business is located) has a statistically significant effect on the objectives, outputs and outcomes of the small business policy. These findings should assist both national and international policymakers to identify specific context-bound interventions relevant to the location of businesses with a view to improving them.","[Moos, Menisha; Botha, Melodi] Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Moos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Botha, Melodi/0000-0002-4014-9729; Moos, Menisha (nee Adams)/0000-0002-9051-1052",,,,,39,2,6,1,10,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Their activities are constrained by economic policies, which are aimed at increasing employment and the efficiency of the labour markets. Our analysis uses a questionnaire to collect data from the institutions and evaluate their perception of the regional labour market. The results suggest that active employment policy instruments and passive policy instruments are perceived as inefficient and inappropriate. The unemployed usually have no previous job experience, completed only primary education and are not willing to travel to work. The pressing problem is the quality of education and the generous social benefits that makes employment policy inefficient for the least skilled unemployed. Despite substantial regional socio-economic differences in both analysed regions (the Ustecky Region and the Jihocesky Region), there are no significant differences in the poor evaluation of all the traditional active employment policy instruments. In the more problematic Ustecky Region the emphasis is put on basic issues such as the lack of education and experience of the unemployed. The local labour market issues are dictated by long-term factors such as the lack of job vacancies. In the Jihocesky Region the situation is better. The issue is more one of mobility. The market issues here are more related to the appropriateness of secondary and tertiary education and labour costs. To increase the efficiency of employment policies we recommend improvements to the institutional infrastructure in higher education, which should be oriented towards investment in the quality of human capital.","[Novak, Vaclav] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Usti Nad Labem Mesto, Czech Republic; [Vokoun, Marek; Stellner, Frantisek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Vochozka, Marek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Rector, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice; Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Novák, V (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Usti Nad Labem Mesto, Czech Republic.",vaclav.novak@ujep.cz; marekvokoun@email.cz; stellner@mail.vstecb.cz; vochozka@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019; Vokoun, Marek/AAI-3302-2020","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814; Vokoun, Marek/0000-0001-5659-3085; Stellner, Frantisek/0000-0002-8519-8401",,,,,28,31,31,2,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Changes in technology have influenced engineers' career expectations to upgrade specific skills and general competencies to suit engineering demands. Reducing EO from the individual level has been shown to be related to adverse effects in engineers' behavioral intention to leave current jobs. Therefore, this paper fills the gaps in the literature by discussing the emerging role of engineers as entrepreneurs in the context of EO from an individual analysis. In addition, this present paper discusses the relationships between individual EO (innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy and risk-taking) and talent retention among engineers. Multi behaviors and roles of engineers-entrepreneurs are important factors for confronting engineering task-related problems and the wide exercise of engineers-entrepreneurs dual roles will impact engineers' technical knowledge and non-technical routines. There is strong evidence that individual EO dimensions can be used for measuring engineers' entrepreneurial behaviors and to predict positive behavioral intentions toward current employments. In, conclusion, developing engineers as potential entrepreneurs is a crucial organizational entrepreneurial strategy and understanding engineers' behavioral expectations will impact greater career satisfaction and retention.","[Osman, Idris; Noordin, Fauziah; Daud, Normala] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Business & Management, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Osman, I (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Fac Business & Management, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",idrisphd2015@gmail.com; fauziah716@salam.uitm.edu.my; normala648@salam.uitm.edu.my,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,7,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,544,553,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400090,0

Each bank in the syndicate takes part with its own share of financing, the aim being to distribute the credit risk among the participating banks. In the last decade syndicated loans turned into one of the most dynamically developing segments of the global debt market. The annual volume of syndicated loans in 2015 reached the sum of 4.7 trillion USD compared to 1.8 trillion USD in the year of crisis 2009. Syndicated loans contribute considerably to economic development because they provide an important part of financing of large capital investments in industrial production, services and the public sector. The trends in the volumes of provided loans, their distribution according to sectors and purposes, setting prices of contracts and setting up the syndicate composition are the basic factors for providing a clear indication for the investment activity, market situation and the expectations of key investors. The main purpose of the research lies in discovering the post-crisis challenges for the syndicated loan market development in Europe. The analysis of the regional and sector profiles of the provided syndicated loans in Europe in the 2009-2015 period sends contradictory messages that suggest pessimism rather than optimism. Based on that, the focus of the research widens to include issues about the evolution in the philosophy of syndicated financing, the development of the elements of the syndicated composition, the necessity to update the tools of risk management, the use of buffers and non-price compensatory mechanisms and the opportunities for making corrections in the price setting of the syndicated loan agreement.","[Petrov, Dancho] Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Petrov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria.",danchopetrov@abv.bg,"Petrov, Dancho/AAC-7557-2019","Petrov, Dancho/0000-0001-6085-1702",,,,,25,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,532,540,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200045,0

A qualitative research based on content analysis research method was used in order to achieve the objectives of the study.

Nowadays, the challenges the higher education institutions are facing are large and complex and involve, it seems, changes regarding the strategic approach, but also rapid changes in operational terms. The other important topic of the paper, online marketing, is also a relatively new one in the academic literature.

We investigate the differentiation of the average pension and the income of the elderly, caused by such factors as area of residence and gender. The analysis shows that the current pension system in Russia at the level of regions of Russia can be characterized as egalitarian. Differences in the average size of pensions and their ratio to the cost of living between regions of Russia (regions of the Siberian Federal District as an example) were revealed, but the differences between leading regions and region-outsiders does not exceed 27% in 2015. The average monthly pension of male in Russia is slightly higher than that of women. Our research confirms this thesis and shows statistically significant differences in the average income of elderly people by gender in Tomsk region. Statistically significant is the excess of income of retired men over women income in most surveyed areas of Tomsk region. The results of our study may be implemented to improve public care and social support of pensioners in Russian Federation and its regions in difficult economic situation. It is necessary to keep the current level of pensions to the subsistence minimum ratio, which fell slightly in 2015. We hope that the indexation of pensions in 2016 will increase its real value.

The regeneration of brownfields has recently become an important issue for general public as well. This paper aims to comment on the perception of local brownfields among the population of the city of Karvina (population 55 thousand, the Czech Republic). The presented research was based on the questionnaire survey that was conducted from November 2015 till March 2016. The first part of the paper presents theoretical approaches linked to economic, social and environmental aspects of brownfields regeneration with a special attention to the Central European conditions and specifics of post-industrial cities. The following part shortly presents the city of Karvina where the research was performed, and then the research results are presented.

In the long-term perspective quite a high unemployment rate can be recorded in the region, and it is primarily job opportunities that is expected from the new use of the contemporary brownfields.

There are very few studies dealing with determinants that affect job satisfaction in the Czech Republic. The studies published so far show that the Czech Republic has ranked and still ranks among the states with the lowest level of satisfaction. The aim of this study is to answer the research question whether changing trends in the level of pay and fringe benefits correlates to overall job satisfaction, or satisfaction with pay and fringe benefits. Pay and fringe benefits are significant determinants that affect job satisfaction. The results of the study show that they lower the overall level of job satisfaction since the average level of these determinants is lower than the average level of overall job satisfaction. Overall job satisfaction is increased by other factors, such as supervision, co-workers, nature of work and communication, whose average level of satisfaction exceeds 4.00. Therefore, the emerging trend of rising pay levels is definitely good for increase the level of overall job satisfaction. On the other hand, it is impossible to prove that changing trends in pay correlates to overall job satisfaction, which is also significantly affected by other determinants. It would be suitable, within the framework of further surveys, to expand the area of examination to include additional determinants, such as family life satisfaction, or to examine how job satisfaction affects life satisfaction.

Compared to 1998, however, in 2013 the regional gaps increased. There are significant orientations of the population employment and the number of employees towards the services sector determining these way changes of the economic profile for some regions.

The results of binominal logit regression show that the Central European migrants exhibit different self-employment propensity than migrants from former Yugoslavia, Russian and Kazakhstan, Turkey and Italy, with the self-employment aversion especially strong among Romanians. These differences remain substantial even after controlling for social and human capital endowment of the individuals.

We use anonymised micro data from Labour Force Survey to measure the gender wage gap in Latvia and identify the factors behind it. Our results imply that gender wage gap decreased during the economic crisis and increased afterwards thus exhibiting procyclical behaviour. In 2007 men on average earned around 25% more than women. In 2009 the difference shrank to 10% and then rose again to 14% in 2014. Oaxaca-Ransom decomposition results reveal that on average around one fourth of the observed gender wage gap is explained by differences in characteristics while the rest remains unexplained. The most important factor in explaining the gender wage gap is the segregation by sectors, which is partly offset with higher education levels for women (albeit segregation by fields of education is significantly in favour of men). Gender segregation by occupational groups worked in favour of men before the economic crisis but afterwards this factor ceased to be important. Our results imply that with equal characteristics as well as distributions by sectors, occupational groups and fields of education, men would earn approximately 10% more than women. Furthermore, we show that the observed gender wage gap is statistically significant in all deciles of wage distribution. Moreover, gender wage gap seems to be increasing with wage.","[Vilerts, Karlis] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Krasnopjorovs, Olegs] Bank Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Vilerts, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",Karlis.Vilerts@bank.lv,"Krasnopjorovs, Olegs/AAS-1279-2021",,,,,,17,2,2,1,6,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,917,927,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200078,0

This paper considers the role of independent franchisee associations in franchising relationships as a means to test for the presence of bargaining power effects. We find that the presence or absence of a franchisee association is significantly related to each of three key contractual and relationship characteristics: contract duration, noncompete stringency, and terminations/nonrenewals. This suggests that bargaining power should be accounted for in studies of contract structure and relationship outcomes.","[Argyres, Nicholas] Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Bercovitz, Janet] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Argyres, N (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, One Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",argyres@wustl.edu; jbercov@illinois.edu,,,,,,,56,21,24,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

DMA/DMS allows not solely for coefficients to change over time, but also for changes in the entire forecasting model over time. DMA/DMS provides on average the best inflation forecasts with regard to alternative approaches (such as the random walk). DMS outperforms DMA. These results are robust for different sample periods and for various forecast horizons. The paper highlights common features between the USA and the EA. First, two groups of predictors forecast inflation:temporary fundamentals that have a frequent impact on inflation but only for short time periods; and persistent fundamentals whose switches are less frequent over time. Second, the importance of some variables (particularly international food commodity prices, house prices and oil prices) as predictors for consumer price index inflation increases when such variables experience large shocks. The paper also shows that significant differences prevail in the forecasting models between the USA and the EA. Such differences can be explained by the structure of these respective economies.

The argument that excessively low interest rates were responsible for the rapid increase in house prices over the last decade has received considerable attention in the literature. However, few papers have attempted to quantify the extent of house price overvaluation in countries that have seen housing booms and busts, in addition to quantifying the looseness of monetary policy. For a sample of 10 OECD countries, we estimate fundamental house prices using demand and supply side characteristics of the housing market. This is supplemented with analysis of price to rent ratios and fundamental price to rent ratios. Loose monetary policy is defined as the deviation of the short-term interest rate from the rate which the Taylor rule would prescribe. The empirical results suggest that for some countries deviations from the Taylor rule played a role in the surge in house prices and that a monetary policy stance less discretionary and more closely aligned with a Taylor rule could curtail some of the imbalance in the housing market.","[O'Meara, Graeme] Indecon Int Econ Consultants, Dublin, Ireland",,"O'Meara, G (通讯作者)，Indecon Int Econ Consultants, Dublin, Ireland.",gomeara@tcd.ie,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,10,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Based on profitability of assets (ROA), we determine using panel data econometric and logit response models the components of profit and loss accounts that generated profitability as well as the factors leading to some entities to ask for aid. The analyses show that before the beginning of the crisis there were significant differences between entities that needed aid and those that did not. The most profitable banks grounded their success in the traditional revenue components of financial institutions (such as margin on interest rates and commissions), as well as in revenues obtained from participated companies and extraordinary results. The model offers a tool to detect entities in difficulties in advance, reducing the financial and social costs of public interventions.

Today, economic analysis is being used to examine more traditional legal issues. This article explores one such traditional legal issue by applying economic methodology to the legislative-judicial interaction or bargaining game. The purpose of this article is to determine the impact of judicial interpretation on regulatory legislation. Most studies of the political economy of regulation have focused on elected politicians (e.g., Congressmen), ignoring the role of the courts. Yet, judges interpret the law and may, in the extreme, reverse legislative decisions. Studying the influence of the judiciary on the legislature's regulatory decisions remains an unexplored but important issue. The model allows us to address a variety of issues central to national policy making, for example, how the court influences legislative choices. We focus on an issue raised in the legal literature and in judicial opinions. Suppose a regulatory statute has been altered or reinterpreted by the courts, and we then observe that Congress does not act to change the court ruling. What can we infer from this lack of action? Many prominent political and legal scholars conclude that this inaction indicates acceptability by a majority of legislators. Because there exists no analytical foundation for assessing how judicial decisions affect legislative decision making over regulatory issues, however, such conclusions rest on questionable assumptions. The purpose of this article is to develop a formal economic model of legislative-judicial interaction. The model allows us to predict the circumstances in which Congress will and will not change judicial decisions. The model shows that congressional inaction is not a sign of acceptability by a majority of legislators. Instead, congressional inaction is a consequence of congressional structure and procedures: committees play an important role here, as does bicameralism. This model will be used to explore and explain the legislative events surrounding the Supreme Court decision Grove City College v. Bell (1984), a case involving statutory interpretation and the Department of Education's regulatory provisions prohibiting sex discrimination.

A sample of 2253 undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) collected through a web-based survey is used for this study. Results from cross-tabulation analysis and logistic regression indicate that parking-pass purchase decisions are largely determined by students' car ownership, daily car-use habits, and faster mobility needs despite viable alternatives. Conversely purchase decisions have little relation to gender, race/ethnicity, income, and environmental concerns. Holding a parking pass fulfilled students' aspirations seeking safety, reliability, flexibility, spontaneity, and mobility. Most importantly, socio-economic status and psychological motives of car use have the greatest magnitude of predicting parking-permit purchases, while the built environment where students live has a minor influence.

Using a new dataset covering about 80 % of all patent litigation cases in Germany between 2000 and 2008 we estimate the likelihood of within-trial settlement. We find that the within-trial settlement decision is to some degree driven by the proceedings that change the pre-trial setting of the negotiations in terms of information and stakes and make previously refused settlement a new option. Additionally, firm-specific stakes as measured by the relation of the involved parties to the disputed patent as well as firm-specific strategies are found to affect the general willingness to settle after the filing of a court case. The results suggest that pre-trial failure of settlement negotiations can to some extent be offset by within-trial settlement through efforts made by the court, but that the disposition to settle is to a larger degree determined by firm-specific stakes and strategies in the case.","[Cremers, Katrin; Schliessler, Paula] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Schliessler, Paula] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); KU Leuven,"Schliessler, P (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",cremers@zew.de; schliessler@zew.de,,,Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) within the Research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); Thyssen Foundation,Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) within the Research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK); Thyssen Foundation,We are grateful for the funding of this research project by the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) within the Research program Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies (SEEK) and by the Thyssen Foundation.,,27,16,16,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Recent evidence has shown that commercial connectivity goes through cycles, due to providers regularly disconnecting their customers. We model these cycles as being a result of the providers' limited ability to monitor their customers' contractual compliance. Based on twelve years of quarterly observations, we estimate the impacts of key covariates on the probability of starting a connectivity war. Following a choice model approach, we use different econometric specifications to test the model implications. Our results predict that the asymmetry between customers and providers, which increases the incentives to abuse connectivity, and the history of past connections, which affects mutual trust and information asymmetries, are the main factors in determining the probability of providers starting a connectivity war, thus helping to explain the cycles that are observed in Internet connectivity.

This is the case even though the CBC's short-term inflation forecasts do not seem to contain any additional information that is of use for PFs when making their predictions.

This paper explores whether there are in fact long-term consequences by investigating intergenerational effects of parental ethnic identity on the next generation's human capital accumulation. Results based on longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) indicate a positive role of both parental majority as well as minority identity. I find differential parental roles with impacts of majority identity working through mothers and minority identity effects being specific to fathers. While the positive effect of maternal majority identity appears to be closely related to language skills, the beneficial effect of paternal minority identity is consistent throughout various robustness checks and likely to be related to higher levels of children's feelings of self-esteem. Overall, the results point at integrated, rather than separated or assimilated family environments to be most conductive for educational success of the second generation.","[Schueller, Simone] FBK IRVAPP, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schueller, Simone] IZA, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Fondazione Bruno Kessler; FBK-IRVAPP - Research Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Schüller, S (通讯作者)，FBK IRVAPP, Via Santa Croce 77, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",schueller@fbk.eu,"Schueller, Simone/ABD-7909-2020","Schueller, Simone/0000-0002-9842-6258",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The survey data used in this paper were made available by the Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin).

Capital cities are now central to the problems faced by national economies in Europe, and appear to have exacerbated the adverse effects of the crisis.

I investigate the impacts of a criminal procedure reform in the Czech Republic that allowed certain less serious offenses to be prosecuted via a simplified (fast-track) procedure. The share of cases actually prosecuted via the fast-track procedure varied substantially across police districts and offenses, which provides the basis for the identification strategy. The shorter procedure had very different effects on ordinary crimes reported by the victims compared with crimes that are identified mostly by police enforcement efforts. Specifically, it led to a substantial increase in the number of recorded criminal offenses associated with driving. This finding is best rationalized by a reallocation of police enforcement effort towards crimes that have low enforcement costs. I also find some, albeit rather weak, evidence of a deterrent effect on burglary and embezzlement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We find that fully qualified firms in a position to choose whether to subcontract generally offer lower prices than partially qualified firms, which must proceed with mandatory subcontracts.

Moreover, the paper analyses the key dimensions explaining the different service models at sectoral level: structural change, knowledge and innovation, internationalisation and competition restrictions. The main result shows that structural composition of countries plays a prominent role, while heterogeneity is driven by dissimilarities in knowledge bases and innovative efforts across Europe.","[Di Meglio, Gisela] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Quantitat Econ 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Pyka, Andreas] Univ Hohenheim, Lehrstuhl Innovat Okon, Stuttgart, Germany; [Rubalcaba, Luis] Univ Alcala de Henares, Appl Econ Dept, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; University Hohenheim; Universidad de Alcala,"Di Meglio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Quantitat Econ 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",gdimeglio@ccee.ucm.es; a.pyka@uni-hohenheim.de; luis.rubalcaba@uah.es,"DI MEGLIO, Gisela/U-2583-2019; Rubalcaba, Luis/AAW-9204-2020; Rubalcaba, Luis/AAQ-8219-2020; Pyka, Andreas/IST-6329-2023","Rubalcaba, Luis/0000-0001-5724-9091; Pyka, Andreas/0000-0001-6207-6690; Di Meglio, Gisela/0000-0001-6184-167X",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding through the ServPPIN project: The Contribution of Public and Private Services to European Growth and Welfare, and the Role of Public-Private Innovation Networks, Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities Programme of the EU 7th Framework Programme.",,31,1,1,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

A given model can be fitted according to either a multi-step or a one-step forecast error criterion, and we show here that discrepancies in performance between direct and iterative forecasting arise chiefly from the method of fitting, and is dictated by the nuances of the model's misspecification. We derive new formulas for quantifying iterative forecast MSE, and present a new approach for assessing asymptotic forecast MSE. Finally, the direct and iterative methods are compared on a retail series, which illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

A retailer may either choose to integrate backward with a small firm (insourcing) or rely on a national brand manufacturer (outsourcing) to produce its private label. The trade-off between insourcing and outsourcing strategies is a choice between too much or too little innovation (i.e., quality investment) on the private label. When insourcing, an outside-option effect leads the retailer to overinvest to increase its buyer power. When outsourcing, a hold-up effect leads to underinvestment.

The Hobbesian outlook would be that people violate the law in the absence of appropriate punishment. John Stuart Mill would have attributed the violation to the lack of incentives to behave legally. In this paper, we combine these two factors to examine the effect of antitrust regulation on price competition. We examine the case of public drug procurement in St. Petersburg, Russia between 2008 and 2010. Our results highlight that the Russian Federal Antitrust Service was unable to enforce competitive bidding when the main regulators interpreted the competition law differently. The Committee for Public Health in St. Petersburg notably leveraged the loopholes in antitrust enforcement and successfully maintained illegal relationships with different economic agents. We use data on Russian drug procurement to illustrate these effects.

Consumers naturally form attachments to their possessions. However, at the extreme end of the attachment spectrum, these attachments can undermine a consumer's well-being. This study describes attachment styles exhibited by consumers who sought help from trained professional organizers (POs) to help them achieve their de-cluttering goals. Narrative case descriptions were compiled from 28 trained POs across the United States using an Internet survey with mostly open-ended questions. Interpretive analysis demonstrates how POs craft strategies to help clients let go of meaningful goods by considering the client's unique attachment profile and the temporal relevance of possessions to self.

Patents support the establishment of the market in several key ways. First, patents provide a system of intellectual property (IP) rights that increases transaction efficiencies and stimulates competition by offering exclusion, transferability, disclosure, certification, standardization, and divisibility. Second, patent transfers constitute what the article terms the market for innovative control that provides incentives for efficient investment in invention, innovation, and complementary assets. Third, patents as intangible real assets promote the financing of invention and innovation. The market foundation role of patents refutes the economically incorrect rewards view of patents. The discussion considers how economic benefits of the market for inventions should guide IP policy and antitrust policy.","Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, Dept Strategy, Int Business, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Spulber, DF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, JL Kellogg Grad Sch Management, Dept Strategy, Int Business, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jems@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Spulber, Daniel F/A-8722-2009","Spulber, Daniel F/0000-0003-2697-6522",,,,,145,27,27,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We investigate the weak association between financial knowledge and behavior by simultaneously testing the roles financial knowledge, parental influence, and individual psychological characteristics (self-discipline and thoroughness) play in young adults' financial behaviors. Results from 2,712 respondents from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth confirm there is a weak association between financial knowledge and behavior. Parental influence and self-discipline positively associate with responsible financial behavior. We also investigate the moderating role of gender and observe that financial knowledge and parental influence improve women's financial behavior more than men, whereas being thorough has a larger impact among males. These findings suggest that considering social and individual psychological factors in financial education programs could improve program efficiency. The results also highlight the importance of adopting tailored financial education to suit gender differences.","[Tang, Ning; Baker, Andrew; Peter, Paula C.] San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Tang, N (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",ntang@mail.sdsu.edu; abaker@mail.sdsu.edu; ppeter@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,75,54,70,3,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

We analyse which factors should be considered to increase acceptability in the case of the Spanish city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. We applied a three-stage methodology: first a qualitative survey using focus groups, second Likert scales and exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 89 individuals, and finally, a stated choice (SC) experiment to a different sample of 206 respondents to value their preferences. The SC experiment was designed as a cordon-price scheme, including system features and considering three different uses for revenues: improving the current bus transport system, creating an underground line and increasing green areas in the city. Our qualitative analysis shows the previous resistance to accept any charging system, the lack of confidence on politicians and stresses the importance given to the use of revenues. On the other hand, values obtained from the SC experiment suggest that that public acceptability relies on the characteristics of the congestion charging scheme. In particular more than one third of the population would be willing to pay a daily fare of 2.22 if revenues from the system were used to increase the size of green areas instead of reinvesting this into the transport system.

The estimation of Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures and comparative analyses was carried out by using a narrow-sample strategy. The estimated positions on each dimension confirmed the Hofstede's original research ranking. The result with significant value was the confirmation of the global trend of decreasing power distance and significant movement towards the individualism. Besides the standardization procedure of comparative cross-cultural analyses, variance analyses were used to identify cultural differences in decision-making styles related to complex decisions. The proposition is that complex decisions are, above and beyond all others, the consequence of social and cultural values installed in every individual. Statistically significant dependency was identified for hyper-vigilant and vigilant decision-making style and national culture's dimensions. A beneficial goal was to identify the differences and the similarities in value orientation and those in the decision-making style which should not be mistreated as they may influence future business cooperation and political and economic integrations within the CEE context.","[Dabic, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Econ, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Dabic, Marina] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England; [Tipuric, Darko; Podrug, Najla] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Org, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham; University of Zagreb,"Dabic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Int Econ, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",mdabic@efzg.hr,"Dabic, Marina/L-9040-2019; Podrug, Najla/GZA-6894-2022; Dabic, Marina/E-6728-2014; Tipuric, Darko/H-8301-2018; Podrug, Najla/H-9134-2018","Dabic, Marina/0000-0001-8374-9719; Tipuric, Darko/0000-0001-8785-0179; Podrug, Najla/0000-0001-5920-4874",,,,,42,18,24,3,91,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Spouse quality declines from first to second marriage under both rules, but selection into first marriage is unambiguously better under unilateral divorce, which should reduce long-run divorce. An improvement in outside options amplifies the selectivity advantage of unilateral divorce provided the majority of the population marries. If the value of outside options is projected to continue rising, marriage and divorce rates should continue to fall.","[Bac, Mehmet] Sabanci Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Bac, M (通讯作者)，Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",bac@sabanciuniv.edu,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

This paper concentrates on Assessing tourists' underlying characteristics and the changes in their transportation and lodging choices based on the introduction of Taiwan's new high-speed rail system. The researchers conduct the multinomial logit model (MNL) in drawing the tourists' characteristics, the elasticity and cross-elasticity and the value of time of the tourists. The results indicate that many people still prefer their private cars although Taiwan's new high-speed rail system has helped to alleviate some traffic issues. Overall, in-vehicle time appears to have had a comparative impact on travelers since high-speed rail began operating. This result reflects that tourists came to highly value their travel time after this new transit system became an option. Further, tourists were more sensitive to the changed travel costs following the introduction of high-speed rail. The results offer initial insight from a policy perspective that aim to control tourism transportation mode choices.","[Shyr, Oliver F.; Chao, Chen-Wei; Huang, Chun-Kai] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Chao, CW (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Urban Planning, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",kukupica@gmail.com,,,"National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC [NSC96-2415-H-006-015-SS2]","National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC, under Grant NSC96-2415-H-006-015-SS2.",,11,3,3,1,45,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Evidence worldwide shows that people who commit other offenses characteristic of antisocial attitudes are more likely to have road traffic accidents and infringe traffic laws. We examine the records of the 28 current member states of the European Union over the 1999-2010 period. Our aim is to test the hypothesis that crime rates (and specifically, motor vehicle-related crimes) can be considered as predictors of fatal road traffic accidents. If they can be, this could be prima facie justification, at least, of the trend in several countries to consider traffic offenses as crimes in their penal codes and to toughen the punishment imposed on those who commit them. The effect of the severity of the legal system applied to traffic offenses is also analyzed. From a geographical point of view, our results reveal that road traffic fatality rates are higher in countries where the behavior of the inhabitants is more aggressive, while the rates are lower in countries with more severe penal systems.

First, it tries to investigate the comparative responsiveness of different kinds of crime to the deterrence variables and verify the hypothesis that visceral factors are more influential on the committing of violent crimes through surveying 15 empirical studies. The result of this survey verified that violent crimes are less responsive to the deterrence variables than non-violent crimes. Relatively higher influence of visceral factors on the committing of violent crimes can be considered through lower amounts for crime supply's punishment and probability of apprehension elasticities in the Becker's model. Optimality in this framework implies that these crimes should be punished leniently that implicitly indicates that expected punishment doesn't work as deterrent in this case. From a policy making point of view, because visceral factors play a strong role in committing violent crimes, severe punishment may be ineffective and preventive policies addressing the roots of violent, visceral crimes may represent a superior alternative.","Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Ghasemi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",ghasemi@unisi.it,"Ghasemi, Mojtaba/R-1877-2019",,,,,,25,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

An online survey was conducted, using e-mail and social networks, of wine consumers in one of the 14 regions of the Czech Republic. This resulted in a sample of n=237. Spearman's correlation test was conducted to find correlations between wine consumption and age and the chi-square test for differences between genders. Four motivations were found to be significantly correlated with age to be sociable, to be respected, because wine is considered healthy and because it belongs with a nice meal, as well as seven factors affecting wine purchase label, provenance, brand/producer, vintage, design of the bottle, recommendations of salesperson and a preference for the lowest priced wines. As the majority of respondents came from one of the 14 Czech regions, generalizations for the whole Czech Republic cannot be made. It is recommended that future work should include more complex segmentation.

Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis are used to interpret and identify the existence of significant relationship between these variables and REIT return. Results show that REITs dividend yield is positively associated with market capitalization except in 2010-2011. This is possibly due to the size of latest REITs listed(exceeding RM1 billion each) which provided lower initial dividend yield. Market capitalization has low correlation with all property types except commercial properties. Malaysian REITs are mainly concentrated on specialized property types. However, there is an increasing diversification trend throughout the sample period although diversified REITs still hold more than 50% of their portfolio on a single property type.","[Jalil, Rohaya Abdul; Ali, Hishamuddin Mohd; Lee; Janice, Y.

This shift is especially notable among young Americans who are driving less, buying fewer cars, and settling in urban areas where they can walk, bike, and use public transport. Meanwhile, baby boomers, though driving more than previous generations did at the same age, are joining this urbanizing trend and, as they grow older, seeking mobility alternatives to car dependence. Other trends, such as the transformation of society by mobile communication and digital technology, are also affecting change and forcing planners to re-think the current imbalance of the U.S. transport system. Using the success revealed by passenger rail services in the Northeast Corridor, this paper examines how high-speed rail and its station hubs could enhance urbanization and help to rebalance the three main passenger modes road, air, and rail so that each flourishes within its most sustainable niche. In these ways, the benefits of HSR extend beyond rail service itself to include this mode's ability to reinvent the transportation system in ways that better serve the needs of a changing society while urgently addressing livability and sustainability.

Contrary to the widely received notion that in Mencian-Confucianism the right to subsistence has an overriding value vis-a-vis civil-political rights, I argue that Mencius (and Confucians in general for that matter) never stipulated such a lexical ranking among rights.

Firstly, we performed a quantitative analysis of the Czech and Polish capital market in order to draw attention to certain specific issues existing on these markets between 2000 and 2012. Next, we compared internal IPO characteristics on the particular capital markets with the empirical evidence on IPOs in the Central and Eastern Europe- and EU-wide capital markets. Our results indicate the favourable development of fundamental capital market indicators on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. This could be seen as a signal of increasing market attractiveness for both investors and potential issuers (IPO candidates) and thereby accelerate IPO activity.

Data was gathered using structured questionnaire survey among clients, consultants and contractors in the southern part of Malaysia. Statistical methods were used to analyze the data. The survey results showed that 96% of the respondents agreed that most construction projects faced cost overrun with an average amount ranging from 5% to 10% of the contract sum. Investigation on the causes of cost overrun involved 35 common factors identified through literature works. Results found that fluctuation of materials price, cash flow & financial difficulties faced by contractors, delay in progress payment by owner and frequent design changes were most dominant factors causing cost overrun. Spearman correlation test was conducted on the factors and found that slow information flow was highly correlated with lack of communication between parties (with a correlation value p = 0.787) A standardized design practices, efficient resource planning & management and proper financial management should be considered as effective tools in controlling cost overrun especially in large construction projects.","[Memon, Aftab Hameed; Rahman, Ismail Abdul] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia; [Aziz, Ade Asmi Abdul] Univ Bakrie, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia; Bakrie University,"Memon, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia.",aftabm78@hotmail.com,"Memon, Aftab Hameed/AAK-3945-2021; , PROF.

The trade exchange volume noted an increase after the new members had joined the European Union. That may be observed while analysing statistical data on the trade exchange volume in specific states as well as in the whole of the European Union. A simple index analysis of the trade volume enables researchers to observe changes over time; however, it neglects the causes of these changes. With a view to identifying theses causes, an econometric tool the panel gravity model was used for the purposes of the present paper. The research objective of the paper is to evaluate the impact of selected factors on the development of bilateral trade in the European Union in the years 1999-2010. The group of potential factors describing the size of trade exchange includes the following: the Gross Domestic Product per capita, foreign direct investment per capita and the geographical distance between trading partners. The research outcome enabled us to draw a conclusion on a positive dependence between a member state's GDP and its export and import volume. In the case of foreign direct investments, their positive impact on the improvement of member states' exporting potential was identified. Moreover, a negative dependence between the geographical distance and the size of their trade exchange was proved. Also, the paper discussed the impact of EU membership on increasing trade exchange volume. The research found an essential increase in exports from the new EU-12 countries to the EU-15 countries and inversely.","[Pietrzak, Michel Bernard] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland; [Lapinska, Justyna] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland.",Michal.Pietrzak@umk.pl; justlap@umk.pl,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Łapińska, Justyna/AAD-7450-2020; Łapińska, Justyna/HMD-4197-2023","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Łapińska, Justyna/0000-0003-4134-4750; Łapińska, Justyna/0000-0003-4134-4750",,,,,38,21,22,0,33,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Government and society should seriously consider and actively address these issues, and maintain a stable and healthy development of society. This article focuses on elderly people living allowances, pension replacement rate which should be controlled above the international pension cordon, and the annuity algorithm to calculate the single premium. Taking the inflation into account, the choice of the ratio of net premium and the prevailing wage is necessary and according to the actual situation, this ratio is relatively stable. This paper uses the current charges by the insurance companies to calculate this ratio. By substituting this relative stable ratio into the formula of single premium, the relationship among the return of pension personal accounts, life expectancy and the retirement age can be obtained. Taking into account the change of retirement age is not only discrete but also lags behind the life expectancy. By selecting several different retirement age, this paper presents the individual accounts yield - retirement age curve in the figure respectively. According to the three diagram analysis, at each fixed retirement age, pension personal accounts yield and life expectancy exist a directly proportional relationship; individual pension accounts at a fixed rate of return, when people life expectancy increases, the retirement age must also be increased. The conclusion that Chinese government can draw is that government should take measures to increase the yield of individual pension accounts while taking into account the increase of retirement age and other measures under the longevity risk environment.","[Qin Yi; Liu Wei; Wu Yifan] Wuhan Univ, Dept Insurance & Actuarial, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Qin, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Dept Insurance & Actuarial, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",703252923@qq.com; 13317131121@QQ.COM; 870224554@qq.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,538,548,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700043,0

Previous studies have highlighted the need to integrate information between public and private healthcare. Therefore, it is important to identify the outcome of the implementation of the Clinical Information System (CIS) in private healthcare in achieving data integration. The three main aspects to be explored in CIS implementation are CIS components implemented in General Practitioners' (GPs), CIS implementation effectiveness and GPs' willingness towards integration. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at ten General Practitioner clinics. Findings show that the implementation of CIS has been well accepted in GP clinics. It is demonstrated that the computer system infrastructure in place in GP clinics is prepared for data integration; and three dimensions of the effectiveness of CIS implementation have been found in these clinics.

Given this competitive environment, market success can be assured through innovation as the main source of building competitive advantage in order to meet customer requirements to the highest possible level. Lately, the innovation process focus has shifted from product or process to business model innovation (BMI) since market reality proves that companies with similar technology and resources reach different financial results due to their BM performance. The purpose of this paper is to go beyond arguing and state the BMI need for a long-term market success by defining seven tangible and realistic steps that have high potential in shifting companies BMI toward a customer-centered perspective. In order to achieve this desideratum, an extensive analysis of literature on innovation and BM was performed with interest in its development and a quantitative research based on a questionnaire applied within a sample consisting of national companies was conducted. Also, the paper shows that the results of a testing conducted by a multinational company from the food industry over the drivers of liking of their product influenced its purchase and brand innovation. Both research areas were used to demonstrate the initial hypothesis stating that companies using customers as main source of information within their innovation system have better innovation results.","[Rodica, Pamfilie; Robert, Bumbac; Lavnia-Alexandra, Cristescu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business & Tourism, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Rodica, P (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business & Tourism, Bucharest, Romania.",rodica.pamfilie@com.ase.ro; robert.bumbac@stud.ase.ro; cristescu.lavinia@yahoo.com,"Bumbac, Robert/AAD-3830-2019","Bumbac, Robert/0000-0002-7288-7400",,,,,11,1,1,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3214,3223,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700337,0

Travel behaviour trends have increased drastically all over the world. With the present reality of climate change, the transportation studies are becoming increasingly important, in regards of travel behaviour changes. It is important to understand the needs to change travel behaviour as one of the initiative to achieve sustainable transportation. In achieving transportation sustainability, understanding on travel behaviour and needs can be more functional and useful for transportation planners to encourage people to use public transportations. In recent years, Low Carbon Society (LCS) concept has taken place to change the people lifestyles, especially to increase the use of public transportations. Undeniably, the only solution to a more sustainable transportation leading to a low carbon society is through a higher adoption rate of public transportation. However, it is still far to achieve as far as transportation planners is concerned because of the lack of understanding on the social needs to complement with public transportations. The planning of the fast developing region of Iskandar Malaysia, which is one of the major economic growth conurbation located in southern part of Peninsular Malaysia, provides a good opportunity to transportation planners or engineers to incorporate the ideas of low carbon society into designing a sustainable transportation systems. Thus, this paper aims to discuss the issues and potential implementation of the ideas to change the travel behaviour of people. This paper also provides current findings of transportation studies on the ongoing research to achieve a low carbon society in Iskandar Malaysia.","[Sinniah, Gobi Krishna; Shah, Muhammad Zaly; Siong, Ho Chin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Fac Built Environm, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sinniah, GK (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Fac Built Environm, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",sgobi@utm.my; b-zaly@utm.my; ho@utm.my,"SINNIAH, KRISHNA/AAD-4031-2022; Shah, Muhammad Zaly/AAN-3669-2020; SINNIAH, GOBI KRISHNA/AAO-2910-2021","SINNIAH, KRISHNA/0000-0003-3502-6772; Shah, Muhammad Zaly/0000-0003-2151-3975;",,,,,17,2,2,0,11,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3868,3876,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700397,0

However, some of current researches indicate that many first-time visitors spend a very short time on a particular webpage when accessing a particular website. Therefore, if we presume that the acquisition of new customers is one of the features of a website, such a website should be designed to obtain the attention of the first-time visitors and to keep them. Various elements of websites essential for obtaining the attention of website visitors and crucial for their satisfaction have been identified in numerous studies. As opposed to these studies, this paper focuses on designing a multiple criteria model that could realistically determine the quality of the website from the first-time visitors' point of view. In order to form a realistic multiple criteria decision making model, the proposed approach is based on the use of a smaller number of criteria that are evaluated using Atanassov fuzzy sets. Also, in order to create a model which as simple as possible, based on Atanassov fuzzy sets, this approach uses the Singleton Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers. The use of the proposed approach for assessing the quality of some websites which promote tourist potentials of the Old Mountain indicates the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. Finally, with the proposed, or with some other, set of criteria, while retaining a relatively small number of criteria, the proposed approach can be successfully applied to the tourism and hotels industry, as well as to other areas, with the aim of determining the quality of the websites from the first-time visitors' point of view.","[Stanujkic, Dragisa] Megatrend Univ, Fac Management Zajecar, Grad Sch Comp Sci, Belgrade, Serbia; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Tamosaitiene, Jolanta] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Stanujkic, D (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Fac Management Zajecar, Grad Sch Comp Sci, Belgrade, Serbia.",dragisa.stanujkic@fmz.edu.rs; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; jolanta.tamosaitiene@vgtu.lt,"Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/E-9278-2012; Stanujkic, Dragisa/J-5645-2019; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Tamošaitienė, Jolanta/0000-0003-4692-6821; Stanujkic, Dragisa/0000-0002-6846-3074; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,54,10,10,1,24,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We demonstrate the existence of twin peaks and the division of the world's countries in two distinct components: a high-fertility regime and a low-fertility regime. Whereas the significance of twin peaks vanishes over time, the two fertility regimes continue to exists over the whole observation period. In 1950, about two thirds of the world's countries belonged to the high-fertility regime and the rest constituted the low-fertility regime. By the year 2005, this picture has reversed. Within both the low- and the high-fertility regime, the average fertility rate declined, with a larger absolute decline within the high-fertility regime. Visually, the two peaks moved closer together. For the low-fertility regime, we find both beta- and sigma -convergence but we cannot establish any convergence pattern for the high-fertility regime. Our results support the idea of conditional convergence where the condition is the successful initiation of the fertility transition. The results are less supportive of the existence of a unique high-fertility equilibrium.","[Strulik, Holger; Vollmer, Sebastian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; svollmer@uni-goettingen.de,"Vollmer, Sebastian/U-6496-2017","Vollmer, Sebastian/0000-0002-7863-0462; Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,33,22,26,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Indeed, images of individual communities, regions as well as whole countries are increasingly being shaped just by the media. The role of TV coverage is indispensable in this context as it has the most intense impact on the wide public. Moreover, TV news reporting agenda to a great extent embodies also press or radio coverage agenda. This paper aims at evaluating whether the selected attributes of the real life in NUTS III regions in the Czech Republic find their adequate portrayals in the regionally-related contributions appearing within the national TV news reporting. The share of news concerning the given topic in individual regions should correspond to the presence of the theme in territorial statistics. This article will attempt to uncover the intensity of the above mentioned correspondence. The previously accomplished qualitative researches have revealed that the thematic categories of security and accidents represent nearly half of the topics in regionally-related contributions within the national TV coverage. Both security and accidents themes are distributed unevenly within the national TV news reporting. The key issue is whether spatial differentiation appearing in the TV news reporting reflects the real territorial figures and statistics, i.e., the amount of criminal offences and traffic accidents. Criminal offences and road casualties are both geographically differentiated, but does TV coverage reflect this differentiation in an objective and adequate way? The answer can be derived from this paper. Arguably, the relation between the TV news reporting and regions, which is stated only seldom, will attract higher attention in the near future.","[Suchacek, Jan] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Havlickovonabr 38, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic; [Sed'a, Petr; Friedrich, Vaclav] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Koutsky, Jaroslav] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Ustinad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Ustinad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Suchacek, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Havlickovonabr 38, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",jan.suchacek@vsb.cz; petr.seda@vsb.cz; vaclav.friedrich@vsb.cz; jaroslav.koutsky@ujep.cz,"Suchacek, Jan/ABH-4495-2020; Koutsky, Jaroslav/S-8495-2017; Friedrich, Václav/J-9265-2012; Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018","Suchacek, Jan/0000-0001-9508-6959; Friedrich, Václav/0000-0003-0076-5233; Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377; Koutsky, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2581-8058",VSB-TU Ostrava under the SGS project [SP2015/111]; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],VSB-TU Ostrava under the SGS project; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,"The support provided by VSB-TU Ostrava under the SGS project SP2015/111 and by Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness, Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296 is kindly announced.",,40,18,18,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

However questions remain as to whether boards with higher levels of diversity amongst directors are better equipped to fulfil their fiduciary duty than boards with lower levels of diversity. This research examines whether increased levels of diversity within boards are associated with improved financial performance to shareholders. From the literature, several theoretical frameworks that could explain why increased diversity might or might not lead to improved board performance were noted. Share returns and directors' demographic data were collected for a sample of the largest 40 companies listed on the JSE from 2000 to 2013. This data was analysed using Muller and Ward's (2013) investment style engine by forming portfolios of companies based on board-diversity constructs. Time-series graphs of cumulative portfolio market returns were analysed to determine if the diversity dimensions tested were associated with improved share performance. The results show that racial diversity within boards is not associated with financial performance. However, increased gender diversity and younger average board age are shown to have strong associations with improved share price performance. These findings are mainly attributed to agency-, resource dependency, human capital and signalling theories. Increased diversity is seen to bolster independence and lessen agency problems. Rising diversity levels also enlarge boards' external networks, allowing diverse stakeholders' needs to be accommodated and limiting dependence on strategic resources. Finally, as human capital is increased, the collection of different skills and experiences are associated with better performance. The results, based on a more robust methodology and improved data set, provide additional support to previous studies.","[Taljaard, Cobus C. H.; Ward, Michael J.

Existing conceptual frameworks on global value chains (GVC) and what we term GPN 1.0 tend to under-theorize the origins and dynamics of these organizational platforms and to overemphasize their governance typologies (e.g., modular, relational, and captive modes in GVC theory) or analytical categories (e.g., power and embeddedness in GPN 1.0). Building on this expanding literature, our article aims to contribute toward the reframing of existing GPN-GVC debates and the development of a more dynamic theory of global production networks that can better explain the emergence of different firm-specific activities, strategic network effects, and territorial outcomes in the global economy. It is part of a wider initiativeGPN 2.0 in shortthat seeks to offer novel theoretical insights into why and how the organization and coordination of global production networks varies significantly within and across different industries, sectors, and economies. Taking an actor-centered focus toward theory development, we tackle a significant gap in existing work by systematically conceptualizing the causal drivers of global production networks in terms of their competitive dynamics (optimizing cost-capability ratios, market imperatives, and financial discipline) and risk environments. These capitalist dynamics are theorized as critical independent variables that shape the four main strategies adopted by economic actors in (re)configuring their global production networks and, ultimately, the developmental outcomes in different industries, regions, and countries.","[Yeung, Henry Wai-chung] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Coe, Neil M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Yeung, HWC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",HenryYeung@nus.edu.sg; geonmc@nus.edu.sg,"Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020; Yeung, Henry Wai-chung/A-9558-2008","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061; Yeung, Henry Wai-chung/0000-0002-0647-0658",,,,,94,360,428,36,494,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

As a result, agreements aimed at partitioning national markets are in principle restrictive of competition by object. The case law on this point has been consistent since Consten-Grundig. Making sense of it, however, remains a challenge. The purpose of this article is to first show how the methodological approach followed by the Court of Justice changes when market integration considerations are at stake. Second, this article explains why and when restrictions on cross-border trade have been found not to restrict competition by object within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU. An agreement aimed at partitioning national markets is not as such contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU if the analysis of the counterfactual reveals that it does not restrict inter-brand and/or intra-brand competition that would have existed in its absence. It is possible to think of three scenarios in this regard: (1) an agreement may be objectively necessary to achieve the aims sought by the parties; (2) a clause may be objectively necessary for an agreement; and (3) competition is precluded by the underlying regulatory context (as is the case, in particular, when the exercise of intellectual property rights is at stake).","[Colomo, Pablo Ibanez] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Law, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Colomo, PI (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Law, London, England.",P.Ibanez-Colomo@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,6,6,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Two measures of urban sprawl related to density and proximity are used as dependent variables: the proportion of low-density housing and the median commute distance. We explain these measures by four main variables based on the natural evolution model: population growth, median household income, the cost of surrounding agricultural land, and transportation costs. We show that, ceteris paribus, higher parking and gasoline prices have contributed to reduce the extent of urban sprawl. On average, a 1% increase in gasoline prices has led to a decrease in low-density housing by 0.17% and to a 0.04% decrease in median commute distance. Furthermore, we show that a 1% increase in the price of off-street parking has led to a 0.12% decrease in low-density housing and to a 0.05% decrease in median commute distance. We argue that results for parking prices are relatively modest because much free parking is available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, increasing efforts have been undertaken by policymakers to use these models for forecasting, although this proved to be problematic due to estimation and identification issues. Hybrid DSGE models have become popular for dealing with some of the model misspecifications and the trade-off between theoretical coherence and empirical fit, thus allowing them to compete in terms of predictability with VAR models. However, DSGE and VAR models are still linear and they do not consider time variation in parameters that could account for inherent nonlinearities and capture the adaptive underlying structure of the economy in a robust manner. This study conducts a comparative evaluation of the out-of-sample predictive performance of many different specifications of DSGE models and various classes of VAR models, using datasets for the real GDP, the harmonized CPI and the nominal short-term interest rate series in the euro area. Simple and hybrid DSGE models were implemented, including DSGE-VAR and factor-augmented DGSE, and tested against standard, Bayesian and factor-augmented VARs. Moreover, a new state-space time-varying VAR model is presented. The total period spanned from 1970:Q1 to 2010:Q4 with an out-of-sample testing period of 2006:Q1-2010:Q4, which covers the global financial crisis and the EU debt crisis.

This paper fills this gap by providing evidence that court decisions can bring to bear existing legal standards and can have significant effects on market behavior, especially if they convey credible commitments to enforce sanctions. This study shows that the outcome of certain court decisions can reduce illicit trade. By analyzing novel disaggregated data of antiquities sold at auction in the past 20 years, our results indicate that, following punitive court rulings, the share of legitimate items (measured by their ownership history, or provenance) and the price premium paid for such items both increased. In addition, we show that standard assumptions behind repeat-sales indices fail to hold as buyers' tastes change.","[Beltrametti, Silvia; Marrone, James V.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Beltrametti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society at the University of Chicago; University of Chicago Law School,Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society at the University of Chicago; University of Chicago Law School,"This research was supported by grants from the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society at the University of Chicago and the University of Chicago Law School.

Evidence was presented on a micro scale for measuring accessibility and social impacts with discussions centring first, on how these measurements could be useful for operators and authorities in the measurement of market potential and market penetration and second, presenting accessibility measurement as maps could provide the evidence base for identifying service adequacy and identifying the income impacts of public transport planning. In the area of social impacts, papers were presented that looked at the way in which public transport operators can enhance social capital of communities and how new transport infrastructure can generate social capital too. Alongside this came evidence for understanding the causal underpinnings of social impacts through looking at the role of income, personality and preferences in the generation of social benefits. Finally, more macro approaches to examining the wider economic, social and environmental impacts of public transport investment were presented. One of these showed the fuller picture that emerges if an Economic Impact Analysis (EIA) is presented alongside the more usual Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) since the EIA shows how the economy will respond in terms of jobs, job access and types of jobs which complements the efficiency and welfare approach of CBA. The second showed how incorporating income distributional considerations within a CBA can clearly identify winners and losers. Over and above the detail provided by the evidence in papers, the workshop, identified that governments/authorities need to be more explicit and transparent about their objectives and motivations so that operators are clear about what is needed, that governance issues need further debate and that the analysis of risk needs further research and discussion to ensure that better projects are put in place.

This innovative business model offers individuals the opportunity to rent cars by the hour, providing them with greater flexibility for their mobility. Previous work on carsharing suggests that its adoption leads to a decline in household vehicle ownership, vehicle miles traveled, and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Utilizing representative data from the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey, this paper presents an analysis of travel behavior and vehicle ownership among carshare members versus non-members in the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on a subsample of the population with access to carsharing at the U.S. census tract level. Consistent with previous findings on vehicle reduction, these results show that carsharing members own significantly fewer vehicles than nonmembers. However, lower levels of vehicle ownership are only found among households living in urban areas. In dense, urban neighborhoods, households with carsharing membership own 0.58 vehicles per household as compared with 0.96 vehicles of a control group. Suburban carshare members drive less than their non-carshare member counterparts - although the extent to which this difference can be attributed to self-selection it is unknown. This study also finds that among carsharing households that do own vehicles, a greater share of those vehicles are alternative vehicles (e.g., hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric, and battery electric). Among vehicles owned by the subsample examined in this study, electric drive vehicles represent 18.3% of those owned by carshare member households, as compared with 10.2% of the vehicles owned by non-carsharing households. This analysis finds that not only are urban carshare members likely to own fewer vehicles than the rest of the population, if they do own vehicles, they are more likely to own a vehicle with a smaller environmental footprint.

Incentivized by MoT, many Chinese cities have started planning for a transit metropolis and even implementing related measures. This signifies some larger-than-ever government-led efforts towards the transit metropolis that we have heard of. Why did China/MoT initiate the transit metropolis program? Is the transit metropolis idea of MoT similar to what Robert Cervero defines in his book, which introduces the concept of transit metropolis and illustrates it using 12 exemplars? If not, why? Have Chinese cities followed the same principles or taken comparable measures proposed or identified by Cervero? Or, have they produced brand new principles or measures? If so, what is the implication? This article answers the above questions through literature review, interviews, surveys and case studies. It shows that MoT's idea of the transit metropolis differs notably from that of Cervero. Even though MoT proposes more universal and quantitative performance measures for a transit metropolis than Cervero, its perspectives and policies are still parochial. Local governments, nevertheless, have comparable principles or measures like Cervero. But compared to a transit metropolis exemplar such as Curitiba, they overlook issues such as the match between regional commuter sheds and the services/administrative boundaries of local transit-related entities, coordinated, regionalized transit services and fares, pedestrian-friendly streets and parking pricing strategies. The above indicate that more work is needed to better define, plan and implement a transit metropolis in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These models are universal in an assumption that, should the disturbance arise in a given rotation, the landowner salvages what is possible through a harvest and replants to begin a new rotation. However, a real possibility exists that multiple disturbances may occur in one rotation, with the landowner retaining the damaged stand thereby waiting through the first or even a subsequent disturbance to harvest and begin a new rotation. We develop a new approach for rotations models and choices that allows more than one event and flexibility in the timing of harvest, where tree recovery and damage may make continuance of the rotation, rather than starting over, a rent maximizing strategy. We thereby generalize the highly-cited body of literature based on Paul Samuelson's and William Reed's seminal contributions. Results demonstrate that failure to consider these new features leads to suboptimal harvest decisions and highly suboptimal land rent values. Important parameters are found to be arrival rates of future disturbances and survival proportions and growth rates after each disturbance.

Our Monte Carlo analysis reveals that the use of the series with the largest averaged within-category correlations outperforms the use of disaggregate data for factor estimation and forecasting in several cases. This occurs for high levels of cross-correlation across the idiosyncratic errors of series that belong to the same category, for oversampled categories, and especially for high levels of persistence in either the common factor or the idiosyncratic errors. However, the forecasting gains are reduced considerably when the target series are persistent. This could potentially explain why there is no clear ranking between the aggregate and disaggregate approaches when using the constituent balanced panel of the Stock-Watson factor model, which classifies the US data into 13 economic categories.

Factor-augmented predictive regression models improve upon benchmark models that include only valuation ratios and interest rate related variables, and possibly individual macro variables, as well as the historical average excess return. The improvements in out-of-sample forecast accuracy are significant, both statistically and economically. The factor-augmented predictive regressions have superior market timing abilities, such that a mean variance investor would be willing to pay an annual performance fee of several hundreds of basis points to switch from the predictions offered by the benchmark models to those of the factor-augmented models. One important reason for the superior performance of the factor-augmented predictive regressions is the stability of their forecast accuracy, whereas the benchmark models suffer from a forecast breakdown during the 1990s.

A series of structural equation modelling estimations was carried out, using empirical surveys among road-based public transportation users in three major urban areas: Jakarta, Bandung and Yogyakarta. The results show that negative experience, service importance and dissatisfaction are factors that significantly correlate with the user preferences in accepting improvement policies along with fare adjustment. The users' travel behaviours and their socio-demographic characteristics were also found to be significant in influencing the degree of such support. However, the results also show discrepancies in the influence of key determinants across the three studied cities, which indicates a need for locally designed approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Suppose that local demand can be sourced from domestic (rigid) production or from (flexible) imports. This paper shows that the optimal domestic capacity is either increasing or decreasing with demand uncertainty, depending on the relative level of the costs of domestic production and imports. We test this relationship with data from the U.S. cement industry, in which the difference in marginal cost between domestic production and imports varies across local U.S. markets because cement is costly to transport over land. Industry data for 1999 to 2010 are consistent with the predictions of the model. The introduction of two technologies to the production set-one rigid and one flexible-is crucial to understanding the relationship between capacity choice and uncertainty in this industry because there is no relationship between these two variables in aggregated U.S. data. Our analysis reveals that the relationship is negative in coastal districts, and significantly more positive in landlocked districts.","[Meunier, Guy] INRA, Paris, France; [Meunier, Guy; Ponssard, Jean-Pierre] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Ponssard, Jean-Pierre] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Thomas, Catherine] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Thomas, Catherine] CEPR, London, England",INRAE; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Meunier, G (通讯作者)，INRA, Paris, France.;Meunier, G; Ponssard, JP (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.;Thomas, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.;Thomas, C (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",Guy.Meunier@polytechnique.edu; Jean-Pierre.Ponssard@polytechnique.edu; c.m.thomas@lse.ac.uk,"Meunier, Guy/E-8948-2018","Meunier, Guy/0000-0002-9052-921X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,34,4,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In the quantitative analysis a Cobb-Douglas regression model has been used and together with its parameters it has obtained results which indicate a higher degree of flexibility of the sale of new and significantly improved goods relative to real capital expenditure streams (0.868) than human capital investment flows (0.190). The model of innovation growth rate (Cobb-Douglas theory) indicates that the flexibility of sold production of new and significantly improved goods can be equal to unity. The research has found regression dependence of new and substantively improved products sold on the physical and human capital expenditure. Thus, there is an imbalance of these capitals in the impact on the volatility of sold production of new and significantly improved goods in the industry. The above-specified production relative to the combined effect of real and human capital investment flows was growing more than proportionally (1.058) in the industry in the years 2011-2013. The current potential for innovation with an unchanged production method allows us to obtain increasing economies of scale of production sold of new and significantly improved goods in the Polish industry. The conducted research shows that the impact of human capital (0.190) amounts only to one-fifth of the potential opportunities available in the Polish industry.","[Zwolak, Jan] Univ Econ & Innovat, Inst Applicat Quantitat Methods Econ, Ul Projektowa 4, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland",,"Zwolak, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Innovat, Inst Applicat Quantitat Methods Econ, Ul Projektowa 4, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland.",jan.zwolak@yahoo.com,"Zwolak, Jan/Y-1527-2018","Zwolak, Jan/0000-0002-6875-105X",,,,,21,4,4,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Incompatible epistemic regimes of high-frequency trading",ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,market manipulation; predation; HFT; Flash Crash; epistemic regimes,MARKETS,"Calls for greater transparency as well as corporate and individual accountability have emerged in response to the recent turbulence in financial markets. In the field of high-frequency trading (HFT), suggested solutions have involved a call for increased market information, for example, or better access to the inner workings of algorithmic trading systems. Through a combination of fieldwork conducted in HFT firms and discourse analysis, I show that the problem may not always stem from a lack of information. Instead, my comparative analysis of different market actors (regulators, market analysts and traders) shows that the diverse and complex ways in which they access and construct knowledge out of information in fact lead to what I call different epistemic regimes. An understanding of how epistemic regimes work will enable us to explain not only why the same market event can be viewed as very different things - as market manipulation, predation or error - but also why it is so difficult to arrive at a unified theory or view of HFT. The comparative perspective introduced by the idea of epistemic regimes might also serve as a starting point for the development of a cultural approach to the study of financial markets.","[Seyfert, Robert] Europa Univ Viadrina, Fac Social & Cultural Sci, D-15230 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Seyfert, R (通讯作者)，Europa Univ Viadrina, Fac Social & Cultural Sci, D-15230 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany.",seyfert@europa-uni.de,,"Seyfert, Robert/0000-0002-9667-1970",,,,,38,33,36,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

We present a technique for the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of exponential smoothing methods, which results in significant improvements in the forecasts. The bagging uses a Box-Cox transformation followed by an STL decomposition to separate the time series into the trend, seasonal part, and remainder. The remainder is then bootstrapped using a moving block bootstrap, and a new series is assembled using this bootstrapped remainder. An ensemble of exponential smoothing models is then estimated on the bootstrapped series, and the resulting point forecasts are combined. We evaluate this new method on the M3 data set, and show that it outperforms the original exponential smoothing models consistently. On the monthly data, we achieve better results than any of the original M3 participants. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Under scrutiny is the iconic brand Nutella that is recognized worldwide. In France, it has been linked to public debates on well-being concerns about palm oil. Approaching the phenomenon from a consumer perspective and through observational netnography, we investigate the accommodation work undertaken by Nutella lovers in reaction to anti-palm oil attacks. We identify three major accommodation processes: neutralization, interiorization, and adhesion. Each of these processes is constituted of three different practices. Our study shows that while an iconic brand can resist anti-consumption claims thanks to its brand community, such disputes can cause the brand to lose part of its strength. We suggest that anti-consumption for an iconic brand such as Nutella may thus be ambivalent.","[Cova, Bernard; D'Antone, Simona] Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France; [Cova, Bernard] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Kedge Business School; Bocconi University,"Cova, B; D'Antone, S (通讯作者)，Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France.;Cova, B (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",bernard.cova@kedgebs.com; simona.dantone@kedgebs.com,"D'Antone, Simona/U-4886-2018","D'Antone, Simona/0000-0001-7343-0237",,,,,39,34,36,1,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

An answer that such practices facilitate interfirm cooperation is incomplete because it fails to address why companies cannot or do not induce such cooperation directly via their own incentive systems. This article addresses these issues. It shows, inter alia, that even when firms can induce cooperation via their own incentive systems, they will do better obtaining that cooperation via cross-firm entertaining and other favor granting. This remains true even if entertainment budgets are subject to corruption, including excessive use or potential embezzlement.

Climate change, environmental pollution, noise pollution, congestion and the road wear and tear are discussed in detail and, where relevant, vehicles are segmented according to fuel type, engine capacity and Euronorm. As the impact of external effects is subject to region specific conditions such as population density and traffic intensity, a separate analysis of urban, rural and highway usage is carried out. Current traffic taxation, on the other hand, is predominantly fixed. Only fuel taxation is related to vehicle miles traveled. In general, steering traffic taxes tend to over-internalize the external effects. Total steering traffic tax revenue amounts to 3.7 billion euro, while external effects are estimated at 3 billion euro. However, the internalization rate is not always straightforward and differs significantly between vehicle types, since current traffic taxation is not time and place dependent. Because traffic taxation only marginally differs between areas (urban, rural, highway) in consequence of fuel consumption, urban traffic tends to be rather under-internalized compared to rural traffic. Consequently, we determined the optimal taxation rate per vehicle segment in each area from an external cost perspective. Furthermore, some recommendations to improve current traffic taxation are formulated.","[Roosen, Jorg; Marneffe, Wim; Vereeck, Lode] Hasselt Univ, Fac Appl Econ, Diepenbeek, Belgium",Hasselt University,"Roosen, J (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Fac Appl Econ, Diepenbeek, Belgium.",jorg.roosen@uhas-selt.be; wim.marneffe@uhasselt.be; lode.vereeck@uhasselt.be,,"MARNEFFE, Wim/0000-0001-9945-5731",,,,,66,0,0,0,19,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

It contributes to the debate on the deregulation and whether the rise of hub-and-spoke networks and the success of low-cost carriers lead to concentration or deconcentration. We use the Gini index and its decomposition to evaluate the contribution of airport subgroups and airline networks to the overall concentration of seat capacity. We conclude that, overall, seat capacity follows a spatial deconcentration pattern. While intra-EU seat capacity became more spatially deconcentrated, extra-EU seat capacity concentrated. However, our results do not support the general view that network carriers tend to increase concentration levels and low-cost carriers to decrease them, leading us to a reinterpretation of the impacts of air transport deregulation. The results show the increasing importance of foreign carriers and new strategies such as hub-bypassing.","[Suau-Sanchez, Pere] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Martell House,Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England; [Burghouwt, Guillaume] SEO Econ Res, Airneth, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Cranfield University; University of Barcelona,"Suau-Sanchez, P (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport Management, Martell House,Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.;Burghouwt, G (通讯作者)，SEO Econ Res, Airneth, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Fageda, X (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",p.suausanchez@cranfield.ac.uk; g.burghouwt@seo.nl; xfageda@ub.edu,"Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018; Suau-Sanchez, Pere/E-6121-2012","Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169; Suau-Sanchez, Pere/0000-0002-5091-9352; Burghouwt, Guillaume/0000-0002-9225-3886",,,,,63,9,10,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Keeping above said in mind the main objective of this paper is to explore the profitability of retail SME's of two advanced EU member states: Italy and France over 2006 - 2012 period. The analysis aims to answer whether features of firm environment such as agglomeration externalities and concentration as well as their characteristics such as ownership influence the performance of SMEs. A dynamic panel econometric technique is applied in order to assess the existence of short and long run effects. The obtained findings will be used to formulate recommendations for business policy makers in the field of EU SME's in retail sector.","[Bezic, Heri; Galovic, Tomislav] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Stojcic, Nebojsa] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Dubrovnik,"Bezic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",bezic@efri.hr; tgalovic@efri.hr; nstojcic@unidu.hr,"Stojcic, Nebojsa/S-5641-2018; Bezić, Heri/S-5281-2018; Galović, Tomislav/U-3429-2019; Galović, Tomislav/Q-6604-2018","Stojcic, Nebojsa/0000-0001-6638-8771; Galović, Tomislav/0000-0002-0891-796X; Galović, Tomislav/0000-0002-0891-796X",,,,,23,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,464,470,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500050,0

The errors in the projections of the National Treasury have nonetheless been substantial in some years, and have increased from 2000/01 to 2010/11. This paper argues that the credibility of fiscal policy would have been severely tested if the largest annual errors in respect of the various aggregates had coincided. Against this backdrop, the paper makes the case for structured bi-annual discussions of government's forecasts during public parliamentary hearings as a mechanism for improving the accuracy and credibility of official projections. It also discusses the potential benefits for South Africa of two alternative mechanisms, namely fiscal councils and committees of independent experts.","[Calitz, Estian; Siebrits, Krige; Stuart, Ian] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Calitz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",,,,,,,,36,3,4,0,6,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We make intensive inquiries into this issue via case studies on two sectors in Taiwan, namely the bicycle industry and the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Our conceptual framework gives special account to fuzzy front-end at the industrial level and how market cultivation and innovative business models come to play an important role in shaping the innovation path for post catch-up. For leading players in Taiwan's bicycle industry, a key issue they faced was how to transform themselves and local setting in Taiwan to become a leader in high-end bicycles to fend off escalated international competition. In the emerging EV industry, the Taiwanese players try to overcome its structural weaknesses in the mainstream automotive industry to explore the possibility of levelling the playing field with the forerunners in the advanced countries. Our case studies suggest that technological catch-up is not necessarily a prelude to post catch-up, depending on the nature of new innovation trajectory and entry modes of the emerging industry. Our analyses also lend support to the importance of product servicising as a means of post catch-up, especially from the perspective of market cultivation.","[Chen, Shin-Horng; Wen, Pei-Chang] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan.",shchen@cier.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC101-2410-H-170-003-MY2],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"This paper was based on a research project sponsored by the National Science Council (now renamed as Ministry of Science and Technology), Taiwan [grant number NSC101-2410-H-170-003-MY2].",,59,3,4,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Panel data for global companies that entered the new and renewable energy industry after the 1990s show that de alio firms achieved higher growth rate than did de novo firms in the initial stages, but that entry type's contribution to sales growth gradually decreased and disappeared four years after entrance.

I use the unanticipated reform of 2007 to assess how a move from a means tested to an earnings-related benefit affects higher-order births. By using data from the Mikrozensus, I find that the reform significantly affected the timing of higher-order births in the first 5 years after a last birth. Overall, mothers just eligible for the new benefit for the current birth initially reduce subsequent childbearing and extend birth spacing, compared to mothers just ineligible. However, by the end of the third year, mothers start to compensate for the earlier losses. The negative effects are largely driven by the low-income mothers, who are now worse-off and do not display any catch-up effects. The differential fertility responses along the income distribution are in line with the heterogeneous structure of the economic incentives.","[Cygan-Rehm, Kamila] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Econ, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Cygan-Rehm, K (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Econ, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",kamila.cygan-rehm@wiso.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,46,37,40,3,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

What about other natural differences between people, which could influence their attitudes towards loyalty and commitment? These differences include: ethnicity, upbringing, attitudes toward risk, attitudes of individualism and collectivism, temporal concerns, masculinity and femininity, all related to how a person exudes loyalty and how a person exudes commitment.

Within the Europe 2020 strategy, research, development and innovation are key policy components of the EU strategy for economic growth. The European Commission invites the member states to allocate 3% of GDP to R&D, with 2/3 realized by the private spending. Therefore, it is interesting to focus not only on the amount of R&D but also on its composition. The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of private and public research and development expenditures on the economic growth in European Union countries. The dynamic panel for 28 EU countries for time period 2004-2014 was estimated using Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM), based on a production function approach. Main findings suggest statistically significant effect of private R&D intensity on GDP per working population growth. The short run partial elasticity coefficient of private R&D varies in the range 0.02-0.04 (depends on model specification and subsample). The log run partial elasticity coefficient of private R&D varies in the range 0.04-0.12 (depends on model specification). Statistical significance of public R&D is dependent on model specification. Insignificant effect of domestic R&D in the business sector is not surprising result, the same conclusion dominates in empirical literature. Conclusions from empirical work suggest that policy in EU countries should put more focus on the distinction between private and public R&D, and governments should stimulate private R&D.","[Freimane, Rita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Freimane, R (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",rita.freimane@lu.lv,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,244,252,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200021,0

Since the introduction of Farmer Input Support Programme, the studies that quantify its effects on income have focused either on the fertiliser or the seed component but not on both which constitute the FISP pack, making it difficult to determine what changes in farmers' incomes can be attributed to FISP as a whole. Using Propensity Score Matching with panel data from 305 randomly surveyed households in Chotna and Monze districts of Zambia, the authors of the article estimate the effect of a FISP pack on household revenue from maize. The results show that FISP increased household annual maize income by 30.8% and total household income by 13.9% for 2013/14 and 2014/15 crop seasons. However, although FISP is achieving its objective of increasing small-scale farmers' income, this increment is not large enough to lift households above the poverty line.","[Funsani, William; Chibomba, Velindah] Minist Agr, Zambia Agr Res Inst, Mochipapa Res Stn, Choma 630090, Zambia; [Rickaille, Michael; Zhu, Jing; Tian, Xu; Avea, Aniah Dominic] Nanjing Agr Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, V Kudirkos G 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania",Nanjing Agricultural University; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Funsani, W (通讯作者)，Minist Agr, Zambia Agr Res Inst, Mochipapa Res Stn, Choma 630090, Zambia.",funsaniwilliam1@yahoo.com; rickaille@hotmail.com; crystalzhzt@njau.edu.cn; xutian@njazt.edu.cn; velindahchibomba@gmail.com; adominicavea@gmail.com; tomas@laei.lt,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711; , xu/0000-0002-1070-3581",,,,,25,4,4,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Craft production-increasingly interpolated as a form of creative work-is shaped by concerns about retrieving archaic tools and ways of making things, celebrating provenance and the haptic skills of makers, and delivering (and marketing) manual labor process. In contrast to evolutionary economic geography's seeming immateriality and abstraction, attention is drawn to material aspects of place and path dependence that undergird geographies of new craft industries: how labor process evolves, in iteration with technical lock-ins that stem from production method, product design, and capacities of component materials, but also how legacies of mass manufacturing linger in putatively authentic places-shaping new geographic concentrations. An especially vivid case is explored: a cluster of cowboy bootmaking workshops in El Paso,Texas. Bootmaking has metamorphosed from artisanal to factory to a craft-based creative mode of production. Crucial were continuity in product design and evolution of labor process. So, too, was geography: an iconic borderland city location with historic legacies of labor intensive mass manufacturing; migrant workers with requisite embodied skills; antique tools; and significant stocks of leather, the core input material that must be seen, felt, and smelt by makers before fabrication. I argue for a grounded, critical evolutionary economic geography that requires stronger intersection with labor process, with the cultural logics infusing capitalism, and with greater recognition of material inheritances that are reconfigured in place over successive generations.","[Gibson, Chris] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Gibson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Australian Ctr Cultural Environm Res, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cgibson@uow.edu.au,"Gibson, Chris/A-7733-2011","Gibson, Chris/0000-0002-7242-8255; Warren, Andrew/0000-0003-1022-7578",,,,,107,92,105,5,62,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

So rapidly changing market conditions, increase competition and intensify the need to evaluate and manage risk. If risk is not evaluated it can lead to loss or even bankruptcy. Agricultural business organizations are facing with risk more than other business sectors, because agricultural products and services are related to natural processes and biological assets: plant's and animal's diseases. Agriculture is particularly exposed to adverse natural events, such as insect damage and poor weather conditions, what negatively impact production. Agriculture is unique sector mainly because of these reasons: seasonality; agricultural products are more prone to damage; climate fluctuations; agricultural demand, supply and price fluctuations. So in agriculture it is very important to evaluate and manage agriculture risk, only then will be possible to make effective decisions on time. Risk analysis helps simultaneously identify threats caused by several types of risk, which leads to an increased efficiency of economic decision-making. In order to make effective decisions at farm, it is necessary identify the main factors of the farm risk and to find the most appropriate management measures.","[Girdziute, Laura; Miceikiene, Astrida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Akademija, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Girdziute, L (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Akademija, Lithuania.",girlau@gmail.com; astrida.miceikiene@asu.lt,,"Miceikiene, Astrida/0000-0003-1432-7971",,,,,24,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,399,409,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_31,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900031,0

Scholarship across politics, geography, science studies and anthropology continues to trace the productive force and specific qualities of diverse temporal horizons. At the same time socio-legal scholars increasingly focus on the work of making and negotiating law, engaging with the dogged, everyday work of legal experts and bureaucrats. Yet little attention has been paid, to date, to the work of legislative drafters. This paper follows the 'legal lives' of qualifying periods on family-friendly employment rights. As examples of legal technicalities that work with time, qualifying periods form an important part of the regulatory structure that separates precarious workers from 'regular' employees in UK law. Drawing on documentary research and interviews with policy experts, union activists and legislative drafters, this paper focuses on the formal qualities of qualifying periods, arguing that these legal technicalities conjure time and legal form as inextricable. Whenever law becomes relevant to conversations about time and governance, we could usefully pay attention to the idiosyncrasies and controversies occupying legal form and legislative drafting.","[Grabham, Emily] Univ Kent, Kent Law Sch, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Grabham, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Kent Law Sch, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England.",e.grabham@kent.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001108/1]; ESRC [ES/K001108/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001108/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/K001108/1].,,40,6,7,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Income from the production of gas and oil make up 40% of GDP and two-thirds of its budget income. The sharp rise in oil prices from 30 dollars in 2002 to 147 in 2008, has allowed Algeria to acquire foreign exchange reserves estimated at over $ 200 billion. Oil income was forever the key element of the famous tacit agreement that the authority has with the company, the contract was to ensure social peace and maintaining the hegemony of the state over society. This income has served to maintain a consensus around the government's power. Algeria has been involved for over twenty years in a process that should lead to the passing of an economic system administratively directed to a market system. Single in its kind, the transition of former centrally planned economies to market economy is faltering. We noticed that the discourse on the transition grows with each fall of hydrocarbon prices. This leads us to say that there is a clear relationship between oil revenues and state intervention in the economy. In other words, the transition to a market economy is driven by the decline in oil revenues. If the financial resources of the state decrease its intervention also reduced. Therefore, economic liberalization depends on the financial resources of the state.

Unfortunately, insufficient cost management is a problem of most companies. A substantial part of cost in the companies is incurred automatically, i.e., due to inertia while conducting routine work which does not demand economic substantiation and create unnecessary cost for the company. A successful and proactive cost management could be a key to business success, and an effective cost management system in a company is directly and positively related with its competitive advantage. This research solves a research question of elimination of casual cost management decisions from the business model of the company and integrating it into proactive cost management which directly correlates with benefits created by changes of current principles and practices. The necessity of demand of proactive cost management was driven by two aspects: firstly, increasing competition and global financial crisis are increasingly signaling that effective cost management system is one of the most important management issues necessary to reach strategic organizational goals; secondly, the literature and practice more often identify cost management as a representation of incurred cost and less often with cost control and proactive management.","[Martirosianiene, Lina] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Akademija, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Martirosianiene, L (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Akademija, Lithuania.",lina.martirosianiene@asu.lt,,,,,,,47,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,167,180,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_11,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800011,0

However, several challenges remain, one of which is related to the ambiguity of authority as a result of the dual command structure. This study examines the perceptions of the types of power and influence mechanisms used by the functional manager and the project manager to influence project personnel, and the effect of these mechanisms on attitudinal outcomes. The research used a two-phase design. The first qualitative phase validated the constructs of power and influence. In Phase 2, quantitative data was obtained from 22 functional managers, 28 project managers and 92 project personnel in South Africa, Italy and Canada from one large project execution technology company. There appears to be a large perceptual gap between project managers, functional managers and project personnel. Managers perceive themselves to be using aspirational and personal influence mechanisms, whereas project personnel perceive the managers to be using positional, punitive mechanisms. Relationships were observed between the perceived type of influence being used by the managers and the project personnel's satisfaction with their manager, overall job satisfaction, their performance and level of engagement. Functional and project managers are associated with very different attitudinal outcomes among project team members.","[Moodley, Dylon; Sutherland, Margie; Pretorius, Pieter] Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Moodley, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,43,3,12,1,24,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This article aims to assess the impact of the information published in annual reports of companies on the market value of the shares in the context of the financial value of the enterprise. Considering that from the investor's perspective an investment is assessed in relation to the intrinsic value of the share, a balance model that uses historical prices while being based on information contained in the financial statements was selected. We find inverse effects for negative and positive word lists. The effect of a positive sentiment was perceived cautiously and negatively particularly with regard to positive multi-words, whereas a high frequency of negative single words was accepted positively and, thus, led to a higher market-to-book ratio. Notably, we show that net optimism in annual reports is perceived positively by stakeholders.","[Myskova, Renata] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Business Econ & Management, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic; [Hajek, Petr] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice; University of Pardubice,"Myskova, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Business Econ & Management, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",Renata.Myskova@upce.cz; Petr.Hajek@upce.cz,"Hajek, Petr/JYQ-5812-2024; Myskova, Renata/HLP-5625-2023","Hajek, Petr/0000-0001-5579-1215;",Czech Sciences Foundation [16-19590S],Czech Sciences Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the scientific research project of the Czech Sciences Foundation Grant No: 16-19590S.,,52,13,13,0,26,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The most interesting part of tendering procedures is the award of a contract. The choice of a contractor is sometimes a matter of pure competition, but it happens to be also a result of a less transparent procedure. Such rewards are difficult to discover and certainly the main purpose for avoiding the foreseen procedure is profit making. However, the existence of these practices in a sector (public procurement) which constitutes 14% of global GPA should not only be examined as an illegal attitude, but also as a dangerous one, because the award of contracts in sensitive areas such as health, security or education is required to receive the highest protection. Having the phenomenon of corruption described above as a basis, this paper attempts to reach the source of the problem. Which reasons could urge a contracting authority to decide and award a contract to a person or a company which does not fulfil all the requirements? Is this only a problem of human greed or is it something even bigger? Comparing several societies, this phenomenon is found more or less to all of them. Unfortunately, we do not observe only a disfunctioning in public procurement, but also a global degrading community with lack of values and expectance nothing better than fraud in the most aspects of social life. A change in our biotheory is inevitable and a good beginning could be the education and not the void one, but a vivid and experiential type of education. If well trained people worked at the public services, then the choice of deviation in public procurement could possibly be limited. Finally, education and principal social structures are the keys to change the shadowy practices in public procurement.","[Panagiotidou, Elisavet] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Law, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Intzesiloglou, Nikolaos] Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Law, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Panagiotidou, E (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Law, Thessaloniki, Greece.",elisavetpanag@gmail.com; nintze@law.auth.gr,,,,,,,9,0,1,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,306,316,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700032,0

Governmental actions can be effective only after understanding factors for recycling behaviour, and fostering them. Since the primary target group of recycling in Lithuania are urban inhabitants, it is important to determine what sub-segments of this group are the most likely to become innovators and early adopters in the field, and to identify what are the most important predictors of their recycling intentions. The aim of the study was to determine how values affect attitude elements towards recycling and what attitude elements and (or) recent recycling behaviour are the most important predictors of intentions to recycle; and to investigate what demographic groups among Lithuanian urban inhabitants are the most likely to be engaged in recycling. Survey using an instrument that allowed determining values, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, actual level of recycling, and link them to the intentions to recycle was performed among urban Lithuanian inhabitants. Results suggest two main strategies for social change managers: informing consumers to increase favourable attitudes towards recycling, and inducing recycling habit.

The BCTP method stems from the UML Use Case Points theory which is a practically tested and accepted approach to SW complexity estimation. The Use Case Points methodology was selected as the theory behind the construction of the BCTP model, due to the fact that firstly, both theories share the requirement analysis task and secondly because complexity of information systems is strongly related to their recovery in cases of their unexpected failovers. In the Use Case Points theory IT analysts perform software requirement analysis by executing various business scenarios. The BCTP theory, on the other hand, is constructed to support the analysis of IT system recovery requirements, by executing multiple efficient recovery scenarios. The method is a new approach to the objective determination of the Recovery Time Effort of a business function in comparison to the Rational Time Objective and the Maximum Acceptable Outage, which are defined with regard to the Impact Value Level of the function. The most critical functions of the enterprise should be included in the Minimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO) concept. MBCO refers to vital business functions without which the enterprise is not able to perform its basic operations. The Recovery Time Effort of a given business function is affected by multiple Technical, Environmental and Unexpected factors with precise weights and assessment values. Recovery exercises should be based on scenarios which include the unexpected factors that may delay the recovery process. The derived exercise results are proposed as drivers for the reassessment of the criticality of a business function.","[Podaras, Athanasios; Antlova, Klara; Motejlek, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Podaras, A; Antlová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec, Czech Republic.",athanasios.podaras@tul.cz; klara.antlova@tul.cz,"Podaras, Athanasios/AAB-1580-2020; Antlova, Klara/O-6401-2016","Motejlek, Jiri/0000-0002-7681-8170; Podaras, Athanasios/0000-0003-4573-8976",ESF operational program Education for Competitiveness in Czech Republic [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0065],ESF operational program Education for Competitiveness in Czech Republic,This work was supported by ESF operational program Education for Competitiveness in the Czech Republic in the framework of project Support of engineering of excellent research and development teams at the Technical University of Liberec No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0065,,28,7,7,2,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

A review on fifty-seven (57) journal articles, conference papers, reports, and theses, have identified twenty-four (24) dimensions of corporate governance in Islamic banks. From these dimensions, the six most frequently used as corporate governance dimensions in Islamic banks are: sharia scholars, stakeholders' role, responsibility, ownership, transparency, and sharia compliance. The synthesis of governance from Islamic perspective will make several noteworthy contributions to address the gaps in literatures for corporate governance in Islamic banks. This study will provide the basis for researchers to empirically examine the dimensions of corporate governance in Islamic banks and add additional empirical methods in future research.","[Sakti, Muhammad Rizky Prima] Univ Teknol Malaysia, MJIIT, Management Technol Finance, Kuala Lumpur Campus, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Tareq, Mohamad Ali] Univ Teknol Malaysia, MJIIT, Dept Management Technol MOT, Kuala Lumpur Campus, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sakti, MRP (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, MJIIT, Management Technol Finance, Kuala Lumpur Campus, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",sakti.finance@hotmail.com; tareq.mjiit@gmail.com,"Tareq, Mohammad Ali/D-5524-2016","Tareq, Mohammad Ali/0000-0001-5521-8814",,,,,70,0,0,1,6,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,18,29,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400004,0

It focuses on the intensified situation for the public IT sector. Due to forthcoming retirements and increasing changes of jobs from public IT sector to private organisations, in combination with severe public budget reductions, a fast approaching loss of professional work expertise (e.g. software application and process knowledge) in the electronic government sector has to be expected. To compensate this loss, answers have to be found to these questions: What knowledge will get lost in the electronic government sector in Saxony? When and where? How should this loss be compensated? The authors represent a network of knowledge management experts from Higher Education, IT and electronic government experts on municipal and regional level and representatives from the Saxon State Government responsible for the electronic government strategy. In summer 2015, a preliminary study introducing into a large-scale research was initiated. Several teams of Master students performed qualitative analyses based on in-depth interviews to find first answers to the questions above and thus establish a basis for future compensation measures, and to test if knowledge management methods accepted in the private sector are also applicable in the public sector. As a lesson learned from the preliminary study, the findings demonstrate a broad unpreparedness in Public Administration to the need for systematic knowledge management. While the question, how the knowledge loss can be compensated, remained unanswered for now, the studies triggered a re-design of knowledge management Master modules in 2016 to better prepare the next students' teams for more focused knowledge preservation actions, aiming to gain answers to that question.","[Schoop, Eric; Hesse, Moritz] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Breidung, Michael] Eigenbetrieb IT Dienstleistungen Landeshauptstadt, Berlin, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Schoop, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany.",eric.schoop@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,635,644,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200055,0

This also applies to shares in a fund already acquired by investors, since the new law will not provide comprehensive grandfathering provisions insofar as there is a need for existing investments in funds and structures, as a profit-realizing switch to the new investment tax regime will be effected. The general principle of a transparent taxation at the level of investment will be abolished because of the tax effects on fund investments will be the same as on a direct investment. Thus, a non transparent tax system at the level of investment funds will be implemented. This article intends to explore the background of this turnaround and to show the new taxation system for UCITS. In addition, several tax calculations will show the effects on future taxation for private capital investors. One impact on these capital investors could be that investment decisions would have to increasingly take into account tax effects. Finally, it will see if this new tax regime can serve as an example for European investment fund rules in the light of decisions of the European Court of Justice.","[Stiegler, Tobias; Wiesener, Axel Ulrich; Bussian, Aykut; Schmid, Jochen] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stiegler, T (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",tobias.stiegler@gmx.net; axel.wiesener@web.de; aykut.Bussian@bakertilly.de; jochen.schmid@tdwk.de,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,2005,2013,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700200,0

In itself, the Belgian Constitution contains very few requirements about public deficit and debt. It still gives the various Governments and Parliaments of the country a large margin of appreciation as no real sanction exists in case of exceeding loan issues (with a limited exception concerning the federated authorities). But as Belgian constitutional law has to organize a highly centrifugal federal system - deepened with the 2012-2014 Sixth Reform of the State -, it is also constituted by so-called special laws. Since 2013, a cooperation agreement has been adopted by the 8 institutions that have legislative powers in order to implement the 2012 Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The global balanced-budget objective arises primarily from EU law and the TSCG, while the 2013 cooperation agreement provides, at least theoretically, the way the stabilizing's efforts between the Federal State and the federated authorities are shared. Indeed, a dispute that got media coverage arose in April 2015 when the Federal Ministry of Finances transmitted controversial fiscal data to the Regions with the possible consequence they should have had to correct their respective deficit objectives. In the end, it appeared to be a mistake but it shows the fragility of such an institutional complexity combined with the existence of different political majorities. This report also focuses on the scrutiny of the budgets adopted by municipalities, federal social security and public enterprises.","[Yernault, Dimitri] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Droit Publ, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Yernault, D (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Droit Publ, Brussels, Belgium.",d.yernault@srib.be,,,,,,,45,0,0,2,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2214-6881,,978-3-319-41205-4; 978-3-319-41203-0,IUS COMP,,,2016,20,,,,,,45,84,,10.1007/978-3-319-41205-4_3,0.0,,,40,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BI1RQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406787000003,0

In this context, mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are under particular scrutiny, since they are often assumed to be motivated by possible market power increases, thus adversely affecting market efficiency. With a view to recent efforts within the European Union to increase the effectiveness of competition law in the energy sector (that is, legal and ownership unbundling as policy tools geared towards forcing corporations into demerging transactions), an event study approach is applied in this article to evaluate the market response to the announcement of mergers and acquisitions in EU and U.S. energy markets and to determine whether or not the hypothesis that M&As result in increased market power of the joined companies actually holds true. Findings indicate that increases in market power are not the main motive for energy market M&As. The results thus oppose the general adequacy of legal and ownership unbundling as veritable competition law instruments against market imperfections and failures, but indicate that unbundling can indeed be a viable policy solution if implemented on a case-by-case basis.","[Bogner, Stefan; Gasser, Stephan M.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, Vienna, Austria; [Rammerstorfer, Margarethe] MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Int Management, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Bogner, S (通讯作者)，WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, Vienna, Austria.",stefan.bogner@wu.ac.at; stephan.gasser@wu.ac.at; margarethe.rammerstorfer@modul.ac.at,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

But in many practical scenarios, the process appears to be inadequate, especially when data are overdispersed in nature. This overdispersion occurs mainly for three reasons: presence of some extreme values, large number of zeros, and presence of both extreme values with a large number of zeros. In this article, we develop a zero-inflated Poisson INAR(1) process as an alternative to the PINAR(1) process when the number of zeros in the data is larger than the expected number of zeros by the Poisson process. We investigate some important properties such as stationarity, ergodicity, autocorrelation structure, and conditional distribution, with a detailed study on h-step-ahead coherent forecasting.

The explanatory power of the developed assessment method was verified through the example of planned highway construction projects (eight projects) and of regional road improvement projects (11 projects) in the Czech Republic. On the basis of the synthesis of the obtained results, we have drawn up rankings showing the effectiveness of the implementation of individual projects. From an overall perspective, we can conclude that in the first group of projects, their ties to regional development play a crucial role, and in the second group of projects, their ties to residential and natural environments.

In practice, consumers often fail to choose the best price because they search too little, become confused comparing prices, and/or show excessive inertia through too little switching away from past choices or default options. This is particularly true when price is a vector rather than a scalar, and consumers have limited experience in the relevant market. All three mistakes may contribute to positive markups that fail to diminish as the number of competing sellers increases. Firms may have an incentive to exacerbate these problems by obfuscating prices, thereby using complexity to make price comparisons difficult and soften competition. Possible regulatory interventions include: simplifying the choice environment, for instance by restricting price to be a scalar; advising consumers of their expected costs under each option; or choosing on behalf of consumers.","[Grubb, Michael D.] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Boston College,"Grubb, MD (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",michael.grubb@bc.edu,,"Grubb, Michael/0000-0001-9885-2225",,,,,121,66,75,0,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The simulation experiments indicate a great potential to reduce congestion by means of intelligent pricing and reconsiderations of route choice decisions.","[Kaddoura, Ihab] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Transportat Syst Planning & Telemat, Berlin Inst Technol, Salzufer 17-19, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Kaddoura, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Transportat Syst Planning & Telemat, Berlin Inst Technol, Salzufer 17-19, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",kaddoura@vsp.tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,36,15,18,0,9,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Rewarding good behavior reduces the state's cost of operating prisons. But rewarding good behavior also tends to lower the deterrence of crime because such rewards diminish the disutility of imprisonment. I demonstrate that, despite this countervailing consideration, it is always socially desirable to reward good behavior with either time off or parole. In essence, this is because the reward can be chosen so that it just offsets the burden borne by prisoners to meet the standard of good behavior resulting in good behavior essentially without a reduction in deterrence. While employing privileges to reward good behavior might be preferable to no reward, the use of privileges is inferior to time off and parole. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a one-dimensional exploratory study which compares the socially responsible companies included in the Spanish sustainability index, FTSE4Good Ibex, with the rest of the indices in the IBEX family. Parametric testing was used to study whether there are differences between the two types of companies. The results demonstrate that there are no statistically significant differences in economic performance between the two groups. Morover, it is confirmed that companies with good practices are as profitable as the rest, but it also demonstrates that the economic-financial behaviour is not better as a result of being in the sustainability index. The basic conclusion is that adhering to social and environmental standards does not harm a firm's competitive position and, therefore, provide support for the development policy of responsible practices so that they become a tool to help improve the resilience of the economy and investor trust.","[Fernandez-Guadano, Josefina] Univ Complutense, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Finance, Econ Sci, Campus Somosaguas,Pabellon Sexto,Despacho 46, E-28223 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Fernández-Guadaño, J (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Finance, Econ Sci, Campus Somosaguas,Pabellon Sexto,Despacho 46, E-28223 Madrid, Spain.",jofernan@ucm.es,"FERNÁNDEZ-GUADAÑO, Josefina/A-8847-2013","FERNÁNDEZ-GUADAÑO, Josefina/0000-0001-8704-1486",,,,,51,7,7,1,27,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This article discusses the shortcomings of this judgment and argues that it is a great time for the CJEU to abandon the application of its quasi-per se rule of illegality approach to exclusive dealing and loyalty rebates and replace that application with a structured rule of reason.

New Evidence From Recent Newspaper Closures,JOURNAL OF MEDIA ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENDORSEMENTS,"With the advent of the Internet, many U.S. metropolitan areas have seen newspaper closures due to declining revenues. This provides the researcher with an opportunity to analyze the microeconomic sources of media bias. This article uses a large panel dataset of newspaper archives for 99 newspapers over 240 months (1990-2009). The author found that, after controlling for the unemployment rate, the change in unemployment rate, and the political preferences of surrounding metropolitan area, conservative newspapers report 17.4% more unemployment news when the President is a Democrat rather than a Republican, before the closure of a rival newspaper in the same media market. This effect is 12.8% for liberal newspapers. After the closure, these numbers are 3.5% and 1.1%, respectively. This moderation of media bias after closure of a rival newspaper is robust to the inclusion of newspaper size, newspaper fixed-effects or metropolitan area fixed-effects as controls. The author also found that newspapers in smaller metropolitan areas have a larger moderation in their bias. Findings provide support for theories in which media bias is demand-driven, as surviving newspapers aim to increase their sales by gaining the former readers of a closed newspaper in the same media market.","[Agirdas, Cagdas] Univ Tampa, Sykes Coll Business, Box O,401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA",University of Tampa,"Agirdas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tampa, Sykes Coll Business, Box O,401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA.",cagirdas@ut.edu,,,,,,,12,5,7,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

Despite the general consensus that malpractice reform leads to an increase in physician supply, usually targeted amongst a subset of physicians, debates rage at the state level over the effectiveness of any given reform. This paper reviews the evidence on the relationship between tort reform and physician supply and assess the implications for any given state. Although our difference in difference methodology prevents drawing conclusions about the impact of reforms on overall physician supply, we find that noneconomic damage caps increase the supply of physicians in high risk specialties. However, these effects, even for the high risk specialties, vary significantly across states. It is unclear whether these differences represent heterogeneous treatment effects across states, or simply random error in the estimates. New approaches are needed to estimating state-specific effects of tort reform to have the most impact on local policy debates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Network ownership, governance and public-private partnerships in Finland",RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Infrastructure; Ownership; Governance; Public-private-partnership,,"This paper discusses and analyses public private partnership (PPP) options within the framework of different ownership and governance (O&G) models of technical infrastructures. The O&G models in Finland are described and the market layers of ownership, operation, and services are studied. All infrastructure sectors have somewhat different O&G structures and they each have a different market context, not least because of ownership and the market structures that are on the infrastructure. Private companies, public companies, state and municipality owned enterprises and purely public-authority-type models can be found. Interestingly, the models seem not to affect too much the cash-based returns to the owners. However, the market structures will probably provide varying prospects for PPPs to be carried out, whether the PPPs are means of procuring projects or outsourcing of formerly public functions. The financial return capacity of the infrastructure is playing a key role. Some infrastructures have already a tradition of good business while others are considered as public goods on more or less sustainable grounds. The results imply that for some infrastructures there could be more natural markets for PPPs. The paper gives a topology for different market layers which can be identified for infrastructures and related services and businesses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the non-linear dependence between absolute returns and signs is characterized by a dynamic copula function which governs a dynamic skewness process of financial returns. The importance of modeling the time-varying skewness is evaluated via out-of-sample forecasts for the US excess stock returns, in terms of both statistical significance and economic relevance. I find that the skewness timing of the proposed time-varying dependence models yields an average gain in the returns of around 195 basis points per year over the forecast sample period. Statistically, the fluctuation test shows strong evidence that the forecasting performance of the decomposition models is unstable over the sample time path. In this regard, a forecast combination, being more robust to structural instability than the individual forecasts, performs significantly better than the benchmarks out-of-sample.

To achieve this, first the literature was consulted to provide a conceptual model. Through conducting a face-to-face interview, a total of 582 questionnaires were collected from employees who were full-time employees of the five-star hotels operating within the Mugla region of Turkey. The data obtained from the survey was analysed via the statistics program; within this explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed within the framework of Structural Equation Modelling. The study concluded and identified, that external factors, namely person-organization fit, have an effect on internal factors such as organizational identification, job performance, production deviance and the intention to remain. The empirical results indicate that person-organization fit has a significant and positive influence on organizational identification, job performance and intention to remain, while has a significant and negative influence on production deviance behavior.

First, a balance sheet perspective on financial success is constructive, and that a meaningful measure of the success of financial capability efforts is the health of one's balance sheet. Second, given relatively weak balance sheets among younger Americans before and after the Great Recession, and given that economically vulnerable families assumed greater balance sheet risk heading into the recession, efforts to build healthy, diversified balance sheets early in life should be strongly considered. Third, policies that establish savings accounts at birth or when entering kindergarten, which have been enacted or proposed at the local, state and national levels, hold particular promise and thus merit further consideration by policymakers, researchers, and others. Fourth, efforts to build savings and assets early in life are likely to yield benefits to children, families, and the economy.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF RECENT FCC COMPETITION ACTIONS,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET POWER,"In 1999, 2005, and 2007 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established approaches for relaxing pricing restrictions for incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) if competition in the relevant market is deemed to be sufficient. In the 1999 decision, the FCC established a mechanism by which ILECs could apply for increased pricing flexibility for special access (high-capacity) services in metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in which bright-line triggers had been satisfied. Such relief was granted in the majority of MSAs. Next, the FCC established a process by which ILECs could obtain forbearance from certain unbundling obligations, and approved requests for forbearance in Omaha, Nebraska and Anchorage, Alaska in 2005 and 2007. The FCC also granted forbearance from price regulation for the highest-capacity services (enterprise services) for the large majority of ILECs. In two recent decisions in 2010 and 2012, the FCC has denied forbearance requests and suspended further grants of special access price flexibility primarily on the grounds that the then-current mechanisms had not performed as anticipated. In their place, the FCC has proposed and implemented processes similar to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission's Merger Guidelines. This article describes the essential elements of the 2010 and 2012 decisions as well as the bright-line mechanisms previously relied on, outlines a framework for determining whether competition is sufficient in a telecommunications market, and uses this framework to evaluate the FCC's new directions.","Adv Analyt Consulting Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA",,"Tardiff, TJ (通讯作者)，Adv Analyt Consulting Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA.",timtardiff@aacg.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Exploiting changes in state law regarding the use of corporate independent expenditures in the pre-Citizens United era, we estimate that a state is more likely to pass antitakeover statutes that entrench management when firms are allowed to make independent expenditures. We also find that this relationship is conditional on the competitiveness of a state's electoral environment, suggesting that the threat of independent expenditures may move vulnerable legislators' votes on less salient issues, such as corporate governance. These findings are robust to competing public interest and political economy explanations for antitakeover lawmaking, and they reveal that allowing independent expenditures may create additional agency costs for owners through public policy. Finally, these results strongly challenge the claim that state-level antitakeover laws are exogenous to firms' activities.","[Werner, Timothy] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Coleman, John J.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Werner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,"Werner, Timothy/P-2261-2019","Werner, Timothy/0000-0003-0534-1229",,,,,88,20,27,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The regression analysis of monthly changes in economic policy uncertainty index, monthly returns on the CRSP value-weighted index, and monthly returns on an equal-weighted portfolio of public firms in the United States ranked consecutively from 2006 to 2011 in the top 50 of the Training Top 125 shows that the increased changes in economic policy uncertainty negatively affect the portfolio returns; however, this effect is not statistically significant at the 1% level. The result from regressing monthly returns on CRSP value-weighted index on the monthly changes of economic policy index yields a statistically significant negative coefficient at the 1% level, and this coefficient is more negative than the coefficient obtained from regressing the monthly portfolio returns on the monthly changes in economic policy uncertainty. This study provides empirical evidence of the ability of firms in the US with the best training program to withstand the storm of economic policy uncertainty better than the whole market. In other words, the findings suggest that firms with the best training program are more prepared than the whole market in responding to the changes in economic policy uncertainty.","Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Sch Business & Technol, Dept Business Management & Accounting, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Eastern Shore,"Sum, V (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Sch Business & Technol, Dept Business Management & Accounting, Kiah Hall 2117-A, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA.",vsum@umes.edu,,"Sum, Vichet/0000-0002-1331-2113",,,,,29,1,1,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

There are three key actors in the development of Brownfield areas; they consist of the developers, the authorities and the buyer. Brownfield redevelopment has a high demand at present time because of the scarcity of land. Most of Brownfield areas are located in urban and developed areas.

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEM,TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,liquidity hoarding; banking; financial crisis; risk management,HERD BEHAVIOR,"This paper provides empirical evidence of the main drivers of liquid reserves accumulation in the European banking system during 2004-2011 by using bank-specific balance sheet data.. The authors of this article propose a time-varying approach to distinguish between the liquidity hoarding and non-hoarding banks, which considers a certain threshold for the liquid assets to. deposits and short term funding ratio. The incentives of the liquid reserves accumulation are assessed through a dynamic panel specification using the First Differenced-GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond (1991). The empirical results show that the funding constraints, structural balance sheet risk and a low profitability ratio enhance banks to provision the liquid reserves. A contraction in the lending activity determines the increase of the liquidity buffers, while the reduction of the derivatives portfolio has an opposite effect. Moreover, smaller and less capitalized banks present more incentives to accumulate the liquid assets in respect to funding the liquidity shocks. The findings are of great importance for the banks and financial supervisory authorities especially during the stress periods.","[Andries, Alin Marius] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Corovei, Emilia; Mutu, Simona] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca 400591, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Andries, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, B Dul Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",alin.andries@uaic.ro; emilia_lud@yahoo.com; simona.mutu@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Andries, Alin Marius/B-5980-2011","Andries, Alin Marius/0000-0002-4415-4197",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi [10]; European Social Fund [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115]; CERGE-EI Foundation of the Global Development Network,Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); CERGE-EI Foundation of the Global Development Network,"Andries was supported by the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi through the grants for the young researchers Project no. 10 and Corovei by the European Social Fund through the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115 Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in the Romanian economics science domain.

However, support for this framework typically comes from analysis of static data, comparing EMNEs and OECD MNEs at a point in time. Little attention is paid to their development paths in a dynamic setting. We examine these propositions directly using an approach that enables us to decompose productivity growth of firms into its components, namely, changes in scale economies, technological progress and technical efficiency. We compare Chinese MNEs with their non-MNE domestic counterparts and developed country MNEs that have operations in China. We demonstrate that Chinese MNEs continue to derive much of their productivity growth from changes in scale economies, while developed country MNEs continue to have an advantage with respect to technical progress. Both these types of MNEs have a significant advantage over Chinese non-MNE domestic firms.","[Bhaumik, Sumon Kumar] Univ Sheffield, Finance, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Driffield, Nigel] Warwick Business Sch, Int Business, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Zhou, Ying] Univ Birmingham, Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Sheffield; University of Warwick; University of Birmingham,"Bhaumik, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Finance, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,"Bhaumik, Sumon/0000-0002-4459-3659",,,,,62,0,0,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,267,296,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028013,0.0,,,30,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300012,0

Commuting to school is an opportunity to embed a regular physical activity in students' daily routines and prevent many health issues that are stimulated by physical inactivity during childhood. A three level nested logit model is introduced to explain the motives behind school trip modal selection. Four choice situations, namely walking, driving, school busing, and taking public transit are considered. This study, particularly, underscored the significance of model misspecification in terms of policy outcomes, since multinomial logit models are typically adopted in the literature and have strong and, in many cases, unrealistic assumptions. Elasticity analysis of the MNL model showed an indirect elasticity of vehicle ownership of -0.13 for non-automobile modes, while NL model provides different elasticities of -0.12, -0.20 and -0.08, respectively for public, school bus, and walk modes. This misspecification results in over estimating the reduction in the share of students who walk to school when vehicle ownership increases. Moreover, a wide range of policy-sensitive variables along with their effect magnitude was discussed and compared with the previous studies. The results showed that one percent increase in the probability of walking to school is expected for every 0.04 percent increase in auto travel time, 0.07 percent increase in the normalized-to-income cost of driving, 0.08 percent decrease in vehicle ownership, 0.03 percent increase in distance to public transit, or 2.37 percent decrease in commute distance. Safety was also found to be very influential on active commuting, such that addressing the safety concern of parents is expected to increase propensity of active commuting to school by around 60 percent.

Although more than five years have elapsed since the Competition Amendment Act was promulgated, this provision has yet to come into force. However, when it eventually does so, it will mark a significant change in South African competition law, as it seeks to regulate firms' consciously parallel conduct. This is coordinated conduct that occurs without communication or agreement, but results in the prevention or substantial lessening of competition. Examples of horizontal tacit coordination practices include price leadership and facilitating practices, such as information exchanges and price signaling. The successful implementation of the amendment poses problems for the competition authorities in assessing the competitive effects of complex monopoly conduct and in providing effective remedies. Oligopoly markets result in mutual interdependent decision-making by firms, which can lead to market outcomes similar to explicit collusion. However, a further and little noticed issue is that firms in oligopolistic markets have opportunities to use focal points to determine coordinated strategies. This paper explores the nature and role of focal point pricing, which can lead to prices that are above competitive levels. The South African banking industry is used as an example. We find that focal point pricing is difficult to control, making the successful implementation of section 10A even more problematic. Moreover, the proposed amendment provides scope for the imposition of structural remedies by the Competition Tribunal, a function that the Competition Tribunal is ill-suited to perform.","[Holland, Mike] PriceMetr & Gordon Inst Business Sci, Pretoria, South Africa; [Rossouw, Jannie] Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Econ, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Staples, Jessica] High Court South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Holland, M (通讯作者)，PriceMetr & Gordon Inst Business Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Rossouw, Jannie/0000-0001-6200-1621",,,,,41,1,2,0,5,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Basically it is focused on the most mostly purchased item in the food range, which is bread. The analyzed sample represents 23 sorts of breads, together made up the total assortment of bread on offer in the shop.

The method used for the analysis is a panel data model which is based on conditional convergence hypothesis. The model is oriented to identification of factors which explain growth differentials of Croatian counties, including variables related to international competitiveness. The fundamental result obtained is empirical evidence for conclusion that international trade is not to be assumed as a key determinant of the regional convergence process in Croatia. Regional growth in Croatia is primarily determined by quality of human capital, investments in fixed assets and structural features of individual Croatian counties. The main conclusion on the basis of the results is that in the past period, regional growth was primarily determined by domestic demand of households and government. The highest growth was recorded in counties in which public funds were invested in infrastructural projects and counties specialised in production of services for personal consumption. However, the role of international trade in the regional economic growth can be more pronounced in the future as a result of limited domestic demand. Improved international competitiveness is a prerequisite for successful and sustainable regional development.","[Mikulic, Davor] Inst Econ Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Nagyszombaty, Andrea Galic] Croatian Bur Stat, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Mikulic, D (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedy 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",dmikulic@eizg.hr; galica@dzs.hr,"Mikulić, Davor/AAA-2279-2020","Mikulić, Davor/0000-0002-9847-6116",,,,,35,8,8,0,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The dynamic panel model of OECD countries in the period from 2000 to 2012 is employed. Taxes fairness is based on two approaches. The first one is the ability-to-pay principle and the second one is the benefit principle. The results suggest that governments should reconsider their attitude to more mainstream tax fairness principle which is the ability-to-pay. Especially left-wing European parties, which often deny benefit principle to be fair, should do so.

This established four initial hypotheses and analysis was performed through the development of a Structural Equations Model (SEM). We applied the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method to establish the relationships between the constructs as well as the predictive power of the structural model. The posited model we analyzed enabled us to confirm :the existence of a positive effect between the two relationships studied (relationship between leisure trade fair venue and exhibitor; and relationship between exhibitor and customer). This means that the quality of the relationship between the leisure trade fair venue and the exhibitors influences both the way in which exhibitors approach and develop their relationships with their customers. In addition, our results show the existence of a relevant impact of the relationship quality between organizations on the performance obtained by the exhibitor of leisure products and services at the end of the show This in turn is an indication of the important role of complaint management as a key tool for achieving a good business performance and ensuring the future of trade shows.","[Rodriguez, Ainhoa; Dolores Reina, Maria; Rufin, Ramon] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Business Adm, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Rodríguez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Business Adm, Madrid, Spain.",arodriguez@cee.uned.es; nnreina@cee.uned.es; rrufin@cee.uned.es,"Martin, Ainhoa Rodriguez/JQX-0769-2023; Rodríguez Oromendía, Ainhoa/HPB-7967-2023","Rodríguez Oromendía, Ainhoa/0009-0002-0856-4532",,,,,58,4,4,0,17,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In order to see the nature and the direction of the relation by applying GMM model, Granger causality and variance decomposition technique, the results show that the relation exists only under certain conditions, and there is a unidirectional relation rather than a bidirectional one. Due to the relation between the stock returns and trading volume after the crises, the results bring to light that the relation exists but only in the case of small size stocks and those traded in the EU zone, where the returns depend on both trading volume and their past values. The results from Granger causality demonstrated that the past values of trading volume could be used in forecasting the values of stock return in the case of domestic and large banks.

This tripartite cooperation model (banks, insurance companies, car dealers) promotes the rapid development of automobile consumption credit. The volume of auto loan credit (guarantee) insurance business got a rapid growth in 2001 and 2002, which made tremendous contributions to the development of China's automobile industry. But after the rapid growth, this market has experienced two high  phenomenon of high loss ratio and high overall rate of danger in the claims. Insurance companies and financial institutions therefore suffered serious losses. In 2004, most insurance companies opt out this market and the market has failed to recover. From a macroeconomic point of view of development, it is very embarrassing to see the auto loan guarantee insurance business is shrinking with the rapid development of China's automobile market and a steady increase in per capita GDP. Under this background, the insurance industry should research: how the insurance companies take measures to prevent the risk of auto loan market, to maintain healthy and rapid development of the auto insurance market. The thesis consists of four chapters: The first chapter is the analysis of automobile consumption credit market on the China. From the relevant data and forecasts we can see Chinese auto market has great potential. But the auto consumption credit is still in its infancy in China, compared with developed countries, automobile credit market has enormous development space and potential in China, and it will be a future automobile market big cheese. The second chapter focuses on the analysis of China's current three important ways of automobile consumption credit: auto financing company, automobile credit card payment, and car consumption loans. Then the analysis of insurance companies in the several modes of action: the function and existing problems. The third chapter: Analysis the demand of consumers and lenders in the automobile consumption credit market, we can see that if the risk(lending institutions cannot get loans) and consumer costs owing on the loan can reduce, then the car credit market can get sustainable development.

We use a recursive VAR model to determine whether budget balances in Macedonia were set exogenously and independently from public sector liabilities in the period 2000 - 2011. The results show that the cyclically adjusted balance of central government does not significantly respond to the public debt changes. Thus the basic conclusion is that in the analyzed period, a little attention is paid to the level od public liabilities (public debt) in setting current discretionary fiscal policy, indicating that fiscal policy can undermine the goal of monetary policy and that it dominates over monetary policy.","[Trenovski, Borce; Tashevska, Biljana] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Trenovski, B (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Blvd Goce Delcev 9, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia.",Biljana.Tashevska@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,"Trenovski, Borce/AAD-7295-2022; Tashevska, Biljana/AAM-6659-2021","Trenovski, Borce/0000-0002-3630-9486; Tashevska, Biljana/0000-0002-6198-9575",,,,,51,5,5,0,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Cross-sectional data were obtained from employees representing various organisations (N = 246). Contrary to expectations, structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated no significant relationship between perceived employability and wellbeing. Perceived employability was a significant predictor of employees' intention to leave the organisation. Results also indicated that the state of the psychological contract does not moderate the relationship between perceived employability and employee well-being and their intention to leave, respectively.

Recent literature defines perceived value as a multidimensional construct; the authors of this article suggest it can be explored through three dimensions: functional, emotional, and social value. Although many authors argue that customer loyalty should be viewed as both attitudinal and behavioural, usually it is not examined within the framework of this classification. This study addresses this gap by exploring the differences in relations between perceived value dimensions and attitudinal and behavioural loyalty. The results of quantitative survey with 211 retail store customers prove the existence of positive relations between three perceived value dimensions and loyalty. However, the results demonstrate that different perceived value dimensions have different effects on loyalty when separately analysing attitudinal and behavioural loyalty. Functional value is shown to have the strongest influence on attitudinal loyalty; meanwhile, emotional value has the strongest influence on behavioural loyalty.","[Virvilaite, Regina; Piligrimiene, Zaneta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Kliukaite, Ausra] UAB Novaturas, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Virvilaite, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, K Donelaicio Str 20, Kaunas, Lithuania.",regina.virvilaite@ktu.lt; zaneta.piligrimiene@ktu.lt; a.kliukaite@gmail.com,,"Gravelines, Zaneta/0000-0003-3930-2383",Research Council of Lithuania [VP1-3.1-SMM-07-K-03-083],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. VP1-3.1-SMM-07-K-03-083) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,50,6,6,13,81,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Besides this finding, there also exists a long-term equilibrium relationship between stock market funds and the stock price index.

The aim of this paper Is to examine the influence of public R&D expenditure on private R&D expenditure of the regions of EU less developed countries. This aim has been achieved by correlation analysis, and reviewing relations of development of examined volumes. The results have been discussed with some relevant studies in the field of public R&D expenditure impacts on private R&D investment. Based on our findings, we can suggest that there is no common pattern for public R&D influences on private R&D among the regions of EU less developed countries. Furthermore, there are no basic differences between the direct and indirect (i.e. via universities and public institutes) R&D funding for government. We can suggest beyond, it could be even better for government to looking for another effective ways of increasing private R&D, since the changes of private sources which may follow public funding are lesser, then one can expect. At least we can say that public sources are causing crowding out effect of private R&D investment, not the crowding in, which is undesirable; therefore, interventions connected only to increasing funding are simply not part of what regional or central governments may aim at all.","[Zdrazil, Pavel] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Zdrazil, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",pavel.zdrazil@upce.cz,"Zdražil, Pavel/AAM-2505-2020",,,,,,15,0,0,0,7,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,218,228,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000022,0

In addition, these studies restrict the slope coefficients of client characteristics on the proxy of audit quality to be the same across Big N and non-Big N clients. We re-investigate the auditor quality by incorporating self-selection of auditors in this paper. In addition, we allow the slopes of client characteristics to differ across the clients of the two types of auditors. We use the property-liability insurance companies operating in the United States between year 2002 and 2006 as a sample. We proxy audit quality by earning conservatism, measured as the signed loss reserve error. Our empirical results stand in sharp contrast with previous findings, i.e., Big N clients are not systematically different from non-Big N clients in reserve-estimation but the former are more conservative than the latter for financially weak insurers.

The originality of this paper is the linkage of macroeconomic variables of European countries and the evolution of private labels in these nations. This relationship may show the development of commercial distribution with regard to macroeconomic indices. A sample of 13 European countries and a period of 14 years have been collected, including data of private brands and macroeconomic indices. Panel Data analysis has been applied using SAS software. The percentage of female unemployment negatively affects the volume and value of private label, unlike male unemployment, which affects them positively. The GDP influences positively and slightly both the volume and the value of store brands. In addition, the fact that the percentage of urban population has a positive influence on the value of private brands but not on their volume is noteworthy. Last but not least, only the estimation of value of private label in Spain shows a significant positive increase in following years. Eight countries of the sample indicate the opposite trend.","[Gil Cordero, Eloy; Rondan Cataluna, Francisco Javier; Rey Moren, Manuel] Univ Seville, Dept Mkt, Avda Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Gil Cordero, E (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Mkt, Avda Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",corderoeloy@gmail.com; rondan@us.es; mrmoreno@us.es,"RONDAN-CATALUÑA, F.

Based on the abilities of the techniques and the results emerged this paper has prepared a robust model available for other RTOs to adopt as a true reference to reach to their TICs.","[Mortazavi Ravari, Sara Sadat] RIPI, Strategy Planning Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Mehrabanfar, Ehsan] Islamic Azad Univ, Young Researchers & Elites Club, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Banaitis, Audrius; Banaitiene, Nerija] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Econ & Property Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Banaitis, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Econ & Property Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",mortazavis2@ripi.ir; e.mehrabanfar@aut.ac.ir; audrius.banaitis@vgtu.lt; nerija.banaitiene@vgtu.lt,"Banaitiene, Nerija/AAN-8039-2020; Banaitis, Audrius/R-6749-2018","Banaitiene, Nerija/0000-0001-8420-5609; Banaitis, Audrius/0000-0002-3302-1209",,,,,49,16,21,5,37,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The paper aims to assess how automation fares with respect to conventional services in terms of users' attitudes. Stated preference data, based on a questionnaire administered in twelve cities, are used for the estimation of logit models providing preference shares for the conventional and the automated bus. The correlation among errors in repeated measurement data is tackled using a multivariate version of the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula, yielding a dosed form for the choice sequence probability. Estimation results show a relatively higher preference for automation across the cities where the automated bus is implemented inside a major facility. Without provision of information on how the system works and with no experience, users tend not to trust automation in the normal mixed-traffic conditions that are found in cities. The impacts of socio-economic variables are heterogenous across cities. Comparison between the logit based on the independence assumption and the logit with correlated observations shows deviations in coefficient estimates as large as twenty per cent with a typical sample size of about two hundred respondents and four choice tasks per individual. Deviations decrease to few percentage points when sample size is tripled. Deviations in preference shares are, however, negligible, a result which, in terms of policy implications, is indicative of the validity of the independence assumption in applied work.","[Alessandrini, Adriano] Univ Florence, Florence, Italy; [Delle Site, Paolo] Univ Niccolo Cusano Telemat Roma, Rome, Italy; [Gatta, Valerio; Marcucci, Edoardo] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy; [Zhang, Qing] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",University of Florence; Niccolo Cusano Online University; Roma Tre University; Sapienza University Rome,"Delle Site, P (通讯作者)，Univ Niccolo Cusano Telemat Roma, Rome, Italy.",paolo.dellesite@unicusano.it,"Site, Paolo Delle/AAC-9996-2019; marcucci, edoardo/AAJ-6539-2020; MArcucci, Edoardo/AAP-5143-2021","marcucci, edoardo/0000-0002-9813-3973; Gatta, Valerio/0000-0003-1631-1797",,,,,40,23,23,2,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

However, the multilevel character of these events is often oversimplified or ignored in the literature. This article uses multilevel network analysis to explore how temporary proximity during trade fairs facilitates enduring multilevel relational configurations that shape the economic structure of a particular industry. Using the concept of multilevel and multisided triad, I demonstrate that cooperation is also dependent on context and on the opposing side of the market, and because these triads are used disproportionately by employees from the largest companies, they contribute to increased socioeconomic inequalities between market actors.","[Brailly, Julien] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Corner Wakefield & William St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Brailly, Julien] Sci Po Paris, CSO, 19 Rue Amelie, F-75007 Paris, France",Swinburne University of Technology,"Brailly, J (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, CTI, Fac Business & Law, Corner Wakefield & William St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",jbrailly@swin.edu.au,,"Brailly, Julien/0000-0002-1462-8603",French National Research Agency (ANR); Sciences Po (Dynamique des Reseaux sociaux Multiniveaux Project); University of Paris-Dauphine,French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Sciences Po (Dynamique des Reseaux sociaux Multiniveaux Project); University of Paris-Dauphine,Research presented in this article was carried out as part of the Multilevel Social Networks programme (MLSN) funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

Policies to reduce this problem are generally aimed at improving control systems and increasing fines for offenders. In this paper, we attempt to identify the joint impact of different variables explaining fare evasion using an econometric study. The variables found to be statistically significant are the level of inspection, the proximity to a Metro or intermodal station, the bus occupancy level, the period of the day, the geographic location and number of passengers boarding and alighting at each bus stop, among others. We propose a novel approach to perform cost-benefit evaluation in order to help authorities increase the costeffectiveness of ticket inspection strategies on a given time horizon. We obtain new evidence that indicates that inspection strategies can be cost-effective even when evaders are not given a fine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we explore the motorcycle phenomenon from a threefold perspective, following the temporal trend of this growth, seeking the sociodemographic profiles of its users, and assessing their subjective motivations that explain the use of this specific mode of transport. We first measure the impact of motorcycles along a 2004-2012 timeline that covers both pre- and post-crisis data. Secondly, logistic and multinomial regression models are implemented to analyse the drivers and significant predictors of motorbike ownership and modal choice. Finally, we compare how motorcyclists and car drivers rated their main use of transport and how they evaluated the inherent risk of riding and driving, respectively. The results highlight the importance of motorized two-wheeled modes of transport in everyday mobility and also emphasize the role of the affordability factor to help understand the rise of this kind of transport, even in times of economic crisis. Overall. motorcycle use is explained by a set of objective and subjective factors that are seeking to resolve specific and unique transportation needs, and that are not equal to those of car drivers.

Our aim is to identify empirically the best factor model approach for the forecasting and nowcasting of the quarterly gross domestic product growth rate. We also propose some modifications of existing factor model specifications, with the aim of improving their forecast performances empirically. We conclude that factor models consistently outperform the benchmark autoregressive model, both before and during the crisis.

At the three- and six-month ahead horizons, various alternative predictor variables increase the accuracy of recession forecasts significantly relative to the term spread, with the annual return on the S&P500 index providing the strongest improvement.

In particular, authors focus on selection and application of multivariable statistical analysis to distinguish factors influencing innovativeness of EU economies to the highest degree. The result of quantitative analyses is linear ordering of EU countries by the level of their innovativeness based on the reduced set of diagnostic variables. The rating was compared with the outcome presented in Innovation Union Scoreboard (IUS) with Summary Innovation Index (SII). Conducted analysis proves a convergence between authors' results and existing ratings of innovativeness. Nevertheless, the main conclusion is that the methodology of innovativeness assessment remains an open issue and requires further research. Especially, it should first and foremost concentrate on deeper verification of a small set of variables that have the strongest impact on innovativeness. It is both, in economic and social interest, to get a clear picture of innovativeness driving forces.","[Roszko-Wojtowicz, Elzbieta] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Econ & Social Stat, Rewolucji 1905 R 41, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland; [Bialek, Jacek] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Stat Methods, Rewolucji 1905 R 41-43, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Lodz,"Roszko-Wójtowicz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Econ & Social Stat, Rewolucji 1905 R 41, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",eroszko33@gmail.com; jbialek@uni.lodz.pl,"Roszko-Wójtowicz, Elżbieta/AAD-4218-2019; Białek, Jacek/AAX-5756-2020; Białek, Jacek/S-6879-2018","Roszko-Wójtowicz, Elżbieta/0000-0001-9337-7218; Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327; Białek, Jacek/0000-0002-0952-5327",,,,,49,9,10,1,25,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Based on panel data of 1830 Chinese counties, this study employs the new classical economic growth theory framework to analyze the counties' economic growth by the perpetual inventory method, Malmquist index, among others. The results show that the economy of the counties exhibits 8 convergence since 2004, and the absolute differences in the different counties are expanding. Industrial policy ensures the additional deepening of the level of capital in the county. Additionally, a substantial difference was observed between the agricultural sector and the non-agricultural sector, whereby the total factor productivity and the technical efficiency are on the rise, resulting in the phenomenon of dual paths of technological progress. In summary, the capital deepening difference between the sectors, production efficiency, and dual paths of technological progress owing to the counties' industrial policy are the basic reasons for the regional differences in the level of economic development in China.","[Wang Zhenhua; Zhang Guangsheng] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University,"Wang, ZH (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China.",wangzhenhuasy@yeah.net; guangshengzhangsy@126.com,"ZHANG, Guangsheng/I-5774-2015","ZHANG, Guangsheng/0000-0003-1482-9429","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503173, 71273179]; Social Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [L15CJY014]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Liaoning Province,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71503173, 71273179) and Social Science Foundation of Liaoning Province (No. L15CJY014).",,28,3,4,4,28,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Through the analysis of three alternative scenarios, results reveal a potential reduction of the Tank-To-Wheel emissions up to 59% in comparison to the do-nothing option, which corresponds to an economic saving of about (sic)543M. These results constitute an instance of the effectiveness of alternative fuels for limiting the effects of climate change deriving from mobility. In terms of transport policy, the integrative approach of hydrogen and electricity, often seen in competitive terms, can indeed be fruitful, especially in a first penetration phase, provided that policy-makers have a long-term vision about future mobility. This should include not only issues related to the technological improvement, but also thoughtful and balanced measures for an efficient carbon policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Scholars engaging in positive analysis of constitutional rules argue that procedural rules are more durable and act as better safeguards for constitutional maintenance. Chapter 61 of the Magna Carta, also known as the 'security clause,' lays out the procedural component for enforcement of the Charter. The clause provides for a council of twenty-five barons to enforce the Charter, with provisions to choose and replace the members, outline their powers, and constrain executive action. It is therefore puzzling that Chapter 61 is absent in the 1216 issue of the Magna Carta, and all reissues thereafter. On the other hand, substantive protections like Chapter 40 have been maintained through the evolution of constitutional rules over 800 years. It is even more puzzling that the Magna Carta survived for 800 years without the main clause to enforce it. This paper argues that the procedural-versus-substantive distinction is superficial, and instead focuses on polycentric arrangements creating opposing interests, to understand self enforcing constitutions and explain the failure of the 1215 Charter and the longevity of the reissues of the Charter.

Our results suggest that governments may influence the openness of the domestic hostile takeover market through takeover regulation, potentially implementing protectionism. The corresponding features of the regulatory regime may in turn stimulate the deployment of anti-takeover provisions by entrenched target managers. Rather than increasing takeover premiums, anti-takeover provisions are associated with lower success rates of hostile bids, and may thus harm corporate governance. Governments' direct intervention in hostile takeovers is more likely in case of a foreign bidder, large transactions, high unemployment and high GDP growth rates, pointing to both protectionist and populist motives. The hostile bid failed in all cases of government intervention identified in our sample. Direct government intervention may thus serve as ultimo ratio in order to block unwanted transactions.

In kernel ridge regression, the observed predictor variables are mapped nonlinearly into a high-dimensional space, where estimation of the predictive regression model is based on a shrinkage estimator in order to avoid overfitting. We extend the kernel ridge regression methodology to enable its use for economic time series forecasting, by including lags of the dependent variable or other individual variables as predictors, as is typically desired in macroeconomic and financial applications. Both Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to various key measures of real economic activity confirm that kernel ridge regression can produce more accurate forecasts than traditional linear and nonlinear methods for dealing with many predictors based on principal components.

In Sweden, a number of different policies have been implemented to support CO2 emission reductions. In order to evaluate effects of different policies, a model for the evolution of the Swedish car fleet was developed in 2006. The model has been used in a number of projects since then, and it is now possible to compare forecasts with actual outcomes. Such evidence is relatively rare, and we think it may be useful to share our experience in this respect. We give a brief overview of the Swedish car fleet model system. Then we describe policies that have been implemented in recent years and the evolution of the Swedish car fleet We then focus on two projects which enable comparison with actual outcomes, and analyse the differences between forecasts and outcomes. We find that the model has weaknesses in catching car buyers' preferences of new technology. When this is not challenged too much, the model can forecast reasonably well on an aggregate level. We also find that the model is quite sensitive to assumptions on future supply. This is not so much related to the model, but to its use. Depending on the use of the forecasts - be it car sales, emissions or fuel demand - it may be necessary to use different supply scenarios to get an idea of the robustness of the forecast result.

In the past, computing power has limited the amount of temperature variables that can be used in a load forecasting model. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study to model the recency effect using a big data approach. We take advantage of modern computing power to answer a fundamental question: how many lagged hourly temperatures and/or moving average temperatures are needed in a regression model in order to capture the recency effect fully without compromising the forecasting accuracy? Using a case study based on data from the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012, we first demonstrate that a model with the recency effect outperforms its counterpart (a.k.a. Tao's Vanilla Benchmark Model) by 18% to 21% for forecasting the load series at the top (aggregated) level. We then model the recency effect in order to customize load forecasting models at the bottom level of a geographic hierarchy, again showing a superiority over the benchmark model of 12% to 15% on average. Finally, we discuss four different implementations of the recency effect modeling by hour of a day. In addition, this paper also presents two interesting findings: 1) the naive models are not useful for benchmark purposes in load forecasting at aggregated level due to their lack of accuracy; and 2) slicing the data into 24 pieces to develop one model for each hour is not necessarily better than building one interaction regression model using all 24 hours together.

One possible explanation for this is that spouses in endogamous marriages possess complementary skills and tastes that increase marital surplus. This paper aims to estimate the effects of ethnic assortative matching on a variety of household outcomes by using the exogenous variation in immigrant flows in the USA during the period 1900-1930 to disentangle the selection effect of partners. The major finding is that the complementarities in home production from same ethnic marriage enhances investment in household public goods such as childrearing and home ownership and reduces the market labor supply of wives. The OLS estimates of the sizes of these effects appear to be substantially biased downward, indicating positive selection into intermarriage in terms of unobservable traits that increase marital surplus.","[Wong, Ho-Po Crystal] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Wong, HPC (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",howong@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,54,3,4,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Our results are inconsistent for the period 2001-2011, but if we consider only 2011, the results document a positive correlation between corporate governance quality and market value of companies, such it is reflected by Tobin's Q. Therefore, our results contribute to the studies relating corporate governance and business performances, as it confirms a positive relationship between the two variables which appears once the Romanian emerging economy has began to adopt the best corporate governance practices. Firstly, our research has important implications for managers in order to know that the adoption of the best corporate governance practices could contribute to the financial success of the firm. Secondly, the results are useful for any investor who needs to consider the quality of corporate governance as a good predictor for the best rate of return of theirs investments.

This represents a change from traditional planning approaches centred on motorized road traffic/infrastructure provision and a shift towards more sustainable transport options. SUMPs require a long-term and sustainable vision for cities and these are to pay special attention to the participation of citizens and stakeholders and to coordination of policies across sectors (transport, land use, health, energy, and so on). The EC guidelines on developing and implementing SUMPs (EC, 2013) establish the following primary objectives of this new way of planning urban mobility: accessibility and quality of life, as well as sustainability, economic viability, social equity, health and environment quality. Since urban areas in Europe account for 23%-25% of CO2 emissions from transport (EC, 2013b; EEA, 2014), SUMPs are expected to contribute to meet longterm climate change policy goals. However, it is less clear how SUMPs can contribute to address key societal challenges such as equity issues in accessibility. According to the EC guidelines SUMPs are still non-existing concepts in most European member states. However, several cities in Europe and beyond have already formulated and adopted SUMPs. This paper is built on a review of former voluntary SUMPs developed in Portugal. A sample of forty case studies is considered in the analysis. It aims: a) to understand how climate change goals and equity issues in accessibility have been addressed through the first generation of SUMPs; b) to reflect on the role of SUMPs as tools to answer climate change goals without putting at risk social equity issues, and c) to outline further research needs in the SUMP approach. The research results are expected to give insights into social equity needs in urban transport and climate change adaptation policies in Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have investigated the drivers of university-industry (U-I) collaborations without looking at relationships and their influencing factors. This paper fills this gap by examining U-I links in the automotive and biotechnology sectors in Malaysia. The exercise produced three key results. Firstly, there was a significant but negative association between perceived importance of universities and firm-level TI, which indicates that firms have used universities in Malaysia less than their perceived importance. Secondly, the results demonstrate that the sequential effect of knowledge transfer (KT) channels and perceived barriers fully mediate the relationship between universities and TI. Firms that regard universities as important to TI also placed emphasis on KT channels and barriers.

We do this by carefully introducing microfoundations into a model by Chu and Koo (1990) who use SD to provide support to family-planning programs aiming at reducing the fertility of the poor. We show that fertility restrictions are generally detrimental for both individual and social welfare in spite of the fact that SD holds.

We develop a dynamic framework where migration responds to the prevalence of disease, to the costs of migration and to the costs of living. The model explores how pressure for migration in response to differing equilibrium levels of disease prevalence generates differences in city characteristics such as land rents. Competition for scarce housing in low-prevalence areas can create segregation, with disease concentrated in high-prevalence sinks. We show that policies affecting migration costs affect the steady-state disease prevalences across cities. In particular, migration can reduce steady-state disease incidence in low-prevalence areas while having no impact on prevalence in high-prevalence areas. This suggests that, in some circumstances, public health measures may need to avoid discouraging migration away from high-disease areas.","[Mesnard, Alice] City Univ London, London, England; [Mesnard, Alice] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Seabright, Paul] Toulouse Sch Econ IAST, Toulouse, France",City University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Mesnard, A (通讯作者)，City Univ London, London, England.;Mesnard, A (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",alice.mesnard.1@city.ac.uk,,"mesnard, alice/0000-0001-6899-9138","ANR - Labex IAST; AFD; IRD; AIRD; William, and Flora Hewlett fundation","ANR - Labex IAST(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); AFD; IRD; AIRD; William, and Flora Hewlett fundation","Support through the ANR - Labex IAST is gratefully acknowledged.; We are grateful to Jerome Adda, Emmanuelle Auriol, Jean-Paul Azam, Michael Ben-Gad, David Bardey, Clive Bell, Bastien Chabe-Ferret, Pascaline Dupas, Saqib Jafarey, Denis Gromb, Michael Kremer, Subhrendu Pattanayak, Nicola Pavoni, William Pouliot, Martin Ravallion, Colin Rowat, Patrick Rey, and participants in seminars in Toulouse, Cornell and City University and in conferences organized by the EUDN, PSE and the AFD in Paris, the AFD in Harvard, the NORFACE at UCL, the CSAE, CRETE, and the PopPov network for helpful comments.

This reduces the deterrence of serious crimes that do provide strong signals regarding the offender's character. Over-criminalization occurs when the costs associated with reduced deterrence due to stigma dilution off-set potential benefits associated with criminalizing the less harmful act. Identifying conditions under which stigma dilution is likely and comparatively costly allows the determination of factors that affect the desirability of (de)criminalizing various acts. These factors are discussed in the context of marijuana possession offenses to illustrate how over-criminalization may reduce social welfare. The normative desirability of various practices in criminal law are also discussed vis-A -vis their impacts on stigma dilution.,"[Mungan, Murat C.] Florida State Univ, Coll Law, 425 W Jefferson St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Mungan, Murat C.] Florida State Univ, Coll Social Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Mungan, MC (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Law, 425 W Jefferson St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",mmungan@law.fsu.edu,,"Mungan, Murat/0000-0003-1948-6488",,,,,32,16,16,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

I investigate this question using a novel data set from Charity Navigator, which provides quality ratings for 5,400 charities. Because Charity Navigator prominently displays a charity's star rating which is assigned based on its overall rating, one can identify the causal impact of a one star increase in ratings on charitable contributions with a regression discontinuity framework that exploits the threshold values of the overall ratings. I find that in general, the third-party ratings have a minor and often insignificant impact on charitable contributions received by charities. However, for relatively small charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5% increase in the amount of charitable contributions received. This result is robust under alternative model specifications and highlights the role of the third-party ratings in not-for-profit markets.","[Yoruk, Baris K.] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Yörük, BK (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",byoruk@albany.edu,,,,,,,32,29,39,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Often the rationale behind such informal arrangements is to get things done', to overcome the rigidity and inflexibility of formal administrative structures. As many other polycentric urban regions face similar issues, this analysis may help government tiers in the development of a response to the mismatch between urban structure and the architecture of formal government. The southern Randstad is one of the regions which has faced different informal governance arrangements at different scales.

By considering the patents issued by the EPO from 2000 to 2005, it is shown that the probability of a patent to be opposed by industry rivals is positively associated with the number of citations received and increases with company sales. The latter finding would suggest that patent oppositions are also used for strategic reasons. However, looking at the different outcomes of the opposition proceedings, it emerges that the probability of having a patent amended raises with the number of claims while the extent of company sales increases the likelihood of a revocation. Accordingly, patent oppositions do not appear to be used for pure strategic motives. This confirms that the opposition procedure adopted by the EPO is an effective mean to reduce the scope of further expensive litigation.","[Sterlacchini, Alessandro] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Sterlacchini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",a.sterlacchini@univpm.it,"Sterlacchini, Alessandro/AAF-9657-2020","Sterlacchini, Alessandro/0000-0003-1857-3803",,,,,38,7,10,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

RMG is a very important industry for the Bangladeshi economy, but is criticized for long product supply times due to poor SCM. RMG requires obtaining real-time information and enhanced dynamic control, through utilizing information sharing and connecting stakeholders in garment manufacture. However, a lack of IT support in the Bangladeshi RMG sector, the high price of computers and the low level of adoption of computer based intemet are obstacles to providing sophisticated computer aided SCM. Alternatively, explosive adoption of mobile phones and continuous improvement of this technology is an opportunity to provide mobile based SCM for the RMG sector. This research presents a mobile phone based SCM framework for the Bangladeshi RMG sector. The proposed framework shows that mobile phone based SCM can positively impact communication, information exchange, information retrieval and flow, coordination and management, which represent the main processes of effective SCM. However, to capitalize on these benefits, it is also important to discover the critical success factors and barriers to mobile SCM systems.","[Ahad, Taimur; Busch, Peter] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Fac Sci & Engn, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Blount, Yvette] Macquarie Univ, Dept Accounting & Corp Governance, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Vatanasakdakul, Savanid (Nui)] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University; Macquarie University; Macquarie University,"Ahad, T (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Fac Sci & Engn, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",md-taimur.ahad@students.mq.edu.au; peter.busch@mq.edu.au; yvette.blount@mq.edu.au; savanid.vatanasakdakul@mq.edu.au,"ahad, Md Taimur/ABB-9277-2021; Ahad, Md Taimur/JMQ-0941-2023; Busch, Peter/B-3839-2019","Ahad, Md Taimur/0000-0001-7657-2185; Busch, Peter/0000-0002-0710-772X",,,,,44,1,1,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,85,91,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700010,0

It compares small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that participated in collaborative research projects, funded by French competitiveness clusters, against similar control companies that were not part of such projects and not funded by the policy, over the period 2005-2013. French competitiveness clusters seek to enhance SMEs' size, performance, innovation and employment; the current study therefore assesses their outcomes in terms of capital invested and equity returns. The findings from a difference-in-differences analysis reveal that sales, employment, R&D investments, and value added all increase in relative terms, but financial returns exhibit significant relative decreases for the smallest companies, whereas larger firms record strong increases. The inability of the smallest SMEs to reap gains from their cluster membership should be a matter of great concern to both companies and policymakers.","[Braune, Eric] Inseec Business Sch, Finance, Lyon, France; [Mahieux, Xavier; Boncori, Anne-Laure] Inseec Business Sch, Finance, Paris, France",Groupe Inseec; Groupe Inseec,"Braune, E (通讯作者)，Inseec Business Sch, Finance, Lyon, France.",ebraune@inseec.com,"Braune, Eric/L-7751-2019",,,,,,49,12,12,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The paper analyses the possibilities of implementation of Toyota Production System within Japanese subsidiaries in Czech Republic. Moreover, it explores both the fit between the cultural values of Czech and Japanese management and the values incorporated in the Toyota Production System, and the various relationships of employees of both cultures at a managerial and operational level. In order to conduct the study, 79 companies were contacted, and survey responses from a total of 108 Czech and Japanese employees were collected. Using a self-administered questionnaire created in Czech, English and Japanese language, the findings of both common and divergent culturally-induced perspectives are analysed. Due to consistency with other cross-cultural studies Hofstede's cultural dimensions are used as foundation. The discussion correlates the results to the extent that they are deemed appropriate. Hall's low and high context models supplement the discussion, where applicable, to further explain issues relative to perception and communication. The dialogue is rich in the knowledge of Japanese methodologies of quality and overall management practice known in this case as the Toyota Production System. Data from the survey show that both Czech and Japanese employees have similar values related to work and neither job satisfaction nor number of conflicts is connected with TPS training. The manuscript concludes with both the list of existing research limitations that can be overcome in next studies, and an analysis of the need for further research within other cross-cultural frameworks.","[Brunet-Thornton, Richard] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Cross Cultural Management Ctr, Prague, Czech Republic; [Koza, Michal] Arthur D Little GmbH, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bures, Vladimir] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Hradec Kralove,"Brunet-Thornton, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Cross Cultural Management Ctr, Prague, Czech Republic.",richard.brunet-thornton@vse.cz; michal.koza@adlittle.com; vladimir.bures@uhk.cz,"Bureš, Vladimír/A-4353-2013","Bureš, Vladimír/0000-0001-7788-7445",FIM UHK Excellence Project MAS Applications in Modeling of Complex Socioeconomic Systems and Intelligent Environments,FIM UHK Excellence Project MAS Applications in Modeling of Complex Socioeconomic Systems and Intelligent Environments,The support of the FIM UHK Excellence Project MAS Applications in Modeling of Complex Socioeconomic Systems and Intelligent Environments is gratefully acknowledged.,,48,3,3,0,31,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Given that this was an exploratory research, we made use of a survey-based approach which enabled us to investigate and analyze the factors that affect sustainability of family-owned and managed businesses in Cameroon. This study also proposed measures that can be put in place by both the policies makers and owners of family businesses to ensure their sustainability. This study Was carried out in the Northwest and Southwest Regions of Cameroon where through purposive sampling some thirty family businesses were studied with the use of questionnaires to some workers and interviews with the owners of these businesses. The study made use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. We made use of the SPSS 17 and Stata 14 software programs for our analysis.

The companies operate in many countries, on different continents and in three very different industries (consumer goods, electronic products, oil and gas) with continuously changing features and trends, which gives complexity of integrating CSR approach. The study was conducted during 20152016 using public documents of the three companies analyzed. The results, based on empirical research, have revealed that there are some differences between the three companies regarding the role of CSR in risk management, but all continue to progress by integrating social and environmental considerations within organizational operations.

Actually it is calculated by the statistic departments on the basis of industry survey. Nevertheless some researchers doubt about the reliability of such indicator for prediction. Others state that this indicator just demonstrate the changes that already manifest in the real economy. So the question is still open and under consideration. That's why the purpose of this research is to test what type of relationship between the industrial confidence indicator and the production indices exist, i.e. Can the production indices be forecasted by the industrial confidence indicator? and Is the industrial confidence indicator based on the current level of production? Three techniques are applied for the analysis of the linkage between the industrial confidence indicator and the production indices: correlation analysis, Granger-causality test and autoregressive distributed lag model. The research is based on the analysis of eight production indices (intermediate goods, capital goods, consumer goods, durable consumer goods, non-durable consumer goods, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply) and the industrial confidence indicator of Germany during the period of January 1995 - October 2015. The results of the research showed that the changes in industrial confidence indicator have significant and positive impact on the changes in all production indices, except electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply. Meanwhile the changes in industrial confidence indicator can be explained only by the changes of two production indices, i.e. intermediate goods and mining and quarrying. Generally, it can be stated that industrial confidence is related with the real levels of production. This research was made on the basis of Germany statistical data and a similar study for other countries should be done in order to find out whether these findings are specific for Germany or universal. The same methodology presented in this paper can be applied for this purpose.","[Dapkus, Mindaugas; Stundziene, Alina] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Dapkus, M (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",mindaugas.dapkus@ktu.lt,"Stundziene, Alina/AAE-1356-2020","Stundziene, Alina/0000-0001-6812-8471",,,,,20,2,2,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,520,531,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200044,0

Based on these we identify some ways forward that, we argue, would deal better with the complex multi-actor dynamics, fundamental uncertainties and challenges to the implementation, coordination and evaluation of policies and which would make for more relevant and impactful innovation policy studies.","[Flanagan, Kieron; Uyarra, Elvira] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Flanagan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England.",kieron.flanagan@manchester.ac.uk,,"uyarra, elvira/0000-0003-3144-1741",,,,,67,102,105,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Firm value was proxied both through accounting measures (such as return on assets, ROA and return on equity, ROE) and market measures (such as earnings per share, EPS), all being industry-adjusted. Based on the 'Comply or Explain' Statement issued by the BSE, there was conceived a questionnaire having the purpose to develop corporate governance ratings. Thus, we report the global corporate governance rating and a set of specific ratings as regards transparency and reporting, board and committees, shareholder rights, as well as corporate social and environmental responsibility. Therefore, by estimating several multivariate linear regression models, our results provide support for a positive and statistically significant relationship between the rating related to transparency and reporting and firm value, likewise between the rating related to corporate social and environmental responsibility and firm value, but only for industry-adjusted ROA. However, there was noticed the lack of any statistically significant relationship between corporate governance ratings and firm value, when industry-adjusted ROE and industry-adjusted EPS were employed.","[Gherghina, Stefan Cristian; Vintila, Georgeta] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Gherghina, SC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania.",stefan.gherghina@fin.ase.ro; vintilageorgeta@yahoo.fr,"Vintila, Georgeta/C-4935-2011; Vintila, Georgeta/AAY-8162-2021; Gherghina, Ştefan Cristian/J-3339-2012","Vintila, Georgeta/0000-0002-0342-9246; Vintila, Georgeta/0000-0002-0342-9246; Gherghina, Ştefan Cristian/0000-0003-2911-6480",,,,,26,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,139,155,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_9,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800009,0

It highlights the quality problems in public and private banks from the perspectives of the main stakeholders; customers and Internet banking providers that are resulted from previous papers. From the data analysis, supported by the literature, seven-service quality dimensions were identified; namely; Usability, Reliability, Responsiveness, Privacy, Fulfillment, Efficiency, Assurance. A revised dynamics model was drawn and simulated using Powersim software. System dynamics results show that Customer Relationship Management is a dimension that would increase e-service quality and customer satisfaction. Finally, when results were brought together, similarities and differences between customers and Internet banking decision makers helped better understand the problem, derive conclusions and make recommendations.

In this paper, we present a new method of Evaluation by an Area-based Method of Ranking Interval Type-2 Fuzzy sets (EAMRIT-2F) for multi-criteria group decision-making. First, we propose a new method for ranking interval type-2 fuzzy sets based on the area under the upper and lower membership functions and the possibility degree of fuzzy sets. The ranking values of the proposed method are also compared with some existing methods. Then, the EAMRIT-2F method is presented based on the proposed ranking method of interval type-2 fuzzy sets for handling the fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making problems. Applying the proposed method to an example concerning the selection of a facility location, we illustrate the process of the proposed method in the fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making. The result of the EAMRIT-2F method is compared with five other methods. The comparison shows the consistency between the proposed method and other methods.","[Keshavarz Ghorabaee, Mehdi; Amiri, Maghsoud] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran 1489684511, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Keshavarz Ghorabaee, M (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran 1489684511, Iran.",mkeshavarz_gh@yahoo.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; amiri@atu.ac.ir; jargita.anatcheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Amiri, Maghsoud/Z-3160-2019; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/J-5488-2014; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018","Amiri, Maghsoud/0000-0002-0650-2584; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/0000-0002-0362-1633; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216",,,,,47,25,25,0,3,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

As' a result, there are excess emergency shunt capacities in the early time, but. insufficient capacities later.","[Liu Qing; Chen Yanqing; Wang Haiyan; Zhang Yajie; Zhang Wei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Transportat, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China; [Liu Qing; Chen Yanqing; Wang Haiyan; Zhang Yajie; Zhang Wei] Natl Water Transport Safety Engn Technol Res Ctr, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Transportat, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China.;Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Natl Water Transport Safety Engn Technol Res Ctr, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China.",673633005@qq.com; 375975962@qq.com; 1293086585@qq.com; 313227462@qq.com; 1393503152@qq.com,"zhang, yajie/GVT-3956-2022",,,,,,9,1,1,0,2,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,684,688,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400111,0

It is an important channel through which the government obtains reliable and valuable data to formulate policies and is the basic parameter essential for national and regional development. It is also an important part of macroeconomics. Research on economic industry security in various countries and regions is long-standing, but most studies have established a theoretical system by relying on policy regulations and economic behavior as a presupposition along with logical reasoning, a lack of economic activity, psychology empirical induction, and empirical analysis research. At the same time, economics began to reflect on postexperience single logical reasoning limitations. It was found that there are important reasons of human economic behavior that affects people's economic behavior: It is a form of psychological motivation. It has been found through long-term study that human economic behavior has its own psychological motivation. To understand the motivation behind the behavior can help us grasp the nature of the behavior more clearly and accurately. The architecture method of psychology's samples method of testing has the advantage of theory confirmation and construction, which the logical deductive method in economics does not have. It is in this context that psychology has a dialogue and fusion with economics resulting in the independent cross-discipline of economic psychology. Economic psychology not only broke the constraints of using purely logical reasoning in economics, it has also produced rich empirical technology; therefore, both early and future theory of economics can use these methods to perform empirical analysis research so that the research results and parameters are more scientific and realistic. Industry security in the economic field is naturally influenced by the development of economics: It introduces the theory and empirical technology of economic psychology to different degrees and in different ways to make studies more scientific and empirical. This is also the topic of this chapter. Currently evolutionary psychology and neural economic psychology have become hot topics [1]. The effect of psychology on economics has been widely recognized and applied. This chapter uses qualitative, comparative analysis, empirical method, etc.; discusses personal insights on the introduction of the theory and technology of economic psychology; clarifies respective performance effects, advantages, and practical significance of economic psychology and economic security; and discusses the orientation and focus of economic psychology in the industry security system. The innovation of this chapter is as follows: Question the limit of industry security fully established in subjective logic thinking; discuss the importance of introducing psychology to theoretical empirical analysis and technical guidance at every stage of industry security establishment and operation; put forward the author's view of economics from the perspective of psychology; intentionally arouse more voice and special thinking on this subject from different fields; and jointly promote the development of China's industry security research center and international industry security research system. The term economic psychology in this chapter refers to the common-concept category of narrow economic psychology with general economic psychology.","[Luo, Guangli] Shanghai Dinglan Business Consulting Co Ltd, Shanghai 201999, Peoples R China; [Luo, Guangli] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Postdoctoral Res Inst, China Ind Safety Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Luo, GL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Dinglan Business Consulting Co Ltd, Shanghai 201999, Peoples R China.",lgl_0525@sina.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-981-287-655-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,161,170,,10.1007/978-981-287-655-3_21,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE9ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377352200021,0

Information is collected, aggregated, analysed and used to create real business advantage and value but also risks within companies and also outside on the markets in a high volume (Spears Janine L., 2010). On the other hand, single individuals still need to deal and interpret this sheer mass of increasing information continuously. The areas of decision making processes, methods and methodologies are well researched (Ayyub B., 2014) at all also on the base of Current Management Theories (Greenwood W. T., 1974) (Barney J. B., 2009). The field of Information Risk Management as a sub-discipline of Enterprise-Risk-Management (Choi J., 2013) theories is in a constant change. This change is triggered by the dramatic ongoing changes in the computerized information management Power, (Daniel J., (2008) capabilities. Well accepted, in 21st century Information itself is a valuable asset (Wagner H., 2014). The correct information at the point in time needed decides on success (Pfeiffer T., 2010)-within milliseconds. Current Organizational Management theories don't take this constantly and rapidly changing environment into account (Huang K., 2015). An undertaken series of 10 interviews of Information Risk Management Professionals compared with field-study of 131 Business Managers examines the differences in perception of related risks, actions and counter activities. In Management Theory as well as in Organizational Theories the Information-Risk-Management discipline needs to be considered through the whole value chain (Holtgrewe U., 2014) as a separate value adding process and function. Esp. managers in middle management are exposed to this area risks, but might get into a conflict of interest (Biocca M., 2005) between performing the required IRM-actions against showing a high cost-benefit rationale. This article examines the different perception, the resulting needs and recommendations for changes in organizational theory to resolve this conflict of interest for stronger overall performance.","[Schwerd, Stefan] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Schwerd, S (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",stefan@schwerd.eu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,645,652,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200056,0

Since there is a wide consensus that the difference in efficiency between public and private companies is hardly measurable as the primary goals of these two sectors are basically different, the attention is turned out to the differences in productivity within the sector of private non financial companies. The Czech economy did not succeed to cope with the risks faced by the countries which attract high inflow of FDI, namely the misbalanced dual structures. The differences between more efficient and profitable sector of foreign-controlled companies and purely domestic laggards have been posing a challenge for domestic economic policy. Moreover, investment and wages in companies under foreign control do not depend only on their own results but also on conditions of their mothers.

Permanent income elasticities were greater in each case than current income elasticity. The quantile regression showed that permanent income, current income and price were significant for all quantiles of housing units consumed. It is recommended that all these factors be taken into account when addressing the housing supply challenges facing Ghana to help clear the existing deficit and to provide for the anticipated increase in demand due to increasing income, since demand for housing in the country is income inelastic.","[Tandoh, Francis] Univ Zululand, Dept Econ, Mangeze, South Africa; [Tewari, Devi Datt] Univ Zululand, Fac Commerce Adm & Law, Mangeze, South Africa",University of Zululand; University of Zululand,"Tandoh, F (通讯作者)，Univ Zululand, Dept Econ, Mangeze, South Africa.",,,,,,,,37,4,5,0,14,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Furthermore, financial costs incurred during BP execution is prominent information needed for BP improvement decision making in terms of cost reduction. We proposed a solution for BP model extension with cost perspective based on PMining. The solution is based on cost extension of the High Level Process Structure (HLPS) which is a meta-model enabling the integration of different perspectives into one model independently of its notation. However, the cost extension is designed only at the activity level and the general approach needs to be validated.

First, we estimate the private returns to education using the highest certificate qualification or sheepskin effects. Secondly, we analyse the trend of private returns to education during the years 2002-2007. Thirdly, we examine the effects of educational mismatch on private returns to education. The simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator with robust standard errors is employed to estimate the earnings function. Our results indicate the presence of an over-education situation among degree-educated workers despite enjoying higher private returns. Such over-qualification in the financial sector is due to the mismatches in the supply of degree-educated workers for medium-skilled positions, which is now outstripping the supply of high-skilled workers. Interestingly, our results are found to contradict most of the previous empirical studies. Hence, our study is believed to contribute to the literature by explaining the phenomenon of over-education using the signalling hypothesis. Since over-education reflects inefficiencies in the allocation of resources, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) need to increase their interaction with industry in order to find a solution to the incidence of mismatch which is partly due to the lack of integration between education providers and employers in the demand driven labour market.

In this study, we asked subjects to estimate how high their tax burden is, and to give their opinion if, or to what extent, they would consider this perceived tax rate as fair. We provide evidence that the perceived income tax rates significantly deviate from the objective tax rates for the majority of taxpayers. The degree of misperception can be partly explained by the individual's level of education, income, and whether the individual included social security contribution in their income tax rate estimation. Comparing the perceived tax rate with the tax rate that is regarded as fair, we find that the individual's level of education and age influence their estimate. Taking the results of Schmoelders (Das Irrationale in der offentlichen Finanzwirtschaft. Rowohlt, Hamburg, 1960) into account, we show that the income tax misperception as well as the relation between perceived and fair income tax rates is surprisingly stable over time.

In particular, to date, there is only anecdotal evidence on which factors policy-makers can utilize to foster entrepreneurship within the agri-food sector. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by developing, testing, and validating a multi-item scale, identifying five factors (i.e. people, money, network, technology, infrastructure) and 16 specific tools (i.e. items) to be leveraged in promoting entrepreneurship within the agri-food industry. We carry out our study in the context of Foodbest, a pan-European public-private consortium created in 2012 to support entrepreneurship and innovation in the agri-food sector. By testing for differences in perceptions of factors' and tools' effectiveness, we find variations according to respondents' organizational and country affiliation. We thus offer new insights into how public policy and public-private consortiums can proactively promote entrepreneurship in the agri-food domain. Key Points: We cover three key points. First, by conducting a literature review and working with a focus group, we identify a set of theoretically grounded factors and tools that could help promote entrepreneurship in the agri-food industry. Second, we develop and test a multi-item scale of these factors within the context of a pan-European public-private consortium. Third, we show that perceptions of factor effectiveness vary among consortium participants according to participants' personal characteristics and organizational affiliations.","[Bolzani, Daniela; Fini, Riccardo; Sobrero, Maurizio] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy; [Carli, Giacomo] Open Univ, Sch Business, Dept Strategy & Mkt, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",University of Bologna; Open University - UK,"Fini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Technol Innovat Management, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",riccardo.fini@unibo.it,"Fini, Riccardo/F-2717-2011; Carli, Giacomo/C-3006-2014; Bolzani, Daniela/ABD-9698-2020; Sobrero, Maurizio/E-2532-2013; Carli, Giacomo/M-4044-2016; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","Fini, Riccardo/0000-0002-8640-8976; Carli, Giacomo/0000-0001-9406-589X; Sobrero, Maurizio/0000-0002-7839-2935; Carli, Giacomo/0000-0001-9406-589X;",,,,,151,9,9,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We consider BVAR averaging with equal and optimal weights, Bayesian factor augmented VARs (BFAVARs), and large BVARs with ad-hoc, optimal, and estimated hyperparameters. BVAR averaging delivers relatively high RMSEs, but performs better in terms of predictive likelihoods. Large BVARs show the opposite pattern, while BFAVARs perform satisfactorily under both criteria. Continuous ranked probability scores indicate that large BVARs suffer most from extreme observations. Using calibration tests, we detect that most BVARs produce reasonable density forecasts for HICP inflation, but not for GDP growth. In an extensive sensitivity analysis, we show that large BVARs are an excellent choice for certain specifications (recursive estimation, 22 variables, iterative approach, and optimal or estimated hyperparameters), while BFAVARs are competitive under most specifications, and specifically when the cross section is large.

I show that station prices are higher and change less frequently in locations using more odd prices (particularly those ending in 5 or 9), even after controlling for other market characteristics. The evidence suggests that the use of pricing points can be an effective mechanism for tacitly coordinating prices, providing an alternative explanation for the widespread use of odd prices in retail markets.","Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Lewis, MS (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",mslewis@clemson.edu,"Lewis, Matthew S/D-2537-2010","Lewis, Matthew/0000-0002-2211-6595",,,,,28,19,22,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

One option increasingly used by schools is to suspend problem youth and remove them for defined periods. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether this type of disciplinary policy has unintended consequences by giving problem youth greater opportunity to commit crimes outside of school. Previous studies have looked at the incapacitation effect of school holidays and teacher strike days, but these studies do not directly address the relevant school policy decisions. The current study relies on administrative data from a school district and a juvenile justice system. The results indicate that out-of-school suspension may increase criminal offending behavior by problem youth, more than doubling the probability of arrest. The effect is particularly large among African American youth, relative to Whites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, an alternative forecast method, intercept correction, is considered for further comparison. Recursive out-of-sample forecasts are generated for both models and forecast techniques. The generated forecasts for each model are objectively evaluated by a selection of evaluation measures and equal accuracy tests. The result shows that the VECM consistently outperforms the VAR models. Further, intercept correction enhances the forecast accuracy when applied to the VECM, whereas there is no such indication when applied to the VAR model. For certain forecast horizons there is a significant difference in forecast ability between the intercept corrected VECM compared to the VAR model.

A century separated them, during which architects and planners designed cities according to abstract principles, but George and Jacobs expected the creative potential of a city to emerge from its inhabitants, not from a central planner. Although the interests and concerns of George and Jacobs overlapped on only a few topics, they both believed that slum dwellers could solve their own problems, given the right tools. For Jacobs, the solution to dilapidated housing lay not in bulldozing neighborhoods, but in rehabilitating them through a process she called unslumming, a gradual process of self-improvement that has at times been accused of being gentrification. Henry George offered a different solution, involving taxation of land values, one that did not focus on particular neighborhoods and thus avoided the paradox that local improvements would raise the price of real estate too high for local residents to stay. An example is given of how George's solution actually worked in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia. In this case, no change in tax policy was needed to bring about a local economic renaissance in the 1960s, merely the realignment of property assessments that correctly reflected the actual value of land.","[Rybeck, Walter] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA",Urban Institute,,,,,,,,,6,2,3,2,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We document an asymmetry in this association depending on whether a stock experienced consecutive rounds of capital gains (winner) or losses (loser): the association is strong for losers, but weak for winners. We also find that earnings forecasts are less accurate for analysts who treat winners and losers differently from moderately-performing stocks. However, the degree of such aberrant reactions to winners and losers and the consequent detrimental effect on the forecasting accuracy are less acute for analysts who have more forecasting experience with winners and losers. Finally, consistent with the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), we find that investors discount earnings forecast revisions by analysts who treat winners and losers differently, particularly after 2003, coinciding with the Global Settlement that aims to improve the integrity of analyst research and investors' financial literacy.

Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal Supreme Court opinions refined the threshold for motions to dismiss claims. In elaborating on these thresholds, the Court discussed the legal interplay of possibility, plausibility, and probability. The Court emphasized that claims must go beyond a recitation of theories or legal standards and rely on some level of factual allegations. Since the Iqbal decision, numerous lower courts have applied the newly articulated Twombly/Iqbal standards. Legal practitioners have argued that there are inconsistencies between courts when evaluating the scope and application of these standards. In order to help resolve this murkiness, this paper suggests a structured methodology that can be employed when arguing a motion to dismiss. A number of tools for evaluating the Twombly/Iqbal standard are proposed. We posit strong and weak conditions for satisfying these standards. The strong conditions for surviving a motion to dismiss are satisfied if well articulated conditions that meet the logical concept of sufficiency along with supporting facts are presented. Under the weak criteria, the claims are more likely to meet the standards the closer they are to the logical concept of sufficiency. In other words, the more unlikely are the claims (and supporting facts) to exist in the absence of a violation, the better able are the claims to meet the standard. The proposed methodology is applied to a broad range of antitrust categories.","[Herman, Douglas A.; Sacher, Seth B.] US Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Herman, DA (通讯作者)，US Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",dougaherman@gmail.com; ssacher@ftc.gov,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

This shrinkage applies particularly to the state's social roles as: a source of income support; a provider of free or subsidised public services; a direct employer; and a defence against the marketisation of society.

Given the important trade volume and rooted relations between Turkey and the EU, their trade and economic relations should be paid due attention and steps should be taken to further improve these relations. Turkey is the biggest economy in a Customs Union (CU) with EU but not in EU, along with Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino. When it joined the CU in 1996, Turkey has removed all customs duties and equivalent charges as well as quantitative restrictions. However some EU countries imposes quota limits to the Turkish road transporters that may indirectly restricts the trade between Turkey and the related country. In this study, we investigate the effect of road transport quotas on Turkish foreign trade with EU countries. A gravity model that is estimated with panel data from 18 selected EU countries between 2005 and 2012 is used for this purpose. Furthermore, as one of the leading sectors using road transportation for Turkey's export to EU countries, textile sector is analyzed as a case study. The results indicate that quotas have significant effects on Turkish total exports via road transport as well as the Turkish textile exports to EU countries. The estimated amount of the loss of the exports of Turkey to the selected countries in analyzed time period is 10.6 billion $ in Turkey's total exports via road transport, and 5.65 billion $ in Turkey's total textile exports. Therefore, it can be concluded that the quota limitations are against CU regulations because they do not limit not on the road transportation but also the trade between parties.

Using a research method similar to those used in prior studies, this study finds that about 1.5% of adult consumers have generated innovations for their own use during the past three years, and 21.9% of consumer innovators share their innovations with other consumers or firms. Consumers who are male, working, and highly educated are more likely to generate innovations. Moreover, consumer innovators tend to share their innovations, when they are young and participate in community activities and when their innovations have higher values to others. The total amount of innovation expenditure by consumers exceeds 0.34 billion US dollars, which accounts for 4.4% of the R&D investment of Korean firms in the consumer goods sector. Although the proportion of consumer user innovators in Korea is relatively lower than that found in advanced countries, the number of consumers who generate innovations and their innovation expenditures are far from being negligible. As a result, this study suggests a few government policies to encourage and facilitate development, diffusion, and commercialisation of consumer innovations in late industrialising contexts, including Korea.","Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, Seoul 130012, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, 85 Hoegi Ro, Seoul 130012, South Korea.",ybkim@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Youngbae/C-1985-2011",,,,,,32,30,31,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The assessment of the effect of economic growth on sustainable development is provided in this paper as well. The main issue of the article is how to achieve economic growth taking into account the sustainability of economic, social, and environmental spheres? The fast pace of growth in production may lead to the high level of inflation. Damage may be caused by the increased use of natural resources and due to the increased air and water pollution as well as waste generation that are attributed to the environmental sphere. The too low growth of production may have an influence on the increased unemployment and poverty levels that are attributed to the social sphere. Therefore, it is of great importance to align these three spheres.","[Ciegis, Remigijus] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ciegis, Remigijus; Mikalauskiene, Asta] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Dilius, Aidas] Siauliai Univ, Fac Social Sci, LT-78366 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vilnius University; Siauliai University,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Donelaicio Str 28, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@vukhf.lt; aidasdilius@gmail.com; astam@mail.lei.lt,,,,,,,111,12,12,2,32,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Specific different concepts of sustainability of the government debt are defined. The rationale and arguments of the selection of the government debt evaluation methods are provided. The results of the research show that isolated research, based on the separate method, which in turn is selected because of the specific adopted concept of the government debt sustainability, often is not reliable due to limited interpretation of the government debt sustainability. This contradiction can be counterweighed by the systemic approach to the evaluation of the government debt sustainability. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this paper, the authors propose an integrated model that combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) into a single evaluation model. The model is illustrated with a case study on bank experts to demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated method for four firms that applied for a commercial loan. In this study, AHP is applied to determine the weight of the criteria, and GRA is performed to determine the most appropriate firm. The results of this study indicate that, whereas firm morality and news criteria are the main criteria with the highest priority, sale and marketing constructions are the main criteria with the lowest priorities for both public and private banks. In addition, according to the results of GRA, the most appropriate firm for a public bank is Firm 1, and the most appropriate firm for a private bank is Firm 2.","[Ertug, Zeliha Kaygisiz; Girginer, Nuray] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Dept Business Adm, Eskisehir, Turkey",Eskisehir Osmangazi University,"Ertug, ZK (通讯作者)，Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Dept Business Adm, Eskisehir, Turkey.",,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,21,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Prior literature examines the puzzling empirical regularity that premarital cohabitation is associated with higher divorce rates. Since cohabitation should yield improved match-quality information, one might expect the opposite. This result, and its recent weakening, have been explored empirically and produced theoretically using matching models. In this paper, we develop an intra-household bargaining model of alternative dating and cohabitation paths to marriage in which higher relationship exit costs for cohabitors relative to daters generates the observed higher divorce rate. We also show that asymmetric exit costs can produce rejection and generate exits that would not otherwise occur. In addition, we show that even when cohabitors have lower average marriage quality, expected utility for a given match quality is higher, and some utility enhancing marriages that would not have taken place without cohabitation will occur in its presence.","[Farmer, Amy; Horowitz, Andrew W.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Farmer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",afarmer@walton.uark.edu; horowitz@walton.uark.edu,,,,,,,40,2,2,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

However, there is not any shared methodology how to assess the sustainability of agricultural production. Local food systems (LFS) are often suggested as a more sustainable alternative to the large-scale mechanized mode of agriculture but there are still many gaps in our knowledge of their social, environmental and economic impacts. This paper introduces the concept of social metabolism as a useful tool for assessing the LFS' sustainability; looking at energy and material stocks and flows of a defined system, it enables one to inspect the functioning of a food system in detail, both on global, national and local scale. Applied to three case studies of Czech and Slovak organic farms, the social metabolism study can provide information on energy and material demands per unit of production, on land-use, labour time and the level of self-sufficiency of the farm system. The data on material and energy flows are suggested to be complemented by a local multiplier, an indicator of local monetary flows related to the farms. Although not providing the final verdict about the farms' sustainability, the concept of social metabolism provides a very useful framework to structure such a debate.","[Frankova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Environm Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Franková, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Environm Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",eva.slunicko@centrum.cz,"Frankova, Eva/AAC-2778-2019","Frankova, Eva/0000-0001-5874-7690",,,,,56,1,1,0,10,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,47,53,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800007,0

The main objective is to confirm that the choice of active entrepreneurship makes sense not only from a macroeconomic point of view, but it is a choice of self-employment, which is long-term and beneficial financially, socially and personally for entrepreneurs. 884 respondents doing business mostly in the form of sole proprietorship, i.e. the self-employed, and differing in the length of time in business, number of employees and specializations participated in the questionnaire survey. This paper analyzes the factors that Czech entrepreneurs prefer either choosing self-employment or employment relationship. The starting hypothesis is that the entrepreneur gets a sufficiently high financial income and this is not affected by the length of time in business, size of business or family tradition. Another initial assumption is that the entrepreneur prefers the option of entrepreneurship for its time flexibility, business persons' independence and self-reliance and these non-financial factors are preferred regardless of the length of time in business, size of business and family tradition.

Pension adjusting ratio is the most important factor, followed by retirement age, pension fund rate of return and enterprise pension payment ratio.

This has led to putting more emphasis on social responsibility of financial institutions, primarily banks, due to their powerful and influential position. Banks have an impact not only on financial and economic system, but on a wider community as well. Their socially responsible practices in particular may have important social implications, what is even more emphasized within bank-centric financial systems, typical of CEE countries. Due to a lack of existing research, the aim of the paper is to assess social responsibility of banks at individual and industry level in a specific CEE context. At bank individual level, focus is put on factors of bank size, ownership status and financial performance, while at the bank industry level the structure of granted loans is included in the analysis. The framework for assessing bank social responsibility is derived and adapted from previous research conducted by Cuesta-Gonzalez, et al. [23] and Scholtens [81]. It is applied to Croatian banking sector, while the level of social responsibility is empirically related to factors at bank individual and industry level. Research findings offer an overview of social responsibility of Croatian banks. The results demonstrate that bank social responsibility is related to factors of bank size and ownership status at the individual level, and to the structure of granted loans at the industry level. However, the nature of the link between bank social and financial performance did not prove significant. Such findings offer a wider lesson of what factors are associated with social performance of financial sector. Additionally, they may serve as a useful reference point for further investigation of socially responsible practices in Croatia and other CEE countries.","[Hernaus, Ana Ivanisevic; Stojanovic, Alen] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Hernaus, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",aivanisevic@efzg.hr; alen.stojanovic@efzg.hr,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Ivanisevic Hernaus, Ana/Q-5895-2018","Ivanisevic Hernaus, Ana/0000-0003-0370-5543; Stojanovic, Alen/0000-0002-8769-3668",,,,,100,8,9,0,30,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This phenomenon of growth and pursuit of socio economic progress has great impact not only on the economy but also on community lifestyle and environment. The Malaysian government adopted the concept of sustainable development as early as mid 1990s to address some of the emerging environmental issues and more specifically recent issues of climate change. Consequently, the concept of new urbanism, compact city and promotion of public transport was highlighted in many urban development plans. Malaysia government announced a commitment of voluntary 40% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emission intensity by 2020 during the Conference of Party (COP 15) meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. In parallel to this commitment of CO2 reduction, the concept of sustainable development in urban planning incorporate a more comprehensive and quantitative approach in the preparation of development plan as well as in exercising the routine development control practice at the local planning authority. Therefore, the scope of work of urban and regional planning should integrate the concept of low carbon city to reduce carbon emission. The paper discusses low carbon emission in urban planning and the policy packages required to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission. It explores the existing framework for carbon reduction in Putrajaya towards providing the platform for development of low carbon emission in real estate development and low carbon society in Malaysia. Finally, the paper believes that the policy packages of the environmental blueprint for the overall master planning of the cities such as Putrajaya, Cyberjaya and Iskandar Malaysia will be effective for real estate development in Malaysia.","[Ho Chin Siong; Abdul-Azaaz, Isiaka Adeyemi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ho, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm, Utm Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",ho@utm.my; azeezabu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3459,3469,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700363,0

Research was based on a survey of 496 students of Economic Faculty of the University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice during four semestres. Statistical methods were used for its evaluation. Financial literacy can be divided into basic financial literacy and special, advanced financial literacy. Basic financial literacy is a set of knowledge and skills, which should be useable by all people, as it allows ordinary and necessary guidance in ensuring basic financial liabilities and assets of each individual within the nation. Advanced financial literacy is a very broad concept. This includes the potential abilities of different age and professional groups at different levels of action, and use of financial services. These include the need to develop skills, responsibility and ethics of those who professionally manage finances of others, or provide them with financial services too. Currently, due to the growing sophistication of trade unions and deregulation of financial markets, many experts have narrowly specialised. Universities and colleges of economics and finance have a great creative potential, as well as methodological, organisational, professional and scientific experience, to be in the process of increasing irreplaceable financial literacy.","[Kantnerova, Libena] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Kantnerová, L (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finances, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",kantner@ef.jcu.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,181,184,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800030,0

Algeria is still not managed to diversify its economy and establish a competitive industrialization at the international level; it has the difficulty in adopting an economy less dependent on hydrocarbons. Algerian businesses continue to face obstacles and constraints, penalizing their performance and prevent from the emergence of a dense and competitive industrial fabric.

Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners are frequently not only timber producers, but also providers of forest amenities, from which they derive a private utility as well as positive externalities for the rest of the society. This is often addressed as a limit to wood exploitation, since generally there is a trade-off between timber production and amenities. However, the forest property fragmentation and the passive management of some private forest owners are also considered as restraining the wood supply. We propose an econometric analysis of the harvesting decision with particular attention to the role of NIPF landowners' management objectives. We defined four categories of management objectives: production-oriented, production 82 amenities, amenities-oriented, and no objectives, using a sample of 432 French NIPF landowners. The aim was to identify the relevant factors influencing the harvest decision, and, in particular, the role of amenities-oriented objectives and no-objectives. Results showed that a change in the management objective from production-oriented to amenities-oriented significantly reduced the probability of harvesting. The lack of management objectives as well as absenteeism, however, exhibited an even higher negative effect. Consistently with a utility maximisation framework, both economic variables (timber price and income) and landowners' socio-demographic characteristics were significant predictors of the harvesting decision. From a policy viewpoint, our results suggest to address incentives schemes on passive forest owners in order to increase wood production. (C) 2015 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umea, Sweden.

It assesses the direction and intensity of relationships between macroeconomic indicators and stock market index and explains possible causes of these conditions. Analysis of the relationship is carried out in different countries with different levels of economic development, both in Europe and overseas. Emphasis was put on the selection of those countries, which were significantly affected by the economic recession. The indicators that affect value of stock market index were selected based on economic theory. Among them belong: gross domestic product, inflation, interest rate, export, and import and unemployment rate. After determining the degree of dependence between macroeconomic indicators and value of stock market index, countries were grouped together in clusters. Clustering was therefore not conducted on the basis of the values of macroeconomic indicators of a country, but on the basis of these indicators having a similar effect on the value of the stock market index. Before cluster analysis, input matrix of variables was subjected to factor analysis to reduce the original number of variables.","[Plachy, Rudolf; Rasovec, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Plachy, R (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",plachyr@pef.czu.cz; rasovec@pef.czu.cz,"Plachý, Rudolf/HDO-7031-2022; Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023",,,,,,24,1,1,2,32,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The main conclusions were the following ones: (i) The Z Scores estimated using Altman's model were higher than the ones estimated using Conan & Holder's model, but any model is useful to predict the future situation of a company; (ii) The prediction of bankruptcy risk is very important in agriculture, like in other economic branches too, as managers need time to analyze the financial situation and take forward corresponding measures across the year to avoid failure and improve the activity, sometime more depending on forecasting than paste financial numbers. (iii) In the area of agriculture, the financial statements of the companies, as a rule, are weak and many Romanian holdings have a high degree of bankruptcy risk.","[Popescu, Agatha] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Popescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania.",agatha_popescu@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Agatha/KBB-4359-2024","Popescu, Agatha/0000-0003-2330-7120",,,,,24,12,12,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2196,2204,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700220,0

As expected, some economists were quick to adopt it unhesitatingly, but others have labelled it as absurd, superficial, simple, anachronistic and even counterproductive. In fact, there are two diverging processes opposed to each other, both worth mentioning. First globalization with its multiple meanings and definitions, and the second - deglobalization which is just beginning to find a place within the confines of concepts used in international economics literature. The issue is not to treat them only as antonyms, but rather to demonstrate the causal relation between them. We consider trying to measure deglobalization as an important step in determining the true meaning of such a phenomenon, or if it is real. Also, would be interesting to find out if deglobalization is really a long lasting trend, or just a short term turn in the evolution of the world economy. Using the globalization index and its components as a tool in this direction could be one of the potential solutions in defining the meaning of the new and complex changes which tends to shape the international economic relations and, after all, the international business environment. Although it is admitted not being a perfect tool, it could be a starting point in studying such a vast change. Therefore, the motivation of this article is to contribute to theoretical debates that bear on this new term, given that, as in the case of globalization itself, economists have not yet reached a consensus on the definition.","[Postelnicu, Catalin] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Econ, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Dinu, Vasile] Bucharest Univ Econ, Fac Business & Tourism, Dept Business Consumer Sci & Qual Management, Bucharest, Romania; [Dabija, Dan-Cristian] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Mkt, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Postelnicu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Econ, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",catalin.postelnicu@econ.ubbcluj.ro; dinu_cbz@yahoo.com; cristian.dabija@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dabija, Dan-Cristian/I-8101-2012; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017; Postelnicu, Catalin/F-6352-2016","Dabija, Dan-Cristian/0000-0002-8265-175X; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548; Postelnicu, Catalin/0000-0001-7892-9993",,,,,26,27,28,7,97,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The analysis shows that academic discussion lacks systematized findings about the business and management success factors relevant to contemporary organisations. Thus the author defines the success factors that are common to the organizations from an intercultural and intercontinental perspective, and distinguish the term management-in-organization, which is directed to the quality of internal organizational processes, and the term management-of-organization, which is linked to the business general achievements. It is assumed that the practice of managing-in-organization has the biggest influence on the completion of an organization's goals and implementation of its functions, whereas balanced, sufficient and systematic attention for management-in-organization and management-of-organization is the most important factor for organization's success and sustainability in a long-term perspective. The proposed model of the influence of organization management success factors on organization's sustainability clarifies the interrelation between concepts.","[Raisiene, Agota Giedre] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Raisiene, AG (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ateities Str 20, Vilnius, Lithuania.",agotagiedre@gmail.com,"Raišienė, Agota Giedrė/KDM-9085-2024",,,,,,99,3,3,0,19,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This is a consequence of the application of the central system of settlement, which was based on Christaller's theory of central places. In connection with the changes after 1989, there was disintegration of such integrated communities and the situation has stabilized. Number of small villages were renewed but cities with hundred thousand inhabitants (population of these cities oscillates around hundred thousand inhabitants) did not experience such process. Due to this fact the big cities in the Czech Republic are typical for their larger size because they also administrate smaller residential units of rural character, often many kilometers from the city centers. These administrative parts of the cities are managed in different ways. In connection with the manifestations of suburbanization during the past twenty years, the transformation of the social structure of the inhabitants in these suburbs and changes in rules of municipal budgetary allocation of taxes (hereinafter BAT) there is the question of sustainability and stability of thus defined borders of municipalities. The paper presents opinions on the development of financing system and attempts to analyze the motives of the peripheral parts of selected cities with hundred thousand inhabitants to remain part or separate from these cities. In connection with changes in the BAT made on 1st January 2013, the financial motive can have an important role. The main aim of the paper will be a comparison of the current financial income of these municipalities with previous periods in relation to changes in the BAT and assess the impact of these changes on the potential disintegration processes and municipal politics. Process of urban disintegration and creation of a new municipality is not easy and is provided for in the legal system of the Czech Republic. The paper also gives an overview of this legislation.

Mostly, regional development for those with small territory and decreasing number of small population is attributable to financial support in a form of income transfers rather than for well-based choice in favour to certain type of policy-making. Although, emergence to make the choice finds evidence in spontaneous and fast movement of resources towards higher developed territories, thus contributing to continuous decreasing of poor municipalities. The paper contributes to the choice making. Authors present preliminary research results for testing two main policy types, as place- and people-based, in context of regional development process and result by using the example of lagging region in Latvia with prevalence of predominantly rural municipalities. The main challenge for research relates to mismatches between characteristics of small municipalities and main aims set for regional development. Application of regression's log-log models allows authors to conclude that regional development at small municipalities' level is diversified, but vulnerable with dominance of elements of place-based approach. Municipalities with low level of development process (development rates) and high level of development result (development level) mostly contributed there. This, in turn, emphasizes unfavourable dominance of short-term stimuli in regional development at small municipalities' level. Relatively high activity of regional resources, although, positively influences regional development. Additionally, activities of municipalities provide effect and this is positive. Combination of place- and people-based approaches would be necessary for further activities for stimulating regional development at small municipalities' level.","[Sipilova, Viktorija; Ostrovska, Inta] Daugavpils Univ, Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Daugavpils, Latvia; [Aleksejeva, Ludmila] Daugavpils Univ, Dept Econ & Sociol, Daugavpils, Latvia",University of Daugavpils; University of Daugavpils,"Sipilova, V (通讯作者)，Daugavpils Univ, Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Daugavpils, Latvia.",sipilova.viktorija@inbox.lv; ludmila.aleksejeva@du.lv; inta.ostrovska@du.lv,"Aleksejeva, Ludmila/AAE-6562-2020; Sipilova, Viktorija/A-2828-2019","Aleksejeva, Ludmila/0000-0002-1965-0818; Sipilova, Viktorija/0000-0002-3642-3799",,,,,20,1,1,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,189,201,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700020,0

Recent analyses have shown that the SMEs' exports capabilities are highly dependent on co-opetition, while others suggest that the challenges of international supply chain constitute a major driver to this combination. This analysis contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on both of these issues. A multivariate regression analysis is developed, measuring variables of SMEs' co-opetition and international activity, and taking as reference a set of 136 Andalusian food exporters. The results confirm the positive effect of strategies of cooperation with competitors (regarding logistics, promotion, quality and R&D) on international marketing activity. This positive effect is enhanced when large retailers are the main buyers, i.e. in hierarchical relationships. Furthermore, exporting activity is shown to promote co-opetition among suppliers. These findings highlight the importance of such strategies as regards both export capabilities of the food firms in this region and their expansion into new foreign markets. The empirical approach and certain implications drawn from the results can be extended to other analyses on SMEs in international contexts.","[Galdeano-Gomez, Emilio; Aznar-Sanchez, Jose A.] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ Aplicada, La Canada de San Urbano S-N, Almeria 04700, Spain; [Perez-Mesa, Juan C.] Univ Almeria, Dept Direcc & Gest Empresas, La Canada de San Urbano S-N, Almeria 04700, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"Galdeano-Gómez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Dept Econ Aplicada, La Canada de San Urbano S-N, Almeria 04700, Spain.",galdeano@ual.es; juancarl@ual.es; jaznar@ual.es,"Sánchez, José Ángel Aznar/AAI-6038-2021; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/K-5440-2014","Sánchez, José Ángel Aznar/0000-0001-5443-1269; Mesa, Juan Carlos Perez/0000-0003-2382-3475","Spanish MCINN; FEDER [ECO2014-52268, SEJ-5827]; Junta de Andalucia",Spanish MCINN(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"This research was partially funded by Spanish MCINN and FEDER aid [Project ECO2014-52268]; and from Junta de Andalucia and FEDER aid [project SEJ-5827, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia].",,43,21,22,1,58,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

There is evidence that postentry multimarket contact raises outputs in those markets that did not experience entry, behavior we generally refer to as a conduit effect.","[Mason, Charles F.; Phillips, Owen R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mason, Charles F.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Wyoming; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Mason, CF (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu; OwenPhil@uwyo.edu,"phillips, owen/J-3651-2017; Mason, Charles/H-9162-2019","Mason, Charles/0000-0002-9846-0173",Paul Lowham Research Fund; University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources,Paul Lowham Research Fund; University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources,"Support from the Paul Lowham Research Fund and the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources is gratefully acknowledged.

Data were collected through in-depth interviews with managers at the bus operators as well as the authority organizations. This paper contributes by identifying nine categories that can be the dominating factors behind the increasing costs of public bus services in Sweden. The identified categories of cost drivers are; of traffic appearance (peak times), greening of buses, age requirements, the contract period, the accessibility customization, special requirements on buses, collective agreements (working time regulation), tendering and contracting process, and finally, counterproductive political governance. It can be concluded that many of the cost drivers originate from the circumstances of the process of public procurement, such as different demands for different regions in Sweden as well as the trade-off between the bus operators' wishes for higher flexibility in the contracts and the traffic authorities' fear of more risks and thereby higher bids in the end.

It explores these issues within the context of the regulatory structures which govern performance. The services explored have contrasting regulatory structures ranging from public operations to private sector operation using a range of forms of performance based contracting and competitive tendering. The study identifies that, in general, operations of all systems have grown as has ridership however significant reductions in service effectiveness (ridership per vkm) have occurred in US contexts where public sector operations have dominated. The implication is increases in public subsidies per trip. In Australia, Sydney and Melbourne Light Rail (private competitively tendered and performance based contracts) have consistently maintained and improved service effectiveness while in Adelaide, a public sector operation, service effectiveness has declined. The paper explores the policy implications of these findings and also considers more recent developments in packaging of private sector contracts for building new Light Rail systems in the Gold Coast and Sydney.

In a world where there are increasing numbers of jurisdictions moving to competitive tendering, there is an increased incidence of a change in operator when the term of the contract comes to an end. In many jurisdictions, the anecdotal evidence on the disruption caused by this change in operator is growing. We investigate this issue using a stated choice experiment in which members of evaluation committees are presented with a series of alternative operator bids that include, ex ante, a measure of the transition costs identified as a proportion of the lowest offer for the contract, and two proxy descriptors of operator reputation. A mixed logit choice model is estimated to identify the role that transition costs play in influencing the preferences of evaluation committee members, providing evidence for the first time on the extent to which the often unreported role of such transition costs, perceived or real, appear to play in the minds of competitive tender evaluation.

This also applies to the globalizing pork industry which is the focus of this paper. On the basis of a case study on the Oldenburger Munsterland, Northwest Germany, the impact of geographic origin effects on multiscalar networks of pork production is examined from the perspective of three conceptual frameworks (global production networks, commodity cultures, and imaginative geographies). The empirical findings based on expert interviews show that key actors of the pork industry (e.g. slaughterers, manufacturers, retailers) adopt specific strategies that are related to changing (and partly delusive) meanings of provenance and regionality. In this respect, several export-oriented firms emphasize a guaranteed German origin primarily in order to develop markets (particularly in East Asian countries). Regional and small-scale strategies, however, are obviously not of such a great importance as media-dominated discourses on geographic origins of foods would have us believe.","[Klein, Oliver; Tamasy, Christine] Univ Vechta, Inst Strukturforsch & Planung Agrarischen Intens, Univ Str 5, D-49377 Vechta, Germany",,"Klein, O (通讯作者)，Univ Vechta, Inst Strukturforsch & Planung Agrarischen Intens, Univ Str 5, D-49377 Vechta, Germany.",oliver.klein@uni-vechta.de,,,,,,,62,4,4,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Although numerous measures are available in principle, in practice, however, financial problems hinder the implementation of these measures. This study addresses an important issue in China how to finance a socially inclusive public transport system given the incomplete nature of fiscal reforms at local government level. Central government grants are required to achieve a more equitable distribution of public transport resources. To calculate the demand for central government grants, an approach was developed to quantify transport social needs (TSNs). A primary component regression model was established to identify the factors that affect the SDGs using public transport. Further, a need-based method is proposed for the allocation of central government grants. The allocation procedure was designed with the categorization of cities to avoid distorted incentives, and a two-step formula was used to address the funding allocation equity problems. The data obtained from 252 municipal cities in China in 2010 show that the TSNs were 37.63 billion trip-kilometers. The corresponding central government grant was (sic)18.82 billion. The results of the proposed allocation show that more funding was provided to small and low-density cities had unfavorable situations due to local public transport investment. This investigation would help in a more equitable distribution of public transport funding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Housing characteristics can facilitate or hinder business start-ups, and the mechanisms depend on whether the business start-up takes place in people's homes or not. Hitherto, economic geography has largely viewed housing as a system that accommodates and filters the workforce across space and neglected that housing is an economic resource to individuals. Using longitudinal microdata for the United Kingdom and a sample that accounts for the endogeneity of housing to employment/entrepreneurship, the study finds that home-based self-employment is facilitated by housing wealth, outright ownership, detached houses, and large dwellings and is undermined by living in flats. Private rented accommodation enables entries into self-employment that are not based in people's homes. Housing thus provides financial security and space, on the one hand, and shapes flexibility needed for entrepreneurship, on the other hand. Areas for future research arising from this study relate to the role of housing over the individual entrepreneur's life course and area effects on entrepreneurship and self-employment that relate to the spatial variation of housing supply.","[Reuschke, Darja] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Reuschke, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",dr35@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Reuschke, Darja/0000-0001-6961-1801",ERC Starting Grant WORKANDHOME [ERC-2014-STG 639403],ERC Starting Grant WORKANDHOME(European Research Council (ERC)),This study was funded by the ERC Starting Grant WORKANDHOME (ERC-2014-STG 639403).,,72,23,25,2,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The main results confirm that terrorism incidents, economic and institutional variables are found to depress FDI of analysed EU and EEA countries. It can be concluded that terrorism and institutional stability are most influential on FDI inflows of the observed EU and EEA countries. The results indicate that terrorist activities reduce security and confidence of investors in countries exposed to terrorist activities, reducing the inflow of foreign direct investment.

The full sample results indicate a small increase in economic growth following a fairly substantial aid shock. The size of the effect puts the result somewhere between the arguments of aid optimists and those of aid pessimists.

One goal is to verify how interdependent port traffic and regional characteristics are, in a context of increasingly flexible commodity and value chains. Despite the aggregated dimension of available data and the heterogeneity of local situations, the main results confirm the affinity between the primary sector and raw materials traffic, and between the tertiary sector and general cargo traffic, whereas the industrial sector offers mixed evidence. This allows us to address fundamental questions raised by both economic geography and regional science about transport and local development.

The task involves predicting the outputs from three solar farms at an hourly resolution using data from the ECMWF numerical weather prediction model. The annual cycle of solar radiation and power is modelled using a low-pass filter built using a Fourier transformation. The diurnal cycle is handled by fitting separate models for each hour of the day with the positive solar radiation. A model for simulating PV power production, taking the effect of temperature into account, is also included. The forecasting methods were gradient boosting for the deterministic forecasting of solar power and k-nearest neighbors regression for estimating prediction intervals in order to provide probabilistic forecasts. A cross-validation strategy, splitting the data into monthly folds, was employed for comparing the performances of alternative methods and in an attempt to avoid overfitting issues.

We model the shares of the population who are in certain household positions (living alone, living with a partner, etc.). These household positions have very pronounced age patterns. The age profiles change slowly over time, due to changes in the home leaving behaviour of young adults, differences in survival rates of men and women, etc. When forecasting household positions to 2040, we want to preserve the characteristics of the age profiles. We test the Lee-Carter model and the Brass relational method using household data for the Netherlands for the period 1996-2010. Annual shares of the population by household position, age, and sex are modeled as random walks with adrift (RWD). While the Brass model has its limitations, it performs better than the Lee-Carter model in our application. The predicted age patterns based on the Brass model look more reasonable, because the Brass model is a two-parameter model, while the Lee-Carter model contains only one parameter. Also, the model parameters and standard errors of the Brass model are easier to estimate than those of the Lee-Carter model. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters.

However, little work exists measuring male fertility behavior. We use survey data from several waves of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in eight Sub-Saharan African countries. We document several interesting differences in fertility outcomes of men and women. First, comparing completed fertility by birth cohorts, we find that on average men have more children than women in seven out of eight countries we consider. The gaps are large - reaching up to 4.6 children in Burkina Faso. Positive gaps are possible when populations are growing and men father children with younger women. Such a situation often coincides with polygyny. Indeed, we find that the fertility gap is positively related to the degree of polygyny. Second, we find a lower variance in completed fertility rates for women than for men, especially in high polygyny countries. Third, we find that differences in the desire to have children can largely be explained by differences in realized fertility. Finally, we find that for men, the demographic transition started earlier and was steeper than for women. These novel facts are useful when building theories of fertility behavior.","[Field, Erica] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Molitor, Vera; Tertilt, Michele] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Schoonbroodt, Alice] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",Duke University; University of Mannheim; University of Iowa,"Schoonbroodt, A (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, W210 Pappajohn Business Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA.",alice-schoonbroodt@uiowa.edu,,"Tertilt, Michele/0000-0003-0605-4141",ERC [313719]; European Research Council (ERC) [313719] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would like to thank Katarina Kuske, Pascal Schmidt, and Inken Toewe for excellent research assistance.

The determinants of cartel formation and cartel breakup are estimated, including analysis of the impact of the discount rate, business cycles, and antitrust policy. We find that cartels are more likely to break up during periods of high real interest rates, presumably because higher interest rates are associated with greater impatience. The adoption of a stronger amnesty policy has no significant impact on cartel breakup over this period, although the results suggest some association with lower cartel formation rates.","[Levenstein, Margaret C.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Suslow, Valerie Y.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Sch Business, 100 Int Dr, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Johns Hopkins University,"Levenstein, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, 701 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",MaggieL@umich.edu,,,,,,,44,13,14,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

That is, a bureaucrat who has accepted a bribe from a firm in exchange for a license may still choose not to grant the firm that license (hold-up). This paper develops a model to study the role that intermediaries play in preventing hold-up. There are two types of firms, good firms that are legally entitled to receive a license, and harmful firms that are not. Without intermediaries only good firms enter the market, and harmful firms do not enter because of hold-up. Intermediaries are legally permitted to help firms reduce their navigation costs of obtaining licenses. Thus, intermediaries increase entry of good firms. However, by utilizing the legal aspects of their transaction with good firms as leverage against the bureaucrat, intermediaries can prevent hold-up among harmful firms. Thus, intermediaries increase participation by both good and harmful firms and their welfare costs are ambiguous. Data obtained from occurrences of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are broadly consistent with our model.","[Mishra, Ajit] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, North East Somerset BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Samuel, Andrew] Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",University of Bath; Loyola University Maryland,"Samuel, A (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",asamuel@loyola.edu,,"Mishra, Ajit/0000-0002-2003-3796",Loyola University Maryland,Loyola University Maryland,"We are extremely grateful to Chris Klimmek, J.D., for his work on collecting and analyzing the U.S. Department of Justice cases used in Sect. 4.

In doing so, it proposed a middle way between capitalism and socialism and between the Democratic and Republican parties. In the 1920s, the Reverend Edwin V. O'Hara founded the NCRLC mainly to bolster the demographically weak rural Church. In the 1930s, the NCRLC turned to economic concerns in response to the Great Depression. It supported many New Deal programs that helped farmers as well as cooperatives and a back-to-the-land movement. The Conference consistently supported the family farm as the basic institution of a morally and economically sound rural society. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Conference entered the realm of international affairs under Monsignor Luigi G. Ligutti and addressed problems of world hunger, land reform, and underdeveloped countries. Under Monsignor Edward W. O'Rourke, who became director in 1960, the NCRLC joined in the movement for social justice and campaigned for the rights of the rural poor and migrant farm workers. Starting around 1970, the Conference became increasingly interested in environmental and energy issues. The NCRLC is in harmony with the 21(st)-century pope, Francis, on rural and ecological issues.","[Bovee, David S.] Ft Hays State Univ, Hays, KS 67601 USA",,"Bovee, DS (通讯作者)，Ft Hays State Univ, Hays, KS 67601 USA.",,,,,,,,256,3,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This research is timely given the switch in purchases from petrol cars to diesel cars arising out of changes in how vehicle registration tax and motor tax rates are calculated. The study finds that households living in urban areas, households that spend money on public transport and households that do not possess a car will spend less on both petrol and diesel. In contrast, households in possession of higher number of cars, households with more occupants working and households with higher levels of household spending will spend more on petrol and diesel. The econometric methodology employed takes into account the fact that the dependent variable contains zero expenditures. Such an approach has never previously been applied to analyse Irish household transport use and provides interesting insights. In particular the effect that the explanatory variables have on participation in the market is quite different for petrol and diesel. For example, the model predicts a much larger increase in the probability that households will spend in the diesel market relative to the petrol market as income increases. The results have implications for the design of tax policy in the transport sector as the Irish economy recovers and average household income increases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, it compares the per se legal and illegal judicial standards to the rule of reason judicial standard in terms of information costs and general social welfare. Second, it seeks to derive the optimal judicial standard that minimizes the problems of under- and over-deterrence. These two issues are closely related because the benefit of additional information can only be measured by its deterrent effects. In this respect, this work synthesizes economic models from decision theory and the public enforcement of law. Lastly, in addition to discussing the optimal information level, we derive the optimal permissiveness of the judicial standard, the optimal burden of proof, and the optimal punishment level. We also analyze how these policy variables are interrelated .","[Kwak, Juwon] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Kwak, J (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea.",juwonkwak@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

In her view, there is no tragedy associated with this third option. The present article takes strong issue with her. Our claim is that she has not properly distinguished between a commons and partnership arrangements. In the former case, outsiders cannot be excluded from entry; in the latter, they can. The reason for this confusion between the commons and private property in Ostrom's work is that she believes private property is possible only if government protects and enforces it. We show by using various historical examples that this assumption is wrong, and hence the central tenet of Ostrom's model of the commons fails.","[Block, Walter] Loyola Univ New Orleans, Joseph A Butt SJ Coll Business, Econ, New Orleans, LA USA; [Jankovic, Ivan] Simon Fraser Univ, Polit Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Loyola University New Orleans; Simon Fraser University,"Block, W (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ New Orleans, Joseph A Butt SJ Coll Business, Econ, New Orleans, LA USA.",,,,,,,,81,13,14,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Post-and-hold laws require alcohol wholesalers to provide a list of prices to the state, which can be reviewed by retailers, competitors and the public. These laws were generally enacted at the end of prohibition with the intention of limiting alcohol consumption by raising prices. The laws may also have the unintended consequence of protecting small retailers. Recently, several large retailers have argued in court that these laws are counter to the Sherman Act, which limits anti-competitive behavior. This paper follows the recent paper by Cooper and Wright (2012) and adds new data and new empirical specifications. The estimation results provide no persuasive evidence of an effect of post-and-hold laws on the consumption of either total ethanol, wine, or spirits. There is evidence of a small effect of beer post-and-hold laws on beer consumption. One possible explanation of this generally null effect is that the wholesale markets for alcohol are so highly regulated that post-and-hold laws have no marginal effect. The empirical results presented in this paper do support alcohol excise taxes as effective means of reducing alcohol consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These two classes of models yield mutually exclusive predictions, but empirical tests of these predictions have been mixed. We draw from historical evidence that suggests a bifurcated marriage market, in which some households use dowries as a bequest and others use dowries as a price. The competing theories of dowry allow us to structure an exogenous switching regression that places households in the price or bequest regime. The empirical strategy allows for multiple checks on the validity of regime assignment. Using retrospective marriage data from rural Bangladesh, we find evidence of heterogeneity in dowry motives; that bequest dowries have declined in prevalence and amount over time; and that bequest households are better off compared to price households on a variety of welfare measures.","[Arunachalam, Raj] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Arunachalam, Raj] Univ Michigan, Ctr Populat Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Logan, TD (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 410 Arps Hall,1945 North High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",arunacha@umich.edu; logan.155@osu.edu,,,,,,,67,16,20,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Fixed-effects, system generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variable estimations are used to establish a causal relationship between emigration and corruption. The empirical results indicate that as corruption increases, the emigration rate of high-skilled migrants also increases. The emigration rate of individuals with low and medium levels of educational attainment, however, increases at low levels of corruption and then decreases beyond a threshold of 3.4-4.0, where corruption is measured on a scale of 0 (not corrupt) to 10 (totally corrupt). Splitting the sample by income inequality suggests that increased inequality reduces the ability for medium- and low-skilled migrants to emigrate.

This chapter empirically analyzes the CSR effects on company financial performance in developing countries, especially Romania. As empirical method we employed univariate analysis to investigate whether the company financial performance of companies which implement CSR (considered experiment group) is higher than non-CSR companies (considered control group). T-test is used to find out if there is any statistically difference in mean company financial performance between ROA, ROE, ROS, PBV, PER, and EPS of experiment group and control group. The sample used included 68 companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) for the 2011 fiscal year.

Thus, Due to big data proliferation and the various information resources, our personal data will be shared and published by all people; that is why our privacy will be increasingly accessed, and thus threatened by hackers. Through this paper, we want to dig into the big data context while implementing a methodological approach to protect the sensitive data in the big data storage.

The share of tourism in gross domestic product is 17.2% which is significantly higher than in competitive tourist countries where tourism has less than 10% share in the gross domestic product. Croatian tourism has significantly raised its results starting in 2000 year. However, in 2008 year the world economy was affected by the economic crisis. The situation, in the which companies in all industries found themselves, demanded the swift reaction with an aim of diminishing the negative effects of the crisis. The specificity of the Croatian tourism is that, in a time of crisis, it showed a high resistance. Mentioned is confirmed by the growth rates which were higher than those in the countries in the competitive environment on the Mediterranean. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to investigate the operations of large hotel companies in Croatia during the economic crisis through the movement of liquidity and solvency ratios. Liquidity is the ability of companies to settle its obligations in the short term. Management or creditors such as banks and suppliers are primarily interested in liquidity of the companies. Effective liquidity management involves planning and controlling the current assets and current liabilities in such way that eliminates the risk of inability to meet short-term liabilities on the one hand, and avoids over-investment on the other side. Solvency of the companies, however, indicates the ability of a companies to settle its obligations in the long term. Solvency is analyzed through financial, capital structure of liabilities and items of assets. For the purpose of this paper a survey was conducted over five hotel companies in Croatia which are listed on the Zagreb Stock Exchange through analysis of their financial statements in the period between 2010 and 2014 year.","[Lozic, Josko] Univ Appl Sci Zagreb, TVZ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Miljak, Toni] Univ Coll Management & Design ASPIRA, Split, Croatia; [Lozic, Ines] Dignus Savjetovanje Doo, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Lozic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Zagreb, TVZ, Zagreb, Croatia.",jlozic@tvz.hr; toni.miljak@aspira.hr; ineslozic1@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,216,223,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700024,0

Some of these factors are: longevity of the relationship, supply base reduction, supplier involvement, information sharing, cross-functional teams, trust and commitment. In addition, this paper identifies several other factors that influence the SC performance, such as: environmental uncertainty, top-management support, customer focus, information technology, strategic purchasing, logistic integration and supply network structure.

Regions have particular needs in terms of human capital accumulation that generate emerging demands for skills and qualifications which are met in ways suited to their requirements. In the research, the authors consider the output of continuing vocational training courses as best reflecting the genuine demand at regional level for skills and qualifications adapted to local economy conditions. Using panel data estimations, the authors argue that the degree of trade openness in each Romanian county significantly influenced the number of continuing vocational training graduates.

The objective of this paper is to identify antecedents of OCBE among university academics in South Asian developing country context. In the light of Social Exchange Theory (SET), researchers conceptualized that Perceived Organizational Support (POS) and Affective Commitment (AC) in a chain of relationship determine OCBE. Researchers employed an online questionnaire among university academics in Pakistan and Sri Lanka and received 136 effective responses. The results indicates a direct impact of POS on OCBE and a mediation effect of AC between the relationship of POS and OCBE. Investigation of the POS, AC and OCBE chain of relationship in South Asian context by the application of theoretical rigor of SET makes this study unique in corporate greening and OB literature. Further, this study sheds new lights to practitioners in order to develop appropriate conditions in encouraging OCBEs at work.","[Priyankara, H. P.

The results of our empirical scientific study provide interesting and valuable findings that the overall performance of industrial enterprises in Slovakia is to be looked at comprehensively strategically and not just in financial terms. Why are some industrial enterprises more efficient than others? What methods and procedures are applied by more efficient companies? The answers to these questions can be found in our paper. We recommend industry enterprises to apply selected methods and models of strategic business performance management.

Taking the UK's relative fiscal and monetary policy autonomy as a starting point, the paper unpacks and analyses how the United Kingdom has charted a successful course between the imperatives of social stability and market credibility. At the heart of this 'success' is a fundamentally anticipatory governing logic. Fiscal consolidation was justified and enacted as a pre-emptive and preventative intervention in order to anticipate an indebted and thus disciplined future. Contrary to conventional wisdom, then, UK austerity is not necessarily geared only towards swingeing spending cuts, because the direction of travel towards an imagined debt- and deficit-free future is just as important as reaching the destination itself under the logic of anticipatory fiscal consolidation.","[Stanley, Liam] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Stanley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",l.m.stanley@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,14,15,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Growing external demands require improvement of management processes. In this context, one of the most current issues is the effectiveness of strategic management.

The problem of strategic management optimisation is in line with the demands of current theoretical concepts, such as the New Public Management (NPM) and Good Governance. However, it primarily has a practical significance. Therefore, specific conditions of the country should be concerned.

The aim of this research is to create such models which can be used for creating automatic trading strategies that will beat the market. Reliability of these models is being checked in three highly liquid shares from Prague Stock O2, CEZ and KB in seven years long period in years 2006-2012. We used Markov chain analysis for modelling. In our models a state space is defined on the basis of cumulative daily changes of share price and a state space with eight states is used. The state space is defined parametrically as a multiple of standard deviation of daily yields for each share. There were 14 parameters calculated in total and for each parameter nine trading strategies for all shares were applied. It means that 378 trading strategies were calculated. We succeeded in finding a set of compact state space models and in applying a compact group of trading strategies on these models which always beat the market when invested in portfolio. The average annual market yield was 3.6%. The average yield of our portfolios osculates between 4.7% and 14.8%. Strategies overcame the market also even after including transaction costs. After including transaction costs in amount of 0.1% from the trade volume a decrease of average annual yields would occur in the range from 0.45 to 2.1 percentage points. We reached the best results in the sideway trend and in shares with less changing volatility. Conclusions of this research are in contradiction to the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Results indicate that Czech stock market is not effective in any of its form.","[Svoboda, Milan] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Svoboda, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic.",svobodm@kem.zcu.cz,"Svoboda, Milan/AAU-4541-2020",,"motivation system of University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, part POSTDOC; Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen [SGS-2015-026]","motivation system of University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, part POSTDOC; Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen","The article was supported by the motivation system of University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, part POSTDOC and is elaborated as one of the results of the research project The Research of Factors Affecting Share Price Movement, Prediction of Share Price Movement and Design of Algorithms for Self-acting Trading SGS-2015-026 of the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen.",,16,9,9,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Although including a balanced budget principle and a debt brake, together with fiscal discipline rules and a permanent assessment of fiscal-budgetary strategies, measures and regulations by an independent Fiscal Council, and thus complying with the principles agreed in this respect at the European level, the national fiscal-budgetary mechanism has a major weakness, derived from the fact that all such rules are included in ordinary laws, situated on the same level of the hierarchy of norms, and thus easily amendable upon approval or rectification of annual budgets. This leaves place for a future debate on the role of the balanced budget rule during the envisaged constitutional reform.","[Tanasescu, Simina Elena; Gherghina, Simona] Univ Bucharest, Fac Law, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Tanasescu, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Fac Law, Bucharest, Romania.",simina-elena.tanasescu@drept.unibuc.ro,"Gherghina, Simona/IAN-4168-2023",,CNCS-UEFISCDI (Romania); ANR (Programme Blanc - France),"CNCS-UEFISCDI (Romania)(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); ANR (Programme Blanc - France)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This study was presented as a national report to the 19th Congress of the International Academy of Comparative Law - Vienna 2014 and was prepared as part of the research conducted under the project FCBB - From Fiscal Compact to Constitution : Shaping a Legal Form for the Balanced Budget Rule PN-II-ID-RO-FR-JRP-2012-0137, co-financed by CNCS-UEFISCDI (Romania) and ANR (Programme Blanc 2013 - France).",,11,0,0,2,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2214-6881,,978-3-319-41205-4; 978-3-319-41203-0,IUS COMP,,,2016,20,,,,,,241,265,,10.1007/978-3-319-41205-4_9,0.0,,,25,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BI1RQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406787000009,0

The research ends up defining the regions having the most and least favorable conditions in terms of human capital. A fact has also been revealed that if the quality of housing facilities is considered, the final values of an indicator worsen, on average, by 10-12 per cent. Based on the values of the assessed conditions for human capital development for the year 2013, the territorial units have been typologically grouped and five types of regions have been identified. Dynamic analysis of estimations has shown their growth in most regions in the period of 2009-2012 and a slight decline in 2013.

Stated preference (SP) scenarios specifically designed for this survey were used to elicit preferences for bicycle facilities and infrastructure, such as bike-lanes and bicycle parking places, and also for the availability of safety courses for school goers. The estimated mode choice model, which explicitly considers taste heterogeneity and panel effects, was tested with data collected in different types of cities (urban, rural and insular) of two different countries Greece and Cyprus, enabling comparisons in adolescents' travel behaviour across different geographical areas. The sample consisted of 9554 adolescent who yielded 20,432 SP responses for model estimation. Our results show that the prevalent factors affecting bicycle choice differ across different types of cities. Bad weather conditions affect the most the choice of bicycle in urban areas, while the most significant variable for rural areas is the percentage of cycleway coverage in the route between home and school. The availability of bicycle parking spaces at the schoolyard and the availability of school courses regarding how to walk and cycle with safety, also increased the bicycle utility in all five areas considered. Finally, three policy scenarios were tested to investigate modal split under various cycling policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, the carriers have implemented a variety of fees on a range of optional services. Among these, checked baggage fees now represent a significant source of airline revenues. This paper assesses the impact of baggage fees on passenger demand and airline fares. We study a sample of US domestic routes over the period 2007-2010 where passengers have a choice between carriers that charge fees for checked baggage and Southwest Airlines, which allows passengers one or two free checked bags. A system of simultaneous equations is estimated. Our results show that, on an average route, a $1 increase in baggage fee leads to a loss of 0.7 passengers and is associated with a $0.11 reduction in fare levels. Interestingly, an equivalent increase of $1 in fares results in a much greater decline in passengers (eight times greater). Therefore, our results support the idea that substituting additional baggage fees for higher fares may be a beneficial strategy for carriers in terms of generating revenues and maintaining market share.

The time period under review covers episodes of significant expansion and contraction in the Irish economy and thus this study is valuable for understanding the underlying behavioural changes that have occurred. Two multinomial logit models are estimated, one a static version which uses data from the most recent Irish Household Budget Survey (HBS) and the second a pooled version which pools data from a number of rounds of the HBS. Car ownership is found to be affected by rising household expenditure growth and employment to a greater extent than falling household expenditure growth and employment. Thus, as household expenditures and employment recover, the demand for car ownership is likely to rise again. A generation effect may also increase future car ownership as younger cohorts replace older cohorts. There is also a trend toward increasing levels of car ownership for urban households which has implications for the public and private transport needs of households in these areas. The results also suggest that family composition is a strong and stable predictor of the level of car ownership across time.","[Eakins, John] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland; [Eakins, John] Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, SEEC, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",University College Cork; University of Surrey,"Eakins, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland.",j.eakins@ucc.ie,"Eakins, John/AAK-5319-2020","Eakins, John/0000-0001-9504-3908",,,,,36,4,4,0,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The Role of Public Campaign Funding in Elections,AMERICAN LAW AND ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,D72; H41; H71; H76; K19,FINANCE; ARIZONA,"In a series of First Amendment cases, the U.S. Supreme Court established that government may regulate campaign finance, but not if regulation imposes costs on political speech and the purpose of regulation is to level the political playing field. The Court has applied this principle to limit the ways in which governments can provide public campaign funding to candidates in elections. A notable example is the Court's decision to strike down matching funds provisions of public funding programs (Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 2011). In this paper, we develop a contest-theoretic model of elections in which we analyze the effects of public campaign funding mechanisms, including a simple public option and a public option with matching funds, on program participation, political speech, and election outcomes. We show that a public option with matching funds is equivalent to a simple public option with a lump-sum transfer equal to the maximum level of funding under the matching program; that a public option does not always level the playing field, but may make it more uneven and can decrease as well as increase the quantity of political speech by all candidates, depending on the maximum public funding level; and that a public option tends to increase speech in cases where it levels the playing field. Several of the Supreme Court's arguments in Arizona Free Enterprise are discussed in light of our theoretical results.","[Klumpp, Tilman] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada; [Mialon, Hugo M.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Williams, Michael A.] Competit Econ LLC, Emeryville, CA USA",University of Alberta; Emory University,"Mialon, HM (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Rich Bldg 317,1602 Fishburne Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",hmialon@emory.edu,,,,,,,25,3,6,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

Does it have to do with the long and surprisingly unbroken history of foundations in Germany or rather with differences in the role of the state? Whatever the answer, this has enormous repercussions on what foundations may achieve in helping to shape public debates. Using Hirschman's model of loyalty, voice, and exit, and a definition of foundations based on seven different functions, the article explores the history of foundations in Germany and assesses their public role, both as contributors of arguments and policy papers, and as objects of public debate. It describes the amazing revival the concept of philanthropy has encountered over the last 15 years, and discusses whether this is due to long-term political convictions or rather to short-term political needs. Using examples taken from the 19(th) and 20(th) centuries, the article highlights a number of aspects that serve to illustrate the theoretical dilemma as to whether and to what extent highly hierarchical organisms may legitimately exist in an open heterarchical society.",,,"Strachwitz, R (通讯作者)，Maecenata Inst, Philanthropy & Civil Soc, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Enterprise risk forecasting is always an important concern for stakeholders. Considering the completeness and accuracy of the information in the early-warning index, this paper presents a new risk-forecasting method for enterprises to use for core business transformation by using rough set theory and an artificial neural network. First, continuous attribute values are discretized using the fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the maximum discernibility value function and information entropy. Afterwards, the major attributes are reduced by the rough sets. The core business transformation risk rank judgement is extracted to define the connection between network nodes and determine the structure of the neural networks. Finally, the improved back-propagation (BP) neural network learning and training are used to judge the risk level of the test samples. The experiments are based on 265 listed companies in China, and the results show that the proposed risk-forecasting model based on rough sets and the neural network provides higher prediction accuracy rates than do other widely developed baselines including logistic regression, neural networks and association rules mining.

The massive expansion of the country's transport infrastructure over the last decade has not been a response to demand bottlenecks or previously identified needs. For this reason, the intensity of use today on all interurban modes of transport in Spain falls well below that of other EU countries. This paper analyzes the institutional and regulatory factors that have permitted this policy, allowing us to draw lessons from the Spanish case that should help other countries avoid the pitfalls and shortcomings of Spanish policy. Based on our analysis, we also discuss policy remedies and suggest reforms in different regulatory areas, which could help improve the performance of Spain's infrastructure policy.

The endogeneity of migration is addressed with a difference-in-differences style identification strategy and a model with household fixed effects. The results suggest that while a migrant household head is away, a greater share of resources is spent on girls relative to boys and his spouse commands greater decision-making power. Once the head returns home, however, a greater share of resources goes to boys, and there is suggestive evidence of greater authority for the head of household.","[Antman, Francisca M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Antman, Francisca M.] IZA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Antman, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",francisca.antman@colorado.edu,,"ANTMAN, FRANCISCA/0000-0002-4283-149X",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,33,25,29,4,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

J,"Bonnafous, A",,,,"Bonnafous, Alain",,,The economic regulation of French highways: Just how private did they become?,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,French Highways; Optimal toll; Privatization; Economic regulation,PROJECTS,"The French highway system is mainly managed by franchises and financed by tolls. It underwent major changes from 2000 onwards. The most obvious change was the privatization of the companies holding the franchises. Nevertheless, the most important was the transposition of a European directive that led the French government to open the competition for new franchised projects. This resulted in a new form of economic regulation of toll highways involving various economic tools. Indeed, economic regulation in this case implies the coordinated use by public authorities of five fundamental instruments of infrastructure policy: - the organization of the market for franchises thus switched from the almost monopolistic management of highways by public regional companies to systematic competition between candidates for the franchises; - the financing of the extensions of the network previously ensured by these regional companies is now ensured by the private franchise selected with, if necessary, an extension of the term of the franchise and a share financed by subsidy; - the pricing imposed by the new franchises places greater demands on users, reducing the need for subsidies; - the evaluation methods that placed a premium on socioeconomic profitability give greater importance to financial profitability; and - lastly, the choice of investments was no longer that of decreasing socioeconomic internal rate of return but that of value for money, with a progressive decrease of the Net Present Value/subsidy ratio. This article proposes a presentation of these changes followed by a theoretical analysis of the new mechanisms of economic regulation, involving on the one hand funding and tolls, and on the other the evaluation criteria applied and the choice of investments. Finally, it will highlight that in spite of the growing role of private finance, the new economic regulation of these infrastructures finally remains an affair subject to government decision.

As a result, the effects of these processes, as well as competitiveness of railways in the transport market, become reduced. The aim of this paper is to answer the questions of how and by which parameters the process of the market liberalization and restructuring of railways in the SEE region should be managed, i.e. how to harmonize and synchronize this process and increase its effects. The process of restructuring has been considered in four segments: market institutions and legislation related to the railway sector, restructuring of the incumbent, degree of the railway market liberalization and financial arrangements between the state and actors of the railway market. The parameters used to compare and discuss the levels of restructuring and how to manage the harmonization have been defined for all of the mentioned segments. As a response to the need for coordination and dynamic alignment of restructuring processes and market liberalization in a region with an atomized rail network such as the SEE region, it has been proposed that the liberalization of the railway market should be realized in phases.

We apply this methodology to the modeling of a multivariate system by specifying the dynamics of the marginal distributions of each process in the system, together with a copula that ties up the marginals to produce their multivariate distribution. We work with the probability integral transforms (PIT) of the system that, under a correct specification of the conditional model, should be i.i.d. U[0,1]. The dimensionality of the system is not a constraint, because the information contained in the vector of PITs is condensed into an indicator, which is the basis of the proposed tests. We construct hyper-cubes of different sizes within the maximum hyper-cube formed by a multidimensional uniform density [0, 1](n), and assess the locations of the empirical PITs (duplex, triplex, n-plex of observations) within the corresponding population hyper-cubes. If the conditional model is correct, the volumes of the population hyper-cubes must be the same as those in their empirical counterparts. This approach allows the researcher to focus on different areas of the conditional density model, so as to assess the regions of interest. We estimate a trivariate model for a very large number of trades on the stocks of three large U.S. banks and find that the contemporaneous dependence among institutions is asymmetric, which implies that when liquidity drains (due to a lack of trading) in one institution, we should expect a concurrent effect among similar institutions. On the other hand, when liquidity is plentiful (due to dense trading), the trades on the stocks of the institutions are not correlated. We assess the models' performances by evaluating their one-step-ahead density forecasts of trades. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This article empirically examines the diffusion of an important renewable energy technology: residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Using detailed data on PV installations in Connecticut, we identify the spatial patterns of diffusion, which indicate considerable clustering of adoptions. This clustering does not simply follow the spatial distribution of income or population. We find that smaller centers contribute to adoption more than larger urban areas, in a wave-like centrifugal pattern. Our empirical estimation demonstrates a strong relationship between adoption and the number of nearby previously installed systems as well as built environment and policy variables. The effect of nearby systems diminishes with distance and time, suggesting a spatial neighbor effect conveyed through social interaction and visibility. These results disentangle the process of diffusion of PV systems and provide guidance to stakeholders in the solar market.","[Graziano, Marcello] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Gillingham, Kenneth] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of Connecticut; Yale University,"Gillingham, K (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Sch Management, Dept Econ, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",kenneth.gillingham@yale.edu,,"Graziano, Marcello/0000-0001-8568-6125","Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, University of Connecticut; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-EE0005688, DE-EE0006128]","Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, University of Connecticut; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors acknowledge partial support for this work from the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, University of Connecticut, and the U.S. Department of Energy awards number DE-EE0005688 and DE-EE0006128.",,47,259,277,11,103,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The weather data includes mean of daily temperature, amount of rain precipitation and road surface condition. The daily mean temperature is normalised based on each region and season and classified into five categories as 'very cold', 'cold', 'normal', 'warm', and 'very warm'. This normalisation approach enables us to investigate the impact of individual's heterogeneity in perceiving regional and seasonal variability of temperature. The impacts of these weather indicators' variability on individual's mode choice is investigated with multinomial logit models. The results show that the impacts of weather differ in different seasons and different regions. Pedestrians' perception of variation of temperature differs between those in the northern Sweden and those in the central and southern Sweden. Such perception also differs in summer and in spring and autumn. Similarly, northern Sweden cyclists are more aware of temperature variation than cyclists in the central and southern Sweden in spring and autumn when temperature changes significantly. The influence of temperature variation on motorised modes also varies among seasons and regions. However, the trend is less straightforward than that on non-motorised modes. The findings highlight the importance to incorporate individual and regional unique anticipation and adaptations behaviours within our policy design and infrastructure management.

I argue that two seemingly promising sets of theoretical considerations - namely, the structure of Rational Choice Theory, and considerations of computational efficiency - are unable to resolve this debate. Given this, I suggest that a consideration that speaks in favour of the preference-based view is the fact that it makes it easier to explain certain empirically observed patterns in decision making.","Univ Kansas, Dept Philosophy, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Schulz, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Philosophy, 3083 Wescoe Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",awschulz@ku.edu,,,,,,,56,4,4,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

However, this increase in information availability has not been matched by an improvement in the accuracy of poll-based news stories, which usually examine a single survey at a time, rather than providing an aggregated, more accurate view. In 2004, I developed a meta-analysis that reduced the polling noise for the Presidential race by reducing all available state polls to a snapshot at a single time, known as the Electoral Vote estimator. Assuming that Presidential pollsters are accurate in the aggregate, the snapshot has an accuracy equivalent to less than +/- 0.5% in the national popular-vote margin. The estimator outperforms both the aggregator FiveThirtyEight and the betting market InTrade. Complex models, which adjust individual polls and employ pre-campaign fundamental variables, improve the accuracy in individual states but provide little or no advantage in overall performance, while at the same time reducing transparency. A polls-only snapshot can also identify shifts in the race, with a time resolution of a single day, thus assisting in the identification of discrete events that influence a race. Finally, starting at around Memorial Day, variations in the polling snapshot over time are sufficient to enable the production of a high-quality, random-drift-based prediction without a need for the fundamentals that are traditionally used by political science models. In summary, the use of polls by themselves can capture the detailed dynamics of Presidential races and make predictions. Taken together, these qualities make the meta-analysis a sensitive indicator of the ups and downs of a national campaign in short, a precise electoral thermometer.

The findings show the significant role of additional leverage effects, captured by negative lunch-break returns and negative overnight returns, in volatility forecasting, in addition to the trading volume's impact. Moreover, there is a strong significance of the usual leverage effects, which turn out to be persistent even for SHCI. Surprisingly, squared lunch-break returns, measured as additional volatilities during the lunch-break period, have a large long-run impact on the volatility for SHCI but not for SZCI. This new empirical evidence is robust to alternative realized measurements and unconditional variance, and, in particular, confirms the impact of intermittent trading, captured by the returns and volatilities outside the trading hours. Overall, our model performs much better than the benchmark HAR-RV model when various forecasting horizons are considered, and our findings have important implications for investors and policy makers.

The propensity score matching estimator based on a uniquely compiled Taiwanese manufacturing data set shows that, as firms engage in outward FDI, they have higher productivity growth rates compared to non-FDI firms. As for the further disengagement of the impacts of outward FDI, our empirical results indicate that expansive outward FDI tends to strengthen firms' productivity growth, while such a growth-boosting effect is not statistically significant for defensive outward FDI. Moreover, as far as firms undertaking defensive & expansive outward FDI simultaneously are concerned, we also find a positive and significant impact of outward FDI on productivity growth, but the effect is not as large as that for firms engaging solely in expansive outward FDI. This may imply that defensive outward FDI has some adverse effects on firms' productivity growth. As firm performance is measured by innovation growth, the average treatment effects are all significantly positive regardless of the type of outward FDI strategies. Nevertheless, engaging in defensive outward FDI is less advantageous to innovation growth than the expansionary outward FDI, as well as to defensive & expansive outward FDI simultaneously.","[Lin, Hui-Lin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10055, Taiwan; [Hsiao, Yi-Chi] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Strategy & Management, Taipei 10055, Taiwan; [Lin, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Lin, Eric S.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Publ Econ Res Ctr, Taipei 10055, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Tsing Hua University; National Taiwan University,"Lin, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, 101,Sec 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",huilin@ntu.edu.tw; yichi19@gmail.com; slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,"HSIAO, YI-CHI/0000-0001-8221-937X",,,,,44,5,5,7,177,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Yet little is still known about how they serve as interventions for deliberately creating new sustainable fields. Emerging sustainable technologies are typically not competitive on the market and are likely to be ruled out by established industries counteracting their development. Hence, they are in need of two types of measures: those that promote the single innovation and measures that generate disruptive systemic change (i.e. bring about a transition toward increased sustainability in the technologies, rules and roles that govern established industries). The article applies the FCE literature to a novel empirical context: the creation of a field for solar technology in an especially challenging environment. Based on observations, interviews and archival data on a conference sequence in 2011-2014, the findings show that the conferences triggered processes promoting the innovation that, then, generated steppingstones for processes of disruptive systemic change. The study contributes to the FCE literature by arguing that conferences can be fruitful arenas for furthering sustainable fields, as they have the potential to address the two aspects of sustainable field creation simultaneously.","Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Studies, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University,"Nissilä, H (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Studies, Helsinki, Finland.",heli.nissila@aalto.fi,,,Foundation for Economic Education [4-2507]; Walter Ahlstrom Foundation,Foundation for Economic Education; Walter Ahlstrom Foundation,This work was supported by the Foundation for Economic Education [grant number 4-2507] and Walter Ahlstrom Foundation.,,34,7,7,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We argue that the multivariate models considered by previous studies are small-scale, probably burdened by overparameterization, and not robust to structural changes. Bayesian Vector Autoregressions (BVARs), on the other hand, allow the information contained in a large data set to be summarized efficiently, and can also allow for time variation in both the coefficients and the volatilities. In this paper we explore the performance of BVARs with constant and drifting coefficients for forecasting key fiscal variables such as government revenues, expenditures, and interest payments on the outstanding debt. We focus on both point and density forecasting, as assessments of a country's fiscal stability and overall credit risk should typically be based on the specification of a whole probability distribution for the future state of the economy. Using data from the US and the largest European countries, we show that both the adoption of a large system and the introduction of time variation help in forecasting, with the former playing a relatively more important role in point forecasting, and the latter being more important for density forecasting.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a stationary solution of the FI-Log-ACD and its properties under the log-normal assumption are studied in detail. An approximately best linear predictor based on the truncated AR(infinity) form of the logarithmic process is proposed, and approximate variances of the prediction errors for an individual observation and for the conditional mean are obtained. Forecasting intervals for these quantities in the log-transformed data and in the original process are calculated under the log-normal assumption. Finally, applications to realized volatility, trading volumes and other data sets show that the proposal works very well in practice. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

The growth of aquaculture complements the stagnant growth of extractive fisheries. Many countries are now entering this emerging economic activity. This positive feature has some serious drawbacks when the country has no local institutions to ensure the environmental sustainability of aquaculture. The Chilean salmon farming industry has grown dramatically since the mid-1980s to become the leading exporter of farmed salmon after Norway. The sector, however, suffered decline due to the sanitary crisis in 2007. It is said that this crisis was caused by overexploitation and overconcentration of fish farms. This paper tries to explain the mechanisms of the sanitary crisis - a tragedy of the commons' - by paying attention to the role of endogenous factors such as local knowledge, capacity building, local ecological conditions and the emergence of local institutions, focusing on the case of salmon farming in Chile.","[Iizuka, Michiko] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Katz, Jorge] Univ Chile, Fac Econ, Santiago, Chile",Maastricht University; Universidad de Chile,"Iizuka, M (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Keizer Karelplain 19, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands.",iizuka@merit.unu.edu; jorgekatz@terra.com,,"Iizuka, Michiko/0000-0002-7098-1575",,,,,50,19,22,0,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Contractual relations based on long-term contracts during the 1970s and 1980s led to relative stability in energy trade between the EU and its gas suppliers. But since the mid-1990s, the process of opening up the EU's gas industries to competition and the desire to create a single gas market has led to an in-depth reorganization of the sector. The EU now intends to redefine the way in which it manages its relations with its main suppliers, such as Russia, by attempting to impose a model based on competition, unbundling of network industries and privatization. Russia does not intend to implement this EU model in its gas sector, despite the big changes taking place in its domestic market. An approach based on the preferential use of state instruments conflicts with the multilateralism and principles of competition upheld by the EU. The EU's normative power is thus in contradiction with the institutional environment of the Russian energy sector. It is therefore unlikely that energy relations between the EU and Russia will be structured solely on standards stemming from international rules and institutions.","UPMF, CNRS, EDDEN, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Locatelli, C (通讯作者)，UPMF, CNRS, EDDEN, BP 47, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France.",catherine.locatelli@upmf-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,57,3,4,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The data clearly support the prediction that the locational choice is positively influenced by a low withholding tax rate. We find only mixed evidence that corporate tax rates play a role.

Compared to similar families without children, the mandate increased account ownership by 9 percentage points (12%) for families with children. Using this exogenous increase in account ownership, I examine the causal effect of transaction account ownership on the accumulation of financial assets. I find evidence of small but significant increases in financial assets for families that transitioned into account ownership.

In this model, land prices play a central role, and three hypothesized mechanisms are proposed by which swings of land prices affect the entire economy: construction on marginal sites, partial displacement of circulating capital by fixed capital investment, and the over-leveraging of bank assets. The crisis of 2008 is analyzed in these terms along with other examples of sudden economic contractions in U.S. history, recent European experience, and global examples over the past 20 years. Conditions in China in 2014 are examined and shown to indicate a likely recession in that country in 2015 because its banks are over-leveraged with large-scale, under-performing real estate loans. Finally, alternative methods of preventing similar crises in the future are explored.","Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Gaffney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",m.gaffney@dslextreme.com,,,,,,,51,5,6,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The article finds a positive and significant correlation between code-sharing agreements and the level of airfares, and considers this to be the outcome of two anticompetitive effects: (1) a round table effect, produced when the exchange of commercially sensitive information among code-sharing partners facilitates coordination and collusion; and (2) a double marginalization effect, produced when carriers use code sharing to add a mark-up over their marginal costs. The article identifies an increase in airfares charged by code-sharing partners of more than 5 percent attributable to the round table effect. On top of this, the article finds further price hikes attributable to the double marginalization effect: ticketing carriers involved in code-sharing flights charge fares more than 4 percent higher than fares set by their code-sharing partner and almost 10 percent higher than other airlines in the same market.","[Gilo, David] Israeli Antitrust Author, Jerusalem, Israel; [Gilo, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Law, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Simonelli, Felice] LUISS Guido Carli, GRIF Fabio Gobbo, Rome, Italy; [Simonelli, Felice] Ctr European Policy Studies, Regulatory Policy Unit, Brussels, Belgium",Tel Aviv University; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Gilo, D (通讯作者)，Israeli Antitrust Author, Jerusalem, Israel.",gilod@aa.gov.il; fsimonelli@luiss.it,,"Gilo, David/0000-0002-8644-5080",,,,,26,5,5,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The study gives explicit and systematic documentation of multiple stakeholder perceptions related to several measures in urban freight. Only a few studies have done so previously. The measure assessed most positively is environmentally friendly vehicles. The ex post evaluation of demonstrated electric vehicles suggests that electric vans can serve parts of the express shipment market very well with their existing range. Removing uncertainties related to their performance and financial viability is an important task for further take-up of these vehicles. The study provides a basis for designing viable and effective measures in order to achieve more environmentally-friendly and effective freight distribution in the city center of Oslo.

Using Community Innovation Survey data and adapting an econometric strategy first devised by Griffith, Huergo, Mairesse and Peters [Innovation and Productivity Across four European Countries, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 22(4), 483-498, 2006], I test whether similarities or differences prevail across country in different features of innovation activity. The results show that relevant differences between the three countries exist in the intensity of R&D activities and in the economic impact of different types of innovations, providing support to the Distance-to-the-Frontier hypothesis. On the contrary, cross-country similarities emerge among the sources of knowledge used to develop innovations, in line with the Sectoral Systems of Innovation framework. The results highlight the importance to take into account both frameworks for a useful analysis of innovation within sectors and across countries.","Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Fassio, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",claudio.fassio@circle.lu.se,,"Fassio, Claudio/0000-0002-9931-3976",,,,,39,10,12,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The effects of labor regulations are greater in industries with a higher rate of labor turnover and among borrowers with a higher probability of default.

In this exploration, we (1) compare OUIGO with the traditional French HSR and the low-cost airlines (LCAs), and (2) analyse fares proposed by OUIGO and its competitors. We thus analyse the new service in terms of production conditions, communication, marketing, booking, network geography, at-terminal and on-board experience and fares. We find that the railway industry's constraints (including market regulations, technical rigidities and incumbent employment relations) affect the OUIGO business model, which appears as a hybrid between LCAs and traditional French HSR carriers, although fares can be very attractive indeed.

Libertarianism is first defined in terms of the nonaggression principle (NAP), in answer to the question What is the proper use of force? This provides a basis for the libertarian positions on property rights, taxation, and many other issues, including human rights. Various philosophical rationales for the NAP are explored, including utilitarianism, religion, and natural rights. The basis of human rights is then examined. Every ethical tradition supports the nonaggression principle, which makes it an ideal candidate for the fundamental basis of human rights. Unfortunately, other traditions expand upon human rights by adding positive rights that ultimately violate the NAP. The conclusion takes up the application of libertarian principles to three issues, which could be viewed as human rights questions: discrimination, abortion, and the trolley problem. The last one involves taking one life to save many others.","Loyola Univ, Joseph A Butt SJ Coll Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Loyola University New Orleans,"Block, WE (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ, Joseph A Butt SJ Coll Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",wblock@loyno.edu,,,,,,,125,3,3,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The results of analysis revealed that wind electricity sector development contributes to the sustainable development of the country, but its impact on Latvia's economy is moderate. On the one hand, benefits from the promotion of the sector are received, when value added, investment, taxes, avoided greenhouse gas emissions and other indicators are considered. On the other hand, thus far these benefits are not well balanced with costs arising from the promotion of wind electricity generation. Subsidies for wind electricity generation and their share included in the final price for electricity increased during the last several years. Thus, economic efficiency of wind electricity sector development remains inconsiderable in Latvia and adjustable policy actions are required. (C) 2015 The Authors.

After revealing their behavioural traits, a theoretical sports spectator's behaviour formation model was structured. The model was examined by conducting an empirical research. After summarizing the results of the research, multiple suggestions and recommendations were given in order to influence sports spectators' behaviour. Basketball spectators assess matches differently. They are more attached to the team and enjoy following the matches in arenas and getting to feel all the emotions caused by the event from a close distance. Others choose watching the match on the TV screen with family and friends. There are some people who attend matches frequently not in order to support the team or because of the emotions but because of business and work dealings, looking for the required acquaintances and associations. It is thought that it is possible to enlarge the basis of team spectators, attract them to matches more frequently and aim for reaching the biggest possible number of people to become loyal basketball spectators and be faithful to the chosen team when considering the aspects that determine spectators' behaviour and its expression in the process of behaviour formation.","[Bradauskiene, Kristina; Stanislovaitis, Aleksas; Stanislovaitiene, Jurate] Lithuanian Sport Univ, Dept Sports Coaching Syst, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ramanauskas, Mindaugas] Lithuanian Sport Univ, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Bradauskiene, K (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sport Univ, Dept Sports Coaching Syst, Perkuno Ave 3a, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kristina.bradauskiene@lsu.lt; aleksas.stanislovaitis@lsu.lt; jurate.stanislovaitiene@lsu.lt; mindaugas.ramanauskas@lsu.lt,,,,,,,23,0,1,2,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

We find that low subjective well-being of Russian old adults is associated with low social activity of old people, weaknesses of social support networks, volunteering and mutual assistance among the old adults.","[Frolova, Elena; Ryzhkova, Marina] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk 634050, Russia",Tomsk Polytechnic University,"Frolova, E (通讯作者)，Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Lenin Ave 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia.",marybox@inbox.ru,"Frolova, Elena A/P-8445-2016; Frolova, Elena/P-2390-2015; Ryzhkova, Marina V/P-2172-2015","Ryzhkova, Marina V/0000-0002-0107-8016",,,,,3,2,2,0,8,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-251-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,489,492,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD8BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363785400079,0

Using the literature in International Management as our framing, we observe three inter-related stylized realities. First, it is state-owned enterprises (SOEs) - not private enterprises - that tend to principally benefit from the favorable Go Global policies. Second, SOEs tend to pay much higher acquisition premiums in outward FDI as compared to non-SOEs. Third, SOEs tend to be less effective as compared to non-SOEs in gaining synergies and enhancing competitiveness as a result of these cross-border experiences. These results yield clear policy implications for the Chinese government: first, more effective public policy would involve enhanced targeting of private enterprises as the recipients of policies promoting outward FDI; second, the Chinese government should continue along the path toward privatization of SOEs. The continued bolstering of economic and social development in China is contingent upon efforts to reduce the state's active role in outward FDI.","[Guo, Wenxin] Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Strateg Management, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Clougherty, Joseph A.] Univ Illinois, Business Adm, Champaign, IL USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Guo, WX (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Strateg Management, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,,,,,,,42,5,6,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,141,159,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028009,0.0,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300008,0

The need for financial statements comparable internationally and at the European level attracts the interest in terms of developing quality accounting standards. Internationally, the research on the compliance with IFRS, in general, and on financial reporting, in particular, continues to be important. Romania, as an integral part of the European and international economic life, is included in this project of accounting standardization. In this study, we aim to cover a set of research methods and tools in order to facilitate the scientific research. The paper will be based on the principles of quantitative research and as well as on those of qualitative research. As part of quantitative research, we will use figures and the statistical analysis method. In this regard, emphasis will be placed on the quantitative data obtained using the SPSS 21 statistic software. In terms of methodology, the quantitative research is deductive, starting from general assumptions and ending with particular cases. In terms of qualitative research, we aim at an intelligent and pervasive description of an event. Qualitative research is inductive, starting from the process of partial observation and ending with general conclusions. As qualitative research methods, we will research the practice of the field, using overall analysis, observation, checklist as tools. The main obstacle in making our scientific approach, is the relatively small number of subjects (the small number of listed companies).","[Gutierrez Ponce, Herenia] Autonomous Univ Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Hlaciuc, Elena; Maciuca, Geanina] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania; [Mates, Dorel] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",Autonomous University of Madrid; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; West University of Timisoara,"Ponce, HG (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",herenia.gutierrez@uam.es; elenah@seap.usv.ro; mates.doloro60@yahoo.com; geaninasth@yahoo.com,"Gutierrez-Ponce, Herenia/AAE-3893-2019","Gutierrez-Ponce, Herenia/0000-0002-4894-7039",,,,,25,1,1,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1569,1584,,,,,,16,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700159,0

Cross sectional analysis across sub-Saharan countries provided no evidence of such an association. However, using homicide rates and several measures of inequality across South Africa's 52 districts does provide evidence of a significant positive relationship between homicide rates and expenditure inequality. A one per cent increase in inequality is associated with an increase in the homicide rate of 2.3 to 2.5 per cent. This relationship remains significant after controlling for other characteristics of the district.","[Harris, Geoff] Durban Univ Technol, Sch Publ Management & Econ, Durban, South Africa; [Vermaak, Claire] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa",Durban University of Technology; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Harris, G (通讯作者)，Durban Univ Technol, Sch Publ Management & Econ, Durban, South Africa.",,"Vermaak, Claire/ACC-2926-2022","Vermaak, Claire/0000-0001-6355-3321",,,,,30,20,22,0,18,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The typical company publishes annually ten items of news on its website, links the website with profiles on social media and shares approximately a third of communication content across communication tools.

In case of external environmental factors, it is possible to discuss the impact of macro and sectoral environment on the financial structure. In this article, the authors focus on the analysis and assessment of the impact of internal business factors on the financial structure of Slovak enterprises. The aim of this study is to determine whether there are differences between the impact of internal business factors (i.e. different direction and intensity of their impact) on enterprises across different industry sectors. The authors use the multiple research analysis as the main research method.

The core competitiveness in private HEIs is highly relied on the competence and capability of their workforce, which refer to the lecturers. The ability of the lecturers to deliver the course in the effective and innovative manner is depended on their innovative work behaviors. The present research exaMined the relationship between the predictor, namely knowledge management practices (knowledge creation, knowledge organization, knowledge storage, knowledge dissemination and knowledge application) and lecturers' work innovativeness. This survey data was derived from a sample of 105 lecturers in private HEIs in Malaysia.

The modeling framework includes structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model with debt feedback, estimated using short-term identification restrictions, and non-linear specification of the government debt dynamics. The considered model variables are GDP, inflation, the effective interest rate on government debt, government revenues and expenditures, the exchange rate and government debt. The model estimation is carried out using the Bayesian approach. According to the results, allowing for a non-linear dynamics in the government debt to GDP ratio could imply stronger persistence and higher volatility in the responses of government indebtedness to macroeconomic shocks. Further, the fiscal stance of the Czech Republic seems to be most vulnerable to unexpected depreciation of the Czech crown, discretionary pro-cyclical increases in government expenditures and decrease in government revenues.","[Melecky, Ales] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Melecky, A (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ales.melecky@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Ales/AAZ-1918-2020; Melecky, Ales/HNP-2751-2023","Melecky, Ales/0000-0002-4495-6296;",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,156,160,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800025,0

The empirical part of the paper concentrates on the analysis of beta-convergence in 35 NUTS 2 regions of the Visegrad Group in the period between 1995 and 2012 to a steady state. The steady state is represented by an average of real GDP per capita in the EU 28.

These days, the urban city lifestyle has greatly degraded our sleep quality which ends up to diverse sleep problems such as the most common one, insomnia. Other than current scientific established solutions, one of the probable ways to improve sleep quality is by improving the bedroom interior configuration via Feng Shui approaches. Feng Shui healing has been a common belief among the Asian as it may has its own scientific origin that is not purely superstitious. Some people may have experienced the remedy of changing their bed positions for better sleep quality however have not conceive that Feng Shui principles has been subconsciously practiced. For that reason, the attempt of incorporating Feng Shui knowledge into bedroom interior configuration is highly expected to upgrade the sleep quality of every individual ranging from general to special care users. In Feng Shui, beds should preferably be backed by a solid wall. However, sleeping with bed directly facing doors and mirrors are prohibited in Feng Shui as these practices were said to affect sleep and are considered unfavourable for health and relationship of the living occupants. This paper generally provides a critical review on the prospects of space configuration by Feng Shui approaches in relation to individual sleep quality. The review of bedroom Feng Shui shall involve the discussion of authentic Chinese Feng Shui knowledge and practices in supportive to good sleep. It will also emphasize the correlation between Feng Shui perception, interior configuration and environmental psychology. It is expected to give further insight into Feng Shui so that the benevolent part of these ancient practices can be merged with modern sciences as an important reference for space design to improve the human well-being.","[Thing, Hong Wan; Hamzah, Abdul-Rahman; Chen, Wang] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Thing, HW (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",ashleyhwt@yahoo.com; arhamzah@um.edu.my; derekisleon@um.edu.my,"Wang, Chen/F-1586-2010","Wang, Chen/0000-0001-7892-3575; Wan Thing, Hong/0000-0003-2890-7264",,,,,34,0,0,0,13,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3593,3610,,,,,,18,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700376,0

We introduce a novel Agent-based model that simulates both individual-level and inter-personal processes, and that allows exploring how stereotypes are shared and validated through interpersonal processes. At the individual-level, agent processes are simulated by recurrent auto-associative networks. To simulate interpersonal processes, these individual networks are combined into a community of networks so that they can exchange their individual information with each other by transmitting information on the same concepts from one network to another. Through simulations, it is shown how the model can account for a number of seminal findings from the empirical literature on illusory correlations, a key cognitive antecedent of prejudice. In addition, novel hypotheses in terms of the impact of interpersonal processes on the dissemination of illusory correlations were supported by the results of a small group experiment. We discuss the results and argue that agent-based models can provide a first step in integrating individual and interpersonal processes underlying stereotype formation and IC.","[Van Rooy, Dirk] Australian Natl Univ, Fac Coll Med Biol & Environm, Res Sch Psychol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Van Rooy, D (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Fac Coll Med Biol & Environm, Res Sch Psychol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",dirk.vanrooy@anu.edu.au,"Van Rooy, Dirk/AAH-4985-2019","Van Rooy, Dirk/0000-0003-2525-5408",,,,,17,0,0,1,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-55236-9; 978-4-431-55235-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,15,26,,10.1007/978-4-431-55236-9_2,0.0,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380563900002,0

The derivation incorporates current standard accounting principles and regulatory requirements. In the end it will be seen that a substantial correlation exists between the final derived framework and current published statements of a modern property-casualty insurer. It remains to be seen if a similar correlation will continue to exist once the long awaited international accounting standard for insurers is finalised. The article accordingly demonstrates that Adam Smith's statement can be used to derive a workable framework for the accounting and hence management of modern property-casualty insurers. A number of important conclusions flow from the article. Firstly the distinction between provisions and reserves must be understood and maintained failing which solvent insurers may be portrayed as being insolvent, second a new provision should be raised, a Year to Close Provision where it is unclear that existing provisions adequately cover outstanding liabilities and third the IBNR provision should be restricted to claims in the pipeline for the year under consideration.","[Vivian, Robert W.; Hutcheson, Hugh-David] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Vivian, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This understanding is based on the results of an investigation conducted in Slovenia between May and December 2009 in 134 Slovene micro-enterprises. Data for the main study were collected via structured interviews with owners or top managers of micro enterprises. We used some demographic questions about the business annual turnover, computerisation, owner's characteristics and some questions about the financial investments in ICT. To visualize and define factors we proposed a research model of annual turnover dependency in micro enterprise. The research focused on characteristics of owners of the enterprise, investments in ICT and characteristics of enterprises' usage of available ICT in correlation to business annual turnover. The results indicate that adoption, the number and type of hardware and software are positively associated with the micro-enterprise success. An important factor is also formal education of the manager and/or owner and his or her computer and ICT knowledge and skills. We also found out that use of internet, eBusiness and number of used business software contribute to enterprise's success. We can confirm that micro-enterprise informatisation can be the basis for a healthy economy growth if adequate knowledge and skills are present. To increase growth in micro-businesses we can use this and additional factors (intentions to growth, size, annual turnover, industry type,...) as filters to separate potential growing micro-enterprises from others that represent more than 94% of all enterprises in county. When we defined target group we can start to encourage growth with knowing methods from best practices all over the world. Based on our survey and on the review of literature, recommendations have been given how to be more effective and efficient in encouraging the growth of micro-enterprises.","[Werber, Borut; Rajkovic, Uros] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Dept Informat, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Urh, Marko] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Dept Business & Working Syst, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Znidarsic, Anja] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Dept Methodol, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Werber, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Dept Informat, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",borut.werber@fov.uni-mb.si; uros.rajkovic@fov.uni-mb.si; marko.urh@fov.uni-mb.si; anja.znidarsic@fov.uni-mb.si,"Žnidaršič, Anja/AAQ-2844-2020; Werber, Borut/AAA-6971-2022","Žnidaršič, Anja/0000-0003-0084-3182; Werber, Borut/0000-0002-5185-5717",,,,,30,5,7,2,31,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In the first stage of the analysis, effectiveness in terms of the protection of industrial property rights is quantified. In the second stage, efficiency, that means whether companies can commercialize industrial rights, is measured. The overall performance score, then, integrates both dimensions; efficiency and effectiveness. The article is divided into three consecutive parts, In the first part, the definition and measurement of performance of companies is discussed. Further, the DEA method is presented in more detail. The history of this method and its application in practice is briefly introduced. In the second part, the methodology used in the research and the data used are presented. The third part shows the results. The proposed methodology for evaluating the performance of innovative companies was tested on a sample of 36 innovative companies in the textile industry. To quantify individual performance components, the BCC input-oriented model was used because decreasing returns to scale in the industry were identified A long-term capital and the period of a company's existence as a measure of intellectual capital were used as inputs of the first model. The outputs of the first model are numbers of registered results of technical creative activity and industrial design. These outputs are also inputs to the second model. The output of the second model is the value added indicating whether the companies are able to commercialize protected industrial rights. At the end of the analysis, the companies are divided into four quadrants according to scores of effectiveness, efficiency and performance.","[Zizka, Miroslav; Turcok, Lukas] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Zizka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",miroslav.zizka@tul.cz; lukas.turcok@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",,,,,20,2,2,0,9,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,365,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000037,0

Manager Effects on Organization Performance,MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MAJOR-LEAGUE BASEBALL; PANEL-DATA; STYLE,"In this study, we examine how pre-managerial experience and performance relates to managerial success. Some prior research has documented that managers contribute to organization performance, but the link between specific manager characteristics and performance has been dubious because data about managers' prior work history are typically quite limited. We overcome this limitation by examining our research question in the context of Major League Baseball, where data on pre-managerial work history are available for a large subset of managers. This allows us to focus on two questions that have not been adequately addressed in prior studies. First, does success prior to becoming a manager translate into success as a manager? Second, what is the relative importance of measurable versus unobservable manager characteristics on performance?

By incorporating managers' accumulated fire suppression experiences (capitalized experience) in the analysis we help fire managers determine fire suppression productivity and efficient budget allocation. Furthermore, monitoring of the management index (MI) helps identify operational deficiencies in the different districts where the analysis is applied. This is so because internally the area contraction factor (ACF) provides information regarding the effectiveness of fire suppression operations by including a comparison ratio between the area affected and the potential fire area without suppression actions. We used the Almonaster fire that occurred in 2008 in the Huelva Province, Spain as a case study to test the applicability of the methodology. Our evaluation showed that the combinations of firefighting resources assigned to the Almonaster fire resulted in a fire suppression efficiency of only 33%, measured as the ratio between damages avoided and suppression costs involved.

However, few studies have directly examined the impact of household structure on the gender differences in space-time constraints associated with various daily activities due to the lack of accurate space-time data. Using a 7-day GPS-based activity-travel diary dataset collected in Beijing, this paper investigates how household structure influences men's and women's space-time constraints and reduces the related gender differences in daily activity participation. The results suggest that gender and household structure matters. Getting help from retired parents reduces the level of fixity household heads perceive and decreases gender differences in space-time constraints. However, the degree of the impact differs among activities and retired parents' age, and fixity level depends on the individual and household background of the person initiating the activity.","[Ta, Na] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Kwan, Mei-Po] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, 255 Comp Applicat Bldg,MC-150, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Kwan, Mei-Po] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Chai, Yanwei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Econ Geog, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhilin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Utrecht University; Peking University; Tsinghua University,"Ta, N (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",tanapku@gmail.com; mpk654@gmail.com; chyw@pku.edu.cn; zhilinliu@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Ta, Na/AAA-3191-2020; Kwan, Mei-Po/S-4162-2016; Ta, Na/P-1352-2015","Ta, Na/0000-0001-7095-4262; Kwan, Mei-Po/0000-0001-8602-9258; Ta, Na/0000-0001-7095-4262; Chai, Yanwei/0000-0003-2513-3769","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41529101, 41571144]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant no. 41529101 and grant no. 41571144].,,51,19,25,4,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This study identifies the driving factors and measures their corresponding contributions in transportation energy consumption for the case of Tunisia by using the logarithmic-mean Divisia index method (LMDI) over the period 1985-2014. The transport related energy consumption is decomposed into energy intensity, transportation structure effect, transportation intensity effect, economic output, and population scale effects according to the driving mechanism. Results indicate that the overall effect of economic output, transportation intensity, population scale, and transportation structure on energy consumption is positive, whereas the overall effect of energy intensity is negative. It was shown that energy intensity played the dominant role in decreasing energy consumption during the study period. Improving the transport intensity exerts significant effect on saving energy. Our empirical findings provide scientific supports for the policy measures based on low, greenhouse gas emissions integrated transport. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using National Household Travel Survey data for 2009, this paper finds that, compared to the mobility of other populations, the mobility of Hispanic female immigrants is much lower, particularly when household income is low. Hispanic female immigrants are substantially less likely to be drivers than their male counterparts, and their probability of being a driver stagnates for decades after immigration, unlike female immigrants of other race/ethnicity groups. Hispanic female immigrants seem to remain non-drivers rather reluctantly. At the household level, Hispanic immigrants do not actively choose less auto-dependent lifestyles, and females clearly depend on others' mobility. Yet once Hispanic female immigrants become drivers, they drive more than females of other race/ethnicity groups. Their high, hidden demand for driving is likely not related to domestic needs because their driving mileage is unassociated with child-caring duties, and is associated with household income level. The association between low-income status and driver status of Hispanic female immigrants has policy implications, especially if the barriers to becoming a driver limit Hispanic female immigrants' access to training or employment and contribute to their low-income status. More detailed analysis is anticipated to detail the mobility challenges Hispanic female immigrants face. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are also a wide set of different institutional arrangements models for BRT implementation and operation and a growing interest in developing these agreements with the private sector.

After a brief period of competition, which seemed to offer the prospect of welfare gains, the industry rapidly consolidated, with resulting losses in bus usage and welfare, similar to the rest of Great Britain outside London. There were large increases in subsidy following the introduction of a national free concessionary fares scheme in 2002. There is some evidence that some of this subsidy has leaked, at least some of the time, into super-normal profits, in part due to generous concessionary fare reimbursement terms. For the urban parts of Wales, particularly in the North East (centred on Wrexham) and the South East (centred on Cardiff), there are aspirations to develop Bus Rapid Transit to supplement the existing rail network. For rural Wales, there have been long standing aspirations to develop more flexible public transport services and long distance bus services, but this has often been thwarted by lack of funding. Organisational reforms that might assist the Welsh Government in delivering these aspirations are reviewed, including Quality Contracts, Quality Partnerships and Community Partnerships.

However, external R&D sourcing might produce an impoverishment of the local knowledge base and thus damage innovation production at the regional level. To address this possible fallacy of composition, we first review the various forms of external' R&D. We then use the French R&D survey to assess the impact of four different ways of transacting or collaborating on R&D: onshore affiliate external R&D, offshore affiliate external R&D, onshore non-affiliate and offshore non-affiliate external R&D. We then estimate knowledge production functions on the 94 metropolitan French NUTS3 regions observed between 1997 and 2008, differentiating internal R&D and these categories of external R&D. We obtain that the impact of onshore non-affiliate external R&D is significantly negative. The other external R&D categories are non-significant and we do not detect any complementarity between internal and external R&D.","[Brossard, Olivier] Toulouse Polit Studies Inst, LEREPS, Toulouse, France; [Moussa, Ines] SupCom, LEREPS, Cite Technol Commun Route Raoued, Ariana, Tunisia; [Moussa, Ines] SupCom, Ecole Super Commun Tunis, Cite Technol Commun Route Raoued, Ariana, Tunisia",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite de Carthage; Universite de Carthage,"Brossard, O (通讯作者)，Toulouse Polit Studies Inst, LEREPS, Toulouse, France.",olivier.brossard@sciencespo-toulouse.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-ORAR-004-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [grant number ANR-10-ORAR-004-01].,,76,5,5,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

We argue that such firms are prone to creative cycles' that arise from uncertainty-induced systemic overshooting that can threaten the firm's financial viability, requiring managers to shift control back to risk-averse financial controllers. But this creates opportunities for competing firms to engage in bold creative visions, threatening the firm's market viability and inducing control to shift back to newly contracted suppliers of creative vision'. We discuss how this principal-agent-agent' mechanism plays out, the types of uncertainty that drive it, and consider the industry-level externalities it induces.

There is a disconnect between the study efforts and the practice of transit -oriented planning and policy making. This paper aims at building this connection through a case study of Wuhan, China. The study applies established conceptual frameworks and analytical procedures in the field to 1) examine the spatial extent of rail transit impacts on housing market; 2) estimate transit access premiums and their spatial distribution in the station area; and 3) simulate revenue streams to illustrate the potential of transit value capture. The empirical results show that in Wuhan the influence area extends to 700 m for light rail transit (LRT Line 1), 900-1000 m for metro rail (MRT Lines 2 and 4). The distance ranges differ from the conventionally accepted value of 400 m and the value of 500-600 m currently considered by Wuhan local planning agencies. This empirical knowledge enables transit planners to modify transit catchment areas for the interest of enhancing ridership forecasting and service planning. The Wuhan case study reports average transit capitalization rates of 2.87%, 3.71%, and 4.37% for LRT Line 1, MRT Line 2, and MRT Line 4, respectively. These.capitalization rates translate to average premium values of 318.14, 383.02, and 400.23 yuan per-square meter within the corresponding influence areas for the respective three lines. This location-specific knowledge on housing market responses to transit access supports the local government to formulate and fine-tune location-specific plans and policies; for example, the density bonus regulation currently practiced by Wuhan municipal government. The simulation shows that a 0.5% capture rate could generate more than 153 million yuan from the existing housing stock (in year 2013) inside the influence areas of the three transit lines in Wuhan. In the full build-out scenario under Wuhan's current TOD density regulation, the captured value is 222 million yuan. The captured value could help reduce transit operation deficits. Planning practice and policy making should move from being experience-driven to evidence-based. Empirical research is essential to identify and provide the needed evidence for more efficient TOD regulation and value capture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The first property is that the dynamic cost functions can give rise to situations in which the transport system is unstable. This property has a number of consequences. One of them - important from a practical point of view - is that, if a transport mode implements a plan of improvements of its characteristics in order to stop the decline of the proportion of freight flow it carries, there is a time threshold to start the improvements, beyond which the plan is unsuccessful. The other property is that the dynamic cost functions give rise to cost elasticities that vary over time, with asymptotic values that tend to zero as transport cost decreases. This means that, if one implements successive improvements of the characteristics of a transport mode, their effects diminish progressively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The costs and distances of voyages can be greatly reduced, particularly for vessels navigating between Asia and Europe. This paper first focuses on the share of the SC transit by region pair which the cargo originates from and is destined to, in order to recognize how the SC is competing with other routes (such as a route via the Panama Canal or the Cape of Good Hope) in the container shipping market on a global scale. The shares estimated in different years (2010 and 2013) are compared to examine the recent change in the competitive environment of the SC. In the second part of the paper, the model to describe the shares of each route is developed. An aggregated logit model, which is one of the most major stochastic discrete choice models, is adopted to describe. The model focuses on the supply side of container shipping market, namely, monetary shipping cost and time. It is confirmed that the developed model including estimated unknown parameters agrees with the actual shares of each route well. By utilizing the developed model, some future simulations such as reflecting the Panama Canal expansion are examined.","[Shibasaki, Ryuichi] MLIT, NILIM, Int Coordinat Div, 1-12 Shinmei Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2390832, Japan; [Azuma, Toshio] Japan Sediments Management Assoc, Chiyoda Ku, 1-6-2 Kojimachi, Tokyo 1020083, Japan; [Azuma, Toshio] OCDI, Chiyoda Ku, 1-6-2 Kojimachi, Tokyo 1020083, Japan; [Yoshida, Tetsuo] Japan Port Consultants Ltd, Shinagawa Ku, 8-3-6 Nishi Gotanda, Tokyo 1410031, Japan",,"Shibasaki, R (通讯作者)，MLIT, NILIM, Int Coordinat Div, 1-12 Shinmei Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2390832, Japan.",shibasaki-r92y2@mlit.go.jp,"Shibasaki, Ryuichi/S-7338-2019","Shibasaki, Ryuichi/0000-0003-2453-8668",JSPS KAKENHI [25289159]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25289159] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was made possible in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25289159.

Yet this important control mechanism has received very little attention in the literature on corruption. I study a signaling game of corruption in which uninformed consumers require a government service from informed officials. A victim of corruption can report corrupt officials whose supervisors are negligent or conscientious but an official's type is his private information. I find that social welfare may be nonmonotonic in the proportion of conscientious supervisors. Several examples show that an increase in the proportion of conscientious supervisors decreases social welfare if the mass of conscientious supervisors is below a critical level. I find that this perverse result does not hold if (a) the bribe is very large, or (b) bribe-giving is legalized. I also find that there is an equilibrium in which no one reports corruption.","[Amegashie, J.

The model is based on a mathematical description of the transport system, where transport mode choice follows ideal simple rules based on distance from origin to destination and transit network accessibility. For each transport mode unit energy consumption, capacity and load factor are considered. Flows of trips are optimally assigned between origin and destination zones in such a way that transport energy is minimised. Energy ideally required for home-to-school/university travel is assessed as these journeys contribute a significant number of daily trips within a city. In particular, the model was applied to the urban area of Catania, a medium-sized town in Italy, for different scenarios, including improvements in the transit system and in pedestrian/cycling accessibility. The methodology proved to be suitable to evaluate the potential impact of land use and transport policies in terms of transport energy dependence, separating it from behavioural considerations.

Hypothesis of our paper is that RTAs-induced trade liberalization will have heterogeneous effects on particular product groups with indirect implications on national welfare. Static and dynamic gravity trade models are used on panel data accounting for over 90% of total trade during the observed period. Estimations of the trade gravity model and trade margins showed that while SAA and CEFTA arrangements positively affected different measures of intensive and extensive trade margins, specially exports and imports of consumption products, effects on trade in intermediate and capital goods were relatively subdued. This suggests a tendency for market-seeking rather than efficiency-seeking behaviour of Croatia's trade sector. When comparing the results for two trade agreements using dynamic model, we find that SAA primarily affected trade in consumption goods while effects of CEFTA are more evenly dispersed across different product groups. Main conclusion of the paper is that Croatia's policy makers should try to keep the preferential status of Croatia within the CEFTA market in the medium term, focusing on the Croatian economy.","[Kejzar, Katja Zajc; Kostevc, Crt] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Zaninovic, Vinko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Rijeka,"Zaninovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",katja.zajc@ef.uni-lj.si; crt.kostevc@ef.uni-lj.si; vinko.zaninovic@efri.hr,"Zaninovic, Vinko/Q-5540-2018","Zaninovic, Vinko/0000-0002-2094-0687",,,,,42,8,8,1,12,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

We argue that this policy had the effect of reducing the likelihood that firm managers-investors would adopt suboptimal investment time horizons. The strategy also served to protect state subsidies to corporations and outside investment funds from expropriation. Using firm-level data that are published by the Russian Trading System stock exchange and the SKRIN database that spans 1998-2006, we test the success of this strategy during this formative era for the modern Russian corporation. We find that co-ownership played an important role in generating improved long-term performance, particularly in industries with high asset-specificity.

Side-payments can support cooperation but are not legally enforceable and thus have to be part of an equilibrium. This requires stable relationships and credible punishment threats. Within this framework, we analyze the effects of separation costs and post-separation alimony payments on couples' fertility decisions. We derive the predictions that higher separation costs and higher alimony payments facilitate cooperation and hence increase fertility. We present empirical evidence based on a recent German reform that reduced rights to post-divorce alimony payments. We find that this reform reduced in-wedlock fertility.","[Fahn, Matthias; Rees, Ray] Univ Munich, Kaulbachstr 45, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Rees, Ray] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Wuppermann, Amelie] Univ Munich, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Warwick; University of Munich,"Fahn, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Kaulbachstr 45, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",matthias.fahn@econ.lmu.de; Ray.Rees@lrz.uni-muenchen.de; amelie.wuppermann@econ.lmu.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GRK 801],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the editor Alessandro Cigno and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments and suggestions.

The present study expands research in this area by proposing conceptual separation of core competencies for individuals' ambidexterity and their relations to behavioural ambidexterity. Drawing from the literature on organisational ambidexterity and knowledge management, the authors coined the term knowledge workers' integrated ambidexterity competency, a multidimensional construct that consists of cognitive, information, and social skills. Hypotheses are developed to test the multidimensionality and causal relationships among constructs. Empirical analysis with survey data from 293 knowledge workers in South Korea supports the validity of the multidimensional construct and indicates that integrated ambidexterity competency, involving an interaction of cognitive, information, and social skills, drives behavioural ambidexterity. The contribution of the study lies in advancing the theory of organisational ambidexterity by conceptual separation of competencies from behaviour as well as the development of the multifaceted perspectives of the competencies, and the development of measurement items.","[Lee, Young-Joo] Natl Informat Soc Agcy, NIA Bldg,Cheonggyecheonno 14, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jung-Hoon] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, New Millennium Hall 418,50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, New Millennium Hall 418,50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",jhoonlee@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,65,8,8,1,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

One of the reasons for this inconsistence may be the ignorance of the impact on the external environment. Under the context of open innovation, innovation activities are divided into inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Based on a sample of 224 Chinese entrepreneurs from the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta, the relationship between the two kinds of open innovation and firm growth is discussed, and how this relationship is being affected by environment competitiveness (EC) and environment munificence (EM) is explored. Results show that both the inbound open and outbound open innovations have a positive effect on firm growth. Both EC and EM weaken the relationship between inbound open and firm growth. The study also finds a negative effect of both EC and EM on the relationship between outbound open innovation and firm growth significantly.

A real-time database is constructed from the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Accounts release. This is used to measure the extent of data revisions while also formally testing the presence of statistical bias in Irish data. Although estimates of GDP are found to be unbiased, the same cannot be said for some of the sub-components, most notably investment spending. Using data from the OECD, we compile an additional data set for 25 OECD economies to assess the relative scale of revisions to Irish data. Finding that revisions to Irish real GDP growth rates are among the largest observed - even when allowing for differences in growth rates - we examine a number of factors that may indicate why cross-country differences emerge. The scale of data revisions, particularly in Ireland, appears to bear some relation to the structure of the traded sector. More generally the paper also highlights the potential for weaker forecasting performances in countries where data revisions are likely to be relatively high.","[Casey, Eddie] Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Dublin, Ireland; [Smyth, Diarmaid] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Casey, E (通讯作者)，Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Dublin, Ireland.;Smyth, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",eddie.casey@fiscalcouncil.ie; diarmaid.smyth@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In studies that have inspected the conditions in which workers support authoritative change, specialists have concentrated on different attitudinal factors that represents employees' states of mind toward hierarchical change. These factors include preparation for change, responsibility to change, openness to change, and pessimism about authoritative change. These factors have distinct meaning and implications for the organization and thus serve as representative assessment of employees' evaluation and worries about specific change activities. This study examines the attitudes of employees towards organizational change through review of relevant literature and discusses how attitudinal factors relate to organizational change, the inherent antecedents of each factor and its influence on employee commitment.

However Saudi SMEs, to some extents, lack the IT infrastructure and applications to effectively manage knowledge assets. The IT applications were found to be controlling the relationship between internal and external knowledge management and dynamic capability.

Drawing from Ernst and Ernst methodology, we use content analysis to develop level-related disclosure indexes for 66 Jordanian companies for three years (2010,2011 and 2012). Using panel data regression, we model the relationship between disclosure amount and the key drivers of social and environmental disclosure via random effect estimation. Compared to the results of previous research into the determinants of corporate voluntary disclosures, this study somewhat shows mixed results. The results from the random effect model indicate that the firm size audit firm and financial performance are significantly associated with the level of CSED. We also find that firm profitability, age, type of industry and ownership are not related to the level of CSED practice.","[Bani-Khalid, Tareq] Al Al Bayt Univ, Fac Finance & Business Adm, Mafraq, Jordan; [Kouhy, Reza; Hassan, Aminu] Univ Abertay Dundee, Dundee Business Sch, Dundee, Scotland",Al al-Bayt University; University of Abertay Dundee,"Bani-Khalid, T (通讯作者)，Al Al Bayt Univ, Fac Finance & Business Adm, Mafraq, Jordan.",Tareq_alkhaldi@yahoo.com; R.Kouhy@abertay.ac.uk; a.hassan@abertay.ac.uk,"Bani-Khalid, Tareq/GQZ-2073-2022; ARIAS, ANA/L-9659-2019; Hassan, Aminu/AAU-5841-2020","Bani-Khalid, Tareq/0000-0001-9723-0600; Hassan, Aminu/0000-0002-2780-555X",,,,,143,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3123,3148,,,,,,26,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700319,0

When these numbers are presented as text in a table, our brains interpret them through the use of verbal processing and may fail looking for patterns, trends, or exceptions among these values. The information contained in numerical values becomes visible and understandable when communicated visually. The strengths of data visualization come from our ability to process visual information much more rapidly than verbal information. Good data visualization techniques and technologies translate abstract information into visual representations that can be easily, efficiently, accurately, and meaningfully decoded. In this paper two such technologies will be presented: Oracle JET and Microsoft Power BI, using as a case study the Most Probable Precipitation Method (MPPM) for the regional precipitation estimation.","[Barbulescu, Alina] Higher Coll Technol, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Stoica, Florin; Stoica, Laura Florentina] Lucian Blaga Univ, Sibiu, Romania",Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Barbulescu, A (通讯作者)，Higher Coll Technol, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",alinadumitriu@yahoo.com; florin.stoica@ulbsibiu.ro; laura.cacovean@ulbsibiu.ro,"Stoica, Florin/GSI-4949-2022; Stoica, Laura Florentina/L-1120-2013; Barbulescu, Alina/G-4385-2011","Stoica, Florin/0000-0002-9073-0781; Barbulescu, Alina/0000-0001-9840-2443",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu [LBUS-IRG-2015-01],Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Project financed from Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu research grants LBUS-IRG-2015-01, and developed within the Center of Scientific Research in Informatics and Information Technology.",,19,0,0,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3213,3228,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700327,0

The study included all economic activities, and in this respect it is one of the few studies that focus on the complete economy of an individual country. The study estimated two groups of costs; namely, the costs of employee-preferred measures for reducing employee turnover rates in organisations and the average costs of replacing an employee in an organisation. When evaluating the costs of employee-preferred measures we mainly wanted to evaluate the costs of subsidising informal meetings, bonuses for the continuity of employment and bonuses for workplace attendance. Most other measures preferred by employees are of a non-financial nature, except for promotion, which we did not evaluate specifically as it is primarily part of the company's employment and job diversity policy. In estimating the costs of employee turnover we focused only on the costs of hiring a new employee: the cost of replacing an employee and the cost of introducing the new employee. Using several assumptions the estimated total cost of employee turnover in Slovenia ranges from (sic)2.2 million to (sic)3.4 million per year in year 2011. In addition to the estimations of both groups of costs, this paper also provides a comparison of evaluations of selected measures for reducing employee turnover as perceived by employees and employers. We arrived at important conclusions, as it turned out that employers give higher ratings to financial measures, while employees give higher ratings to non-financial measures.","[Buzeti, Jernej; Klun, Maja; Stare, Janez] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Buzeti, J; Klun, M; Stare, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",jernej.buzeti@fu.uni-lj.si; maja.klun@fu.uni-lj.si; janez.stare@fu.uni-lj.si,,,European Union; European Social Fund,European Union(European Union (EU)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"The study in its operational part was financed by the European Union, European Social Fund.

An additional contribution of this article is to extend the analysis on the basis of a full geographical coverage of European NUTS2 regions, with the aim to generalize the empirical identification of the impacts of specialization and diversification externalities with respect to the existing literature.

Chinese cultural industry government regulations need legal norms to improve and increase social regulation.","[Han, Liwen] Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Cultural Ind Secur Inst, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication,"Han, LW (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Cultural Ind Secur Inst, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China.",hlw519@sina.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-981-287-655-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,255,260,,10.1007/978-981-287-655-3_33,0.0,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE9ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377352200033,0

On the other hand, economically more free country; with better rating and easier conditions for doing business does not attract more FDI inflows, but rather the opposite.

The empirical analysis consists of unit root tests, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) framework, Granger causality test, and diagnostic tests. Based upon the empirical results, there are significant differences between the post-transitional and original EU member states. This difference is most notable in the fact that only in the panel of countries that have acceded to the EU after 2004 there is a statistically significant link between energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emission. We therefore conclude that while not all EU member states exhibit signs of environmental imbalances, there still are significant differences between the EU 15 and the states that have acceded to full membership after 2004.","[Kokotovic, Filip] Univ Coll Int Relat & Diplomacy Dag Hammarskjold, Zagreb 242, Ilica, Croatia; [Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Dept Business Econ, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Cingula, Domagoj] Varazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy, Varazhdin, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kokotovic, F (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Int Relat & Diplomacy Dag Hammarskjold, Zagreb 242, Ilica, Croatia.",filip.kokotovic@hotmail.com; petar.kurecic@unin.hr; dcingula@esd-conference.com,"Cingula, Domagoj/GZL-5400-2022; Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,101,111,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500012,0

Obtaining customers' trust is therefore imperative to cultivating and nurturing long-lasting and profitable customer-firm relationships in online environments. Surprisingly however, there is currently a dearth of research on the effects of trust on customers' acceptance of e-commerce in Africa. This paper investigates the effects of the components of institutional trust on perceptions of ease of use and usefulness, as well as attitudes towards use on customers' intentions to use Internet banking services. An integrated research model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was built and empirically tested using data obtained from 390 retail banking customers in South Africa. The results show that the proposed model possesses high explanatory capabilities as it could explain 61 per cent of the variance in Internet banking use intentions. The study results further show that situational normality is neither a salient determinant of customers' attitudes towards use of internet banking nor their use intention, whereas structural assurance is. By examining the effects of institutional trust on the TAM's variables, especially in a developing African country, this study does not only provide insights for managers in their efforts to achieve rapid adoption of Internet banking, but also contributes to the literature on the topic.","[Maduku, Daniel K.] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Management, Dept Mkt Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Maduku, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Fac Management, Dept Mkt Management, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Maduku, Daniel K/AAM-7545-2021","Maduku, Daniel K/0000-0002-6651-3461",,,,,87,16,21,1,36,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Estimation of the impact of the exogenous variables (cash conversion cycle, average payment period, inventory conversion period and average conversion period) on firm performance (endogenous variable) was based on the econometric technique of the Ordinary Least Squares. The study produced evidence of significant positive impact of cash conversion cycle, average payment period, and inventory conversion period on firm performance. There is also evidence of nonsignificant negative impact of average conversion period on the performance of the selected firms. Parameter estimates were obtained at 10 per cent level of significance.

Our research position is that since MSBs are widely perceived as the future of emerging economies, it has now become foundational for the aspiring MSB to rapidly invest in the digitally-enabled virtual marketplace since it offers a great marketing opportunity for the firm. A battery of quantitative techniques yielded four key drivers of eMarketplace uptake among MSBs in the study area. The current study has offered some insight on how best to possibly improve the uptake of eMarketplace by MSBs particularly in the SSA context.

Across the Muslim and Arab world, important initiatives and policies make citizens and young people exposed to the world of business or entrepreneurship in different areas or disciplines. In the educational sector, a number of public and private universities and colleges in these countries have recently been engaged in offering entrepreneurship courses, training and offer facilities with the aim of attracting the attention and attendance of particularly people and graduates with innovative business ideas. Despite that entrepreneurship is for exploiting the intelligence and potentialities of male and female individuals, relevant educational courses and programs do emphasize the great importance of teamwork. The weight given to teamwork assignments very much expresses this importance, and business and entrepreneurship syllabuses and course grading systems usually stipulate that very clearly. This paper aims at exploring the orientation of King Fahd University (Kfupm) students towards the kind of business endeavors using end-of-semesters projects carried out during the period between 2004 and 2014 at the undergraduate level. Key findings are that Kfupm students collectively lean more towards services activities than industrial production ones, while by contracts, inventive and high-tech projects are very few. This suggests that the macro-economic prevailing context does matter, as trade has long been the dominant economic activity in Saudi Arabia. An important implication for decision-makers and educators is to find ways of enhancing innovation-based entrepreneurship education and training more effectively.","[Oukil, M-Said] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Management & Mkt, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Oukil, MS (通讯作者)，King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Management & Mkt, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.",Oukil@kfupm.edu.sa,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,69,76,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_7,0.0,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900007,0

First, we analyze the current environment of these organizations and the problems, and define the development goal of them, then we bring up solutions according to the goals, that is, integrating resources based on the existing community grid management system, with the cultivation of professional social workers, establishing micro societies of persons with disabilities and social support networks with persons with disabilities as the principal part, so as to solve the problems of social capital shortage of persons with disabilities, and their lack of care after disintegration of unit system and the government withdrawal from specific social services, thus to empower persons with disabilities and social organizations of them.

It examines and identifies attributes of perceived customer value in terms of benefits and sacrifices by applying a multi-attribute model. Customer value concept used in the research was defined and measured in terms of functional and affective dimensions. The perception of selected customer value attributes was measured as customer satisfaction, i.e. as a result of a congruence between the perceived and evaluated reality (benefits and sacrifices offered by on-line shopping), and customer expectations. The attributes evaluated the best were those that contributed to customer satisfaction the most and thus represented important attributes of customer value dimensions. In total, 25 attributes considered to be important for on-line shopping were selected for the questionnaire and explored further in the primary research. A principal components analysis and orthogonal Varimax rotation were used in the analysis to obtain factors that respondents considered to be attributes of the perceived customer value for shopping clothes on-line. The factor analysis identified six dimensions of perceived customer value toward shopping clothes on-line: three factors (web site appearance, shipping and product presentation) are functional and can be attributed to the benefits that customers expect to get when shopping clothes on-line, the other three extracted factors (annoyance, assurance and trust) are affective and risk related ones, and can be labelled as attributes of sacrifice. The number of identified customer value attributes perceived differently by on-line shoppers according to their gender, age, education and shopping behaviour was very low. This means that clothing online market is rather homogenous. The future research will show whether the identified differences will form the base for customer segmentation of the Czech clothing on-line market.","[Simova, Jozefina; Cinkanova, L'ubica] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Simová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Liberec, Czech Republic.",jozefina.simova@tul.cz; lubica.cinkanova@tul.cz,,"Simova, Jozefina/0000-0003-0809-8180",project SGS Factors defining satisfaction and loyalty of online shopping customers,project SGS Factors defining satisfaction and loyalty of online shopping customers,The paper was written under the support of the project SGS Factors defining satisfaction and loyalty of online shopping customers.,,29,6,7,1,26,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Based on the notions of spatial coordination challenges and Penrosean growth constraints, I argue that foreign entries tend to have a subnational scope, causing ownership mode choices to be more sensitive to target-region cultural variation than to target-country cultural variation. Accordingly, I hypothesize that target-region cultural varation has a more positive effect on the chance of JV selection than target-country cultural variation. I also hypothesize that this will be especially so for initially relatively large subsidiaries and subsidiaries established through acquisitions. An analysis of 170 entries by Dutch firms into 90 regions in 35 countries lends support to my hypotheses and indicates that the dominant effect of subnational cultural variation is not absolute but is confined to subsidiaries with specific establishment characteristics.","[Slangen, Arjen H.

Methodology that is used in this paper is mostly analytical and comparative in nature, based on observed research papers and knowledge of globally recognized authors (among others Madura and Fox). This paper deals with process of choosing relevant source for forecasting exchange rate and description of risk assessments of forecasting methods. Basic concepts of forecasting of exchange rate are presented as well as risks on side of Multinational Corporations related to exchange rate variation and exchange rate management. In addition, there is described very close relation between decision of management for investments, loans, hedging, budgeting on short and long run on one side and further measuring of specific risk exposure of Multinational corporations. Also, in paper are displayed systems for risk measurement which are highly important for resolving this specific risk issue. As most of economics literature states, long term and short term forecasting should be performed with different analyzing techniques with usage of different models and moreover long term forecasting is not reliable for decision making processes. Results of paper are summarized in conclusion and represents observation remarks on challenges that Multinational Corporation deals with when considering necessity of forecasting exchange rate. Downsides, strategy enablers and alternatives to traditional forecasting of exchange rates have key role in further determination of decision-making process.

The data are collected from a survey that was conducted in tertiary education institutions that provide PA or other relevant graduate and/or postgraduate study program in the countries. The core difference between the experiences of Latvia and Lithuania lays in study programs supply. Tertiary education institutions of Lithuania provide graduate PA study programs as well as postgraduate ones, while there are only Master's programs available in Latvia. Respondents from both countries highlight as an important factor organisation's employer brand and its social responsibility considering an employer. The most important areas that PA organisations need to pay attention is in for attracting and retaining employees are working environment and advancement/learning opportunities thus developing job advertisements.

While Bowen, Newenham-Kahindi and Herremans (2010) have found that community engagement strategies fall into the transactional, transitional and transformational categories, more research is needed. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with CSR practitioners, community beneficiaries and external experts across three companies from different sectors and geographically-associated South African communities. Barriers to and enablers of transformational community engagement are identified and compared with points made in the literature. Prominent barriers identified include community expectation; the internal capacity of the company to engage properly with communities; and, according to a new finding in the literature, community educational levels. The most prominent enabler of engagement was relationship-building. Companies with dedicated CSR practitioners are able to engage more in the community. Regulatory dynamics are found to largely determine the differences across sectors. But there is the risk that engagement is symbolic rather than substantive. Eleven higher-order antecedents to transformational community engagement are then identified. A newly developed firm-oriented decision-making model is proposed for moderating these antecedents. The findings in the community and national context provide granular insight into an African operating environment.","[Stirling, Lauren; Wilson-Prangley, Anthony; Hamilton, Gillian; Olivier, Johan] Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Stirling, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,43,4,10,0,11,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This study aims to evaluate the economic burden and cost effectiveness analysis of four Psoriasis treatment modalities in Malaysian public hospitals. This is a prospective cohort study involving a total of 523 moderate to severe psoriasis patients (Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)> 10 and/or Body Surface Area (BSA)>10 and/or Dermatology Life Quality Life (DLQI)>10) recruited from five public hospitals in Malaysia via consecutive sampling technique. The duration of the data collection is 12 months (6 months recruitment and 6 months follow up). Inclusion criteria include new or existing moderate to severe psoriasis patients who started with new treatment modalities at the time of the recruitment period, Malaysians, aged 18 years and above and who are willing to participate. The costs are calculated from the societal perspective. Provider costs are calculated by estimating recurrent costs (emolument, consumables, utility, maintenance and training) and direct costs (drugs, laboratory investigation, procedural examination). Patient costs components are direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include treatment cost (traditional medicines), out of pocket expenses (over the counter drugs, skin supplements and products). Indirect costs covers transportation and loss of productivity. Economic burden is measured by multiplying the total cost with the prevalence of psoriasis. Effectiveness of the treatment modalities is assessed based on PASI, BSA and DLQI scores (outcomes).

The latter should be proved by the reasonable analysis. This paper aims to identify the comparative level of the development of Latvian corporate bond market in the global perspective. Numerous researchers have analysed the development of a bond market of a country. The existing academic studies on the topic can be divided into 2 groups: descriptive factor analyses and comparative factor analyses. Comparative factor analyses identify the main dimension of the influencing factors and suggest the metrics to evaluate the bond market development. This paper uses the comparative framework developed by The World Bank (2004). The paper reveals that while there is a progress in the areas of stability of Latvian bond market and efficiency (the significant improvement in the bid-ask spreads is revealed despite still comparatively lower issued amounts outstanding), the problematic areas remain size and access: the amount of domestic issues and amount of domestic corporate issues make Latvia lagging. The paper argues that the opaque methodology and insufficient number of ratios in efficiency and stability groups bring the need for further development of the model.","[Tocelovska, Natalja] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Tocelovska, N (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",natalja.tocelovska@sseriga.edu,"Tocelovska, Natalja/HZK-0053-2023","Tocelovska, Natalja/0000-0002-1235-6579",,,,,12,2,2,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,845,857,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200072,0

It was found out that public administration bodies play a crucial role when preparing brownfields regeneration projects, coordinating the efforts of individual stakeholders and mediating individual interest among various parties involved. In the first part of the paper theoretical concepts related to the regeneration of brownfields are discussed, while the second part deals with comparison of selected brownfields.

Qualitative models use just three values: Positive/Increasing, Zero/Constant and Negative/Decreasing. Such quantifiers of trends are the least information intensive. Qualitative models can be useful, since models of online trust include such variables as e.g. Perceived website quality and ease of use (SIT) or Company's positive reputation (REP) that are sometimes difficult or costly to quantify. Hence, a significant fraction of available information about online trust is not of numerical nature, e.g. if SIT is decreasing then online trust is decreasing as well. Such equationless relations are studied in this paper. The model has 13 variables and 32 pair-wise interrelations among them. The set of variables and interrelations was established based on discussions with experts and internet users. The model is solved and 23 solutions, i.e. scenarios are obtained (thus, we reduce a vast set of all imaginable scenarios concerning online trust to a manageable list of scenarios). All qualitative states, and the first and second qualitative derivatives of all variables are specified for each scenario. Many modifications, upgrades and extensions of the present model are easy within the methodological framework introduced in the paper. Qualitative modeling can be seen as one of the uncertainty calculi, such as fuzzy sets and rough sets, that can be helpful e.g. under information shortage (for example when new website is about to be launched and/or when novel, subjective or difficult to measure variables are considered). The paper is self-contained and no a priori knowledge of qualitative modeling is required on the reader's part.","[Vesely, Stepan; Dohnal, Mirko] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Vesely, S (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",stepan.vesely@seznam.cz; dohnal@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Dohnal, Mirko/E-5778-2016","Dohnal, Mirko/0000-0001-9307-9528",,,,,56,5,5,0,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The activity of collecting and selling recyclables presents virtually no barriers to entry, making it a viable option. Very little research focusing on street-waste pickers has been undertaken, and, when it has been conducted, it has mostly taken the form of case studies. This paper reports the results of the first countrywide research into the potential barriers that prevent street-waste pickers from improving their socio-economic circumstances. The study used a mixed-method approach. Structured interviews were conducted between April 2011 and June 2012 with 914 street-waste pickers and 69 buy-back centres in 13 major cities across all nine provinces in South Africa. Low levels of schooling, limited language proficiency, uncertain and low levels of income, as well as limited access to basic social needs make it difficult for waste pickers to move upwards in the hierarchy of the informal economy. The unique set of socio-economic circumstances in which street-waste pickers operate in the various cities and towns in South Africa make the design of any possible policy interventions a complex one. Policymakers will have to take note of the interdependence of the barriers identified in this research. Failing to do so may cause policies that are aimed at supporting street-waste pickers to achieve the exact opposite, and, ironically, deprive these pickers of their livelihood.","[Viljoen, Kotie] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Blaauw, Phillip] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Schenck, Rinie] Univ Western Cape, Dept Social Work, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; North West University - South Africa; University of the Western Cape,"Viljoen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"Schenck, Catherina J/O-9605-2014","Viljoen, Jacoba/0000-0001-6087-9684; Blaauw, Derick/0000-0001-8750-4946",,,,,44,17,22,1,14,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The aim of this paper is to conduct an analysis of the relationship between investments in innovation-related intangibles, i.e. R&D and patents, and a biotechnology firm's market value. A sample consists of ten biotech firms listed on the New Connect market. This study utilizes the panel dataset over a 3-year period to run empirical analyses using a fixed effects model.

In the chapter are identified the results of development changes and economic growth by applying shift-share analysis. The chapter shows that the consideration of national share, industrial mix, and regional share in total shift-share employment growth of the regions indicate a strong process of deindustrialization. An allocative component of regional economic growth has a positive value reflecting above-average industrial productivity. Comparative analysis of the regional industrial territorial concentration is based on location quotient.

Maintenance of track sections is then decided based on long-term planning for an extended track life and on short-term scheduling, combining maintenance tasks, to reduce the number of track possessions. In the particular case of track geometry correction (TGC), which requires moving costly heavy equipment and specialized crews working over-night, a large outlay is involved as well as relevant track possession costs. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has yet addressed a combined tactical and operational analysis over the determinant logistics issue involved in the problem. In this sense, we propose a method to plan and schedule the heavy maintenance interventions for TGC, where both travel costs and number of workdays spent on track are minimized, ensuring at the same time, an adequate quality for the track. The method follows a Decision Rules Model (DRM) which is able to provide planning/scheduling solutions by following a set of rules used in maintenance practice. A resolution algorithm that reproduces the optimal solving is developed, whose formulation was established previously. The DRM is able to reach solutions for annual periods with significant reductions in the unit maintenance cost. The method is best applied in the consideration of regular work intensities and, observing a real case of a 300 km double track line, it was possible to conclude that the problem can be reduced to the determination of the frequency of the number of traverses of the complete line (required for maintenance) that ensures the minimum maintenance cost for a given temporal horizon.

To increase the quality of service and customer satisfaction, it is important to measure how the service provided is perceived and to determine customers' expectations and demands. In 2009, the Turkish Republic State Railways (known as TCDD in Turkey), which provide railway transportation services in Turkey, started High Speed Train (HST) transportation services. HSTs are comfortable and technologically modern transportation vehicles that attract both current and potential customers. Since 2009, efforts have been made to expand HST services to other cities. The current HST service between the cities of Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey can be used as a model to evaluate customer satisfaction and quality of service during the development of additional HST services between other cities. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to create a mathematical model to determine which areas of service influenced customers' views and satisfaction regarding HST services in Turkey and the magnitude of contribution of these factors to overall satisfaction. Thus, factor analysis was conducted to determine the relevant factors affecting satisfaction with HST services. A mathematical model was then created with the help of factor scores. As residual outliers were found during the creation of the model in both the x and y directions, certain bounded influence estimators resistant to outliers in both directions were proposed for the estimation of model parameters. The mathematical models established in this study enabled the analysis of the influence of advertisements and information services, food service, physical conditions, the attitudes and behavior of personnel on customers' overall satisfaction with HST services.

Second, the nonparametric part of the model relaxes the standard assumptions of linearity and additivity regarding the effect of R&D and human capital. Finally, the assumption of homogeneity in the effects of R&D and human capital is also relaxed by explicitly accounting for the differences between developed and lagging regions.

According to the Peltzman offsetting effect theory, seat belt laws make drivers feel more secure and drive more aggressively, which could cause additional crashes and fatalities. A set of panel data containing 50 US states and the District of Columbia for the years from 1983 to 1997 are analyzed using such panel data techniques as fixed effects and instrument variables. Fixed effects consider both dimensions of states and time while instruments variables are proposed to reduce the endogeneity problem. Most data were collected as part of a previous research project. The fatality rate of non-occupants, which refer to pedestrians and cyclists on the road rather than drivers and passengers in the vehicle, is chosen as the dependent variable. The Peltzman effects are identified especially in the situation when the primary enforcement is directly introduced to a state. Moreover, sensitivity analyzes on seat belt laws and seat belt usage are conducted to check the robustness of the results on Peltzman effects. Furthermore, the dynamics of Peltzman effects is examined by constructing variables that represent the amount of time seat belt laws have been implemented in a state. The Peltzman effects are found to fade away over time, which could be a reason many previous studies failed to identify the Peltzman offsetting effects caused by seat belt laws.

A potential solution for this problem is to offer paid, high-quality parking facilities close to the train platforms and free but lower-quality parking further away. Since free parking is currently also offered close to the platforms, the question arises of how the proposed solution would affect cycling as an access and egress mode for train travel. To answer this question, the bicycle parking preferences of train travellers were examined in this paper by reporting the results of a stated choice experiment (n = 866) conducted in Delft. In this experiment, respondents chose between paid and free parking alternatives, that varied in costs, walking time to platform and the type of surveillance. To explore the effects of paid bicycle parking on the demand for bicycle parking, two base alternatives were added to each choice set, that is 'other mode' and 'use another station'. Based on the observed choices in this experiment, a four-class Latent Class Model (LCM) was estimated that provides insight in the heterogeneity of the bicycle parking preferences of train travellers. The classes are labelled as 'free facility lovers', 'cost sensitive cyclists', 'time sensitive cyclists', and 'paid facility lovers'. The estimated model was used to predict choice behaviour under various implementations of the new pricing policy. The results indicate that only a small proportion of the train travellers will stop cycling to and from the station. Of these, the vast majority would rather walk and a fair share would use public transport. Only a very small number would travel to the station by car. The results suggest that paid bicycle parking is a feasible solution by which to distribute scarce parking capacity at major railway stations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The ICT application areas are: mobile telephony, internet usage or provision, and other ICT related products and services. The main modelling and forecasting approaches are diffusion modelling and forecasting, time series forecasting and technological forecasting, and this review devotes a section to each of these approaches. Most of the research activity in the field (measured by numbers of papers) has occurred in the modelling of diffusion in la, particularly mobile telephony, producing beneficial cross-fertilisation between forecasting and ICT applications; examples are multi-generational modelling and choice modelling. Although call centre manpower planning has led to innovative forecasting models, other analyses of clusters of ICT time series data sets have been less innovative. Technological forecasting papers tend to be exercises based on expert opinion. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our methodology includes a statistical analysis of new vehicle registration data from calendar year 2013 to test the relationship between PHEV and BEV market shares against statewide variables. Several of the factors that existing studies find to be important in earlier HEV markets are also correlated with 2013 PHEV or BEV market shares. We also find different sets of variables to be significantly correlated with PHEV and BEV market shares, respectively, which suggests that these markets are distinct. The differences between the factors that are correlated with PHEV and BEV market shares highlight the possibility that strategies for promoting the overall adoption of plug-in vehicles may not affect the two vehicle types equally. However, further analysis should be undertaken prior to developing policies and approaches based on these findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Following this approach, we firstly hypothesize that firms with intangible resources will establish direct export channels to better exploit, protect and develop their firm-specific resources. Secondly, we propose that firms that establish their export channel on the basis of their internal resources outperform those firms that do not. To obtain empirical evidence we used a Heckman two-step model for the DOC Rioja wine industry. The results confirm that firms improve their export performance when jointly considering internal resources and the export channel. Also, human resources are the most relevant intangible resources in our model. This paper contributes by offering empirical evidence on the exporting channel strategies chosen by Spanish wineries. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by examining the performance consequences of following the RBV approach. Likewise, it has important practical implications for managers, who can improve their firm's export performance by assessing their internal resources before considering which export channel to choose.","[Fernandez-Olmos, Marta] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Diez-Vial, Isabel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Business Adm, Madrid 28223, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Complutense University of Madrid,"Fernández-Olmos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",maferno@unizar.es; diezvial@ccee.ucm.es,"Diez-Vial, Isabel/ABF-9207-2020","Fernandez Olmos, Marta/0000-0002-5623-2391","Ministry of Science and Innovation, National R&D Plan - Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Plan Nacional de I + D + i [ECO2009-09623, ECO2011-29445]; CREVALOR group from University of Zaragoza; Complutense University of Madrid [CR35/10-A UCM]","Ministry of Science and Innovation, National R&D Plan - Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Plan Nacional de I + D + i; CREVALOR group from University of Zaragoza; Complutense University of Madrid","This project has been supported by the ECO2009-09623 and ECO2011-29445 projects (Ministry of Science and Innovation, National R&D Plan - Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Plan Nacional de I + D + i), the CREVALOR group from University of Zaragoza and CR35/10-A UCM from Complutense University of Madrid.",,103,14,15,0,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Having the residents of the four counties involved as the target, this paper aims to identify the level of electronic service use resulting from the implementation of the ALO Digital Project. A questionnaire was administered and the results of a regression analysis demonstrate that the project is still at low level of online service sophistication. Additionally, despite users' overall satisfaction, implementation difficulties were noticed. In practical terms, this reveals a type of service more related to information consultation, downloading and printing documentation, and supports the premise that a change of focus and direction of local e-government is needed to substantially improve the life of the individual citizen.","[Ferreira, Neuza C.

The results indicate that successful models of recession condition on different economic indicators at different forecast horizons. Predictors that describe real economic activity provide the clearest signal of recession at very short horizons.

The plans cover 12 years each. The test of a swing voter model, combined with variables relevant to the Keynesian model of demand side policies, supports the proposition that there is less investment in municipalities with highly partisan electorates. The model seems to work better for road than for rail investments. Municipalities with a high density of voters at the ideological cut-point (middle of the ideological distribution) got more investment in the 2010 plan but not in the other plans. The impact of the elasticity of output on public service provision raised investment in road projects in sub-plan period 1 compared to later sub-plan periods. The tax elasticity of output may influence the volume of investment downward. The Plan for 2010-2021 seems to be the most politically determined of the plans considered here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, experimental research shows that in the laboratory subjects routinely make suboptimal decisions in contests even to the extent of making negative returns. The purpose of this study is to investigate how earning the endowment, demographic differences, and individual preferences impact behavior in contests. To this end, we conduct a laboratory experiment in which subjects expend costly resources (bids) to attain an award (prize). In line with other laboratory studies of contests, our results show that subjects overbid relative to theoretical predictions and incur substantial losses as a result. Making subjects earn their initial resource endowments mitigates overbidding and thus increases efficiency. Overbidding is linked to gender, with women bidding higher than men and having lower average earnings. Other demographic information, such as religiosity, and individual preferences, such as preferences toward winning and risk, also influence behavior in contests.","[Price, Curtis R.] Univ So Indiana, Romain Coll Business, Dept Econ & Mkt, 8600 Univ Blvd, Evansville, IN 47712 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University Southern Indiana; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Price, CR (通讯作者)，Univ So Indiana, Romain Coll Business, Dept Econ & Mkt, 8600 Univ Blvd, Evansville, IN 47712 USA.",crprice1@usi.edu; rms246@case.edu,,,University of Southern Indiana,University of Southern Indiana,"We thank two anonymous referees and a coeditor for valuable suggestions, as well as Tim Cason, James Choi, Larry Iannaccone, Will Masters, David Ong, Wafa Orman, Jared Rubin, seminar participants at Purdue University, Chapman University, University of Southern Indiana and participants at the Economic Science Association conference in Tucson.

Gregory",,,MAXIMIZING THE US POSTAL SERVICE'S PROFITS FROM COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CROSS-SUBSIDY; SHAPLEY VALUE; GAME THEORY; FRAND; COSTS,"The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) regulates the pricing of the U.S. Postal Service's products, including products not protected by the Postal Service's statutory monopolies that the enterprise sells in competition with the products of private firms. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 created new requirements for the PRC's pricing regulation of competitive products. I evaluate the economic implications of the PAEA's three primary requirements with respect to the Postal Service's pricing of competitive products: preventing cross subsidy of competitive products by monopoly products, ensuring that competitive products cover their attributable costs, and allocating to competitive products an appropriate share of the Postal Service's common costs (known as institutional costs in postal regulatory jargon). The first has a relatively straightforward economic interpretation: the PRC can use either the incremental cost test or the standalone cost test to detect cross subsidy, subject to some nuances when the Postal Service does not break even. To ensure that the Postal Service's competitive products meet the PAEA's attributable-cost requirement, the PRC can apply an incremental cost test using Shapley values. Given the evolution of the Postal Service's network to support competitive products, the PRC should use incremental costs that are neutral with respect to the order in which the Postal Service has introduced its product lines. Next, I explain that the appropriate share of institutional costs for the Postal Service to recover from competitive products depends on understanding in precise economic terms the alternative rationales for empowering the PRC to regulate the Postal Service's competitive products. I identify and analyze the implications of three possible rationales: (1) ensuring that the Postal Service fulfills its essential mandate to deliver monopoly (market-dominant) mail services, (2) ensuring that the Postal Service fulfills its fiduciary duty to taxpayers as a state-owned enterprise, and (3) preserving competitive parity in markets in which the Postal Service competes with private firms. I find that those goals indicate that the optimal allocation of institutional costs to competitive products would maximize the Postal Service's profit from its sale of competitive products-thereby enabling revenues from competitive products to cover as much of the Postal Service's overhead as possible. I review how a multiproduct firm maximizes profits using Ramsey prices. I then propose a simple shortcut by which the PRC could approximate those prices for its competitive products with limited information and at relatively low administrative cost. By gradually increasing the share of institutional costs that competitive products must bear, the PRC can identify the profit-maximizing price for competitive products and thus iterate toward the precise allocation of institutional costs that maximizes the profits that the Postal Service earns from its offerings of competitive products. Finally, I show how the Postal Service's Board of Governors could obviate the PRC's intervention by independently implementing profit-maximizing prices for competitive products and why, in the absence of other remedies, Congress should enact legislation to ensure that the Postal Service maximizes the profits that it earns from its competitive products.","Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Sidak, JG (通讯作者)，Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",jgsidak@criterioneconomics.com,,,,,,,64,3,3,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The prominent features of the French transit are presented. First, we describe the complex and opaque bidding process which is for the entire network. Then we evoke a payroll tax especially devoted to the transit and underline the fact that the system is heavily subsidised. As competing for the entire network might find its rationale in the scale and scope economies, we test some very simple models devoted to this issue. We found no evidence of economies of scale for bus networks. This, given the funding crisis of transit authorities, leads us to recommend a gradual reform of French transit competitive tendering process. This reform should lead to a slowdown in the upward trend of transit employee's salaries. Some smaller parts of the networks would be submitted to bidding processes. The contracts might be improved as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a theoretical model to examine the conditions under which a multi-facility firm chooses to employ a standardized adoption policy for a voluntary program. We test this model empirically using a firm-level dataset on the adoption of a voluntary environmental auditing program and find that, consistent with the theoretical model, a standardized auditing outcome is less likely among firms with more heterogeneous portfolios of facilities. We also examine the effect of environmental auditing on facility compliance using both firm-level and facility-level controls. We find that the estimated effect depends on whether or not measures that proxy for firm incentives for standardization are included in the analysis. These findings suggest caution in drawing conclusions on the effectiveness of voluntary programs in improving compliance based on analyses that assume standardization on the part of the firm.

The present paper contributes to this literature and investigates whether financial market regulation follows a regulative cycle: does regulation, and consequently investor protection, increase as a result of a stock market downturn [as argued by, e.g., Zingales (J Account Res 47(2): 391-425, 2009)] or-contrary to the regulative cycle hypothesis-as a result of an upswing [as claimed by Povel et al. (Rev Financ Stud 20(4): 1219-1254, 2007), or Hertzberg 2003] Following Jackson and Roe (J Financ Econ 93(2): 207-238, 2009), we use funding data on the world's most important financial market regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as a proxy for the politically desired degree of regulation. We apply time series analysis. Using more than 60 years of data, we show that the SEC's funding follows a regulative cycle: A weak stock market results in increased resources for the SEC. A strong stock market results in reduced resources. Our findings underline the downside of regulation as the regulative cycle amplifies the technical procyclicality inherent in regulation.","[Lohse, Tim] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, D-10315 Berlin, Germany; [Lohse, Tim] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Thomann, Christian] Royal Inst Technol KTH, CESIS, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Thomann, Christian] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Risk & Insurance, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Thomann, Christian] Minist Finance, Stockholm, Sweden",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Max Planck Society; Royal Institute of Technology; Leibniz University Hannover,"Thomann, C (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol KTH, CESIS, Lindstedtsvagen 30, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",Tim.Lohse@hwr-berlin.de; thomann@kth.se,,,,,,,38,7,7,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Based on the the space syntax methodological framework we analysed the metric and topological access between individual streets. The results obtained show an association between residential pattern changes and the relative access of individual streets to the core area of the Arab's community (at the local and the global level) and discontinuity of street networks. The results clearly indicate that topological accessibility (i.e. topological distance between axial lines) is more significant in determining the dynamics of minority-majority residential pattern than is metric distance. The findings thus support the notion that a city's spatial configuration provides essential conditions for urban ethnic dynamics and the evolution of minority groups' residential patterns. Hence, this factor might be essential for policy making regarding minority-majority residential segregation.","[Goldblatt, Ran; Omer, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geog & Human Environm, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Goldblatt, R (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geog & Human Environm, POB 39040, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel.",ranrang@gmail.com; omery@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,51,2,3,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We argue that most fundamentals-based political science forecasts overstate what historical political and economic factors can tell us about the probable outcome of a forthcoming presidential election. Existing approaches generally overlook the uncertainty in coefficient estimates, decisions about model specifications, and the translation from popular vote shares to Electoral College outcomes. We introduce a Bayesian forecasting model for state-level presidential elections that accounts for each of these sources of error, and allows for the inclusion of structural predictors at both the national and state levels. Applying the model to presidential election data from 1952 to 2012, we demonstrate that, for covariates with typical levels of predictive power, the 95% prediction intervals for presidential vote shares should span approximately +/- 10% at the state level and +/- 7% at the national level.

Our empirical findings show that an increase in immigration does not affect crime victimization, but it is associated with an increase in the fear of crime, the latter being consistently and positively correlated with the natives' unfavourable attitude toward immigrants.

I show that, depending on the value of the firm's potential growth opportunities and the CEO's concern about being fired, the CEO is either tempted to overinvest in risky ideas (excessive risk-taking) or underinvest in risky ideas (excessive conservatism). The optimal pay package consists of stock options, to encourage the discovery of innovative ideas, and either restricted stock, to combat excessive risk-taking, or severance pay, to combat excessive conservatism. The model provides new empirical predictions relating executive pay arrangements to the importance of innovation and career concerns and analyzes how the change in the economic environment caused by the current financial crisis might change the optimal mix of stock options, restricted stock, and severance pay.","Univ Texas Austin, Dept Accounting, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Laux, V (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Accounting, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",volker.laux@mccombs.utexas.edu,"laux, volker/C-5230-2017",,,,,,37,23,30,4,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

J,"Sgard, J",,,,"Sgard, Jerome",,,Global economic governance during the middle ages: The jurisdiction of the champagne fairs,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HISTORY,"This article reviews the history literature on the Champagne fairs and argues that their unique success rested on the close approximation of a limited-access, extra-territorial jurisdiction, with a de facto global (cross-jurisdictional) reach: contracts and judgments issued at the Fairs were expected to be enforceable across Europe, via a mix of agreements and power struggles with distant, municipal or territorial authorities. The threat of reprisals worked merely as a reflection of (i) the geopolitical leverage of the French King, and (ii) the specific market power first accumulated by the Fairs, and then lost. The paper argues however that with no substantial local community of merchants in Champagne, Greifs (2006) model of inter-city mutual dissuasion and reprisals may not apply to this experience. Guarantees against extortion had to be bargained over by the merchants with the Fairs' feudal rulers. An equilibrium-based analytical framework is thus proposed, that accounts for the development, growth and eventual demise of the Fairs. Insolvency, rather than pure moral hazard, is used as the reference case for market indiscipline, calling for formal interaction between jurisdictions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

For instance, if marijuana is a complement to hard drugs, then these laws would increase the usage not only of marijuana but also of hard drugs. In this paper I study empirically the effects of medical marijuana laws by analyzing data on drug arrests and treatment admissions. I find that medical marijuana laws increase these proxies for marijuana consumption by around 10-15 percent. However, there is no evidence that cocaine and heroin usage increases. From the arrest data, the estimates indicate a 0-15 percent decrease in possession arrests for cocaine and heroin combined. From the treatment data, the estimates show a 20 percent decrease in admissions for heroin-related treatment, although there is no significant effect for cocaine-related treatment. These results suggest that marijuana may be a substitute for heroin, but it is not strongly correlated with cocaine.I believe marijuana should be illegal in our country.

The results confirm Becker's deterrence hypothesis. Moreover, crowding out of pro-social behavior occurs due to deterrence incentives: when deterrence incentives first exist and are removed later on, subsequent behavior is more selfish than without this deterrence history. This study offers evidence that (part of this) crowding out takes place via change of emotions. Without deterrence incentives in place, in a variant of the dictator game, players with pro-social emotions steal less. When players face expected punishment, pro-social emotions are deactivated and do not decrease stealing; in this case, self-centered emotions get activated and motivate greater stealing.

Jacobs acquired fame for The Death and Life of Great American Cities in which she challenged the prevailing orthodoxy of the urban planning profession.

In spite of the passage of this regulation, some investors continue to meet privately with executives. Using a unique set of proprietary records of all one-on-one meetings between senior management and investors for a New York Stock Exchange-traded firm, we investigate the impact of private meetings on investor decisions. We find that when investors meet privately with management they make more informed trading decisions. This improvement in trading is concentrated in hedge funds, but is not present for investment advisors or pension funds.

Over this period, the model has called many crashes, but not all. Those called have had high interest rates in long term bonds relative to the trailing earnings to price ratio. In general, there will almost always be a crash if the model is in the danger zone. The model predicted the crashes in China, Iceland and the US in the 2006-09 period. Iceland had a drop of fully 95%. For the US, the call was on June 14, 2007, and the stock market fell 56.8%. A longer-term study for the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, and the UK shows that, over long periods, being in the stock market when the bond-stock signal is not in the danger zone, and in cash when it is in the danger zone, provides a final wealth which is about double that of a buy and hold strategy for each of these five countries. The best use of the model is for predicting crashes. Finally, we compare Shiller's high PE ratio crash model to the BSEYD model for the US market from 1962-2012. While both models add value, the BSEYD model predicts crashes better. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We validate our measure in the context of earnings announcements and provide evidence of its greater applicability, relative to a number of previously used proxies, such as the change in dispersion, Kandel and Pearson's (1995) metric, abnormal volume and the bid-ask spread. We find that the new measure of differential interpretation is related positively to other commonly used proxies, namely trading volume, disclosure informativeness, and the cost of capital, and is related negatively to disclosure readability and management guidance precision.

Its economic rationale is explained as the consequences of either exogenous or endogenous anticompetitive forces present in different industries. In this paper, we use a dynamic oligopolistic industry model and show that rivalry restraint emerges as equilibrium behavior among firm owners who delegate decisions to managers. In the corresponding two-stage game, managers choose optimal production rates in a dynamic Cournot market and owners set incentives for managers, acting sequentially rational. Equilibrium incentives correspond to rivalry restraint, that is, managers are less aggressive in the product market with lower outputs and increasing profits for all firms in the industry.","[Dockner, Engelbert J.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Loeffler, Clemens] Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Vienna,"Dockner, EJ (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Finance Accounting & Stat, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",engelbert.dockner@wu-wien.ac.at; clemens.loeffler@univie.ac.at,,"Loeffler, Clemens/0000-0002-9558-0305",,,,,44,3,3,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Where it does play a role, the type of enforcement-anti-cartel vs. other measures-seems to determine the direction of impact.

In contrast, in areas with little newspaper coverage, liberal districts tend to grant substantially larger damage awards than do conservative ones.

Farmers' responsiveness to financial and non-financial incentives to convert part of their land into forest is examined in a discrete choice experiment. Besides landowner and contract characteristics, we test the role of motivational drivers in explaining farmers' willingness to conclude afforestation agreements. These are expected to lower demand for financial compensation. We fix financial compensation levels in contractual agreements relatively low compared to opportunity costs, but comparable to what farmers currently receive for nature conservation measures. Although we find substantial demand for afforestation agreements in both samples, Dutch and German farmers value contract conditions differently. This has important implications for the effectiveness of varying compensation levels on scheme participation rates. Farmers are willing to trade-off financial compensation against non-financial terms and conditions. However, having a positive environmental disposition towards wildlife conservation does not necessarily result in the acceptance of lower levels of financial compensation.

Several studies in the management research literature (Labianca, Moon, & Watt, 2005; Sterling, Lopez-Kidwell, Labianca, & Moon, 2013) have shown this effect. In the Labianca et al. work, the difficulties are attributed to increased cognitive load, due to the way that people are taught to tell time using analog clocks. However, in general, analog methods of presenting data improve performance rather than degrade it. A different explanation for the observed drop in performance comes from temporal dissonance (Conway & Limayem, 2010).

Comparisons of the point and density forecasts produced under the flat prior are made to those produced by the traditional (mixed estimation) Bayesian VAR' methods of Doan, Litterman and Sims, as well as to fully Bayesian Minnesota Prior' forecasts. The actual record and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the record of the alternative procedures studied in pseudo-real-time forecasting experiments, share a characteristic: subsequently realized revenues are in the lower tails of the predicted distributions too often'. An alternative empirically based prior is found by working directly on the probability distribution for the vector autoregression parametersthe goal being to discover a better-performing entropically tilted prior that minimizes out-of-sample mean squared error subject to a Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint that the new prior not differ too much' from the original. We also study the closely related topic of robust prediction appropriate for situations of ambiguity. Robust priors' are competitive in out-of-sample forecasting; despite the freedom afforded the entropically tilted prior, it does not perform better than the simple alternatives.

Our purpose is to investigate empirically the effects of offline bank perception on consumer's behavioral intentions to use internet banking and to explore the role of the dispositional resistance to change, as a narrow psychological personality trait by developing a structural equations model that used a sample of 595 Tunisian non-users of internet banking. The findings suggest that offline relationship quality enhances the perceived risk related to the internet banking and decreases the perceived usefulness of online usage.

The research shows that despite Kazakhstan's intentions to update and develop much of its infrastructure over the coming 20 years, inefficient use of resources is currently observed in every sector. It is necessary to encourage scientist and entrepreneurs to invent and commercialize new green technologies. That would be basis for successful implementation of transition from brown to green economy. Challenges and obstacles to gain this have been determined during the study. Kazakhstan will increase its GDP by few times, its industrial output as well as the size of infrastructure in approximately the next decades.

This paper aims to answer this question by examining the relationship between the loyalty to private labels and national brands and the average price paid. We utilized the UK Kantar TNS panel data and looked at purchasing of ten product categories between 2008 and 2012. The findings show that the higher the loyalty to private labels the lower the average price paid for private labels. In contrast, the more loyal consumers are to national brand the higher the average price paid for national brands.

In this study, a choice modelling experiment was conducted in Australia to estimate the marginal values for improvements in recreation facilities (trails, day and-night facilities) and historic sites in State plantation forests. The aim of the study was to examine the relative importance of historic sites as an attribute of forest recreation, and explore preference heterogeneity for various attributes of forest recreation across different forest areas and forest users. The results indicate that while there was significant preference heterogeneity for the different recreational attributes at two forest areas, there was less variation in the welfare estimates across attributes, sites and between user and non-user groups. Similar values were identified for the Heritage sites between recreational users and non-users, indicating that protection values were dominant over recreational use; yet no sub-group of the sampled population appeared to value Heritage sites in isolation from recreational assets, suggesting that respondents viewed the forests in multifunctional dimensions.

We hypothesize that individual variation in intergenerational mobility is partly attributable to regional and neighborhood conditionsmost notably access to high-quality schools. Using restricted Panel Study of Income Dynamics and census data, we find that neighborhood income has roughly half the effect on future earnings as parental income. We estimate that lifetime household income would be $635,000 dollars higher if people born into a bottom-quartile neighborhood would have been raised in a top-quartile neighborhood. When incomes are adjusted to regional purchasing power, these effects become even larger. The neighborhood effect is two-thirds as large as the parental income effect, and the lifetime earnings difference increases to $910,000. We test the robustness of these findings to various assumptions and alternative models, and replicate the basic results using aggregated metropolitan-level statistics of intergenerational income elasticities based on millions of Internal Revenue Service records.","[Rothwell, Jonathan T.] Brookings Inst, Metropolitan Policy Program, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Massey, Douglas S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Off Populat Res, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Brookings Institution; Princeton University,"Rothwell, JT (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Metropolitan Policy Program, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",jrothwell@brookings.edu; dmassey@princeton.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG029409] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD069609, P2C HD047879] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,68,38,48,1,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Thus, a tenancy agreement can be concluded either orally or in writing. As such the rights and obligations of both parties are depending on the terms and conditions of the contract entered by them. The problem would arise if both a landlord and tenant are not equal in footing in terms of bargaining power. Hence their rights either as a landlord or tenant may not be well protected. Obviously there is no specific law dealing with rent control and other related matters that lead to tenancy disputes. These include issues on security and rental deposit, quality and safety of the rented houses, termination, eviction and a mechanism for dispute settlement. While provisions on tenancies and leases can be found in the National Land Code 1965, Contracts Act 1950, Distress Act 1951 and Specific Relief Act 1950, the existing legislation remains rather vague and deals with the issue in piecemeal. The question thus arises whether a comprehensive law in a single statute is really needed to regulate landlords and tenants in Peninsular Malaysia? Adopting the qualitative research methodology, this conceptual paper will focus on the relationship between landlord and tenant in private residential tenancy. It is the aims of this paper to identify key legal issues in landlord and tenant relationship in this sector and to examine the adequacy of existing legal framework. The reported cases on landlord and tenant may become evidences as to the need of a specific landlord and tenant law in Peninsular Malaysia, in particular for private residential tenancy. The best practices from Scotland are taken as reference, whenever necessary. The findings of the research found that based on laws and practices in these two jurisdictions, it is very significant to have specific law to regulate the relationship between landlord and tenant in private residential tenancy in order to protect the interest of all parties involved.","[Sufian, Azlinor] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Legal Practice Dept, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia,"Sufian, A (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Legal Practice Dept, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia.",sazlinor@iium.edu.my,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,4071,4081,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700417,0

The main objective of the research is to examine the possibilities of measuring loyalty and satisfaction of customers in a spa company based on comparably simple data collection. The secondary objective is to point out the specific nature of providing spa services along with the factors that substantially influence the overall result of satisfaction and loyalty. The research results showed that managers and customers perceive the importance of satisfaction factors differently: customers put more stress on boarding than expected. As well as differences in levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty indices were proofed for different segments of customers. Therefore, the Czechs are in general more satisfied than Germans. Customers who come more often tend to be less satisfied. The guests, whose stay is at least partially covered by public health insurance, are more satisfied than self-paying customers.

The centrifugal and centripetal forces influencing retail locations were once the subject of serious intellectual debate. Same product retail store (SPRS) clusters, which were once common in the retail landscape of Manhattan and other Western primary cities, are now in severe decline. However, there remain modern megacities where similar retail store cluster phenomenon is resurgent. This paper attempts to examine the formation and sustainability of the SPRS clustering phenomenon illustrated by Bangkok, Thailand. The authors find 14,468 SPRS permanent retail outlets located in 299 clusters. The data were mapped and then classified according to the North American Industrial Classification System. Locational Gini coefficients were computed to permit an analysis of the city's retail clustering within and between its fifty administrative districts.","[Mandhachitara, Rujirutana] Penn State Univ, 3550 7th St Rd, New Kensington, PA 15068 USA; [Shannon, Randall] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, 69 Vipavadee Rangsit Rd, Din Daeng Bangkok 10400, Thailand",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Mahidol University,"Mandhachitara, R (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 3550 7th St Rd, New Kensington, PA 15068 USA.",Rum20@psu.edu; Randall.sha@mahidol.ac.th,,,,,,,55,1,1,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

However, there is relative dearth of empirical studies examining the impact of e-banking on performance of banks. Though e-banking is gaining acceptance in Bangladesh, impact of e-banking on bank's performance is yet to be established. This paper fills this gap. Using panel data of 13 banks over the period of 2003-2013, this study empirically investigated the impact of e-banking on the performance of Bangladeshi banks measured in terms of Return on Equity, Return on Assets and Net Interest Margin. Results from pooled ordinary least square analysis show that e-banking begins to contribute positively to banks' Return on Equity with a time lag of two years while a negative impact was found in first year of adoption. Empirical findings of this study is of greater significance for the developing countries like Bangladesh because it will invoke the attention of the bank management and policy makers to pursue such policies to expand e-banking. This study also contributes to empirical literatures by reconfirming (or otherwise) findings of previous studies.","[Siddik, Md.

Despite their theoretical promise their empirical accuracy in forecasting has not yet been assessed, either against each other or against any established approaches of forecast combination, model selection, or statistical benchmark algorithms. Also, none of the algorithms have been assessed on a representative set of empirical data, using only few synthetic time series. We remedy this omission by conducting a rigorous empirical evaluation using a representative set of 111 industry time series and a valid and reliable experimental design. We develop a full-factorial design over derived Boosting meta parameters, creating 42 novel Boosting variants, and create a further 47 novel Boosting variants using research insights from forecast combination. Experiments show that only few Boosting meta-parameters increase accuracy, while meta-parameters derived from forecast combination research outperform others.

Immigrant men in the USA, on the other hand, experience positive annual growth in all three domains relative to US-born men. This difference is largely on account of low-educated immigrant men, who experience faster or longer periods of relative growth in employment and wages in the USA than in Canada.

Still, knowledge becomes a capital (factor input) proper when employed in production. Volumes of new products sold could suggest the market value of utilised knowledge capital the same way the resale value of plant and equipment often approximates the stock of physical capital. Conversely, shares of sales of new products arguably capture an altogether different phenomenon: product-related firm transmutation. Findings suggest that the deeper utilisation of knowledge has significant productivity effects and supersedes mere mobilisation of knowledge. Further, undergoing transmutation towards the production of more of new products relative to incumbent products has no significant relationship with labour productivity. Firms should therefore prioritise the deeper exploitation of given new knowledge rather than potentially prodigal shifts in production towards new products as such.","[Mwaura, Samuel] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Mwaura, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",samuel.mwaura@strath.ac.uk,"Mwaura, Samuel/JYO-7308-2024","Mwaura, Samuel/0000-0002-7019-108X",,,,,73,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

As a result, it is impossible to apply these tests to stock markets, where lengthy time series of data are scarce. In response to this, the current paper develops a new test for predictability in panels where N is large and T >= 2 can be either small or large, or indeed anything in between. This consideration represents an advancement relative to the usual large-N and large-T requirement. The new test is also very general, especially when it comes to allowable predictors, and is easy to implement.

Endogenous worker-firm matching could also account for such wage differences. This hypothesis is tested thanks to linked employer-employee data on the French private sector between 1995 and 2011. Childbirth penalties are estimated for women and for men from hourly wage equations including firm- and worker-fixed effects on top of usual measures of human capital. Though worker-firm matching explains none of the motherhood wage penalty, it plays a role in the case of fathers who do not experience any wage loss after childbirth, but do not enjoy any premium either; there is evidence of an erosion of this premium since the end of the 1990s. In a counterfactual where women do not incur any penalty after childbirth, the gender gap still amounts to 2/3 of the one that currently prevails.","[Wilner, Lionel] CREST ENSAE, 3 Ave Pierre Larousse, F-92240 Malakoff, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Wilner, L (通讯作者)，CREST ENSAE, 3 Ave Pierre Larousse, F-92240 Malakoff, France.",lionel.wilner@ensae.fr,,,,,,,37,13,13,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Meanwhile economic reforms have created massive movements of rural workers towards urban labour markets. The co-existence of these movements with a HSR network raises the question about the impacts of the HSR on rural migrants and the livelihoods in their villages. This paper seeks to analyse these impacts from a livelihood perspective. Two main roles of transport are analysed: transport as delivering access to new economic opportunities and transport as an industry providing employment. Statistical data and fieldwork evidence in Qiya, a small village in Hunan province, show that the opening of the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR line decreased their access to places of employment both in terms of cost and time, but the HSR construction created employment opportunities for the villagers.","[Liu, Shujing; Kesteloot, Christian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Kesteloot, C (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",shujing.liu@ees.kuleuven.be; chris.kesteloot@ees.kuleuven.be,,"Kesteloot, Chris/0000-0002-4305-096X",,,,,38,14,14,38,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

De la Croix et al. (J Popul Econ 25:899-922, 2012) extended the scope of the theorem by showing that it also holds for risky lifetime. With this note, we introduce medical expenditure as a determinant of the probability of surviving to old age to prove the theorem. The original as well as all extended versions of the serendipity theorem, however, fail to prove that second-order conditions are satisfied in general. Still, unlike De la Croix et al. (J Popul Econ 25:899-922, 2012), we can exclude the existence of corner solutions where the probability of reaching old age is zero or one. The zero survival probability case becomes irrelevant if the option to randomize between death and life utility is taken into account. Survival with certainty is ruled out if the marginal cost of survival is increasing. Hence, the optimal survival probability represents an interior solution. Furthermore, we show for the optimal survival probability that the value of a statistical life is positive and equal to its marginal cost.","[Felder, Stefan] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Felder, Stefan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, CINCH, Essen, Germany",University of Basel; University of Duisburg Essen,"Felder, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.;Felder, S (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, CINCH, Essen, Germany.",stefan.felder@unibas.ch,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Three variants of the stochastic volatility are implemented in an attempt to improve the existing homoscedastic framework. Our baseline model assumes that the variance covariance matrix is driven by a set of idiosyncratic, country-specific and regional factors. In contrast, the second specification adopted implies that the error variance of each equation is determined by an independent stochastic process. The final specification assumes that the country-specific volatility follows a single factor, which leads to significant computational gains. Considering a range of competing models, we forecast a large panel of macroeconomic variables and find that the stochastic volatility influences the predictive accuracy in three ways. First, it helps to improve the overall predictive fit of our model. Second, it helps to make the model more resilient to outliers and economic crises. Finally, taking a regional stance reveals that the forecasts in developing economies tend to profit more from the use of the stochastic volatility. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters.

There is large literature describing their technical architectures or using them in various scientific contexts. Yet little attention has been paid to expectations of practitioners (planners) and to the operational use of such models. The gap between lab application and operational use for planning practice is still to be filled. We shed light on what would make them definitely accepted and more used by planners to evaluate a range of urban and transport policies. In addition to literature review and our own experience dealing with urban planning agencies, we have interviewed different types of end users in France to identify their motivations and barriers to use LUTI models. The results show demand for a far more bottom-up oriented approach: the models should consider objectives and general needs of end users to live up to their expectations. Only a closer collaboration between modelers and end users, and more efforts to integrate modeling into urban planning, will make LUTIs considered as relevant approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

From the perspective of port authorities or governments, knowing the Minimum Efficient Scale (MES) is salient, because they sometimes determine the port development or expansion based on the port capacity or the existing size of the terminal. Notwithstanding the importance of knowing the exact MES, extant literature has not managed to estimate MES in the port industry. This study aims to estimate the MES in the port industry in South Korea in order to identify whether Container Terminal Operators (CTOs) are under economies of scale, constant economies of scale or diseconomies of scale; we explore a bottom point of the average cost curve in order to suggest an adequate scale for the port industry in Korea. The finding demonstrates that undercapacity may be a strong issue in Korean container ports. However, CTOs in Busan port are in an overcapacity area given the market demand of container throughput in 2013, which is approximately 25 times larger than the estimated MES; in fact, all CTOs in Busan port operate at more than 20% of MES. This study then can provide port policy makers with a helpful tool to derive ex-ante MES level at the terminal designing stage and to adjust ex-post port investment decisions at the additional port capacity designing stage, which may contribute to avoiding overcapacity.

Focusing on it, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of riders' perceptions of BRT service implemented with limited space and capital funding. A total of 1700 SBS riders on four routes were interviewed using the survey methodology developed in this study. Statistical analysis and regression modeling were used to analyze rider socio-demographics, investigate the relationship between rider satisfaction levels, and the key factors driving them. The results show that, while most of them are transit dependent, new SBS riders are mainly attracted by better service and accessibility. Riders on different routes were found to have different socio-demographics. The statistical tests of satisfaction means provide further insight into the disparity in service evaluation between/among groups of riders (e.g. gender, experience, weather, route, trip purpose). Service frequency, speed, and on-time performance were found to have a positive influence on rider satisfaction across all routes. Variables related to off-board ticket machines and travel information are more valued than others. The effects of external factors vary according to characteristics of the routes and rider groups. This study suggests potential applications of the results for future planning and improvement to increase rider satisfaction and thereby retain and increase ridership. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply a panel regression on a sample consisting of the largest and most frequently traded joint-stock companies from four countries. The results show that the larger companies and those with higher fixed asset investments exhibit higher leverage, while the more profitable companies and those with more tangible assets use less debt financing. Other variables, such as the concentration of company ownership, the riskiness of its operating profits and the effective tax rates have not been found statistically significant. These results, supported by the robustness tests, have confirmed our expectation that the managers in these countries do not set specific target leverage ratios, but instead follow a particular order in the selection of the sources of financing. In other words, the companies behave in accordance with the pecking order theory, which is a confirmation of our initial hypothesis. The governments of these countries should put more effort on stimulating the use of other sources of financing to relieve the possible excessive company dependence on the banking sector.","[Arsov, Sasho; Naumoski, Aleksandar] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Blvd Goce Delchev 9V, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Arsov, S (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Blvd Goce Delchev 9V, Skopje, Macedonia.",sarsov@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; aleksandar@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,"Naumoski, Aleksandar/HJB-0287-2022","Naumoski, Aleksandar/0000-0002-2602-5041; Arsov, Sasho/0000-0002-8149-1504",,,,,56,11,16,2,28,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Based on these differences, we designed novel financial education materials targeted at US immigrants and their children and evaluated their effectiveness using a randomized control trial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of financial education programs targeted at this population. Compared to a control group, the groups that received the one-time educational intervention were more likely to correctly answer financial knowledge questions immediately after the intervention. The estimated effects of this one-time intervention on knowledge were large, but most of them faded away after six months. Moreover, we find little effect of the treatments on intended financial behavior measures, both immediately and six months later. Our results point to the efficacy of this type of educational material in informing immigrants and their children about important financial information that they are unfamiliar with, including information related to their immigrant status. However, they also suggest that a priority for future research should be to test whether repeated opportunities for learning can increase financial knowledge retention and lead to behavior change.","[Barcellos, Silvia Helena; Carvalho, Leandro S.] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Smith, James P.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",University of Southern California; RAND Corporation; National University of Singapore,"Barcellos, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",sbarcell@usc.edu; lcarvalh@usc.edu; smith@rand.org; joanne_yoong@nuhs.edu.sg,"smith, james/HTQ-1933-2023","Yoong, Joanne/0000-0002-0162-9885",Social Security Administration Financial Literacy Research Consortium [5 FLR09010202],Social Security Administration Financial Literacy Research Consortium,"The authors thankfully acknowledge funding from the Social Security Administration Financial Literacy Research Consortium, grant no. 5 FLR09010202.",,28,11,17,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The Disproportion Factor Model can be implemented by investment arbitration tribunals to evaluate the reasonableness of environmental regulations imposed by host states that have a damaging impact upon foreign investment activity, such as would be the subject for a claim of indirect or regulatory expropriation. In this setting the Disproportion Factor Model can help illustrate whether a host state measure is unreasonable and in that sense should engage the investor's entitlement to compensation under international law. It also acts as an objective guide to the setting of an appropriate quantum of compensation for the injured investor by reference to the environmental benefits that the regulation aimed to achieve relative to their costs, as evaluated by a rational decision-maker. The formula should be consequently viewed as a useful tool in judicial analysis by international investment tribunals.","[Collins, David] City Univ London, City Law Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Thomas, Philip] City Univ London, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Syst Analyt Grp, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London; City University London,"Collins, D (通讯作者)，City Univ London, City Law Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England.",david.collins@utoronto.ca,,,EPSRC [EP/K007580/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K007580/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,22,1,1,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

I propose a simple model of career concerns where firms are willing to pay for managerial talent to reduce production costs, but also to subtract talented executives from competitors. This second effect is privately valuable to firms, but is socially wasteful. As a result, equilibrium pay for talent can be inefficiently high and career concerns too strong. Explicit incentive contracts do not solve the problem, but equilibrium pay is reduced if managerial skills have firm-specific components, or if firms are heterogeneous. In this second case, managers are efficiently assigned to firms, but equilibrium pay reflects the profitability of talent outside the efficient allocation. The effect of increased competition is ambiguous in general, and depends on the profit sensitivity to cost reductions. This ambiguity is illustrated in two examples of commonly used models of imperfect competition.","[Feriozzi, Fabio] IE Univ, Dept Finance, IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain",IE University,"Feriozzi, F (通讯作者)，IE Univ, Dept Finance, IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain.",fabio.feriozzi@ie.edu,"Feriozzi, Fabio/L-7414-2014","Feriozzi, Fabio/0000-0003-1699-2414",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-30323-C03-03],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"I am indebted to Marco Celentani for many insightfull discussions on earlier drafts, and two anonymous referees for their useful suggestions.

In consumer-price auctions, bidders compete on the price they will charge. New bidders offer to set the price at their marginal cost. With complements, the existing operator strategically offers a price that is below its marginal cost; with substitutes, it offers a price that is above its marginal cost.

It is through this process of conditioning funds upon regulatory compliance that Congress works toward ideal policy outcomes without inciting institutional conflict with the other branches or from the opposing party.

Specifically, states that adopt ignition interlock laws that require participation of first time offenders, with blood alcohol levels of .08 or higher, see fatal accidents involving a drunk driver decrease by 9%. The results provide evidence in support of current and future policy legislation that first time offenders should participate in ignition interlock programs, which will reduce alcohol-related fatal accidents and generate large benefits to society.

The analyse of the legislative proposals set in EU Commission: Promotion of Employee Ownership and Participation and its' alleged impact on companies in EU member states is based on primary and secondary sources. European Commission is still not offering common legaldefinition of employee share ownership and employee financial participation across EU member states. The author argues that different national laws in EU member states regulating employee financial participation is an important obstacle for international companies to implement employee share ownership schemes in cross-board situations. The Common European Regime proposed by European Commission would offer employers and employees a choice between two alternative employee financial participation regimes one originating in national legislation, the other in European legislation. That could be considered to be a great step towards solution of cross-border situations when international companies are obliged to apply different national laws when implementing employee share ownership schemes, thus causing inequality between employees from different EU member states. This paper analyses problems with implementation process of employee share ownership schemes in cross-board situations and offeres most suitable way to implement common EU wide regime on employee share ownership.","[Abula, Marta; Dovladbekova, Inna; Berke-Berga, Anzelika] Riga Stradins Univ, Riga, Latvia",Riga Stradins University,"Abula, M (通讯作者)，Riga Stradins Univ, Riga, Latvia.",marta.abula@rsu.lv,"Berke-Berga, Anzelika/JBJ-1257-2023","Berke-Berga, Anzelika/0000-0002-8844-8197",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,11,18,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200001,0

In this context, change management must be based on an entire arsenal of tools and skills meant to facilitate change. Modern societies experience a long process of global change, encompassing all sectors of the economy. Regardless of the level of development of a country, it faces the phenomenon of change in all its structures. If Western countries continue speaking of change, evolution or progress, in the eastern countries, as it is the case of Romania, managers talk about the phenomenon of transition, which broadly defines another level of change. Thus, the paper aims to track how it works in practice a model proposed by two specialists, Kameron S. Kim and Robert E. Quinn on the example of an organization in Romania. Using a tool developed by the two specialists managers can identify a pattern in terms of organizational culture change, which can be applied to a wide network of organizations belonging to the public sector or to the private sector. The instrument aims at identifying current culture, the sectors where that specific type of culture manifests more strongly, outlining a change strategy depending on the nature of culture identified. The company which is the subject of the study is Dante International eMAG, the largest retail company in Romania that has recently been expanded to other markets in Europe. The aim of this study is to identify the dominant culture that characterizes this company, the discrepancies between current and desired culture for employees and the aspects in which the manager in charge with change has to act.","[Criveanu, Maria Magdalena] Univ Craiova, Str Alexandru Ioan Cuza 13, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Criveanu, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Str Alexandru Ioan Cuza 13, Craiova, Romania.",mag_da64@yahoo.com,"Criveanu, Maria Magdalena/HPE-7719-2023","Criveanu, Maria Magdalena/0000-0002-8155-6726",,,,,13,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,399,404,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500043,0

Based on the results of content analysis, the authors 1) analyzed higher education policies of the BSR countries; 2) developed a research methodology for determining tuition expenses and thematic field indices in the tertiary education system of Latvia; 3) by means of direct calculation, determined tuition expenses per one student and tuition expense indices within different education cycles for Latvian higher education institutions (HEIs).Within the framework of the research on higher education policies in the BSR countries and the contributing factors it has been concluded that higher education institutions have full autonomy; each country applies different public funding calculation formulas and implements different funding models.Having conducted the research on higher education tuition expenses and thematic indices the following conclusions have been made: to ensure a high-quality study process it is necessary to systematically upgrade and purchase equipment; determining the thematic field indices by study program, the aspects of regional factors should be taken into account; the number of students differs at various study programs.","[Erina, Jana; Erins, Ingars] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Berzins, Gundars] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University; University of Latvia,"Erina, J (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",Jana.Erina@rtu.lv; Ingars.Erins@rtu.lv; Gundars.Berzins@lu.lv,"Berzins, Gundars/AAZ-5669-2020","Berzins, Gundars/0000-0001-5058-4268",Norway Grants Programme within the project EU Policies Impact to the Transformations of the Higher Education and Research System in Norway and Latvia [NFI/R/2014/006],Norway Grants Programme within the project EU Policies Impact to the Transformations of the Higher Education and Research System in Norway and Latvia,"The paper was supported by the project that has received funding from Norway Grants Programme 2009-2014 within the project EU Policies Impact to the Transformations of the Higher Education and Research System in Norway and Latvia, agreement No NFI/R/2014/006.",,20,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3771,3782,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700379,0

The main aim of this study was to determine the extent to which JSE-listed companies comply with international best practice guidelines for IR practices via the company's website. A secondary objective was to arrive at an opinion regarding the stage of internet adoption for IR practices in which JSE-listed companies find themselves, based on Hedlin's (1999) three-stage model. A checklist of 201 items was used to assess the websites of 205 JSE-listed companies from the beginning of July to mid-September 2012. The average online IR score for all 205 companies was found to be disappointing, although the top 100 companies in South Africa performed better than companies in other emerging and developing economies, but worse than companies in advanced economies, where size is probably the main differentiator. Bandwidth is also a constraining factor for online IR quality in South Africa. We conclude that instead of moving towards stage III (HTML, video and audio) of Hedlin's model (1999), JSE-listed companies still seem to find themselves in stage II (paper-equivalent PDF's). This should concern Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), as effective and efficient communication with investors could contribute towards attaining optimal share prices and improved liquidity and analyst following.","[Esterhuyse, Leana; Wingard, Christa] Univ S Africa, Dept Financial Intelligence, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Esterhuyse, L (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Financial Intelligence, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Esterhuyse, Leana/G-5040-2019","Esterhuyse, Leana/0000-0003-0140-7980",University of South Africa's Masters and Doctoral Support Programme; Academic Qualification Improvement Programme,University of South Africa's Masters and Doctoral Support Programme; Academic Qualification Improvement Programme,The financial support from the University of South Africa's Masters and Doctoral Support Programme as well as the Academic Qualification Improvement Programme is acknowledged.,,60,13,13,0,17,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This paper situates this increase against the backdrop of the structural problem of overaccumulation, and thus the absence of profitable reinvestment opportunities in the production sphere, in addition to the scarcity of high-quality collaterals. Zooming in on Europe's offshore world and Dutch conduit structures in particular, the paper illustrates, on the basis of the Amsterdam-based Lehman Brothers subsidiary (and others), how shadow banking enables regular banks to increase leverage and take on excessive debt. It will be argued that the continued expansion of debt at the systemic level, inter alia facilitated by shadow banking, heralds the prospect of a crisis far more dramatic than the one we are currently witnessing.","[Fernandez, Rodrigo] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Geog, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Wigger, Angela] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, IMR, Thomas van Aquinostraat 5-1-3,POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Fernandez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Geog, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",rodrigo.fernandez@ees.kuleuven.be; a.wigger@fm.ru.nl,"Wigger, Angela/GZB-9371-2022; Fernandez, Rodrigo/GRF-1350-2022",,European Research Council [313376],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"The work of Rodrigo Fernandez is part of The Real Estate-Financial Complex research project, supported by the European Research Council [grant number 313376].",,106,27,29,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The sources of corruption are grouped into three main thematic areas - historical roots, contemporary causes and institutional causes to make way for subjective and objective measures. The subjective measures allow for assessment of the effectiveness of anticorruption policies. Using pooled OLS, fixed-effect and instrumental-variable approaches, and focusing on the perceived level of corruption as the dependent variable, we find that ethnic diversity, resource abundance and educational attainment are markedly less associated with corruption. In contrast, wage levels of bureaucrats and anticorruption measures based on government effectiveness and regulatory quality breed substantial corruption. Press freedom is found to be variedly associated with corruption. On the basis of these findings, we recommend that the fight against corruption on the continent needs to be reinvented through qualitative and assertive institutional reforms. Anticorruption policy decisions should focus on existing educational systems as a conduit for intensifying awareness of the devastating effect of corruption on sustainable national development.","[Forson, Joseph Ato; Buracom, Ponlapat] NIDA, Grad Sch Publ Adm, 118 M003,Seri Thai Rd, Bangkok 10240, Thailand; [Baah-Ennumh, Theresa Yaaba] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Chen, Guojin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen Shi, Fujian Sheng, Peoples R China; [Peng, Zhen] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Xiamen University; Guangdong University of Technology,"Forson, JA (通讯作者)，NIDA, Grad Sch Publ Adm, 118 M003,Seri Thai Rd, Bangkok 10240, Thailand.",datoeagle@yahoo.com,"Chen, Guojin/JXL-1905-2024; forson, joseph Ato/W-4747-2017; Baah-Ennumh, Theresa Yaaba/AAP-5606-2020","Chen, Guojin/0000-0001-9457-9583; forson, joseph Ato/0000-0002-5997-5713; Baah-Ennumh, Theresa Yaaba/0000-0003-1572-2076",,,,,63,8,11,5,45,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The analysis shows that the decision to unbundle institutionally or organisationally with separated accounts depends crucially on the importance of cross-border transportation. If cross-border transportation is sufficiently important, national governments choose accounting separation. However, for low-efficiency gains within a bundled firm, national governments are stuck in a Prisoner's Dilemma and would be better off coordinating on institutional separation.
